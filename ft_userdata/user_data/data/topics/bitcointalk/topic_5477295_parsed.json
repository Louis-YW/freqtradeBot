The way I see it, it implies that the government is still in charge of the direction Bitcoin moves. If they cannot control Bitcoin, they can move against the appurtenances of the cryptocurrency: mixers, exchanges, etc. What do you think?What I think is that the government is not in charge of Bitcoin and the coin continues to maintain its decentralization which nothing will stop. Think about it, did the government sanction Bitcoin? Heck No, because there is no reason to do it, and even if they try, they would fail judging by the structure of the coin itself.But I support the government against most m!xers, they shouldn't fold their arms and let illicit flows happen all over in the name of Bitcoin. Even Satoshi will never want that.Besides, this forum is associated with Bitcoin, not m!xers, I wonder how you make them relate this much. And saying bye-bye to m!xers here still amounts to nothing by the two parties as the m!xers would take their adverts elsewhere and we will be free from allegations of promoting illegality. M!xers can't be illegal entirely but this doesn't stop the fact that some are using it for illegality. To make matters worse, it's more difficult for the government to solve the illegal puzzles in crypto compared to the fiat practices.BTCt can't continue to let itself be dragged with those who are only in for the money and not for the core value of what Bitcoin and this forum represent. They may cry foul (even the users here) but let the sanctity prevail as much as it can. Everybody can't just be allowed to do whatever they like.",

What do you think?\"The Sanction On Mixers Would Make This Forum Boring\" - bitcointalk was created for communication between BTC-like-minded people, and not for advertising mixers. Do you somehow imagine the purpose of this forum differently or has thi forum really changed so much that it is associated only with a place for making money on signatures (mixer campaign's). Even if something like this happens that the forum becomes boring (according to your version), then there will still be people here who want to discuss issues related to the bitcoin and a certain level of activity will be maintained.If some advertisers leave, others will come. This is far from the worst thing. Even if there are no advertisers at all, the forum administration must have reserves (donations, etc.) to keep the forum in working order.",

Considering that mixers and casinos seem to be the biggest advertisers here, I foresee a drop in revenue for the forum.There will be no advertisement, signature campaigns from Mixers since January 2024 but theymos will allow forum members to discuss about mixers.You will need to have data from the past to see how signature campaigns in Bitcointalk were run by different companies and how many of them are from mixers. Mixers were more seriously with signature campaigns after ChipMixer, a biggest mixer in latest years, were seized in March 2023.Now, I will help you to have an overview with past data.I take some screenshot from 2014 to 2019, for latest years, you can explore it by yourself with this link https://web.archive.org/web/20190701000000*/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=615953.0The forum had less campaigns in 2019, in a bear market and if you compare 2019 to years like 2021, 2022 or 2023, you will see we have a good increase of campaigns. The forum has yet died and in fact, it does not depend on mixers for traffics or signature campaigns.20142015201620172019",

I don't think the forum will ever be boring but the ban will limit some discussion which will look like censorship and that is what the government want us to do with bitcoin.I was here when Chipmixer took over the forum with their ads signature and I think they had more than 30 participants in that campaign, during there time no other competitor in this forum, many that tried ended as a scam, the adverts was nice and going until FBI comes in with their investigation. It was only Casinos and Chipmixer that were doing the forum and everyone loved it but since the absence of Chipmixers, other mixers came into the forum and they have competing to take over the forum and dominate the forum with high pay but you think that will make the forum to be boring? Come on man.The mixers have become an object of investigation and this will hurt the forum if it continues, you don't want to see the Bitcointalk host file removed from the server because you want high pay, don't you? It's better they eradicate anything that will harm the forum before they come for the forum and the staff, I don't want to hear Theymos house has been raided in the US.",

What do you think?You are right but to some extent only, because banning mixers is not the government's decision as authorities did not ask theymos to ban mixer advertisements as if it will be continued then theymos might not left with other choice but to ban the forum, so it was better to make this bold decision. Secondly, these advertisements are not generating any revenue for the forum admins AFAIK. Maybe indirect they maybe but I saw something where these campaigns are generating direct revenue for these admins.Maybe those who might be earning via these campaigns must be giving donations to this forum, but admins don't ask these platforms to pay fees like the other forums ask. And there is no doubt that governments have full influence on the crypto sphere whether you are talking about this forum or any other token. Even in the past China had the biggest impact on BTC prices but now that position has been taken by the USA. Whenever the US government makes any decisions in favor of BTC the price goes up and vice versa.",

The mixer campaigns that were managed on this forum did not pay any fee to Theymos; their contract was managed by the campaign managers, who contracted and coordinated forum members to promote the mixer service on their individual signature spaces.
