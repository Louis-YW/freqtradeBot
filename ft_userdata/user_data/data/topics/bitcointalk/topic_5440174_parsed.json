  "content": "In my country (Germany) it is not legal to do business with children in the age 0 to 18. From 0 to 7 it is forbidden, and from 7 to 18 there are some minor differences, But overall and away from everyday life things, in Germany it is not allowed to sell children (age 11, 12, 13) and young people (age 14, 15) bigger things. For example, if I want to sell a television set to a 13 years old person, it is not allowed and I have to give back the money the 13 years old was paying me for the TV set.In the case a 13 year old is selling me something with Bitcoin, it is easy to handle. I get the TV set back (from my example) back, and I have to pay back the Bitcoin or the money therefor (at the market price).But my question or my reason to discuss:If a 13 year old children is mining BTC this is not allowed in Germany. The question of the hour is, not just for Bitcoin - for all POW coins: How to protect chuldren from mining coins? Is there a statistic about how many coins (BTC) were mined by children or persons under 18 years? And how to compensate this unlawful behavior?Is there a mining protection for children on the Bitcoin core?",

And how to compensate this unlawful behavior?Why would it be illegal for a 13 year old child to mine BTC in Germany?Mining coins may generate income, but I doubt that it counts as labour as defined by the Jugendarbeitsschutzgesetz. A child receiving interest on its savings account is also legal, isn't it? Except that of course the child probably can't access the money without their parents consent until it is old enough.There's also no legal contract in place, so the child's Geschäftsfähigkeit being limited isn't really relevant either. One could argue that using a mining pool under the age of 13 is problematic since they can't legally agree to the ToS without a parents consent but that's true for every website and App these days and has nothing to do with mining itself. The amount of children watching YouTube videos or installing Apps on their phones without their parents oversight is probably a couple of magnitudes larger than the amount of kids that try to sign up for a mining pool.",

As a rule, when a child uses his PC for mining, the parents pay for his expenses. For a child, this is a 100% way to make money. But maybe then the child will achieve great success in mining.",

Even a gambling app will just notify you that you need to be 18 years old or something to use it. Sure, they can use KYC to filter out their users, but why would you expect something similar on mining software? At best it would be just a notice as mentioned above (which is never gonna be effective), at it worst they'd need you to face cam or do something similar to see if you're really 18+ years old or not. I doubt that would be popular. Legality aside, I believe the dev would rather spend their time improving some bugs or adding new features to the network. Heck, I doubt they'd even care if a 5-year-old mine some sats on his papa's computer at home.",

What should be illegal about any of these activities? Does it need specific protection? I don't think so.Keep in mind, without the right (expensive and hard-to-get) ASIC hardware you will pay 10000x or more for energy consumption vs. the returns of your mining efforts.With current consumer-prices for energy in Germany I doubt it's even possible to stay net-positive if you own some of the latest ASICs.Regarding ETH/similar mining with graphic cards, it could be possible to earn a few bucks per month. But probably any newspaper-distribution-job once a week will be more lucrative for any teen unless they could afford 10 or more of the latest graphic cards.All in all I don't really get what you are concerned about.

And lets face it, most parents are not responsible. One thing that the government can do (And does) is reinforce KYC (Know-Your-Customer) identity checks. But that otherwise pointless identity check will not stop the child from selling its Bitcoin. It could sell it in many various ways which the government cannot see or control. It could trade in the coin for an item. So it does not have to be limited to fiat.So fortunately, these kids will learn the struggle of obtaining Bitcoin and the pain of losing them. If you ask me, I think its best to let life teach them how to handle money.Every mistake is an educational fee.",

The rules also stipulate that children are not allowed to operate hazardous equipment (including electrical). It is somewhat ambiguous whether bitcoin mining falls into the category of electrical equipment because in practice the risks associated with electricity are minimal. I just found this news.Moreover, no legal action against a child's legal-business(in a general sense) is based on one's own initiative.",
