So if you are asking if newbie should use indicator or just there instinct to trade then obviously the best advice here is to use indicator because it's a guide for newbie that makes the analysis more easier.Just focus only on well known indicators such as MACD, RSI and BB so that you will not be confused.",

Not trading with indicators is more confusing than you think, you can't trade the market without indicators. Indicators are your guide whether a newbie or an experienced trader. Learning indicators is important, if a newbie is having confusion using a particular indicator it is better to change it and use indicators you can understand. The advise is that indicators are very important to trade",

But we don't know the reason and why these sentiments will be active. Indicators or charts show you history, not the future. You have to determine the future from past history. That's why people follow indicators or charts. What else could analyze? Sometimes a few projects have good news and price go up. But this isn't something we can research.",

Owing to the complexity and how confusing indicators could be, which would you rather advise for a newbie to place much focus on between the Market (trading without indicators), and the Indicators, and why? Let me be specific about trading, this my post is not focused on holding at all.What you said is like you do not have a matchet and you want to kill a bull with your bear hand, or like you want to kill a lion with just your hand because you do not have a gun. If you want to kill a bull, you will look for a machete and knife. If you want to kill a lion, you need a gun. If the right equipment is not used, you will find yourself dead. In trading, that dead represents losses while the equipment used for you to kill or defeat the lion are the trading indicators. If you trade without indicator, it is like a lost sheep, the losses would be great. New traders should have to learn indicators, they are not hard to learn if they concentrate in learning them.",

The trend tracing and other things concerning the analysis of market is still under indicators. The indicator that you have and analyse maybe different from another's own but they are all indicators to help you on winning the market. Therefore based on the indicators they are 100% IMO but depending on your analysis of it and that makes it below depending on the ability. Although I'm sure no body can give 100% analysis of the market continuously and some reason are uncertainty and fear.",

The two are needed in order to have a better success rate on trading.As a newbie there might be other important things that they need to learn first. It is also normal to experience a failure when we are starting on something but obviously this should not stop us to continue and to improve ourselves more.

The indicators just make it easier for traders to check what is happening on the graph and find the best entry or exit price points to minimize risks. Trading with naked charts is the best for pro traders since they can spot trading patterns with looking candlesticks. Using indicators or oscillators can be helpful for newbies to get in or out at the right timeframe and best possible price area.",

Stick with indicators because even though those indicators arent precise but it is really much better compared on trading up on something which you arent using things or tools because it is really just a pure gambling when you do make out calls and price predictions  basing on hunches and intuition which is something not that recommendable.Better make yourself able to practice with those indicators even though it is really hard but it would really be worth on the time and effort that you had spent out if you've been doing this for a long time.Practice makes perfect as we do all know.Dont make yourself just trade off without any basis or analysis and also a reminder that dont make yourself that too impulsive when it comes to fuds and fomos in the market.",

Indicators are just a bunch of math formulas which allow you to see more clearly some aspect of the market and then take decisions based on them, however it is important to remember that there is no indicator that can predict what the market will do, so it always important to look at the big picture and try to read what the market will do or the overall direction the market has at the moment, if you do not do that and only trade by using indicators then the accuracy of your trading strategy will always be on the low side.",

That's the fundamental approach. Indicators on the other hand are smaller time frame stuff, not a terrible way to look at things if you want to trade daily, like 5 minute candles for example on a trade you want to finish up in under an hour for example, buy and sell all within that time period.
