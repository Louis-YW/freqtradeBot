There have been cases where those people who shared about their current crypto holdings or positions became victims of possible hacks of either their PCs/laptops or their accounts too where no 2FA was enabled. Even if your friends/relatives are so good, it is said that even walls have eyes and ears. So it's better that you share such things very carefully so that your left hand doesn't know what your right one did. TBH, I'd never suggest to share about your crypto holdings at all because it's all about your privacy and if you open it up voluntarily, then what's the point of using crypto?",

In fact we should keep secret as secret especially things related to money.QuoteThere have been cases where those people who shared about their current crypto holdings or positions became victims of possible hacks of either their PCs/laptops or their accounts too where no 2FA was enabled.Even 2FA can be stolen.QuoteEven if your friends/relatives are so good, it is said that even walls have eyes and ears.We don't know when a good person turns to be a bad one. Maybe they are not bad but when life is hard, they have to make a tough choice from which we don't know what they choose to do.They can make their tough choice become easily by stealing money from someone trust them a lot. It is when nightmare comes with talkative people about their successful investment and big portfolio.Their money can be stolen but it is not the worst. They can be killed by bad people too.",

      "body": "We actually live in a world where it is hard to trust anyone most especially with sensitive informations like our crypto holdings but crypto holdings aren’t just like keeping information about something but it is about finance. Many people use cryptocurrency as the primary source of storing their future wealth or retirement funds and we all know these are saved for the use cases of the family and should their be a natural occurrence like death and this holdings were actually kept secretive by you then everything could be lost forever and that puts your family in a financial bind. So I think no matter how bad everyone might seem there’s certainly just that one person that has to be trusted. Being a Kin or just anybody. This person could be entrusted with something like a private key or seed phrase for recovery. The only thing bad is when you go around boasting of how much you have as your holdings because this could trigger just a member of your family and friends to dig into your account.",

A little funny, folks.There is nothing wrong with friends, if, of course, you have them, and there is nothing wrong if your loved ones know what you are doing. Seriously, if you don't trust your relatives, why the hell do you need them then? It is not necessary to tell where and how much you have in cryptocurrency, you do not need to show your seed phrase, but to completely keep secrecy, in my opinion, this is paranoia.I am sure that the same people who unsubscribed above will also support the idea of ​​spreading information about Bitcoin. But tell me, how can you be trusted if people don't know what you do?",

      "body": "Situations of security breach that I have experienced are mostly with girlfriends against boyfriends, friends, and brothers. Some cryptocurrency holders fall victim to security breach because of the kind of information they disclose to their friends, brothers, or girlfriends. Is not a bad idea to tell people what you are doing but giving them every sensitive details about you own asset is not wise.In a movie I watched, a rich guy told his brother about all the assets he has and how wealthy he is, and his brother, with so much pride, told his friends that his brother is so wealthy and can give him anything he desires.His friends became jealous and gradually made plans to attack the rich; they stole from him until he went bankrupt. So the issue there was that this rich guy told his brother about all his wealth, and his prideful brother told his own friends about his rich brother, which caused an attack on the rich guy.Another incident I have experienced is the situation where a guy always tells his girlfriend about all his crypto assets and gives the girl access to all his wallet information. One day, both of them had a disagreement, and before the boy could realize it, his girlfriend had disappeared with all his crypto assets.In my opinion, crypto is a private asset that only you should know about. You can keep track of how your brothers, sisters, or children can access the asset should anything bad happen, so it is not wise to share your cryptocurrency private information with a third party.",

Even if we trust someone enough with everything other things there are level to which the person will know about your wealth, holdings and earning, jealousy will come in, after jealousy then come little inner hatred which usually led to attack, either physical stealing attack or someway which they can just use to move the users funds. When it comes to this aspect I strongly recommend everyone to remain secretive about there holdings. That being said, when we also want to talk about security insurance. To some point I do recommend one sharing few pieces of information regarding how and where they are holding down some crypto, people who these kind of information can most likely be recommended to share with are holders child, or the spouse, you the holder will determined who has a lesser greed and can be patient enough, to play a blind eye until when it's necessary for such funds to be accessed.",

It is easier for people to sell their trust for money, due to greed or poverty, and most of these stories that I am not ready ro share here are been carried out by the most trusted personnel, those who used to say that it is always someone on the inside that knows you to the core can be capable of doing evil to you, simply because they know you too well.
