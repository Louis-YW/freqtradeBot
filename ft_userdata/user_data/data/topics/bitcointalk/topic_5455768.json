  "content": "Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,This is my first time of uploading my message content for the forum to see. I have to do it for every necessary measures to be taken to forestall any ill activities of this account holder.As  at 7th of June 2023 as clearly seen on the uploaded image, the user as also seen (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3541801) sent me a message which I suspected to be a scam. I had to run a check and discovered that he the sender profile is kind of scanty with registration date March 17, 2023, 03:48:03 AM and since then @proxy3200 has not made any post not to talk of replying any post. I do not know how many people here must have received such message. I just want to let the platform know about this so that nobody would fall for this trick by this account holder @proxy3200.If they are looking for this services what stops them from making an official announcement on the service board for others to see rather than sending message to my dm if they do not have a sinister motive. I would advise anyone dealing with them to be extremely cautious",

Even at that, a scammer should atleast make themselves somewhat believeable.Op, consider to active the function that prevents newbies to message you and be safe.Meanwhile, I have gotten some random messages from people who wants me to promote their project via my signature and then, they don't have any Ann thread and that doesn't imply they are scammers.",

I thought as much too because I see no reason why one would want to sell such script when in the real sense one could get a fortune out of it then I realized there is more to it than I thought. Possibly, there could be something more to this script than we could think of. Maybe just a you have said the possibility of it being  coded for some nefarious act and these scammers do pick possible targets so as to infiltrate their devices with virus with codes if their targets do buy or exchange script with them.",

Perhaps they could buy  a copper membership but, not many are into doing that.
