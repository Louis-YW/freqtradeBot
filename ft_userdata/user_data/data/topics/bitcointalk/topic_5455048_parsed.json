Is there any pointers on what should be watch for the requirements to receive the airdrop. I have 1500$ on Zksync with 4 DEX use to buy and sell. I wonder how often should we make transaction to become eligible on airdrop.Also is transferring from Zksync wallet to Zksync wallet is allowed instead of using the bridge for transfer of ETH Zksync era? The bridge fee is very high and also the withdrawal outside the Zksync took 24hours before it bridge on Ethereum mainnet. Thanks for sharing this website.",

I think just use the dex or any dapps weekly or even so 3 to 4x a month, you can try to add some liquidity also.

I’m not familiar on the sybil term but lucky I only transfer once on my regular metamask account to ledger account. I do this so that I can hold my tokens to a more secure wallet after I bridge all of my tokens that I purchased on the DEX.So the use of DEX is the one that needs to do regularly right? I will bridge again tomorrow on my ledger wallet to make at least one bridge on my wallet.",

The low liquidity on Zksync makes trading on this chain very profitable if you enter on the right time. What type of project do you recommend to purchased on this chain. I’m currently investing only on DeFi and launchpad since I’m assuming this sector will be boom the most when the money flow on this chain.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on June 04, 2023, 05:14:46 PMTry to copy the wallet to the link Ive posted here.

I can say that exchanging major coins/tokens on SyncSwap is very convenient and inexpensive; trade on ZigZag, but the number of users and therefore actual transactions is still very small. The prospects for using zkSynk are enormous. Of course, other L2 projects are not sitting idle, but zkSynk is one of the first in terms of the amount of investment and support of third-party developers/users.",

I stop trading interactions since most of the coins in there is garbage. I only stake my ETH on the defi but I still feel that I’m just waiting time and money with this ridiculous bridging since there’s no slightest sign of airdrop for users. The bridge outside the ZKera took 48hrs on my last bridge so I just keep my balance in there. The problem is my money just stuck with just minimal profit from staking while I can earn more if I invest it on other project.",

The number of projects is growing and the number of Sybil attacks is growing in proportion to them. The most recent are the “activities” around Starknet. I've been working with zkSync for the last few days and I can note a couple of drawbacks: there is no direct switching between zkSync-lite and zkSync-era; There are many bridges, but most of them have a limit on the number of blockchains/tokens used. It's interesting to use, but not always convenient.",

I only stick to one burner wallet as I do not want to waste all of the time and effort that I have in order not to be tagged as Sybil.
