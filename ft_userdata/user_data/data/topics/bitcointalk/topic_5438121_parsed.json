Another platform, where this abuse frequently happens is YouTube where creators promote number of fake projects. Agree, in general, you shouldn't take financial advice from social media influencers, especially those who have a shady reputation and track record. Most of the time their actions are driven by self-interest, whether that's through paid promotions or creating artificial hype for tokens or NFTs that they will eventually sell to their followers.",

Another platform, where this abuse frequently happens is YouTube where creators promote number of fake projects. Investment is always a personal matter.  And everyone takes only one idea from social media but smart investors always do their own analysis and don't just invest based on someone's advice and that's wise. Because those who promote a project or a product in exchange of money can never be completely trustworthy because they always promote a project or a product in exchange of money. So it is always better to do your own research and then invest somewhere",

These influencer things are bad given that projects are just paying them o promote their own shttty project. This kind of influencer promotions has been going for a long time now and people should be awake on how dangerous it is to trust these influencers and not do any research about the project they are into. This shows how worst people can be for the sake of money. This is why I don't trust celebrities or any influential people that has no real knowledge about crypto that is just blindly doing crypto promotions.",

It was not new to having these scenarios, research must be applied in all projects whether it was old or new just to have an overview of the project. In this way, we are able to avoid in investing scam projects. Many scammers and market manipulators use social media platforms to trick innocent people. It was their advantage as it was easier for them to spread (fake) information and get clients/investors. We need to be vigilant this time otherwise, we just let these people survive and continue their evil doings.",

Another platform, where this abuse frequently happens is YouTube where creators promote number of fake projects. I am interested in cryptos since the end of 2017 so more than 5 years now and one of the lessons, that i have learned is, that you should never buy something because some crypto youtuber or crypto twitter influencer is saying that. Back in 2020 and 2021 i joined a few very early project and there i witnessed it first hand, that big crypto influencers get a big allocation in the private sale or even in the seed sale of projects and for that they are shilling those projects \"for free\". That way the project gets exposure and the influencer gets a big allocation for a very cheap price. Once the project is successful and the prices has risen the influencer then begins to dump and moves on to the next project.",
