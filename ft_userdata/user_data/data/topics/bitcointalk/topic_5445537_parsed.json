Of course, we got those coins back in the form of private keys.My point being: Today I tracked down the BTC I received from that key, and I noticed it had since went through a couple of transactions, each with different UTXOs (thereby increasing the transaction depth that needs to be explored to find the original chipmixer UTXO) until finally it went into an outgoing transaction with no change.I'm pretty sure LE is capable of analyzing the 7 TB of seized data, and notify chain analysis companies about the wallets, which they can then label - and taint.Of course, chain analysis tools cost money, and while LE will probably get them for free or using their massive budget, exchanges are probably less likely to splash 6 to 7 figures a year on chain analysis services. Especially seeing the spectacular nature some of these exchanges have failed (FTX), they probably used entry-level screening with less depth just to say they were compliant with AML.Whereas you have a public company such as Coinbase who can probably afford the maximum possible screening easily.So it really depends on the exchange you use. Definitely avoid Coinbase though (as you normally would). Since there's no way to know the transaction depth they use for each of the addresses they analyze - at different tiers of their offerings - you should be safe using non-US exchanges to cash out those chips, then deposit them with some other exchange. As it has been said elsewhere, there're not interested in going after small fish. Only killer whales.Which means that they'll probably freeze that Minh guy's exchange accounts - and yours too, if you have the misfortune of using an exchange that over-zealously reports everything to the FBI - but they won't go through pains to identify you specifically just because you have received a Chipmixer chip. Especially if the exchange doesn't share that kind of data about you.Other things that might help:- When paying for services online, pay using the Chipmixer UTXOs first (some wallets like Electrum allow you to select specific UTXOs to spend) to reduce the value of \"liability chips\" you posess.- Don't use wallets that send change to receiving addresses, or the same address as others. Mostly mobile wallets do this. You don't want to potentially contaminate the rest of your money.- Don't ever send chips directly to an exchange.Anyway, I checked using WalletExplorer again, and it seems like it can neither cluster change addresses from Electrum, nor addresses part of the entire chipmixer operation. So at least this removes the majority of internet sleuths from the equation.",

In an ideal world, only direct evidence of major crimes linking coins to the things that you and the media have mentioned (fraud, ransomware, drugs, etc) would be the focus of the authorities who took chipmixer down. I doubt exchanges will ask users to return coins or anything like that. Similarly, I doubt that anyone who was honestly using the service will get anything back from these agencies because in their eyes, privacy is on the same page as fraud/laundering and therefore no one deserves their coins back.",

First I don't know for sure if it was German police that seized the coins, but if indeed it was them you don't have to fly a plane there to file a case for assets recovery if you're a foreign citizen. Interestingly enough this case falls in the same category as demands of the seizure of stolen assets since the money (coins) seized here are have yet to be classified as the proceeds of a crime.Quote from: crewdede on March 20, 2023, 05:19:10 PMInstead, they confiscated all money..Again, seized not confiscated.Law enforcement can only seize money, only a judicial act can confiscate permanently that amount when a court gives a final sentence on it. Theoretically, at least, you have time till that to file your own request with them till they give a final verdict on it.Quote from: Husires on March 20, 2023, 11:00:15 AMI do not know what the laws are in the United States, but if you are in a house and this house will be used for illegal purposes and it is your property, then the kingdom has the right to confiscate this property to the state.No, it's not like that in this case.To keep the house analogy is like the owner renting it to five families, one room each and because 2 of them are removed in drug dealing they grab all the stuff from all the rooms and seize everything, a thing that will never finish like that in court.",

They will go to any extent to frustrate people all in the name of tracking illegal transactions when in the real sense most transactions conducted on chipmixers are not illegal but for the sake of privacy, the users made such steps so as not to reveal their identities so that as to retain being anonymous. It is sad that even the government too are sometimes using it to smare their perceived opposition since they got knowledge about their financial activities. I mostly pitty those under the raiders of the LE because they are always the target of this act from them but I believe if you can get a good lawyer, you can sue the government over any such act and recover your money from them.",
