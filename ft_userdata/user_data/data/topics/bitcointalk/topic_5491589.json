These 17 investors and entrepreneurs are worth a collective $93 billion, between their estimated crypto asset holdings, publicly disclosed stock holdings and private assets. That’s more than double the $37 billion in collective crypto billionaire wealth last year.For the third year running, Changpeng Zhao, founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, is crypto’s wealthiest person. Despite pleading guilty to U.S. money laundering charges in November, CZ, as he’s known, is now worth an estimated $33 billion, up from $10.5 billion last year. That makes him the biggest crypto gainer in dollar terms since last year and the 50th-wealthiest person in the world. The bulk of his fortune comes from his majority stake in Binance, which remains the industry’s largest global trading venue by volume.1.

It will be difficult to ascertain the financial worth of these billionaires since some of them run some centralized organization that handles people's funds, but the list looks fair.

At that point (actually welll wellllll welllllllll before that point) money is just a game. Whether that kind of person has 5 billion or 30 billion or 100 billion doesn't matter to them, its not like they are actually ever spending that money, its just wealth to keep growing. The actual money CZ needs for living his life is a tiny tiny fraction of his wealth. Losing $4 billion may be a reason to complain, but it changes absolutely nothing for him.And the analogy to $37k doesn't work, because that is the sort of money people actually need to spend. Losing $4000 in that case would definitely be a big deal because the person might actually need that money at some point. There is no point in time when CZ will need that $4 billion. He doesn't have to replace it, because he'll never need it in the first place. And it is nothing compared to how his crypto wealth will grow in the future.

I get to understand that bitcoin made a lot of persons who were not interested in it at the first time it was created. So, when it made remarkable increase in price, and many turned millionaires and billionaires with little investment they had out then or during 3 to 4 years of its launch. Because of this good news, big investors, millionaires and those who have acquired lots of properties tend to sell off their assets and invest in bitcoin. Some gave it a try with some little money, and they got lots of profit after some years, now they went all in. I don't see it as a bad idea to go all in its bitcoin but truly as a wise man it is not expected to sell all you have that you value so precious and risk them into bitcoin investment.",

The Binance exchange itself have pleaded guilty and with CZ both will pay the fine and there is no denying or avoiding this fine. Just as your concern CZ already step aside from the company such that it doesn’t dent it and a new CEO was appointed although we know he will be heavily involved. Now the question is, is the 4 billion dollars too heavy on them I will say no because an exchange that has about $25 Trillion volume of crypto assets can overcome this but as we all know no amount is small to lose even for a billionaire. Come to think of it the way people make millions easily from shit coins (memecoins) this days, binance as one of the big exchanges that drives there narrative can gradually make this back through coins like this, not to talk of there ever growing blockchain network (smart chain), so they will come good eventually.",
