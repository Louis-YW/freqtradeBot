There are lots of the same schemes already since then but just different site names.A \"common sense\" is enough to determine that there's no such thing as that.

They leverage of what people generally consider to be 'greed' and they strike.There ain't no exchange that is genuine that will give such offers, then the question to ask will be \"how many people can they pay 0.4btc if everyone decides to create an account and deposit 0.005btc into it\"?They always give you a very juicy expectation and keep their scammy proceed at lower levels so you don't see it coming.Beyond giving technical analysis on their website creation date and all, I prefer to psychologically analyse before anything as I have fallen victim to scammers before, although not in this exact same format.",

They promise you a large amount of bitcoin or Ethereum but in return you need to send a small deposit. Most figure, it’s a small amount and do the transaction and get scammed.",
