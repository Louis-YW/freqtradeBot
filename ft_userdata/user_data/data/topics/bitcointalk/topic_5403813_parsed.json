I did not mention about their hidden, shady activities to get profit from wash trading volume, traps to liquidate users.Because I wanted to bind with things relate to their service fee: trading (taker/ maker), withdrawal fee. I know they have different things to build and maintain their service: security, maintenance, consolidate inputs, process withdrawal, etc. but they must assign income from their service fee for those things. Secretly over charge withdrawal fee and when get accusation, saying \"we use it for different things of our service\", it's not fair.",

What the system looked like was a ton of money, all in spread out places all in crypto, and it was just a few bots running constantly 7/24 looking out for possibilities. Let's be honest, the math is not that hard, and building is not that hard neither, making it super fast is the hardest part.The bot calculates the chance to profit, and makes the moves and you earn, which is an easy way of making money. Obviously it didn't last long because the chances were like 10 bucks here 40 bucks there, very very rarely it showed like thousands. Hence it didn't really worth it for us.",
