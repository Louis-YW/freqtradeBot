If there's a wallet or an exchange that doesn't allow you to do so, you should avoid it. Because it would mean that they haven't updated their system even after 5 years.Bitcoin protocol allows sending bitcoin from any address type to any address type.",

It's unfortunately not just exchanges that are sometimes late with adding support for Native SegWit addresses, it's also crypto exchanges and similar centralized services. This is not the place to mention any names, nor is it important at this point, but a very popular casino that has been around for many years was still not supporting Bech32 addresses the last time I checked. And it's a site I am sure everyone who is into gambling has heard of.",

Nothing on the protocol level prevents sending from segwit to legacy. Just use a wallet which supports segwit (most of them do).To be clear if you want to send to a Taproot address you should definitely upgrade your wallet (assuming the wallet software has the feature) because the new address format is slightly different than the SegWit version 0 even though it looks the same. In other words if you enter a Taproot address in an old wallet that supported SegWit, it should reject it for having an invalid checksum (the new address format uses different details when computing checksum).",

      "body": "Since this is the \"Technical Support\" section of the forum, it's probably worthwhile to point out a few things:1. There are no addresses in the blockchain.  There are no addresses in the actual transactions that are sent between peers.Addresses are an abstraction that are created by the user-interface of the software that you use (whether that's an exchange, a wallet, a casino, or something else). They exist only to make it easier for HUMANS to talk about transferring control over value.  Therefore, the only limitations on whether or not you can send bitcoins that you control \"to a particular address\" are limitations put on you by the software you are choosing to use (either because that software is out-dated or because the creators of the software have made a decision not to support it).Another important thing to be aware of if we are talking about the technical aspects of Bitcoin is that:2. YOU DO NOT SEND FROM AN ADDRESSThat's not how bitcoin works.  I know that those that aren't familiar with the inner workings of Bitcoin like to think of it as a bank account, but it just isn't true.  You spend unspent transaction outputs.  There is no \"from address\". Bitcoins in a single transaction may have been previously received using multiple addresses, or no addresses at all.",
