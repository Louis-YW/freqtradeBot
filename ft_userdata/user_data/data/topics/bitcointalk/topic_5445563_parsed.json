  "content": "What sort of Bitcoin services would you like to see get built out? And what do you think is required for mass adoption, let's say onboarding the first billion people?Bitcoin DEXsI think we need large liquidity Bitcoin decentralized exchanges. DEXs are popular in the Ethereum ecosystem, but Bitcoin DEXs are very low volume and illiquid and therefore the prices are awful. We need to start seeing Bitcoin DEXs with many millions of dollars in volume per day and prices near market price to allow people to easily pick up bitcoin privately, rather than getting tracked by centralized exchanges.Bitcoin-first online merchantsWe also need a Bitcoin-first popular website. Someone needs to create Amazon for Bitcoin. Yes it'll be great when the already established e-commerce websites start accepting Bitcoin at naturally that is needed for mass adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a currency, but that could be many years off. In the meantime I'd like to see a successful bitcoin-first online shop open up so that it actually becomes easy for anyone to buy things online with bitcoin. I'm sure there are bitcoin online shops but there's no Amazon for bitcoin where people are like oh you want to buy things with Bitcoin just go here!Decentralized Bitcoin lendingProbably also a decentralized collateralized lending platform. The lending platforms have gone out of business because they have been centralized companies. Non-collaterized lending with Bitcoin won't work because that requires legal enforcement, but collateralized works because that already involves financial enforcement (you don't get your more valuable Bitcoin back if you don't pay off the loan). I'd like to see a decentralized bitcoin lending protocol start giving people with much of their money in bitcoin options to leverage that wealth without getting rid of it and without risking it on a company that might fail.What do you think? What other basic services do you think are needed in the Bitcoin ecosystem to make it better, more usable, and more ready to enable mass adoption?",

I believe one government adoption decision can affect the percentage of adoption somewhere, so I agree if the government declares bitcoin legal as a means of payment then adoption will really increase there.The problem: how can we expect governments to adopt bitcoin legally when they have always been on the side against the decentralized nature of bitcoin?",

      "body": "\"Bitcoin-first online merchants\"I think this is what we have been calling for years, to see some online business as big as Amazon to accept bitcoin as payment scheme and then see how it goes. There are a lot of websites that is accepting BTC as of now, but I think there hasn't been one as huge as Amazon in the e-commerce. Although there are news that they are going to accept it way back, but it didn't materialized. One big negative though that maybe why there e-commerce are not accepting BTC universally is that it is very volatile and this businesses needs that liquidity right away. They don't have the luxury to wait for the price to increase or even break even. So it's really a big challenge for us to see it one day BTC being accepted.",

It may seem odd to us because we know that we can be our own bank by holding it.But for those people that still don't have the whole trust in bitcoin but trust the banking system, it's like a good gateway for them to be introduced to bitcoin through these banks. Like those institutions that do offer bitcoin trust although there's already that has an existing company that does it but for the majority of the retailing banks, it will give mass adoption vibes.",

QuoteWhat do you think? What other basic services do you think are needed in the Bitcoin ecosystem to make it better, more usable, and more ready to enable mass adoption?I think the potential example is Bitcoin wallets with more intuitive user interfaces, better education and support resources for new users, and improved infrastructure for scaling and transaction processing.",

Especially with Bitcoin, the only collateral that can be implemented in a decentralized way is some altcoins via crosschain smart contracts. So this lending can only be a tool for shorting Bitcoin, and not actually giving loans to consumers or businesses.",

Bitcoin transfer fees which are high enough will also be a fairly difficult consideration for customers who want to buy goods in e-commerce. despite of all that, i agree that this way, will increase the adoption of bitcoin to use massively. Quote from: thecodebear on March 19, 2023, 05:21:09 PMWhat do you think?

It would be a downward process; Countries to big organizations to small investors and to normal people. In order for normal people to trust this technology, it should be first acknowledged by big industries first. And I doubt it is services Bitcoin is needing for such thing to occur. Bitcoin is simply a digital currency and will only be used as an alternative mode of payment to fiat. It just happened that volatility exist which generates profit for those who manage to make use of the changes on their market price from time to time.",

The area where crypto could exhibit the greatest growth is with older population demographics. Targeting platforms and media used by older generations could give it the biggest boost.There are certain spokespersons and celebrities who have the ear of those groups.
