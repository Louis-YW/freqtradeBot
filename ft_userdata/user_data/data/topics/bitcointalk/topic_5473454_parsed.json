Lastly I can not see the payment measures and could you please come up plain to the end with your payment procedures so one.can. know. Possibly an escrow would also make much sense if considered.",

Thanks for your feedback!Our clients are not on Bitcointalk unfortunately, but we do have a portfolio to show for those interested to see more from our previous work. About the payment procedure. It depends and it can be customized according to our client's needs and also according to regulations that must be taken into consideration.",

Putting it up here would make more meaningful thoughts while easing the stress involved sending you pm always when one is not sure how fast you would reply looking at the fact that you are not always available here and members here also look at that aspect of your engagement here to know how reliable you are to respond swiftly to messages sent d request for inquiries about your organisation.Nevertheless, putting up your portfolio would make more sense for us to see for ourselves to engage your services or make recommendations but we just can not do anything with you since we have not seen anything yet and   seeing is believing if you may wish to know.",
