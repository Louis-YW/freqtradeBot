But the phobia around selling remains a mystery. Institutions have been playing their game but who are those large whales who have kept BTC floating around < 50k in the past few months or is it the retail newbies trying to make a quick profit with bitcoin? It is very unclear. Share your insights with proofs.",

(if it's not steady enough, it might be another Microsoft/Twitter) What happened in 2015? The price looked really boring (except that time it dropped by half) but the bear winter had been well underway in 2014 so why wasn't that considered the big sell off (the peak being november 2013).",

Just let it die out and lose publicity and let's just move on already.I agree this model is barely relevant these days, but did it really fail? Looking at one model of it (there are many), then price reached it's target ($67.2K) on November 2021:Sure it didn't go above it, but price did reach it's so-called target. I'm naturally more sceptical with the target of $720K by 2028, but ultimately until this target fails then the model hasn't failed yet. I guess otherwise by mid 2024 and next halving if price isn't around $75K, then we can consider the model unreliable. But given this is two years away, it doesn't seem that far fetched either.",

The point is that, charts are getting invalidated every single day, and yes your chart as well and that is fine.But, if you ask me we are talking about something that is a bit more serious here with the fact that crypto is not something you can calculate beforehand. Obviously the big sales comes from the bitcoin rich people who bought it early and made a ton of profit and they are worried that they would not be making that back if they sell it all when it's low, hence they wait until it peaks and then sell, that's it.",

Great lessons, many who should have taken their profits at the high in November. But majority still based on this model that they really think more money is going to come if it reaches $100k. I didn't follow that guy though, but just curious of his predictions, nevertheless it has been disproved already so what it is there to follow?",

Like the miners' ban in China last year, which was not foreseen in any technical analysis or predictive model, also the reduction of liquidity by central banks, or the cascading liquidation of leveraged positions as we have seen recently. All this is much more important than standing in front of a blackboard and drawing future lines based on the supposed regularities you observe in the past. In the case of PlanB, he put together a very elaborate and logical model based on supply, and I understand that he does not want to give it up for lost after so much time and effort invested in it, but I think he would do better moving on and stop making a fool of himself.",

All this is much more important than standing in front of a blackboard and drawing future lines based on the supposed regularities you observe in the past. Your point of view is somewhat logical, this is what I think too. Indicators and charts often fail to predict the future, especially when there are important events that change the course of events such as the Corona virus, interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve or the ban on mining in China, In all of these cases there were major influences that led to the failure of all predictions, so I believe that indicators, charts and technical analysis are only useful in cases where things are going naturally without any unexpected influences.",
