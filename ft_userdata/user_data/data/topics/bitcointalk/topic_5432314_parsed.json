But, we should not herd kids into Bitcoin, as there are investment opportunities beyond this niche.Teach kids how to build capital, how to recognize a problem and solve it, money management, how to choose investments etc and let them gravitate to ventures that interests them.It's perfectly alright if they are not interested in it as we are.",

In their shallow defense, Bitcoin did not exist 17 years ago, so they couldn't have put it into Bitcoin, at least not right away.True, the couldn't have done more than they did since, as at 17yeara ago, bitcoin was non existence and with them so keen on having nothing to do with your gift of $20, it still remains a good decision for them at the time.Although, I suppose that was to be a fixed deposit account for which, cost of maintenance isn't supposed to affect your money negatively. At the very least, you should be paid an interest for operating a fixed deposit account.What really could be the case as per the depreciation of your savings worth is the every day inflation we've got in our individual nations today. I cam tell you that there are certain notes in my nation that can't buy any bit of a commodity. A note that some 17years ago could acquire you 2-3 of a commodity and now, it can't afford one. Loosing it's value completely and that's so sad.Taking note of the developments in our world now, the bitcoin innovation has made operating a fixed deposit account seem like a worst choice. Perhaps best for some persons but, some $20 bitcoin investment at the moment surely would be worth something in 17years. Its an enlightenment that needs to be adorn by people wth a new world order initiative. Fixed deposit in fiat's isn't equal to bitcoin investment in approximately,  same time frame.",

Or they will learn as an informal educational system? Then education is an education, whatever way is acquired, it is an education. But the question is if you are the parents and the money gift has been given to the new born baby in it dedication/ name ceremony day, what will you used the money for? As I put on my own, it was used to open bank account for me. But if I am the parents in the dispensation, I would have kept it in a BTC wallet instead of keeping it in the bank for worthless years. Then teach them crypto gradually till they understand it all when they grow up. They way they will understand Fiat currency is will the same way they will use to understand bitcoin but in a gradual process. Teach the children to know BTC",

When they're young, there's more to teach than just bitcoin, teach them how to treat people, teach them to be better people than just focusing on finance. I also have 2 kids, and I don't see the need to teach them about bitcoin, it makes no sense to cram a whole bunch of investing knowledge into their heads when they're giddy kids.",

      "body": "As a parent, of course I want the best for my child's future. But we need to realize and understand that there are phases in the development of our children.teaching financial management to our children is a great thing if it is taught at the right time or phase. and certainly not by coercion or pressure.There are 4 important phases that we must know in children's education.1. phase of play, freedom (live like a king).This phase ranges from 0-6 years of age. and it is in this phase that the growth and development of the brain dominates. Emotions are also more studied in this phase. and in this phase we as parents have to praise and pamper children more lovingly. let children play and imagine freely. because this phase is an important phase in brain development and also an important phase in developing golden potential for children. things that need to be avoided in this phase are yelling at the child loudly, shocking the child is also strictly prohibited in this phase because it is fatal in inhibiting the neuron cells that are developing very rapidly in the child's brain and will make the child's potential become hampered or even extinguished or suppressed . so that when an adult the child will be very difficult to develop their own potential. what we can teach in this phase is to provide games that are interesting but contain educational and creative elements to stimulate the growth and development of children's intelligence.2. Phase in the introduction of discipline and responsibility.This phase is at the age of 7-14 years. So maybe it's at phass that we can start teaching children about money management. such as setting an example to children about saving. But it must be done slowly but consistently. We as parents must set a good example. and maybe a little hard on children at this age a little bit is allowed. because in this phase is the phase in the formation of our child's personality. so we have to really make children know a responsibility and discipline in life. and if we spoil children too much during this phase, it will actually make your child a child with a weak personality. in this phase also our children must be informed about what obligations they have to do. telling children about building a future and pursuing an ideal during this phase can be a motivation for them. and we tell them where the best places to save are. Introducing investment and crypto can also be started in this phase and of course at the level of basic knowledge.3. The phase of building relationships with children (becoming friends for our children)This phase is at the age of 15-21 years. well, in this phase we have to be more able to build relationships with children like friends. so that our children remain comfortable to talk to us. and the child keeps asking for solutions and discussing with us every time he gets a problem. and we must attach importance to rationality at this stage. we give advice like a friend as well as a parent. if we are too hard in this phase it will actually make our children close to us and even our children will prefer to confide in their friends rather than us. maybe in this phase we can introduce our children to our investments and all about crypto and bitcoin that we have learned so far. because of course at this age they will need this knowledge. 4. Phase of Freedom, Independence and trust. In this phase our child is an adult and let him become an independent person and be able to solve his problems independently. But our advice is still needed for our children. be it moral advice, life or financial advice.References and basic sources of thought : Klikpsikolog.comI have also created a topic about introducing this child phase on the Bitcoin Discussion Board Get to know the Child Phase before teaching Bitcoin and Financial Management.. because I think this topic is suitable to be on the bitcoin discussion board.",
