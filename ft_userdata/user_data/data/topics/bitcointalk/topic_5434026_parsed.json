  "content": "Another discovery of fraudulent activities was made by Korean specialists from AhnLab. The game is distributed through phishing sites or through a mailing list; it is a simple Pokémon NFT card game. After installing the game, RAT, a computer remote control virus, is installed on the victim's computer, which ultimately allows hackers to fully monitor all the victim's actions, including stealing passwords and seed phrases. QuoteHackers have been using a fake NFT game claiming to be Pokémon-branded to spread malware to unsuspecting users, according to cybersecurity firm AhnLab. The phishing website, which is still active at the time of writing, appears to offer a legitimate NFT marketplace and the option to buy tokens and stake NFTs based on the popular Japanese media brand. However, users who download the site's content are actually installing a remote access program called NetSupport Manager that gives hackers control over their devicehttps://metaverse.sg/nft-news/fake-pokemon-nft-game-distributes-malwareThe remote control can be configured as the most common process on Windows, which the user will never mistake for malicious, which also applies to antivirus software, although some completely refuse to detect it.As a result, the simple truth rings again: do not open anything on the Internet, do not open attachments from strangers, and start self-education on Linux systems in order to completely abandon leaky Windows.",

I've always rejected the offer because real intentions shows miles away. And when you think about it, crypto people who connect their wallets for playing are the perfect target for the scam. You don't even have to get the banking details and hope banks don't reverse money transfers. You literally get everything without any work because others end up giving their wallets for you. I wonder how these won't happen all the time.And funny enough people don't seem to care when some unknown game designers decide to use stolen trade mark. Like that wasn't a huge red flag.",

Thanks Op this is a great news another one to avoid. At one time, I studied how these viruses are created and hidden, and the fact that they can create the most common screenshots and instantly send these screenshots in stealth mode to a hacker is already dangerous. In another case, I think a hacker can set up surveillance specifically for certain applications in order to receive a signal in time when the user opens it. On the internet, this virus quietly spreads in free mode on specific subject forums  (there is a simple guide to creating it), the task manager on Windows rarely detects it, and it is because of this that you must always monitor what and where you download. The best option would be to install a virtual machine, if necessary, download something, and also use a sandbox so that if malware enters, it is deleted when the application is closed.",

In the first case, it will most often be Windows, and in the second, Linux or Mac is more desirable. Of course, on each of the devices, perform only certain tasks, in order to avoid troubles, such as hacking with the help of NFT games. You can get a used hardware of past generations, the capacities of which will be enough and will not cost much at all. But it will allow to avoid the effects of malware if you reduce the use of this PC to only work with crypto currencies.",
