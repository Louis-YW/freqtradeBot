Proof of capacity has become one big thing in the market and there have been projects known for being focused on storage but they're not in the cloud.And with those projects you've mentioned that are focused on cloud storage, I think there's a place for them and it's just a matter of time until most people would be looking into it. But the thing about the market is, it's all about investing and whichever becomes the most profitable, then people will be quick to go there.",

However, from my perspective they're successful on marketing-startegy. Getting ICO on Coinlist (At the time, the platform who always sold out for every ICO).Also, they can entering main big exchange (Binance & Coimbase). So, from my perspective they are success on marketing.",

Another way to utilize their potency is to collaborate or integrate with any platform that connects their requirements with the storage-based cryptocurrency.For example, most of the platforms need to compete directly with Google Drive, Dropbox, or Mega. So in order to thrive, they need to have a smooth UI/UX for the users. Or, say their platform is used to incorporate other systems, like IPFS. One thing that I take a look closely beside the coins that are already mentioned here is Sia. Siacoin has been existing for a long time, and they are still struggling to develop the platform to make the regular Joe use the platform.",

Well they are not doing anything revolutionary but they are doing something. I am pretty sure those will get wiped some day but until then they will move with the markets. They have their followers and believers hyping them for free and since Filecoin raised almost $200 million in their ico they can just keep running this Circus As A Service operation no matter if it's needed or not. If they keep building their jobs will be safe and who wouldn't want to keep that up.But maybe i am wrong. Maybe they have a killer app coming and i haven't paid attention but i wouldn't hold my breath.",

Maybe they have a killer app coming and i haven't paid attention but i wouldn't hold my breath.Filecoin is a relatively new project but I don't think they will be with us long if they don't offer us such services that would be better than other traditional cloud providers don't.If they want to fight with the big guys it is a lost war without even starting but if they have some genius idea or killer app which I find this to be highly unlikely as their roadmap does not point to such revolution then most likely this is another Burst or Chia coin,sure they have something better to offer but in the end in a world where such service already exist it won't be with us long enough but that is just my opinion.",

The demand to use cloud storage based on the crypto is very small at this moment. People are still mostly using mainstream cloud storage provided by reliable parties. It's only good for betting for the next pump but I guess seeing from the performance of token makes me believe if that would not be suitable for long term. Crust has been dumping so hard. That looks like an overrated token.",
