No, how do I know this, because the thread you just posted is which was created by Lauda is pinned and has the necessary information and yet newbies still don’t go there, so I think yours will be treated same way. The creation of new threads by newbies asking for guidance can never be curtailed even if we try because almost every newbies feels that kind of a thread is his introduction into the forum. So best is we just keep up with it. If they create the thread point then to what they need, that’s how I think it would be as things stands",

Newbies don't know about this forum and he will not care of reading any thread at the start. I don't think OP idea will work here in begginer section for newbie. I am mentioning same thread created by different users in this weekI am a newbieI am open to learning new things as a beginnerHi Im very newbie Hi I'm new here, hope you welcome me.",

I sometimes become sceptical about it because at one place they are calling themselves newbies and showing like they don't know anything, but at another place, they are giving suggestions and participating in discussions like they have been here for more than 2 years.I am not targeting anyone, just being curious, but still, your intention is to help real strangers who really make such posts.For them, I will say, before making any post, surf around here and there, and they will find good topics for them to read. But in my opinion, this thread you mentioned is not enough for them if compared with the suggestions and links of threads that a newbie is being provided with when creating that \"newbie\" topic.You should add some more links here, so we could use your post in future to mention when needed.",

So those are the exact actions these newbies take with ignorance of the effect.I have a suggestion on how to eradicate these sucking introduction threads that keep everyone pissed, but before my suggestion, what my instincts are telling me now is that most of us trying to eradicate this bad posting of newbies did once partake in it. lol   is just a joke but maybe true. I can remember vividly around the first of April when @thymos, in collaboration with @powerglove, launched a captcha task that must be solved before you can login. If this idea of yours is considered and then put in as an instruction to newbies and new account openers, it will surely stop. When it is marked red or even attached to a sanction, the problem will be solved. I think that's one of the ways the problem of newbie introduction posts can be stopped.",

Yes, it's true that in local Indonesian board, threads like this are very effective and receive lots of questions from beginners. Even so, there are still beginners who create their own threads and say that they are still beginners and need advice and guidance, or threads introducing themselves and reasons for joining the bitcointalk forum. The most important thing is that you add more links such as an introduction to bitcoin, how to get merit, and any threads that might be useful for beginners, you can take them from other boards, not only those available in help and beginner boardI can only appreciate what you are doing, I hope it works and this thread can be a reference for beginners who want to ask questions. If it turns out this thread doesn't work, at least you tried. Keep contributing to the forum, I guess that's what you do",
