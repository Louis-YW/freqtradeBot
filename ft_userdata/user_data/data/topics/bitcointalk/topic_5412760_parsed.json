  "content": "Hi bitcointalk.Due to my country's gambling regulations I started good and reputable betting site search. Upon checking bitcointalk I found that PLAYBETR is A+ betting office and also 3 different betting providers.I opened an account deposit around 3000 USD at start , started betting , lost entire bankroll. I deposit again at same type of bets I continue betting. After some point I try to withdraw my funds ( 1000 USD required money not entire bankroll ) at that point I have around 7k USDT . They said on live support nothing to worry , first withdraw could take around 1-2 hour . I wait continue playing in that time. After that point my luck turned and I made around 8000 that night. After that night , they want verification from me and after than that  they accuse me of arbitrage betting and return my deposits and close my account.I have proof of every bet. I have proof of every conversation. I just want to learn their opinion about this situation.Many thanks",

Deposit transaction information such as Transaction ID, conversation screenshot (make sure to hide out personal information if there are any). Right now there are nothing provided to support your case so no one will show interest to join the accusation. Update: If you still have access of the account, I hope you have then record a screes cast of the account balance, betting history, deposit history, withdrawal history. Make it real so that you do not accused to be edited the video.",

We were extremely diligent in communicating the details and replying immediately to all inquiries from this player. We strongly encourage the player to post all communication regarding this matter. With his permission, we will gladly post his chats and all email communication, as it gives a full picture of the things he has incorrectly stated, as well as his threats to go to this forum if we did not pay him. At no point did any winnings or losses have any affect on the way his account was dealt with. The player was asked for KYC to verify his location, as he had login/logout activity from 9 countries, including the US and Ukraine, which are not permitted, per our terms of service. During this period, his account was fully open and available to login, play and request withdrawals, as normal. While this was taking place, we received a report from our odds provider's risk management team, informing us that the player had violated our terms of service by using arbitrage betting. At this point, the odds provider had no knowledge of our internal review on his location and we had no knowledge that he was being investigated for any wrongdoing. Upon being informed of his violation of terms, the account was suspended and we explained to the player that he could receive his deposits back. He insisted that he was not doing this, so we asked the odds provider's risk team to have another look, in order to be 100% certain. This was escalated to their highest level of security and they once again determined that arbitrage took place and showed us which bets. At this time, we once again informed the player that we could not accept his action and that his bets had been resettled at a rate of 1:1 and we returned his deposits immediately. We have also offered to this player the opportunity to find a reputable 3rd party mediator and present his case. We will do the same and abide by their ruling. Obviously, our reputation speaks for itself, and we have no interest in, nor would it make any sense for us to randomly take an honest player's winnings. Unfortunately, with the recent addition of the 2 BETA books, we have been hit hard by abusers, such as him, who are trying to take advantage of our innovation and desire to provide an exceptional gaming experience. Our biggest concern from this accusation is that other abusers will see that he received his deposits back and think they can freeroll us by doing the same and risking nothing. That is not the case. If fraud is detected and confirmed, we do have the right to seize the full account balance to compensate us for the added security and prevent future indiscretions. We have invested heavily in the highest level security tools available and have worked directly with other operators, as well as the odds providers, to detect and eliminate these types of abuse, which are a huge drain on our resources, which should be spent making great products. Playbetr is growing rapidly and we are so excited to be able to offer players new exciting promotions and updates. Having 3 sportsbooks live at once can certainly be a chore, with regard to the many players who try and exploit or abuse it, but it is worth it to be able to provide a great experience for the majority of players, who are not looking to cheat! We can guarantee with 100% certainty that all legitimate play will be paid, as always, and we know the many Playbetr members of this community will testify to that, as well. Thanks and best of luck to all!",

If he would have lost his bets there would be no problem and he would be welcome to deposit more. After all he risked his money on their site. Basically now he risked thousands to get breakeven or lose, is that fair?Also, how do they even know he was arbitrage betting? Don't you need 2 different bookies to do so? How would they know?Sounds very sketchy. Here, apparently, there is an opportunity to arbitrage on playbetr, otherwise how would they have found out about the user's bets from other bookmakers and here the question is whether they did it intentionally or it's just a bug that the user had to report to support, but he decided to take advantage of it.",

Arbitrage betting is sanctioned on traditional fiat bookies as well. Try it out and enjoy the new low limits on your betting accounts. Whether or not arbitrage bettors eventually get banned, I am not sure. Sometimes it doesn't require much effort to recognize such bets. If your history shows wagers with usually round amounts and bets like $5, $10, $20 on popular sports and leagues, and then all of a sudden there is a change in style and you start betting on weird low leagues and dubious sports, you will give the operators reasons for doubt. A sudden bet of $87.94 in a long history of bets with clean and round numbers doesn't fit.",
