This is among the reason we just use a simple lock because of anyone is able to get the SIM getting your Bvn is no stress. I know saving our Bitcoin key on phone or devices is not really save but sometimes it's the best for such person basic reason maybe that's where he/she gets more privacy and security because sometimes when one is protecting against online thefts, the offline thefts are much closer. Though the best way to protect your bitcoin Keys is offline but sometimes some people don't have that offline privacy    and so they opt for the online after all no protection measures is 100% save, it depends on the individual to make it so.",

Even if somebody borrows your phone and you tell him your phone password, there is no way he can access your app because you only give him one password. Except if the person is a thoughtless human being. Especially BVN and account number, there might be some time you are needed in an emergency, and not all people have the knowledge to have them off-head.",
