Crypto debit cards like crypto.com, swipe and many more will allow you to use crypto to fund your debit card that you can use on purchasing in any store online. Finding an e-commerce that accept crypto is very hard since most of the seller and buyer is using fiat while the demand for crypto e-commerce is very low.",

I've paid my transaction there with bitcoin and they've automatically converted the price into our local currency for its pricing. They've used a third-party service where I have to pay bitcoin converting the amount of my checkout. But, it's so long since I've been with them and AFAIK, they've got international outlets for which you can try to shop. I think if you still cannot find one, you can just go with this link:Quote from: Potato Chips on February 15, 2023, 08:27:40 PMAlternatively, you can try the gift card route, see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5208530.0And try to use bitrefill for its gift cards.",

But they are not mature enough and nobody knows when they will, so the alternatives already given (purse, gift cards...) and solutions like Crypto.com's or Binance's with their debit card are the way to go in the meantime, IMO.",

I do not want to sell anything special, just ordinary  stuff.Something that matches ebay, not by a long shot!There was one serious attempt like open bazaar and it went out of business, the myriad of small projects simply couldn't gain any traction at all, mostly because people look at ebay for buyer protection, cryptocurrency-based solutions offer merchant protection against chargebacks so not that many are thrilled of shopping on a young platform and getting a brick instead of an iPhone without the possibility to get the money back.The only one that I know to still be around is bitify.com but it's not like I've ever used or can vouch for it.Quote from: Wapfika on February 16, 2023, 02:42:15 PMActually you don’t need to find an e-commerce that accept crypto anymore since you can shop already on any e-commerce like e-bay and amazon by using crypto debit cards. Crypto debit cards like crypto.com, swipe and many more will allow you to use crypto to fund your debit card that you can use on purchasing in any store online. So what the point then, just use your normal card from your bank with fiat and keep your coins, at least if something goes wrong you know that somebody will answer and it won't be a bored guy in 3rd world call center that will tell you for weeks the issue will be solved.",

They let you mark your postings indicating you accept crypto payments, at the same time an option to filter such postings is also there. But mind you, there’s no affiliated escrow there as it's geared towards in person deals. You can still do purely online deals but it's likely that people would be very much cautious with your sell posts.",

These decentralized marketplaces are built on blockchain technology, ensuring secure and private transactions.OpenBazaar is an open-source marketplace that allows users to buy and sell goods using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. It enables users to create their own storefront and list products for sale, as well as browse and purchase goods from other stores.Bitify is another platform that is a decentralized marketplace that accepts traditional payment methods such as credit cards and PayPal in addition to cryptocurrencies. Bitify has a simple interface and charges a small fee for each transaction.Purse.io is a one-of-a-kind platform that allows users to use Bitcoin to purchase discounted Amazon products. Users make a wishlist of items they want to buy, and anyone looking to buy Bitcoin pays for the items on the wishlist and has them shipped directly to the user who made the wishlist.OpenSea is a marketplace focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are one-of-a-kind digital assets such as art, music, and collectibles. It is the largest NFT marketplace and accepts cryptocurrency payments such as Ethereum.Overall, these platforms give users more opportunities to buy and sell goods online using digital currencies. They provide a decentralized and secure alternative to traditional online marketplaces, allowing people to transact directly and without intermediaries.",

Plus LTC price, again, weird thing.Anyhow it's clear that in terms of e-commerce it will be the usual way, you won't have a marketplace that starts with bitcoin only and grows and far more probable one that is already up and going accepting crypto on top of fiat. You simply can't gain enough traction just with crypto, merchants might be happy but customers not so much.",

This may not only ease the online shopping for many people worldwide and will also act as a source of Bitcoin adoption globally.At the moment, all stores that accept bitcoin as payment are small and with a rather limited range of goods, which are very far from the scale of ebay. The search for OP \"something like ebay, but based on crypto\" is currently doomed to failure, if we talk about the abundance of sellers and goods.Amazone and eBay will not allow other online stores to grow to their level, therefore, trying to wait for the appearance of a large store that accepts bitcoin as payment may not be feasible.Acceptance of Amazone and eBay as a means of payment in bitcoin depends on the legal status of btc in the United States, since these online stores are under the jurisdiction of this country. Undoubtedly, adding bitcoin to these stores would be a very powerful push for global adoption, as btc would then be used directly for its intended purpose by the millions of users of these online stores around the world.",
