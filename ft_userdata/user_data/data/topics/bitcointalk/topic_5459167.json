I saw a thread that was made in 2022 or 2021 and it was anonymous but the chance of you getting your post turned into anonymous is less than 4%.",

Is there a settings in my profile?It is currently impossible to get \"Anonymous\" instead of your current nickname, as you have already been told. But in general, what are you worried about? If there is no connection between the current account and your real identity, then essentially your forum profile is anonymous (because no one knows who is behind that account). If you want to make sure, then create a new account (by the way, this is not prohibited on the forum) from which you can ask a question that interests you. Just don't abuse it in malicious ways.",

Is there a settings in my profile?As been said, only Theymos can grant you that request but you’d have to give him a very good reason to do so. I remember when a certain member asked for some of his topics to be made anonymous as OP, Theymos granted his request but those who participated in the thread or was in the forum back then know who the OP is. If you’re worried about offending anyone with your posts, you should create an alt account to make such posts.",

But of course, everyone is anonymous here if we all go by that explanation of yours. However, the type of anonymous OP talked about there is a more secretive type. If you checked very well you would've realised how user anonymous doesn't have any link to their profile. To state it, I believe that \"anonymous\" account isn't just an ordinary account. I suspect it's an admin account. That account even posted recently, about a year ago. So, we can't say it's a throwaway account.",

Creating a new account in order to make a post that is either controversial or that you wouldn't want to get you into trouble is even encouraged by theymos himself. Unlike what some people says that it is an act of cowardice, I believe it has more to do with privacy instead.It is important anyone that wants to post information that they don't want to be linked to their main account, especially this time around that the reputation board is full of drama and people fighting against others. Before now people request theymos to change their particular post to Anonymous and he did for them, but I don't know if it still exist till date.",
