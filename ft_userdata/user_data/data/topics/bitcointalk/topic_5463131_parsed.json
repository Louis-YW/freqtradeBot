Even for me birthdays are not so special in the forum among users - but everyone can present their happiness in any way. It would probably be nice to be celebrated on an achievement thread - as other users have recommended.I just thought about it. The forum is so delightful that lovers of attracting attention can celebrate their birthdays at least every day. Many hide their date of birth for privacy, while others simply invent it because, on the Internet, we can be of different ages.But, OP, if you need it, then congratulations, and good luck with your life! :",
