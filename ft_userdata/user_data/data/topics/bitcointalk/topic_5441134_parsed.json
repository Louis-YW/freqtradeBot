Drop your thoughts.  As the name implies, it is decentralized. There's no way a central entity, let alone the government, could control it. Sure, you can incarcerate the people who were behind the project and keep them for as long as you like, but the protocol itself will remain running on the web for an indefinite amount of time. I saw this happen with Forsage, that DeFi project that turned out to be a big sham and a Ponzi scheme. The founders and a couple executives behind this project is already indicted and are slated to get their jail time soon, but as it stands today Forsage is still apparently running. So to answer your question, I think DeFi is uncontrollable, at least by a central government or a single entity, but have the public go against it and it will collapse.",

      "body": "I guess it depends on what you mean. Systems that rely on votes and are fully decentralised (like pos systems like makerdao) seem like they'd be extremely difficult for governments to control and ultimately hard to centralise and maybe impossible to control. Other aspects of defi like usdc and usdt are probably controllable as their collateral is centralised. Afaik they make up large portions of dai's collateral but it's likely collateralised so much a central entity would need good timing to actually be able to collapse it and they'd likely take the entire stablecoin industry out with it if it was possible.",

The defi platforms are still not safe for as long as SEC identifies its owner, it can be closed. SEC will charge them for operating an unregistered securities exchange.Unless the defi is not operating in US, probably Hongkong I think it will be fine. Just be cautious because the Chinese government can also look into it and suddenly changes its stance.",

Drop your thoughts. If we speak about theory, then yes: I believe it's possible to ban/regulate etc DeFi simply by criminalizing any participation in it. However, in real life it's easier said than done. A country has to have a huge and very advanced cyberpolice force in order to track down every (or most) DeFi user. It's not very realistic and unsustainable.",

Drop your thoughts. Regulated Decentralized Finance (RegDeFi) is coming, that's for sure, because for a while now DEXes have blurred and bended the definition of “Exchange”, and regulators are still trying to keep up while new innovations that need different rules.And they already work with regulators. Uniswap for example has banned hundreds of wallet addresses for alleged crimes. And they are not doing that from the goodness of their heart or because they want to centralize everything. They are being pressured by regulators to comply with them as basically every \"exchange\" is subject to regulatory compliance.",

Actually, too many of them said to be decentralized but after being looked at, it tends out that they're not.If these platforms are just like bitcoin which is wholly decentralized, even how hard these governments try to track them down and regulate them, there's no way for them to stop it if it's being backed up by people around the world.

Nations like china implement a great firewall to censor internet traffic. VPNs, proxies, etc are used to bypass state imposed restrictions. Platforms like thepiratebay tried to avoid government restrictions with servers located in countries which did not extradite criminals to the united states. They also planned to have servers housed inside of drone aircraft in neutral international territory in an effort to bypass state regulation. To some extent computer virus authors, malware writers, botnets and other cybercrime demographics have long evaded authority figures.There is no shortage of effort made to avoid censorship and restrictions. If it were possible to put a defi project on mars or the moon and have it accessible to earth by internet. That might put the protocol out of government reach. But then maybe it wouldn't.",

Drop your thoughts. It depends how the protocol was designed. If, for example, a company is definitely established in the midst of a highly regulated country, the scenario of regulatory intervention may not be ruled out if the founders can be identified. The anticipation can be technically many things, for example the need to run protocols without a single operation and spread anonymously. Then it also becomes a hard process to close or change the defi protocol.",

Drop your thoughts. The word defi is known as decentralized finance for a reason, everything surrounding it is meant to be decentralized from the teams, the communities, and the protocols level and that is why most often than not, the teams that operate and found decentralized finance systems are usually anonymous to protect the community, the protocol and the people who used the protocol because ones they are been compromised by the government individuals, it is no longer decentralized. However, there is a concern about being anonymous in the crypto ecosystem, teams and individuals use the anonymous privilege to run to swindle people, manipulate protocol with an exit door, rug pull, and also insider stealings. The government is very concerned about this repeated stealing of people's money that is bringing down families because they are trying to make a living through crypto, that is why you see many are calling for crypto(altcoins) regulations.",

Drop your thoughts. If the company or a person running a Defi protocol is able to hide their identity, there's no way for a government to regulate them directly. However a government can always use a strong internet firewall to restrict access for it's citizens. So indirectly a government can regulate them. Defi is posing a huge risk in the mainstream financial market today as it is very very easy to convert the black money into white. So it's a security risk as well as these can be easily used to finance terrorism activities and any kind of illegal money transactions.",

Most DeFi organizations have a central figures, commercial browsers need permission to have wallets as attachments, and as long as we are ultimately valuating things in fiat money, or dealing with fiat money at all. And if we want to keep current form of civilization that has taxes, we need to have transparency on wealth and AML laws. This is where FATF comes in and basically renders any cryptocurrency unusable that you can't prove where you got it from.Things have become way more complex and while it's still possible to launder money i am not going to give any examples how to do that as i don't think it's ethical. But DeFi is not the key element in that.",
