Be careful when doing that online if that was really your money because you could be targeted by some hackers and scammers.I don't think it makes much of a difference between USDT and USDC. Maybe just look into the companies that issues each stable coin and choose who you trust more. I know Tether has had plenty of accusation compared to Circle and Coinbase but both companies seems liquid enough to support a 1:1 redemption or close.",

I'm curious and probably worried as well about that website where you're staking your USDT/USDC. Well, it's not actually staking but you're letting them borrow your money so that's an interest account just like what the banks do.",

      "body": "Staking of USDT is the best move for now. There's really no much difference between the two because they're both stable and since you've already staked your USDT, just continue with it. That's a more reliable source of passive income and the value would be growing, as long as it takes the market to complete this cycle.",

I'm beginning to suspect you are shilling that Natomi  protocol.Let me just remind you that most of the defi/lending and borrowing platform could go bankrupt soon. Look at, Luna, Celsius and probably Blockfi may follow soon. In the case of USDT, its safer to use USDC or so they say because its more transparent and coinbase has backed their reserves unlike USDT which is not. Also USDT is not safe, they have once frozen funds, you'll never know when they suddenly lose knots.",
