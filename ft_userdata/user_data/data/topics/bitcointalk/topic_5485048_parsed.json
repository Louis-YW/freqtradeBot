I see so many people that come around here sharing how much bitcoin they own...don't.  Just like any of your finances such as your portfolio or how much your annual salary is..it's no one's business but your own.  Being transparent about these things can be harmful to you in a multitude of ways.  As an advisor this is something I tell my clients all the time.  Your financial info is private and should always remain that way.  I hate these new social media trends where people walk up to strangers on the street and ask things like \"how much do you pay in rent\" or \"how much money do you make a year\"...ignore them!",

He only wants to know other people's income but never learns how to earn money in a different way or in bitcoin, even he is more happy to hear other people's stories than his motivation.So I will not tell anyone how many bitcoins I have now, enough for myself, I don't want to be a risk that at the end they threaten me.",

Its true that this is something that should really be in private and something that shouldnt be known by someone. Here on this forum then you could really be able to see those people who are really that even sharing up their portfolio balances as if they are really that confident on doing so.Honestly, its really that still not that easy for you to victimized someone even if you do know those details, this is something that those things having in mind into those people who are really that too boastful with their holdings since they do know that people cant do something shit on them.On online space then i might not be worrying about but in physical world then this is something that you should really be mindful because we know that not everyone that near you would really be having that kind of positive views towards you but rather they would really be targeting you instead.When it comes to money then everyone could changed up instantly.",

If you act stupid now it won't take long before you go back to where you started, to nothing. Compared to staying rich, becoming rich is way easier.

In the middle of class he asked that, I was really annoyed to hear that, but because he was my friend, I had to show it. but if I had the same case now, I would ignore it before the question was finished.

I believe those videos are mostly staged because no one who cares about their safety and privacy would entertain such interviews. I saw one where the guy asked to see where this person lives and how much his rent was. I find it hard to believe that could be real.Before anyone will ask you about your Bitcoin hodlings, that means that they are aware that you're involved in Bitcoin. I think this question comes up when you're trying to convince a newbie to invest in Bitcoin or you're teaching bitcoin to someone. It's a newbie question, anyone who understands the value of Bitcoin and knows it's digital money will not ask such questions.",

It doesn't make sense to make people know the amount of bitcoin you are holding for security reasons. If I am teaching someone about bitcoin, no matter how close the person is, I will never use my main wallet to teach the person about bitcoin, I have a wallet with i have no bitcoin in it, that's what I do use to explain about bitcoin to people I know. Don't think that because you are close to someone, you can tell them about your holdings, it's not safe to do that, the amount you hold should be known to only you.Quote from: ChiBitCTy on February 13, 2024, 05:25:44 PMI see so many people that come around here sharing how much bitcoin they own...don't.I have seen a lot of posts like that on the forum here, most of them will make a screenshot of when they are purchasing bitcoin, and they will decide to post it here, which doesn't make sense to me. I am not against posting that you purchased bitcoin and you are planning to encourage other people, but when doing that, always make sure you blur the part that is showing the amount of bitcoin that you purchased, at least nobody will know the amount of bitcoin that you are holding.",

Malicious people don't need to know the exact amount of bitcoin you have, as long as you're into it (well, unless you have quite a lot!). If you know that they know you own bitcoin, you should regard yourself a target, just as with owning any other financial asset, like gold, jewellery, stocks.

In a discussion it often comes to them asking so you've been around for a long time, how much do you still have, or how much did you have in year X and I want to tell them because it's a part of this narration that we all used to have a lot but we didn't value it as much as we should have. Anyway, I understand what the problem is with telling people how much you own, but at the same time when you don't say anything it's going to cut the conversation short because most people will feel like you have too much and are afraid to talk about it because you're a millionaire. I had people ask me if they should buy, if I'd help them buy, how much to invest and it always ended bitter because I didn't want to get involved.",

Many people ignore this ongoing risk to our security and possessions in their pursuit of approval from others.

Newbie often ask such questions, a person can also ask questions to get to know others can ask such questions to know whether you have bitcoins or not and to get an idea about your financial situation. But as a bitcoiner, almost all of us know how important it is to avoid these questions. Moreover, one of the purposes Bitcoin is designed for is anonymity. In my opinion any question asking about personal finance and not just Bitcoin is best ignored. Almost everyone knows of instances where he has been victimized after informing others about his financial situation. Both knowing and asking about the financial affairs of others should be avoided.",
