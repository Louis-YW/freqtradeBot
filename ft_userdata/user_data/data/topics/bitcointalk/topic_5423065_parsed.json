Im thinking about that guy may not wanna see his wife knows if he was actively doing gambling. That's why even he was winning big reward and his wife may become lazy to did work with him caused by he understood once someone was winning big reward and it can make his family become lazy and they didn't wanna work again. I think that must become most potential reason why he didn't wanna tell his wife and child about his reward from doing gambling. There were so many old cases that pretty similar with it. From his reason if he wants also educate his family to always working hard and not depends with the reward that already won.that's such a very wise decision by him to educate his family.",

This kind of people should know that some people's children are rich because their parent was rich, I think people that got no money in the past should know that. A wife living with him for long and having children with him, not letting her know when she is worthy to know about it is perfectly not only a wrong decision but also a very stupid decision.",

I reckon what he thought was worded poorly or something, the idea is he didn't want to indulge the money they got and well, lead to thinking that said money is something normal they can get every now and then. Can't exactly tell what kind of person he is though since we only know he donated a part and hasn't said anything else about the rest but if it was say used as an investment for their children, building a business then I reckon all is good even if he did keep it from his family. If it was used for gambling or well, selfish indulging then that's a different case altogether.

Banks would probably distribute the money to their family and children, which may vary from the laws of each state but I reckon it's something similar, granted the deceased didn't leave a will ofc.",

So, it's not that he doesn't want to share it with his family. and based on the story above, he contemplates what to do next with the remaining amount of money.I'm not going to jump to any conclusion, or judge it. actually this goes back to the way a person thinks, if he has a good mindset and intellectual. he will not feel confused and already has plans for the future with the money he has from the lottery draw.",
