These alt farmers are destroying the environment of the forum and abusing bounty rules. These also demotivate genuine workers to leave the forum because their already dropping payout getting thinner because of these multi-users. So I think we could discuss a solution on how to get rid of these alt farmers or at least demotivate or force them to work fairly. I am giving my opinion here and you can leave your opinion too. my opinion:Quote from: DVlog on June 13, 2022, 01:50:31 PMA special badge can be provided for bounty hunters. New members must pay 10$ to the forum to get that badge to join the campaign. Already existing members and users above full member will get that badge as an airdrop. It is easy to get member rank by buying merits but for full member rank, it won't be profitable. When an alt farmer gets red-flagged to 10 of his account he or she will think twice before doing the same because it will cost him money this time.",

Let's say the top managers will adopt such rules, do you think they don't have any other option to pick newbie manager who will do anything to earn worthless coin?

      "body": "Ultimately, if there's an incentive for account farmers then you'll likely see alt farmers on mass. If there isn't any incentive, there would be less, but ultimately the wider forum users would suffer from this. For example, removing signature campaigns would undoubtedly reduce spam, farmers, and some scam signatures, however ultimately that means restricting legitimate users, which I'm not a fan of. I personally think the sort of economy we've got going on in the forum is a good thing. theymos has made it more difficult with various changes, for example the merit system makes it harder for low quality farmers from ranking up accounts, and therefore reducing the incentive without too much impact on legitimate users. Then, the bumping changes on the altcoin announcement sections was implemented, which in turn reduced the amount of projects participating in fake bumping groups. So, ultimately theymos has already implemented things which have been rather effective. However, I'm sure there's other things that could be introduced, although none spring to mind. Although, what we have to remember this will always be a problem, when there's an incentive for doing it, which at the moment, there's plenty of incentives.",

My only intention is to demotivate them from creating hundreds of accounts again and again.theymos has shown a dislike to the newbie jail which was implemented several years ago, because it restricted too many legitimate users, without too many benefits associated with it. They're unlikely to implement something like this that would pretty much have the same effect. Although, $10 is nothing when they can earn that back in a day. Most of these alt farmers are likely earning a pretty penny. I think it was somewhat recently discovered a alt farm was participating in a well established signature campaign, and were earning massive amounts of money per week. Then, there's the plethora of bounties they can abuse, which might be hit, and miss, but can earn users some money on the side.

There's no how a user can complete posts on 10 accounts without using a bot. Aren't they required to make posts?They definitely use bots. I see it everyday now I'm more exposed to it. I wouldn't think it would be far stretched to say some are in the thousands. They're likely using bots in an attempt to earn enough merit, to then earn from the accounts, which might mean once they've done that they'd use them properly all of sudden. I don't think the latter happens much as it simply doesn't happen with the merit system, but I imagine that's their line of thought. Otherwise, I don't know why. Hundreds of accounts like these are nuked per month I'd say. You find its either low quality or they're copying it from another post. However, in most cases because of the way they're doing it, connecting the accounts is almost instant. For a few months I was battling a thread bumping system, which used the same sort of words, and sentence structuring. They have somewhat disappeared recently though, at least that group of them. Unless, I haven't caught onto their new techniques yet.",

Somehow, despite all the warnings and tagging, thy still get patronage from users on and off forum. The more reason why these activities aren't moderated as individual actions still comes through despite flags raised.My advice for you, keep a healthy involvement with the bounties if you can't stop, help to catch these account farmers if you can and ensure your participation on where it matters most on the forum isn't lacking.",
