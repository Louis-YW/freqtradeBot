  "content": "I have created a simple nodejs app that makes RPC calls to your node, and then creates a secure tunnel to view your localhost on your phone.There is a lot of work left to do, but it can execute some basic functions:â€¢ balance and transactions are displayedâ€¢ choose between your various walletsâ€¢ generate a receive address with QR codeâ€¢ scan QR codes to send Bitcoin (fee set to economical for now)You can also save the website to your homescreen, and it will open in fullscreen like a regular app.I hope to encourage people to run a full pruned node and become economic nodes.https://github.com/BTCapsule/soverynodeVideo of sending testnet Bitcoin from my node on my iPhone:https://v.nostr.build/nx8g.mp4",

Since you did mention that it's intended for mobile (mainly, I guess).The website provided by localtunnel is somewhat random, and I may be able to make it longer and more secure. Itâ€™s your own personal url, but it could be better.Iâ€™m working on options to self host. It looks like this will require opening ports on your router and installing an SSL, so Iâ€™m not sure if that can be easily solved. This may just be a trade off. Personally, I would rather use someone elseâ€™s server to display a GUI of my node, than to trust someone elseâ€™s node.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 30, 2023, 11:04:06 AMQuote from: https://github.com/BTCapsule/soverynodeThe terminal will provide a link. Follow that link on your mobile browser. Enter your PUBLIC IP address.With so many ISP assign dynamic IP address to their customer, it doesn't seem to be practical. Entering new IP address when you reboot the modem or ISP assign new IP address after some time is rather cumbersome.Iâ€™m working on self hosting options, but I may be able to remove the need to type in your IP address. You can also delete all the localtunnel code and use ngrok to tunnel the wallet, but ngrok is not open source. It has some nice features though. Eventually, the plan is to have an executable that you just open and immediately have your url and wallet without friction.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 30, 2023, 11:04:06 AMQuote from: https://github.com/BTCapsule/soverynodeThe terminal will provide a link.

That was some major friction that Iâ€™m glad is gone. I may be able to edit the conf file automatically too, but it might be best to leave that to the user.",
