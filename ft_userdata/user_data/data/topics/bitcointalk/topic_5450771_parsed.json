      "body": "That seems like an impossibly insane number for the \"total asset value.\" What's going on with that? Would you mind sharing the address? It's tough to suggest your best course of action without knowing more about who you paid, etc. There's no such thing as chargebacks in crypto,, but if this seller has a public reputation, hopefully there's a way to resolve this.",

      "body": "Firstly, I dont think this is a bitcoin technical support related thread. You are talking about USDT in tron explorer. You should move this thread to altcoins board imo.Secondly, could you be more clear about where and whom did you pay ? The balance you just mentioned is quite large enough for your normal scammer. It must be something big.",

      "body": "First you have to tell us how did you make that purchase. Where you made that deal.If it is a peer to peer trade without Escrow in between you and your trade partner, I am sure you were scammed and you lost your USDT for nothing (as so far you did not receive your bitcoin which you wanted to buy with your USDT).If it is a Peer-to-Peer marketplace, with a Escrow service, how did you make that purchase? Did you click on Paid button to mark the trade as You already made your payment. This step is very important to prevent the trade to expire as well as let the system knows that you paid it and that amount of bitcoin will be locked in Escrow and won't be returned to your trade partner. You will receive your coins after the trade partner click on Release or if you win a dispute for that trade and the system will release coin for you.",
