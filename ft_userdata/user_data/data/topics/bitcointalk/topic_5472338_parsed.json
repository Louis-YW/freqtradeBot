And it happens in a casino called NitrogenSports. That casino is rebranded now to NitroBetting and now they only allow USA users, so, i can't play there anymore. $200k was a brutal lose, with that money you could start your own casino. I'm really sorry for your loss and i hope you recover soon. Now I'm curious, how did you lose that amount?",

I can't just imagine myself losing huge amount like $200k in a casino were I know that gambling is a probability game which is not certain or defined that someone most always strike a winning.",

This money is big enough to change the life of a poor man to become very rich down here in my country, and you just lost it in one session, gush. I have never used up to $100 in a session because my income is not big, and I only gamble with 5% from my income.What got over you that made you to gamble with such amount, you should not be influenced by those wealthy gamblers that stream their gambling activities, because they have more than enough to throw away. Gamble responsible and don't live to regret your actions later.",

No matter how you look at it, it is very likely that you would lose that money sooner or later, because people gamble for the thrill of it, not for the profit, right?",

This is money that can change someone life forever... far bigger than my five years target. Well, it is obvious you are rich and I don't think you need to gamble because you are probably richer than some of the companies you want to win money inÂ   My highest daily loss in gambling should be $100 and that is a long time ago. I'm not a high risk taker and I believe in building small money to big amount over a long period of time.",

That's actually big regrets if I was in your position cause I could do a lot of things with that money by just simply investing into Bitcoin, building a small business, renovate the house and buy also a motor vehicle for everyday use. I also gamble but it won't even reach $100 as I limit myself, of course sometimes I won more than $100 but I always stick to my limit so I won't get addicted as well trying to chase the loss. But actually damn, that amount could already support a lot of kids in my country for years, depends on the inflation rate.",

I don't have that big money to begin with. But during the height of my addiction, I would say that I will go and lose $1k at least in one sitting in a card game in a land base casino. It's just a short time, maybe I was really unlucky that night that it was very quick and then I say that is the only money that I will lose, then next thing I know I will have to go to a ATM machine and withdraw more, again and again. So it was really hard to control once you taste that defeat and wanted to recoup and recover. Anyhow, not sure how are you going to be affected losing that big money and hopefully it's a money that you can afford to lose.",

Might be interesting what kind of games you play though to lose that kind of money?Could be dice games or slots?Anyhow, I can't recall how big I have been losing in one session. But in the last traditional base casinos that I played, perhaps just around $200-$400. It's not that big as compare to you, but that is the money that I only bring in the casino and I played like 4 hours with my family and friends and so I did enjoy our session that time despite going home losing money.",

And that $200k in a land base casinos, you will be treated like a whale already and can get huge peaks or even a good stay in their hotel.But in just shows how gambling is, some of us here live in a 3rd world country or maybe in the States or Europe. However, we can still fell on the trap that majority of us will lose in a casinos, whether $100-$100k.",
