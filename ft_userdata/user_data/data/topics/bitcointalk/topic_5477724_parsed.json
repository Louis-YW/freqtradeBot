Then go back to team or as club in a football when they don't have structure and solid foundation it makes it very difficult to achieve some common league why because there are lots of incompetent players that was brought into the club all less it's being change to have a newly signed up players otherwise such team won't experience much growth but as time keeps going you will later find out that there is need for a total structure.",

No doubt money can influence the performance of a team because they have the money to buy expensive players but there is no assurance that that player will perform well in the team. Manchester united had bought two players last season Antonio and one other guy but what are they doing now? Also, Chelsea bought so many players as well still there have not been much an improvement. Expensive players and bad management will still lead to the downfall of the team. What is more important is how well can the manger use those players to bring success to the team.",

You can take a look at this table, you will know that many if the clubs have related before https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unrelegated_association_football_clubsBut some clubs are good and now retaining good title for many years because of the reason that I stated above which is better sponsorship offers and better players because they have money to buy the players to play for them.

Not only Manchester City but also Chelsea as an example how money get most important thing for both teams success won many trophies after acquisition and have much money. Abramovich success make Chelsea become big fourth of Premier League teams and Manchester City dominance winning many Premier League trophies after having much money. Teams football history is not really important now because money can make unpredictable team success lead top achievement, I sure if new teams get huge investor in the future will be top team and dominance with domestic league competition. After Manchester City which one new teams will change the old dominance team for winning domestic league trophies?",

That is why gambling on these games is common and has become regular from majority of sports players out there.Some game lovers might disagree here that the heritage is being destroyed by gambling and the fan-craze, but I see these things as one fuels the other and if you have craze you will have betting happening too and its good for the games and the companies that run them.Overall, we should do our part in preserving the heritage.",

Look at Manchester United and Chelsea for example, they have a history of being one of the greatest teams in any English Leagues but look at what has been happening to them, it is a shame to even openly support them and even the fans have stress to breathing anytime they have a match because they always choke them all the time. In the past, even in their worst moment, they were not this bad as they used to play in the past, I don't think your facts can checkmate in some aspect.There may be some clubs I have to know in many leagues, your theory might be right in this aspect because if you take a deep decades back to the club, they don't have anything to show off about the club performance, if you watch Premier League very well, Everton for the last 20 years don't have a Premier League in their shelf, Nottingham Forest doesn't have too for the last 4o years and somehow these teams many times played repeatedly in the Premier League.",

Like some families have older ones who have liked and played football in their youth age whether international or local even to the parents and grand parents.So I accept it is hereditary for families and their siblings but for clubs or teams, I doubt that. If a team is not performing and they desire to perform, what they need to do is to wait for transfer season and do their buy of choicest players plus coach. Some years back Manchester city wasn't in the top team list but they have been able to do that in recent years.The most important thing for team is to have the finance to be able to overhaul their team but if a team lack the finance then it could support your assertion that the team performance is hereditary but with finance, they can change their fortune.",

Take a club like Barcelona for example. They've had legends like Cryuff, Ronaldinho, Pep, Henry and so on to their name. When you're mentioning household names in football you'll call them. Football heritage is not how club wins the league. If you look, there are teams who have won leagues multiple times that are mid table teams today. If a club bottle's the league, it doesn't mean they don't have football heritage. Arsenal is football heritage but they bottled the league twice; to Leicester and Man City. Manchester United can't win the league today, but they can be called football heritage. When a club is very well organized and run, they will win titles or atblesst conoete for it. And a lot of things determine if the club will be well run, finance is a part of it.",

You can start the change, but it won't be effective if others don't follow. So it's not about previous scores or what they have achieved or have not achieved in the past; it's about the club being able to accept change and change their pattern. If it's to bring in more effective players, they pave the way for it. You can't be in the same place with no upgrade in skill, and everywhere is necessary. If you want to make a difference, competition is high, so to win, one needs to step up. Although there are people who have so much positive energy in them, which can trigger a team to win to some extent, and there are also people who don't excel when they are in some particular club, all that matters is change, and I don't see anything like hereditary in play here.",

They always end up bottling the league at the end.OP, I think you are aware that anything hereditary is transmitted through blood, not by the physical characteristics of various individuals assembled to form a team. This means that a team's success or failure cannot be inherited, regardless of how we evaluate their current performance. For example, before Pep Guardiola joined Manchester City, could anyone honestly name Manchester City as one of the greatest clubs in the world? However, given their current performance, you can confidently name them among the best teams in the world, even though they won't be the center of attention in football for years to come.What I am trying to say in essence is that a team's bad or good performance can not be transmitted(hereditary) from one generation to another because all the players in the team are not linked together by blood rather each of them is brought into the team by signing of the contract to play for the team for a space of time. No connection that a bad team that was bad years back will transmit their bad performance to a present team when they have had a change of coach, management, and players",

As I understand of football, teams that are usually in relegation don't come back the next season, they get demoted instantly after the season and any of the team that made the top 3 come back for another chance and this happened repeatedly and for the other teams that haven't top the rank most are low budget clubs that sometimes don't have much money. The top teams are mostly rotated, only few leagues remain the same especially Laliga.As for Champions League, I think Real Madrid has been the highest winners in numbers but are they consistent about it? No, the last time they win it was last 2 years and even this season, they have been the best in the group stage but who knows what will happen after the stage, no one can tell for sure and the same goes for every league. I don't think your fact is right in this context but perhaps when we had Messi and Ronaldo, your context might be right.",
