      "body": "It's hard to say exactly how long Ethereum will maintain its lead as a smart contract platform. But two things are certain. First, people are constantly looking for better, faster, and more scalable blockchain technologies. Second, Ethereum has plenty of competition from other formidable projects. As these other platforms improve, Ethereum will have to innovate and provide new features in order to remain in its position of leadership. It's an ongoing process that all successful platforms must undergo. That said, Ethereum is still the frontrunner in terms of public adoption, and that's not something that can be easily overcome.",

That isn't same as 51% attack. If it would be easier to host light weight node in your own home, there wouldn't be an issue and this is something i am sure they are tackling next. Compared to bitcoin, that was once mostly mined from one server farm, i don't see the issue really, some people can't afford mining btc just like some people can't afford hosting their own nodes. This will most likely change in the future with lighter clients.if cloud servers were compromised, people would either move to other servers or host it by themselves.Sure, things can be more decentralized but we tend to forget that the whole internet mostly runs on centralized servers and their backups.",

That being said i don't really think that i was that much different when Ethereum was still proof of work. I mean there were or still are huge mining companies in china and if a single company is controlling a big share of the mining power of a crypto currency then it is just as centralized.I think that Ethereum will always be the number one smart contract platform, simply because they invented that functionality.",

Although there are blockchains which causes lower transaction fees such as Litecoin and BNB, ETH chain would still be more used because it is somehow more secured.Ethereum is still decentralized. It is just because of third party wallets and apps which makes it seem not to. Except from high transaction fees, my another problem is delay on some of my transactions made which on my end, viewed it as traffic given how many projects are using this chain. I got used of it than to use other chains and eventually lose my funds. Better late than never, I guess.",

Ethereum always had the problem of incredibly high fees and to solve that it had to rely on other cheaper and faster networks to have it done in the cheapest way. The eth network has to rely on sidechains and Layer two solutions to be able to provide a cheap and fast network. So, basically, ethereum would not work if it wasn't for other solutions. If it can't solve what we need to have solved it is not a good network and will replaced by a new and better network very soon.",

It's pretty much the same like anyother POS smartcontract blockchain in the market. There's no different between ethereum and any other smartcontract blockchain in the market.
