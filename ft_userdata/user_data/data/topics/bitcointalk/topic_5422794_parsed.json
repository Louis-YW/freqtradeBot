You cannot predict the market with a technical analysis only.Quote from: CryptoDor on November 23, 2022, 08:14:25 AMLet me know if I have missed some weird forum rule not allowing speculative predictions on a chart from a screenshot.Because you are a newbie, it does not allow you to post images not unless --you paid a copper membership or at least you are a jr. member onward.

By that logic no one should be looking just for TA to make money with trading except few people on the top? And they would be somehow successful most of the time?If you are talking about high frequency trading then no, most of the people aren't playing that game against bots, but that's not really something people would be posting to forums any way because even if you would be working with bots their response time would be too low against well funded bots.And when you talk about low to mid freq trading there's so much room to work with by common laptop. And if you are rich enough you could force confirmations that trigger bots by yourself. In fact i have seen a ton of market action with only reason seems to be to mess with bots.Common people could be looking for different issues and different charts. There are so many different ways of doing TA and to choose what FA to combine it with it would be impossible to predict everything with some superbot or even with think tank that have more responsibility to their funders and take less risks then common trader.Quote from: Husires on November 24, 2022, 08:31:43 PMAt the present time, most of the technical analysis indicators do not work, for example, all moving averages have been broken during the past months, and therefore it has become useless to rely on them as points of support and resistance.Therefore, publishing such analyzes is more waste of effort than benefit.It's about probability of working and even those probabilities change. When something goes different direction then predicted to, but it had a probability to go against prediction, it doesn't mean predictions doesn't work, people just interpret and simplify it like that. Markets usually follow similar cycles as it's mostly patterns on how humans behave in markets. That is not really exact science, it's just predictions on data we choose to play with.",

But those who \"get lucky\" are very few, and those people are mostly the hardest workers, and the smartest traders.

Reason because TA doesn't work for everyone is because trading is a zero sum game. It's just logically impossible for everyone to sell the top just because they follow the same \"working\" indicator. That's not how it works. Just like it's impossible for everyone to buy at the right time and hodl, so you indeed can try to \"get lucky\" on that tactic too and hope this growth won't end. But you still might want to have an exit point where you take profits, because there's no such thing as infinite growth. And just taking profits when you think it's a right time for it is similar to low frequency trading.",

And I really agree that these TAs are getting useless from time to time which makes no reason for us to believe in others' TAs rather than our own. Traders are not reliant on TA anymore but rather have luck and follow their instinct. Because even if we spend a lot of time in the market, checking the chart, etc... sadly it only confuses us about what we gonna do next. This will tell us that trading is really hard and the direction of the market is very unpredictable.",

Normie laptop traders eventually get this info too, and it's unlikely that they wouldn't gain from that too. They don't have to buy bottom or sell the top do do so.Even if they have 52 % changes to win, trading is a game worth playing, just like the edge card counters get in back jack makes it worth their time even if they lose high % of the time. And unlike in black jack, you don't lose everything when you lose, so it's way more profitable then gambling.",
