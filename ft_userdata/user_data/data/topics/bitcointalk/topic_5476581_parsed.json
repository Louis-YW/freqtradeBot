  "content": "So someone that I know wants to check the current btc price whenever they want.  The thing is they are not tech savy at all.  What I did last time was use an old android phone that they had and entered that bitstamp website into the google chrome browser on their android phone.  So everytime that person uses that android phone and enters the passcode to unlock the phone, they would click on the chrome browser and then it would show the current btc price on bitstamp.  They would then click that button to turn off the screen so if they wanted to check the btc price again, they have to enter the passcode etc.  The thing is this android phone is an old phone and very slow so it isn't their main phone.  The reason I did that as oppose to entering the bitstamp website on their phone that they use is because if they check the bitstamp price while in public, imagine someone else looking at their phone when in public, that person would assume they have cryptocurrency.  That person doesn't have any but wants to check the prices only.  So because of that, I thought best idea is ask them if they have another phone or computer that they leave at home to use so they check it that way so did that with the android phone.Now that android phone no longer works and that person wants to check btc price.  What are their options for this?  They do not have another spare phone and no computer at all.  I don't want that person to check cryptocurrency prices in public on their regular iphone in case someone looks at it and assumes they have cryptocurrency which they do not have.  I did thought about telling that person to only check it whenever they are at home and they are fine with that.  The issue with this would be everytime they check the btc price at home on say bitstamp with their regular phone, well if they open the google browser on their phone in public, it would then display bitstamp.  So I thought telling that person to delete their web search history each time on google chrome on their phone would work but this would be a huge hassle for someone not tech savy.  Also they would have to enter bitstamp website every single time and since that person isn't tech savy, I would have to write the bitstamp website on paper for them to leave at home and they type it every single time on their iphone.  Does anyone here have any alternatives to this?  The other thing I thought was download the bitstamp app?  However, can you view updated current prices with any of those apps if you don't have an account with that site?  That person owns no cryptocurrency and does not have any account at any of the exchanges.  That person just wants to check btc price at home say a few times a day.Now if any of the apps do work for this, which one would it be?  I guess a safe way would be make sure that crypto app is on the last page of their iphone apps?  So the only way to get there is scroll once or twice to there?  Again the thing is I don't want that person to use their iphone in public and when playing around with the pihone, go to or even click on the crypto app by accident where other people might notice it and think that person has crypto.  I always heard people say you shouldn't even keep any crypto apps on your phone for safety reasons.  So in this situation, best thing to do? If that person had another spare phone or a laptop even, well that would be very simple.  Anyone have opinion on this?",

Even if we were talking about a newbie that newly just got their first few sats and are looking for the best time to sell their coins or are looking at their current balance due to lack of experience that would have been understandable but for someone that does not own anything to keep checking the price of bitcoin is somehow strange. If I’m to advice you or that person I’ll just say; whenever you’re in public space and you want to check the price of bitcoin make sure you reduce the brightness of your screen, when you do that it will be almost impossible for the people sitting close to you to see what you’re doing with your device… Another way will be to fix a privacy screen guard on the mobile device it works almost the same as “reducing the brightness” but in this instance you can increase the brightness of your device and your neighbors still won’t be able to see what you’re doing with your device.These are just simple steps that could help your no-coin friend check the price of bitcoin without being afraid of his surroundings.",

I only check the price of Bitcoin a couple of times in a week.QuoteSo I thought telling that person to delete their web search history each time on google chrome on their phone would work but this would be a huge hassle for someone not tech savyIf they can open the tab to check a website, they can delete that web search when they are done. They do not have to clear the entire search history.They can also have a separate browser to check the price, one they will not have to open in public for other searches.If they use Chrome regularly, they can download duckduckgo to only follow the market price at home.Quoteand since that person isn't tech savy, I would have to write the bitstamp website on paper for them to leave at home and they type it every single time on their iphoneThis still begs the question as to why they are so interested in checking the price.",

We can freely use Coinmarketcap to easily look the price of possibly if you have a Binance app you can as well monitor price of bitcoin without having to pass through those rigorous ways. However, i won't encourage anyone to visit market or even have to start looking at their holdings in their wallet this attracts evil eyes because you don't know if the person next to you in taxi is also a guru tech or have knowledge about bitcoin he might use his or her phone to start recording what you are doing and if mistakenly you reveal seedphrase or private keys his camera got all thing recorded and you won't know someone out there in the bus already snipped your details secretly.

You can check the price of cryptocurrencies in your home or workplace where it will be kept secret. Checking the price in public could be dangerous because you are unconsciously telling people that you have cryptocurrencies even if you don't own any. And in some locations, cryptocurrency owners are seen as very rich people. In this case, you might be attracting criminals to yourself and family members. QuoteIf that person had another spare phone or a laptop even, well that would be very simple.  Using an unused phone just to view cryptocurrency prices is a waste of time. You can easily check Bitcoin prices on any platform with ease. You should be thinking of how to use these old devices to set up an air-gapped wallet if you don't own a hardware wallet. QuoteAnyone have opinion on this?  You might have a good idea of what you want to communicate to the community but you lack the skills to coordinate your thoughts and express them in an understandable manner. I suggest you reduce you writing and present you thoughts sequentially.",

Reading your post was so boring that I imagined if i was reading a novel. If your aim was to earn merit then you should consider improving your writing skills Why should someone who doesn't even own coins worry so much? There's no reason to constantly monitor the price of bitcoin if you don't own any. It truly baffles me when people take excessive precautions, like discreetly checking bitstamp and wiping browser history, when they have nothing to protect. I now know that the only people who continually monitor the market price to see how much their investment is moving are those who own coins.

I'm not familiar with Bitstamp, but monitoring bitcoin price is simple nowadays, and there are many apps you can use to do so, such as Coin Gecko, coin market cap, and even some crypto exchange apps like Binance and Kucoin, where you don't need an account to monitor bitcoin price because it's displayed on their homepage. If you are concerned about privacy, and your friend uses a mobile phone, you can easily adjust the brightness of the screen, which works very well, and you may also put a privacy screen guard, which makes it almost impossible for people around you to see through your screen.",

Now if the issue is that you don't want to save any crypto applications on your cellphone for security reasons, I think that might be true because all your data is stored online, including emails and passwords.The difference is that if you enter the application manually it may be safe and after using it always press the exit button from the application then enter again manually at a later time in my opinion it is very possible.",
