If they're so big and powerful, then nobody can force them, right?Plus, if they get badly hacked (i.e. somebody from inside gets to steal the keys of the cold storage), they get so badly fucked they will have no chance to reimburse.Plus, you don't know if they are working on real funds or have ongoing debts and/or leverage (like FTX had to look bigger than they are).So better keep at any exchange only the bare minimum for your needs and never forget the \"not your keys, not your coins\" mantra.

You can join their staking program. Although they are not staking all coins but at least you can buy those stakeable coins and lock them up for allowed time to have some additional percentage of your worth. You can stake for 10days, 30days, 60days or 120days. Many people are benefiting from this and you can try it if you wish to",

If so how to get binance shares ?I think binance is a little smaller than the names that you mentioned because they are already there before crypto came and crypto adoption is not totally wide. It does not mean that you aren't smart if you aren't involved in crypto but those who got involved in crypto either want easy profits and doesn't like the idea of local currencies.Binance is trusted but it is centralized and we crypto users are advised to not totally rely on them or store money on them for a long time especially if you are not using it. Some cant trust binance but it doesn't automatically mean that they don't trust governments and banks. It will still depends. Maybe they won't, if they are corrupt and doesn't do their duties well.",

However, it can't be used to judge the exchange net worth because CMC data says a $76 billion daily trading volume was executed on the Binance exchange as of August 2022.Nevertheless, saying Binance is bigger than the Banks is naive but i will agree with this if we're talking about innovation.Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 08, 2022, 05:09:17 PMAnd bigger then goverments.This is another naive statement that I believe CZ himself will never agree with. Ask yourself if Binance is bigger than the government why did CZ submit to the UK and US government crypto rules and regulations?

I think you don't understand that Binance was not owned by CZ alone and the exchange started it journey through ICO which they also hold a bounty campaign on this forum.Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 08, 2022, 05:09:17 PM I trust all my money to binance more then banks when there IS economy problems and bank runs that banks closing down but it can never happening with binance.That's why binance always will reinburse losses in crypto.I wait when binance will start refund atleast some money If i lose on futures trading or paying money for most Active future traders.But where i can buy shares of binance stock ?
