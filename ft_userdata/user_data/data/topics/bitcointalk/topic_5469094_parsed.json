      "body": "If your miner is running you can see its hashing on the miner's dashboard you might be just excited to see your real-time hashrate on the pool you need to wait for a while before you can see the real-time hashrate on the pool.Can you mention here what pool do you mine? You can switch to another pool to try.",

      "body": "As already mentioned it would be helpful to get some more details.Some classic troubleshooting would be to restart the miner and check the connections (make sure that all cables for data connection and power are plugged in).Check the version of the firmware or u might wanna reset the miner configuration to the factory settings?",
