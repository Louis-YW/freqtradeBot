Also I don't foresee a reduction in this numbers of money laundering using cryptocurrency. The NFT market has given an entirely new route for such non sense. But can we blame the money itself for such things?The answe is no! Money laundering has been happening since ages. Criminals will always keep on doing their thing but does that make the money dirty? Such crimes has nothing to do with bitcoin. It's just a acceptable medium of exchange. Take it that way!",

That crime took place within a banking system that is compliant with what's supposed to be tough AML measures. Money laundering happens everywhere using all kinds of means. Money is being laundered in casinos. Money is laundered through real estate, through artworks, even through stocks, and others.But the point is that Bitcoin dwarfs in comparison to how much money laundering happens in the fiat system.",

No further details are given but it would be interesting to know if one of the coins used was Monero. I also don't see if they used a DEX or a CEX, it would be interesting to know. Quote from: jackg on August 17, 2022, 03:29:35 PMThis makes me wonder if crypto is easier to track than using fiat to move the funds around.If they withdrew cash and transported it via car from France to Israel, they'd only really risk being found at the initial withdraw step (and if they can hide their identity well for that bit, they probably wouldn't be recognised the rest of the way) - the money could then be laundered by more tried and tested measures to ensure it looks like they acquired it a legit way. It is a fantasy what you have written. How could they withdraw millions from a French bank? There is currently a €1k cash payment limit in France, so to withdraw millions from a bank they would have to have filled out a bunch of AML paperwork, and I don't think that would be done by someone who is trying to launder money. In the unlikely event that they could have taken out those millions in bank bills, driving from France to Israel, they probably wouldn't have been stopped in EU territory, but if they had, they would have had a lot of explaining to do, otherwise they could have been preventively seized the money. But at the EU border, they would have had to declare the money, otherwise it could have been seized, and, again, I don't think that declaring the money would be done by someone who is trying to launder it:EU Cash Controls\"As part of the EU’s efforts to tackle money laundering and the financing of terrorism, all travellers entering or leaving EU territory are already obliged to complete a cash declaration when carrying EUR 10 000 or more (or equivalent in other currencies, bonds, shares or travellers’ cheques). Customs authorities are empowered to check persons, their luggage and their means of transport. They are also empowered to detain undeclared cash.\"I imagine you don't live in the EU or don't know how things are there.",
