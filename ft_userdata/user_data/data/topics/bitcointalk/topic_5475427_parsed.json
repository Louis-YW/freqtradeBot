I was thinking about the fact that, besides, the wallet doesn't need your location unless you are using a CEX or any other centralised means of storing crypto. That's when you could experience some issues as a result of a change of location login from a different IP, and there is also no point in doing that as anyone who wants to track you in CEX can use the provided documents to do that.",

There won't be any issue, VPN will help you to improve your privacy. If you decide to use wallets like Electrum that are connected to other nodes, keep in mind that there is a chance, when you make a transaction, nodes that you are connected to might get your IP address and will be able to see transactions sent by your IP. That's why it's better to use VPN or connect to Tor when you use wallets like Electrum.",

Some tutorial would be of great help, or maybe it would be better if you advised him to try the Sparrow wallet which has Tor built in, which is in any case a much simpler option than configuring Electrum with Tor. Even if OP creates a new non-custodial wallet and uses VPN or Tor from the beginning, and sends his BTC from the online wallet he currently uses, there is still a possibility that someone will link those coins to his identity if he has ever used KYC anywhere in to the process of buying/keeping those same coins. Of course, there is always a way to break that link, you just need to know what the mixer is for",

The most popular open source wallet you will see for multi coins is the unstoppable wallet but it also has limited number of coins although it is updated regularly. So for large number of coins you will have to go for open source hardware wallets. The likes of mycelium and MetaMask are other options but just like TrustWallet they are closed source even though they claimed to open source.",

I know I am not that techy but I have got to ask, is there / will there be a security issue when handling such transactions? Using a VPN will not effect the safety of your coins, unless the VPN itself is unsafe. You'd have to be using a pretty obscure VPN for that to be the case though. I would recommend focusing on your system security. If you are not entirely sure if a VPN will effect your security or not, then this does raise concerns about whether or not your system is safe, or if things that seem safe (like system \"cleaners\" or \"anti viruses\") that actually aren't are existent. If you're using Windows, please be safe. It is generally an unsafe operating system and it is most-targeted by attackers. Look into Linux and getting to know this OS if you aren't already. Paper storage, encrypted external storage or cold wallets are your safest bet for wallet solutions. Only keep a minimal amount of \"spending\" coins on a wallet that connects to the internet from your computer, especially if it does turn out that you're using Windows. Stay safe!",

When you are using a decentralized noncustodial wallet, then even if you use VPN, there will be no problem. The problem only comes when you are using a centralized wallet or exchange and if that exchange has some locations as prohibited and if your VPN connects to that location, the service provider may feel that you are accessing from a banned location and therefore may restrict your account.Quote from: Sinzu_ on November 25, 2023, 05:01:14 PMQuote from: OmegaStarScream on November 25, 2023, 03:59:05 PMQuote from: Sinzu_ on November 25, 2023, 03:56:59 PMHow do I know if my wallet is a noncustodial wallet?Does it give you access to your private keys, and seedphrase and let you export them? or does it require you to have an email, phone number, etc., and in some cases maybe to even verify your identity?
