Besides, I don't think there is a coin with volume 0 in the spot market, it will be delisted by the exchange. If there is no buying interest, who will you trade with?Quote from: ATUK22 on October 12, 2022, 08:21:14 AMHow do you find the perfect coin/token to perform a pump and dump? what your criteria?meme coins",

Don't forget that there will be people or even bots that will put the price near the buy and sell orders.But to know which is the impending pump and discharge of the coin will be difficult because we will not know unless we set the alarm for all the coins and if a large deposit comes to the exchange wallet, it will probably be the pump.",

This way only makes you lose your money faster. Only a very small chance to gain profits from this way, while we put our money on too risky coins/tokens.

But not only meme coins, but fundamental coins also have pump-dump schemes. That's the way of the whales gain profits from creating the hype. Sometimes, they have armies to spread FUDs or issues.

This act is risky but maybe the op is willing to try it. If he got lucky and others will noticed and bite with it then maybe he can make more? High volume coins are hard to manipulate so I don't think he can do it with a small capital but he can be a small fish instead and ride its waves. He will only need to be careful and always timed his moves so that he won't get caught out in the dip.In crypto, we still have those less risky coins which are not a pump and dump. There is less pressure when investing on them and they are also perfect for those who have a small amount of money. We can always go on them.",

They don't have a good trading volume but pump just to attract investors.For me, only potential coins with good reputations are reliable and trusted. There are fake pumps that only tempt crypto users to invest but we have to get rid of these fake projects as much as possible. Continuous research will always be the key.",

A coin don't really need high volume before you invest to dump but a good trading volume and in more exchanges. The important side to pump and dump coin is to invest early and dump early on higher profit because it is like ponzi, the early you come the better for you  Quote from: ATUK22 on October 12, 2022, 08:21:14 AMHow do you find the perfect coin/token to perform a pump and dump? what your criteria?The use of the coin can be used to know if it will pump and not only that the team, exchange listed the coin and number of community but if you join the telegram of the project you can know if people are buying much. It is also for your own knowledge to decide to dump if the price is flying very fast, team don't tell you in the telegram group that you have to dump",

Just curious  I think OP had some background about these coins getting pumped and dump for a period of time or he might have accidentally invested a pump and coin and earned a good profit. Perhaps he got some ideas by reading some of the thread here since altcoin will always be a good place for a pump and dump coins but the hardest part is to find a coin that would pump and dump and that's probably a lot of buy order. But based from what he was doing it looks like he wants to cause a pump and dump to a certain coin.",

I don't think that would be a great idea when it comes investing, because that's the most important especially here in crypto world because of the mannerism of the marke as well that so volatile.
