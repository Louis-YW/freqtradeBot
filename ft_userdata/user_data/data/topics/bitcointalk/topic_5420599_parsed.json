  "content": "Update: I think OWL.games cheated me anyway,I have even more proof.. Their compensation for me was not even 10% of total win.A contract was signed in which I undertook not to disclose the terms of the contract.However, next day I immediately consulted a lawyer (unfortunately, contract was already signed) and immediately informed OWL.games that I wanted to terminate their contract and would immediately transfer all their compensation back.Why was the contract signed? I waited longer than 13 days for my winnings and I didn't expect to get anything back, so ...Official answer from bgaming where they specify the maximum deadlines for reports - https://ibb.co/t4X0xqcI understand that by continuing this thread I risk legal action. I am ready, I have enough proof that OWL.games is deliberately cheating their customers.A little later, I will provide more evidence.",

After you win? After you withdraw? Or what.I guess you should give them at least 5 days before the review of your KYC.Some tips when winning large amount. Withdraw it little by little so their system wont trigger when doing large amounts.",

From the way the owl games rep answered you, it doesn't look good for your case. 97% win rate lol. Of course it will need verified from the provider but again, doesn't look good. In order for the community to help or get on your side, you need a believable story. I'm not guaranteeing you are lying but it looks super fishy and if the casino will not pay unless the provider says its legit wins. So your line of \" If Owl.games withdraw my win - it will have good advertising,If not, there will be strong anti-advertising and legal problems. is total shit.",
