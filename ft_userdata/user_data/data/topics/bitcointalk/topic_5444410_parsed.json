  "content": "The skeptical me is beginning to speculate that there is a coordinated attack against the cryptospace. Within 7 days we witnessed what was assumed a market dump of 49,000 coins by the American government, a fud on Binance, rumor that the SEC are sending wells notices to all Defi project founders located in the USA and presently New York AG vs. Kucoin. This is very head shaking. The market appears to have been okay, however. The New York Attorney General's office today filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin for allegedly violating securities and commodities laws in the state.The NYAG's lawsuit targets KuCoin for allegedly “falsely representing itself as an exchange” when really it is a “securities and commodities broker-dealer.” It aims to block access to the exchange in New York by forcing KuCoin to geo-fence its website based on IP addresses and GPS location.Read in full https://decrypt.co/123102/new-york-attorney-general-kucoin-ethereum-security",

This is not the first time, but know that those centralized platforms are causing the attack. What is centralized can be controlled, the more decentralized things are, the lesser the control can be. Quote from: bbc.reporter on March 11, 2023, 01:56:35 AMThe market appears to have been okay, however.Did you check the market ever since that has been reported? The market have crashed very well to the extent that bitcoin dumped below $20000. Bitcoin is even still better, altcoins dumped most and massively.Quote from: bbc.reporter on March 11, 2023, 01:56:35 AMThe NYAG's lawsuit targets KuCoin for allegedly “falsely representing itself as an exchange” when really it is a “securities and commodities broker-dealer.” It aims to block access to the exchange in New York by forcing KuCoin to geo-fence its website based on IP addresses and GPS location.That won't be a problem and I do not see it as a downfall for Kucoin, US do not accept foreign exchanges, Kucoin should stop doing that.",

I am sorry if I did not make the post quite clear for you. I will try to create a clearer one next time. What I was trying to tell everyone was the recent bad news we were reading, the rumors of wells notices and the 49k coins of bitcoin deposits to Coinbase made by wallets controlled by the American government, assumed for dumping, have been appearing like something coordinated to bring the price down. It was not organic selling.",

Entire journey from going to returning should only take a few hours max assuming there are no traffic jams.",

It did not occur as speculated, however. What really occurred was New York was only isolated from the cryptospace and it appears that the Biden administration also wants to isolate the whole country.This is head shaking because much of the protocols that are being created in the cryptospace Defi category have the quality of avoiding regulations hehe.",

Surely, KuCoin's market is not solely dependent on New York.Being one of the top centralized exchanges in the industry they can still do better without New Yorkers they have the data and if NewYork is not their biggest market then they have to let it go, I'm sure the majority of investors are trading on Kucoin, they can always find a new market to explore  QuoteOn the other hand, is there an official pronouncement or directive from the SEC that Ethereum, among others, is to be classified as securities?
