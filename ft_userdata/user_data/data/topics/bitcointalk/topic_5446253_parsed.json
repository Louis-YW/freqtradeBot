One required me to sign up, which I found inconvenient. One didn't bear any result, as in the company name didn't match any from their database.

Unfortunately I haven't get any chance to check the green SSL certificate before as I was too focused on the company registration certificate. But alas, when I tried to do it today, what I found shocked me:  Care to explain? Or should I go directly to the scam accusation?archived down page",
