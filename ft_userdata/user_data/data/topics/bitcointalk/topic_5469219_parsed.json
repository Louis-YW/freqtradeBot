  "content": "After we saw the SlapFight Championship which had a lot of buzz on social media and also raised concerns about the safety of fighters or in a better term: slappers, it was a known topic of discussion between both supporters and others against it. Today, while I was surfing and watching some videos I came across a video of pillow fighting between two tough guys in a ring the thing that made me search for more information. Surprisingly, I found out that they also have a championship and there's already the first professional international pillow fighting sports association which means it’s officially a sport.I don't see it as bad as slapping but it might be a bit boring for us to watch because it seems nearly impossible to knock your opponent out or for judges to determine a winner unless they decide to put rocks inside the pillows (just kidding).What are your thoughts on this new sport, Do you think we might see it in sportsbooks anytime soon?",

As it is we don't know they are using the pillow to fight even the slap fight I have not heard of it. So I will advise to link the stories. I am curiously to see the images and the link to read more. And I don't think it is an international fight and if it was an international sport, international sport channels and international news stations would have broadcast it.I believed it is a regional game. Pillow fight and slap fight, I will not even light to watch it because it would not be interested and it will be too brutal.",

      "body": "To be honest this is the first time I heard of big league for pillow fighting and I don't really believe that they already have an international pillow fighting sports association because pillow fighting like this is usually only done at certain events or small events and only.Just tried looking at pillow fights on YouTube and couldn't find any big events such as national or even international leagues and what was presented was only children competitions held in the middle of rice fields.Provide little clarity on where the league is and there is at least little source link here that we can visit to see the league.But if you think about pillow fighting it actually won't harm the players because all the equipment has been provided by the organizers and it impossible for stones to be deliberately inserted into the pillow.This will also provide new interest and can be participated in by all groups and it will be safer than the sport of slapping which has been popular for some time.",

I have not heard such a sport to gamble, who would have lose to a pillow fight when all you need to do is swing your arm with a soft stuff. After watching a single fight of it, I'm not sure how can you win with that but I definitely knew that it was not an ordinary pillow they are holding to fight, there's something inside that isn't so soft to keep your enemy dodging your swings. I guess it's a foul when you try to knock your enemy using your other hand   it is so fun to watch actually",

Would you even bet if the bookies are going to list this on their sports? I did search this on youtube years ago and somehow enjoyed laughing. I'm sure this is one of the sports the women would want to participate in. However they may classify this sport is, is for them to figure out.",

Moreover,  we need to visit the various videos and make an analysis of some of the other features of this game and to see if all its aspect and participation follows a guideline to make Pillow Fight an international champion game.",

Such kind of game will sound odd to most of us. But to think that there are other local sports which are not being listed with gambling sites, should be enough to tell that not all sports would be. Same with e-sports wherein there are other arcade games, perhaps, but only Teklen and Streetfighter are being talked about and gambled of. Pillow fight as a sport might have people be amazed of it and curious at first but in the long run eventually we’d bore out. Its popularity and size of community would matter ‘coz it is where such kind of game will be determined to whether be put and considered with online platforms or not. For sure there’ll be more to arise even if they are long existing already in this industry.",

Now its not really shocking that people would really be always having to say and its not really that shocking anymore. Scoring through hits or making points is a common sensething if we do speak about on how to win the game or sport. I havent seen this one though but since you had mentioned it out then i might be making some search first and sees on how the game though having some mechanics and on just hearing out then i must admit that it is really that a pretty boring game or something not that interesting. Frankly speaking, i would really be better to get entertained on watching those slapping big dudes rather than on a girly pillow fight.",

So here's some link on how it looks like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbBOgQnp9Mhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FG4HO_jv7QSo watching out the video did really make me chuckle. What the heck this sports which using up a boxing ring and having those typical MMA movements but handling out a pillow aiming for the head but are those things do actually make someone that to be knocked down?On thing i had observed too that seeing on the crowd on which there are really lots of people who do watch this one which meansthat demand and recognition about this sport is real. hahaha",

The game is like wrestling so at that there may be some form of physical threat and injuries here and there that we may need to look into properly to be able to understand what comes along with this game.",

Because usually at my place sports competitions like this are only held on certain days and are held in the pool, not in the ring. but in my opinion, even though this type of sport is of international class, it will not be in sportsbooks because it seems like this sport is not interesting to watch. And at my place this sport is special because it is only held once a year and it is held over a pool so when a player falls it becomes a source of laughter because he gets soaked. And I was more interested in watching MMA than watching this pillow fight, even though the news spread that some of them were former MMA fighters who took part in this game.",

Sitting over it both keeps beating same as what we see with the slapping tournament on consecutive order. One who miss the balance and falls into the water will be loser.
