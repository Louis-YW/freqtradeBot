Shoot me a PM so that we can arrange everything. I will not go first on this deal so which means that you will pay me first for the premium cost plus the fee(whatever you feel comfortable) before I will process the premium.",

Purchases can be made through anyone's account or (as I recall) you just need to send a link to the invoice.Quote from: Eternad on September 02, 2023, 02:29:14 PMAlso, I just want to let you know that I will remove my paypal account on the payment option the moment I successfully purchased you the premium account to avoid being automatically deducted of the monthly subscription.

Shoot me a PM so that we can arrange everything. I hope you will be careful and that you know all the repercussions of such an action. In my opinion, it is better to use your envato account to buy the item than to put your PayPal information into someone else's account and having them manage the transaction on your behalf.",
