All payments are received on wallets that you manage (you own the private keys) and merchants get a custodial wallet service from you.

Right?The merchants have to trust any which ways .. even banks ,,, though they can transfer funds to any wallet where they want , bitcoin transfers was never a challenge for anyone unlike alt coin transfers.. moreover the basic intent is not to invest ..but to earn .. so merchants can start  anywhere from possibly any lowest amount and eventually grow...",

This is a pretty big deal, since credit card companies charge merchants around 2-3% in order to run their transactions, and as you can imagine, small businesses with tight margins often have difficulty making this extra cost up in price savings. But perhaps the most compelling reason that businesses should start accepting cryptocurrency payments is so they do not have to rely on third-party payment providers. Instead of relying on companies like Visa and Mastercard, merchants can cut out the middleman and process payments directly with their customers. This not only saves them money but also gives them complete control over their business' security. But if a business accepts cryptocurrency through a third-party custodial wallet service, they are still at the mercy of that company. This means that if something goes wrong with the security of their crypto wallet, or the company goes out of business, it could affect their business as well.",
