After that will hold till new ATH and start selling after reaching double from last high which is approx $1,40,000  but this is my simple and long process. I want to learn short term trading which can be done with price action along with fib tool. Thanks for your valuable suggestion.",

Well, I don't have any instructions video or books to give to you but I will advise you to return back to your long term trading which is more favourable than short term trading because many successful traders in the community today used that method to achieved what they have today. If you can carry out your personal research to know what is about to happen to long term traders soon, I think you will maintain the long term trading.",

If you still have questions and a desire to read, you can ask them at https://www.google.com/Unfortunately,YouTube videos are overly optimistic or are not specifically dedicated to Bitcoin, it is better to listen to several channels before starting trading, and using Fibonacci alone does not guarantee that you will get good results because it is an indicator and it is used with several indicators before making a decision to buy or sell, so without Knowing technical analysis indicators and support and resistance levels, you will not be able to make the right decision from a single trading indicator.trading cryptocurrencies is completely different from trading in the stock market, as with time you know when the indicators are a good measure for trading, when the price of 200-Week MA was broken, it was an excellent opportunity to buy for everyone who is good at technical analysis.As a beginner, the best advice is to learn, stay away from short-term trading, and use DCA if you do not know how to make a decision.",

I'm attempting to investigate and learn about it.This is not true because no indicator or indicators are better than others but it depends on our understanding on them, how fulfill we are from how they make us feel and the profit we make from them as against others. IMO I prefer price action than Fibonacci. Fibonacci is more of a biase indicator that you only draw based on your trading subjectivity and what you feel with the market but most times it doesn't come that way and you need to draw another chasing the price chart.Quote from: RajeshKarwa on June 15, 2023, 05:44:56 PMCan someone suggest a good instructional video or book to help me learn both?  Thank you!!   No matter the spectacular kind of video you watch, you need your own training by yourself to help you better understand what you are trading. You don't need to ask for such video because no one is better than others, you can only use them for learning process or learning sake. Therefore, you can search on Google.",

Can someone suggest a good instructional video or book to help me learn both?  Thank you!!   If you are a day trader or a scalper, you are a short-term trader. Both are difficult to accomplish because your position will be on for minutes to several hours. This is extremely risky because a minor percentage increase in price will gain you a lot in a matter of minutes or hours also if the price decreases. If you want to be successful with something, don't just blindly accept what others teach you. If that strategy works for him, it may not necessarily work for you since we have different market execution even though we have the same strategy. That is, before funding the account, you must back test the strategy numerous times to ensure that it truly works for you.",

Can someone suggest a good instructional video or book to help me learn both?  Thank you!!   Success rate depends on the user of that indicator because we have different placement of the indicator based on the time frame we are using. Saying that it is the most successful method on trading is debatable. It’s really the most popular indicator on short term trading because you can determine the price support and the movement of the price properly but this does not guarantee your successful because timing to enter is still the key to success because there is always a time that the price breaks all the support set by the Fibonacci if there is a strong trend. I suggest to combine it with chart patterns so that you will have a general overview on what will be the outcome of the price in general.",

I'm attempting to investigate and learn about it.To start with, Price Action (PA) isn't an indicator. It's just you viewing price movement in relation to candle patterns and guessing where it heads to. In essence, PA is trading handsfree. As for Fibs, I used that a lot when I began trading but along the line I realized there's no perfect way to draw it. It was more of guessing as it could be plotted or drawn from any top or bottom. By that I mean, top/bottom of 1hr, 4hrs, daily or weekly etc could be used and they give different vibes. For me, anything that's not near clarity in trading is second guessing and that's gambling. May be there are better ways to look at Fibs than I do and I wouldn't mind to have opinions on that. This day, I'm more confident relying on pivots, trendlines and S&R than any other indis.",

I would suggest you to keep on functioning long-term trades that demand patience and time, as long as they produce massive gains; there is no better way to catch up trading than with a well-planned strategy. Short-term trades do not always end well; one can experience daily losses when the market fluctuates; this is primarily due to the market's state, rather than the trader's technique. Long-term trading is solid; we trade based on the current market environment. It's nothing unusual to see the market disintegrate during the bear season; we're all used to it.",
