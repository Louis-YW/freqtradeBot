  "content": "QuoteClimate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act put the U.S. back on track toward significant emissions reductions, potentially reducing greenhouse gas output by 40% of 2005 levels.But one miner warned that when it comes to the transportation sector, domestic resources for lithium, the most critical mineral used for electric vehicle production, may not be sufficient enough to meet some of the most ambitious targets. The Biden administration, for instance, aims to slash the sale of gas-powered vehicles to 50% of all new purchases by 2030.“Yes, we’ll [eventually] have enough, but not by that time,” Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium (PLL), said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “There’s going to be a real crunch to get the material. We don’t have enough in the world to turn that much [lithium] production in the world by 2035.\"With the average electric car battery requiring roughly 8-10kg of the metal, lithium remains a crucial material in the transition to emission-free vehicles. Growing demand has caused the price of lithium carbonate to nearly double this year alone, and the IEA projects demand to grow by 40 times in the next two decades, with a majority of that supply coming from outside of the U.S.That has complicated climate targets set by the Biden administration. The president has called for half of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric, setting aside billions of dollars in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to incentivize drivers to make the shift.But those same tax credits come with requirements calling for parts and components to be largely sourced in North America, leading some EV makers to push back against the goals on the grounds that they are not realistic.Piedmont Lithium is looking to cash in on the demand, as one of only a handful of U.S.-based lithium miners. On Thursday, the mining company announced plans to open a lithium processing operation in Tennessee, with construction set to begin in 2023.Once fully operational, the plant will process 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year. The company is also planning another plant in North Carolina, which will allow the firm to supply lithium for 1 million electric vehicles per year.“The world has changed,” Phillips said. “We're now in an era where everyone's going to want an electric car. The car companies can't make them fast enough, and people are now looking for the lithium they need for the batteries to go in those electric cars.”While carmakers like General Motors (GM) have rushed to secure partnerships with domestic mining operations in anticipation of the demand, the Albemarle (ALB) Silver Peak mine in Nevada remains the only operational lithium mine with meaningful output.Phillips said a slow permitting process has stalled approvals for new production sites. Meanwhile, China has continued to dominate the industry, refining more than half of all lithium supply while Australia and Chile remain the largest producers in the world.“Projects get permitted [in Australia] in under a year,” Phillips explained. “Here, it's two, four, six, seven, eight years, which is a problem, especially in a business that's booming so fast.”The White House has moved to accelerate the process by invoking the Defense Production Act to bolster the production of minerals critical to EV manufacturing, including lithium and cobalt. The IRA also established the Advanced Production Investment Tax Credit for domestic production.But with the demand for EVs far outpacing supply and new mining operations working within a five- to 10-year timeline before coming online, Phillips said that, as it stands, the U.S. cannot meet its clean energy targets with the domestic sourcing priority.“Energy security is a national issue,” Phillips said. “I think you'll see companies that are thinking about battery plants in different parts of the world or lithium conversion plants coming to America because this investment tax credit will be very valuable…The market opportunity is huge.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-supply-ev-targets-miner-181513161.html....Many years ago back in 2014, it was announced that afghanistan might hold more than $1 trillion dollars worth of rare earth minerals as well as large lithium deposits.QuoteRare Earth: Afghanistan Sits on $1 Trillion in MineralsThe aerial surveys determined that Afghanistan may hold 60 million tons of copper, 2.2 billion tons of iron ore, 1.4 million tons of rare earth elements such as lanthanum, cerium and neodymium, and lodes of aluminum, gold, silver, zinc, mercury and lithium. For instance, the Khanneshin carbonatite deposit in Afghanistan's Helmand province is valued at $89 billion, full as it is with rare earth elements.https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/rare-earth-afghanistan-sits-1-trillion-minerals-n196861I'm not certain how many survey sites they include in their estimates.But if demand trends high enough. I would guess a way could be found to untap reserves there. If only due to the surging demand and opportunities it would create on a global scale.",

Because if they are close like with Putin then China will have it all if invading Taiwan will be uncontested. But it's just wrong to push EVs to everyone now the fact that it's expensive while you have a limited place to go. I don't really see why they chose to develop EVs when they could make hydro-powered cars and US will not have to go to Afghanistan again. The downside, however, is that South America which has unlimited water thru the Amazon river will be more developed same as the countries along Congo river. They'd be the front of the new world order.And check this news https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/california-heat-wave-flex-alert-ac-ev-charging.html",

And when the new generation of batteries will emerge, those may or may not use Lithium.So, again, I think it's more that PLL is trying to protect their business than anything else in that article.",

You honestly have a point there. There has never been a time America has 'helped' without an incentive and with Biden looking to scrap 50% of gas powered vehicles by 2030, he has barely 8 years to achieve such a plan and since they just have 6.8million tonnes, which is barely enough to make these EVs he definitely would look to Afghanistan.",

Maybe it works in theory, but I assume that possible problems will be revealed only with the intensive use of such batteries.

This will be a real problem if you continue to use this rather \"ancient\" technology. But the world does not stand still, and in recent years, a sufficient number of new elements have been discovered to build energy storages (batteries).For example:- Batteries based on silicon and sulfide can store much more energy than lithium-ion counterparts with graphite electrodes.- MIT has developed batteries from aluminum, sulfur and salt. They charge quickly, do not ignite and are not afraid of overheating.... and other developments that are easy to google. Yes, I understand that it will be in the form of industrial production in 2023, but in a couple of years, it should enter the market.Resource horror stories are just propaganda of suppliers or beneficiaries of the old technology. Remember how the world switched to diesel engines on ships - how many tantrums, loud statements and sabotage against diesel, in an attempt to save the need for coal. It will also be with lithium, gas, oil and other \"irreplaceable resources\"",
