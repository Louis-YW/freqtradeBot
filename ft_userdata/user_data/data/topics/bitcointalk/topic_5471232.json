Unfortunately, I got to know it late and decided to buy Bitcoin in 2021. When Did You Meet Bitcoin? how much was the price ? Well, that must be so regretful, but what we can do now, what happens is for good. I mean, the hack of MT GOX occurred in 2014 and you might become a victim of it, but you were saved, and of course, there could be many other possibilities like, you might be a billionaire now (depending on your investment). Well, overall, it is really sad, because, that time was a golden time. A few days back I was thinking the same, but I was thinking about 2009, like where I was in 2009 and what I was doing, then after remembering so much, I came to realize that I came to get access to the internet around 2013 or 2015 maybe. Not so sure, but in 2009 I was too young. Even I even talked to my cousin who used to be a software engineer, and he must have access to BTC, he said he with his friend made many BTC but now we don't know where those BTC went, and we don't have access to the drives and even did not kept the seed phrase save. Talking about my story, I came to know about BTC in 2018 when I got access to the internet, I joined so many online faucets and mining platforms, but made nothing, and after wasting around 2 months I left it by saying we could not earn BTC, unless we have some fan following. The rate of BTC at that time in local currency was around 8 Lac but now it is more than 80 lac.",

Would you like to see some forum users talk about the first time they heard of or bought bitcoin? You can refer to this interview thread as many have done interviews and there you will see how familiar they are with bitcoin.I don't think this thread is too important to ask when to meet bitcoin they have their own way and have their own capital to do it, there is no need to reveal it, if you want to know the truth then ask your friends who know bitcoin.",

You know, dude, what you did was demonstrate that this subject had been posed on this forum many times before. Your question is extremely typical; perhaps the following time you create a subject, there will be more sharing of knowledge with other communities on the forum site. I'm not saying your query is illogical.It's only that the newcomers who came here before you and joined the forum have already talked about it. Don't get upset or take it personally. Consider this to be a new thought or piece of information; I'm only trying to help you develop in the long run.",

Same to you somewhere around 2014-2015 when Bitcoin faucet and Ponzi is very popular. My classmate on college introduced to Bitcoin mining which is through cloud mining that turns into scam. Luckily, I only invest Bitcoin from my faucet earnings and the amount is not that huge so I easily get over to that scam.Despite my rough start on Bitcoin. I still manage to accumulate decent amount of Bitcoin through the use of faucet and paid to click sites even it’s just micro amount in fiat that time. My mother discouraged me to continue doing it because I’m wasting energy that time to run my computer just to earn small amount in fiat. My patience work when Bitcoin price first hit around 10K while I earn my Bitcoin when the price is still below 100$ each.",

      "body": "There are many threads already that are having similar topic or question like yours OP.But I started to know a bit about Bitcoin in early 2014. I only knew it as like any other stock in the market as what I have understood back then. I was a struggling freelancer during that time which I am financially broke and income isn’t stable that time.I thought back then that I should be buying 1 BTC, but I didn’t know that I can buy in fractions (satoshis) in which I have lack of education and understanding how Bitcoin works. It was just above $600 back then, but I cannot afford due to being broke.I ignored it for 3 1/2 years as I am focused on my work at home freelancing gigs and network marketing. I got into BTC again when it touched down $10k for the first time and that got me thinking on what if I did spare at least a few dollars to buy fractions of BTC back in 2014. Until now, I still regretted my decision back then of not buying but it is what it is.",

I know this is common thing to say by everyone that they missed the train at the right time, menh I bet you even though you were given the chances to buy at then you could have sold by now because I believe there were people who had the opportunity to buy at then and they did bought. But guess what?I can tell you that none of those people who had that chance to buy at then were holders till date, believe me or not most holders are of recent lemme say from 2019 or 2021 dip. This made me not to pay attention to anyone who come here lamenting on how they missed the train if they had the chances of filling up their bags. I will still tell you that you don't miss yet, there are more chances for you to bag more because judging from how the bitcoin halving works we can still say that we will experience more price surge come 2024 and the possibility for pice increase is about 75 percent so you can buy and hold.",

You were introduce to Bitcoin at 2014 as you say but you weren't interested only to buy it in 2021. I am just curious to know what made you decide to buy Bitcoin in 2021, because there was a bull run in 2017 when Bitcoin reached and all time high I would have thought you might have preferred to have bought then.To me I never saw Bitcoin as an investment opportunities thanks to the person that introduced me to Bitcoin and I wasn't all too concerned about the price of Bitcoin then. I was fascinated by the possibilities Bitcoin has over the traditional financial system and I think this mentality would give you more understanding and longevity in Bitcoin.",

Not until after 2020 after coronavirus that I was reintroduced into it and found out about this forum in early 2021. It has been an amazing journey and experience with the knowledge I have acquired so far about bitcoin.
