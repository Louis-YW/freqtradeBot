  "content": "The collapse of a big fish like FTX will lead to hundreds of other bankruptcies, the long-running TV series about FTX is just the beginning. Luna's death alone led to many crashes like 3AC, Celsius Network... and blew away 60 billion market capitalization. FTX is something much bigger, I have a feeling that the storm has just begun and we are not yet the center of the storm, the crash of FTX will be bigger than what Luna or Mt.gox ever caused.In just 3 days, information related to the collapse of FTX caused the market to evaporate 150 billion and I believe this number will increase when they are officially declared bankrupt under Chapter 11.The empire of FTX and the companies they associate with and invest in.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159Qjz1F9uyElsr8oIdNzCz-R_4dCAQgPbpvzR24AHbw/edit#gid=0134 companies filed for bankruptcy with FTXhttps://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1591086026327326720?fbclid=IwAR3w3Ah5zNKZuRkxaXq0__Lofv2OvfODUqcds96QFIKtZH9j4LhFHLqKdvI",

But that won't make the crypto market lose its strength to rise because these times will end and when people decide to exit the market, they will lose the moment to stay afloat and finally be able to get profitable again.Let it all reveal itself because this is like a purge from the crypto market of projects that are not good and just want to scam people who invest in crypto. We should wait for what will happen in the market and in the meantime, we can return to investing in bitcoin only, which will provide benefits in the future, rather than investing in altcoins that are trying to survive.",

Binance's decision is clearly making the crypto market boisterous and questioning what is going on.This statement will lead to potential and ongoing negative issues, which could occur for the bankruptcy that occurs against FTX and Alameda, in general the effect that occurs on FTX will affect and have bad pressure for other exchanges, like CoinDesk, Coinbase and others, as they are also one of the highest volume trading FTX tokens.",

Apart from exchange we can witness the dump in the cryptocurrency prices which may increase further but this isn't going to be the end of cryptocurrencies just another big lesson for all the users.",

The total number of Sol tokens purchased by FTX is 58 million and will be allocated from September 2021 to 2027 and will be unlocked monthly.Recently, lending platform BlockFi, after blocking withdrawals last week, is said to be preparing to file for bankruptcy as it relates to FTX and Genesis, a crypto brokerage firm that also just announced suspended withdrawals. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-brokerage-genesis-suspends-withdrawals-at-lending-arm-1.1847224Below is a list of companies that suffered significant losses after the collapse of FTX and I also believe the consequences will be more severe than what we see now.",

These will be stains that adversely affect the reputation of crypto, but if you compare crypto with stock or forex, we are still very young and very vulnerable is inevitable.
