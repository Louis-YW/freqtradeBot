It has a lot of negative reviews in almost all rating platforms. You had to search and check before using it with real money.Sorry for your loss. Unfortunetly, you have nothing to do and zero chance to get your money back. I hope you didn't lose a considerable amount of money.",

Did you ever invested on it?To bad you to fall for two times on a scam platform and this scam scheme is so classic where they promise  a to good to be true profit and then ask for money again so that their victim can withdraw the amount they wanted to get. Much better if you move on because no one can help you as those scammers for sure don't have plans to return your money.And next time don't believe on anyone who claims that they can help you and ask some amount as payment since they possibly scam you again for third time.",

First the taxes; second the taxes should be payed only by one account (a friend helped me); third the said that there was the suspect of laundering dirty money and they wanted 20000$ a warranty of my account.  I didn’t payed this amount. Ouch...Sounds a lot like a scammer trying to scam some extra money from their scam victim by trying to make them pay for \"taxes\", then for \"warrantee\", and if you'd pay that, i'm pretty sure they'll say you also have to pay to \"unlock your account\", and before they leave they'll make you pay a \"fine\". And once you've payed all that, they'll dissapear and they'll probably contact you using a different identity and offering you to help you find the scammers for a nominal fee.It's been said in this very thread: walk away... Every cent you give to these people is gone forever. Even if they offer to \"free\" all your money for a very small sum, they'll just keep that sum on top of everything they've taken from you.The only thing left to do, is contacting your local law enforcement (if possible). Odds are big they'll do nothing, but at least your complaint will be on file, and if they ever catch those scammers you might have a very, very small chance you'll get part of your money back.",

The platform is still working you can find it as --not listing a potentially fraudulent url--But if i read your posts correctly you DID invest with them, but when you wanted to withdraw they asked you for more money to pay for \"taxes\" (eventough they could have used  part of your money they already had), and you DID pay those \"taxes\".  Then they apparently still didn't want to release the funds (because you say your friend had to help you?) and now they're asking a ridiculous amount of money as a \"warranty\".Now ask yourself: why would they need cryptocurrency as a \"warranty\" to give you your own money back? There simply isn't any reason to do so... If they were legit, they would have taken the taxes from your money they already had access to, and maybe they'd force you to go trough a KYC procedure... There simply isn't any reason to ask for more money, cause this will prove nothing... What would they be doing? You give them $20k, they then proceed to give you your own money back and the $20k extra? Is having $20k a sign of honesty? For them, asking such an amount would prove nothing and it would solve nothing... The only thing it solves is their scam methodology.There are multiple red flags here:continuously asking for more money because they won't release your money if you don't pay them more money first (pro tip: if somebody asks you to pay money in order to get money, it's 99,9999% certain that it's a scam)domain is only 89 days oldhidden whois infoI can be wrong, but after looking at that site, it was pretty hard to navigate, the wording seemed strange to me, the proceeds seems relatively high... All in all, i'm pretty sure this is a scam. You're free to do whatever you want, but if it was my money, i'd go straight to the cops and i certainly wouldn't give those guys any more money.",

In the future, avoid no-one-has-ever-heard-of exchanges like this.Two things you may wanna check:1. if the loss is tax deductible, for instance see: https://koinly.io/guides/ (I'd consult a CPA to be extra sure)2. recovery chances are extremely low but another thing to try is to see if your coins went to a centralized exchange using a block explorer that tags known addresses e.g. oxt.me for bitcoin, etherscan.io for ETH - if the coins did, you would need to involve the authorities.",

Or at least, that's the feeling i get from your response.It's quite simple: you're responsible for your own finances. We all warned you about all the red flags and the typical scam behavior. If you value the layout of that site over our experience, you could always just ignore our warnings and proceed... There's nothing stopping you. The only thing you cannot expect is us condoning a site that exhibits many of the red flags of a typical scammer.Maybe you get lucky (and we got it wrong), but i seriously doubt it... All in all, there's nothing more to say...I wish you good luck, and i hope you won't lose any more money than you already did!",

Most of us aren't native english speakers, so sometimes things go wrong during translation As for getting your money back: i'm afraid crypto transactions are irreversible...Getting your money back will involve law enforcement. You can help them a little bit by tracking transactions and hoping they don't pass a mixer and end up on a KYC exchange, but your odds are very (very) slim i'm afraid.Anyways, i hope you get lucky.",

I think you're correct report on HongKong police since the website is using Chinese language, maybe the another option is Taiwan, I doubt it's China since they're ban all cryptocurrency related.
