How does it work, maybe I don't understand the essence of it correctly?I believe those are just mere sayings that did not actually work the way they sounded. Just like the statement \"Givers never lack,\" they are linked to religion and other sorts of beliefs. But when you want to put it in investment terms, we can say that the more money you invest in any particular investment, the higher the return you will receive. The more stock and shares you purchase in a company, the higher the return you should expect.Given your line of work and your kind of earning, I will advise you to follow what works for you. As you said, you have a stable income that you don't expect to get anything from anyone else other than your monthly or weekly pay job. In cases like this, you can minimize the amount you spend unnecessarily on things that you think will not add anything to you or are not that important to you.But it actually pays to be good to others. When you have enough to spare, you can actually give to others who are in need without needing anything in return in one way or another. I always believe such kindness actually returns to you in another way, even if it's not directly from the person or in the same way.",

It is not telling you to spend your money on the dumb stuff like alcohol or smoking. You should spend your money on the useful stuff. Maybe buy a book, get programming lessons, invest in something, travel to another country and have a vacation… Any of those actions is better than staying home and staring at your monitor. Saving money is a good thing but saving all of it is not healthy. I am pretty sure there is something out there you can buy to improve your skills.",

It's a biblical principle. Even in this principle, where one gives or sows is also important because not all \"soil\" is fertile. A man who cheerfully gives in the right direction or place will receive bountifully. This doesn't apply to giving foolishly. The way it works is that one spends on others who later return same good gesture in bigger measure to one.",

How does it work, maybe I don't understand the essence of it correctly?If you spend more, money gets circulated in the economy. But it doesn't have any relation with getting more money. Spending is directly related to the flow of money which increases demand in the market. Usually it is seen as a positive but such overspending by the mass leads to inflation. So there's a negative point as well. Everyone wants to become rich. That is possible through more than one streams of income. I often say to my colleagues that if you are less than 40 and only reliant on your salary income, then you are not using your time wisely.",

The preacher will tell you that when you give more you receive more rewards from the Creator or nature. This assumption is valid in the religious palace which is why most religious people give to the church and charity. But in the economic or business world, your ability to cut costs and save profit is the pathway to growth and prosperity. If you spend above your profit or income you will end up consuming your capital or end up in debt. Quote I spend enough money, but I have a fixed income, therefore I will not be able to get more.

Don't keep your savings in fiat because of inflation and the devaluation of some local currencies. Ensure you have targets or a saving plan. Immediately it gets to a certain amount use the funds to invest in a like bitcoin. It might be challenging now but you will benefit in the future.",

It won't just comeback to you nothing even if you spend that much because money won't be back to you if you do nothing.Yes, you don't understand the essence of it correctly.

You build from what you got, and by saving money you can mean several things. It can mean that you cut spendings, or that you store it in your bank or buy stocks, gold and bonds with the money you are saving. You just need to make sure that you save only as much as you can afford. It doesn't make sense not buying decent shoes or not investing in your health in order to save money. You still need to eat healthy and try to live fulfilling life. Otherwise your savings might not be enough to dig you from the hole you have put yourself into.",

You have to save and that savings of yours is the one that you'll use for investing. Look at the rich people, they have one in common and most of them are spending wisely their money through investing, stocks, gold, bonds and even in bitcoin and crypto. And if your salary isn't enough, look for a 2nd or 3rd job if you still can and from there you'll learn how to be wiser with your money because you've worked hard for it.",

We all have our own thoughts and can make decisions when it comes to investing.

Their assets may even grow consistently, even if they don't have a large sum of money to start with. As the saying goes, it's better to be wise and have $1000, than to be foolish and have $10,000.
