First, BlackRock's entry into the Bitcoin market through an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) can be considered as a step that could increase institutional adoption and give the digital currency greater legitimacy. In many cases, the entry of institutional players is often seen as a sign of progress and legitimacy for the asset.Second, with respect to decentralization concerns, it is important to remember that decentralization is one of the main pillars of Bitcoin. The blockchain on which Bitcoin is based is designed to ensure security, transparency, and broad participant involvement. While BlackRock's presence may have had some influence, the structure that the Bitcoin network has built can enable wider community participation to influence the direction of development and deal with challenges that may arise.Third, if any forks happen in the future, be it based on a BlackRock decision or some other reason, we need to view them as part of market evolution and growth. Forks do not necessarily signify conflict or failure, but are often the result of a difference of opinion and an exploration of innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In situations like these, the Bitcoin community has the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process and determine the desired direction.So, if you look at the long-term implications of BlackRock's entry into the Bitcoin market, they are still speculative and cannot be predicted with certainty.I still can't understand, if blackrock makes a fork with a higher ensuance of earnings for miners, they will go to the network that is more profitable, I hope I'm wrong, because that would end the fundamentals of bitcoin.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on June 17, 2023, 03:51:19 AMIsnt that an intiative that a huge firm are making their move to a more legit way where institutions might get attracted with it.

Well for me this a positive sign considering whats going on lately. BlackRock is a big firm and others even anon whales could notice its a bullish effect or not.I understand that there is a lot of fud, but I do not understand that a company will design the best for the network following the current objective of the network, it has the power to manipulate information and thus create a new narrative for a fork of its enterrsse, I do not see this BlackRock's entry as a breakthrough for cryptography, rather an attack on future network decentralization.",

Bitcoin's utility is a store of value now the world works with money involved with it. This people who are interacted with bitcoin for investment scheme can also have their freedom to do so. Well they are using bitcoin though as Satoshi wanted too. Anyone can use bitcoin for peer to peer transaction, if you are aiming for that then these huge people are included also on those Satoshi's goal whether they use bitcoin big or small. They may have agenda for themselves but that isnt out of control.",

I understand, but my biggest fear would not be these big companies themselves using Bitcoin for capital gains, and thus having the power to influence other users and miners to follow their fork. I could be completely wrong and doubting the miners, but it would be very naive to believe that the miners would stay in the main network just to reap a little reward, there would be no incentive from the network to protect it, and the block reward would not pay the expense of machine and energy. I think in this way that in the future the fork could harm the fundamentals of the Bitcoin network.",

I think this time Blackrock is somehow favoring Coinbase as its custodian, which was sued by Sec, and that will restore the reputation of that exchange. The market will change its shape if such news reports start appearing, and I have seen that with each good news the market finds its way for a pump. I don't think that it will ever be a nightmare because if an asset manager like Blackrock is interested into Bitcoin and is making its way to enter the crypto-market then that will be really good things for the market and for the miners. The market will continue growing because of such news, and the investors will gain more confidence to invest in Bitcoin. I hope things will improve further in the market, and we will soon be able to see another pump that would take price of BTC above $30k range. Let's hope for the best!",

Let's hope for the best!You're only thinking about the price of Bitcoin, not what a big fund manager can do to Bitcoin's fundamentals, manipulation by her, to be able to have a big influence on the crypto market. But without a doubt Bitcoin with this etf the market value will explode, what makes me worried is BlackRock's influence on the market, the essence of bitcoin is decentralization, and not being censored the same as happened with the eth mix. Anyway, I'm behind on this big change, but let's see how the network will reorganize itself in the future.",

All the institutions in wallstreet going for BTC EFT OF Blackrock will realy destroy crypto or they could end up like BTC CASH?Yes, I also think about this possibility, even if it happens I have my belief, then I dissolve btcblack and play for the normal bitcoin network, there is the doubt will the network win? or go to the side that has more consistency? or do we lose computational power? Even so, I continue with my thoughts, encryption will not make more sense to me if it continues on a centralized network.",
