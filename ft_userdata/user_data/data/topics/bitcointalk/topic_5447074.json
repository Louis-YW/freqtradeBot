  "content": "Do you all consider Bitcoin the best asset in the world or do you think there are other assets with as much potential for safe long term appreciation?By best asset I mean potential for long term return on investment versus potential for risk. Return vs risk.Just curious to see what people think.Personally I think Bitcoin is easily the best asset in the world. Ethereum is probably the second best asset in the world but it is far riskier due to centralization and lack of clear purpose or utility and lots of possible future competition form other L1s and I think its days of growing significantly faster in price appreciation than Bitcoin are mostly over so the growth possibilities compared to the much greater risk I think leaves it far below Bitcoin when considering which is a better financial asset. I guess the one benefit it now has is income through staking but that isn't nearly enough to make up for the other disadvantages.And beyond that I can't think of anything else that would even be in the conversation for best asset outside of like owning a really good rental property in a booming city but that is very specific and requires good financing and a fair bit of luck and work to accomplish.Think of it this way, if you had to put all your money in a single asset, would you put it in anything but Bitcoin? I already made that decision years ago by putting just about all my money in Bitcoin. But how about you all? Where do you land on this question?",

The worst case scenario is that Bitcoin is overpriced and it will return to previous levels because that's its objective value. Real estate is a good answer. But to play devil's advocate here, the caveat there is all real estate is different. A piece of desert in the middle of nowhere is very different than prime real estate in a city. The good pieces of real estate are much harder to get though. Bitcoin is fungible so its much simpler to invest in Bitcoin. Also physical changes over time can change the value of real estate. If a fire destroys a house, or a food destroys a whole section of a city, suddenly that real estate is worth a lot less. Or even if a house just needs lots of repairs suddenly its worth a whole lot less. Or if crime goes up in an area the real estate is going to be worth less. That's part of the risk built into real estate investments.Which is why I said a contender could be \"owning a really good rental property in a booming city but that is very specific and requires good financing and a fair bit of luck and work to accomplish.\" Real estate is a much riskier and complex investment than stacking Sats. But I agree real estate in general, when done well and when avoiding bad luck, is in the conversation for best asset.I guess it also depends on the context. If someone needs to generate income a rental property would be preferred over Bitcoin which doesn't have cash flow. Real estate also has the advantage of mortgages where you can buy things for a fraction of the price up front, and then use credit to keep stacking properties and cover the mortgage with rental income. That of course requires lots of work. On the other hand for just growing wealth passively Bitcoin would be far superior.",

The worst case scenario is that Bitcoin is overpriced and it will return to previous levels because that's its objective value. Real estate isn't even keeping up with inflation right now. There is no telling where it is headed. Sure over a super LOOOOONG term it may work out, but even 10 years out it could be a terrible investment right now since in most parts of the world it is over priced and beyond the means of many people.On top of that it is usually not divisible and you have head aches such as maintenance, taxes and tenants and often terrible regulation always voting in their favour, that can even drive you to suicide. With interest rates rising any monthly gain may have been wiped out. Many landlords in my part of the world are in fact selling up, that will drive the price of real estate down further.With BTC there is usually only a tax when you sell and have made profit. Worst case scenario you lose it or make a loss. With real estate there is far more responsibility and far more things can go wrong and it is usually out of reach for the average Joe, unlike a small piece of BTC.",

The worst case scenario is that Bitcoin is overpriced and it will return to previous levels because that's its objective value. People will always need a place to live, that's a fact, but it doesn't make real estate the best possible investment in terms of risk/reward. Firstly, real estate prices are inflated like before 2008 and way off the neutral levels (talking about house price to earnings ratio). The WEF shows that it seeks to deprive us of property (including real estate). It may turn out that in a few years we will see high Cadastral tax or unrealized gains taxes. Simply pay us 5% of your real estate each year or sell it.Demographics of developed countries, the risk of World War 3, nuclear escalation, the collapse of society makes investing in real estate a high-risk investment in virtually half of the globe.You need to know the industry and the region in which you are buying a property, because there is nothing more important than a good location.",

It shouldn't be everything in one asset but you still need to diversify your assets. There are a lot of assets but it's not the only one that is good for you for sure. It's better to have multiple ones in order to have a great return on your money. Managing my allocation to BTC would be important for me and not everything.",

The worst case scenario is that Bitcoin is overpriced and it will return to previous levels because that's its objective value. I agree with you, real estate is the best asset in the world. I forgot about that article, but as far as I remember the survey results, real estate is the most searched and invested asset by the rich, while cryptocurrencies are only 2%. But for those with little initial capital and who want to get rich through investment, bitcoin is the best choice because, thanks to its volatility, many people can take full advantage of it for the best return. I love real estate, but with limited capital, I cannot invest in real estate. So my portfolio is also mostly bitcoin as I also hope that bitcoin will make it possible for me to earn some substantial capital.",

It might not bring anything to me in my life time but it also could be worth more eventually. That is if i want to invest safely, which i don't do in real life. In real life i don't trust just one asset. I buy and sell low caps as i don't have enough capital for huge purchases. Those have been very profitable to me. It's kind of like gambling as in small bets i can get huge rewards, but unlike in gambling i can sometimes be part of the team and work in grass root level.",

The assets which are limited in number, can definitely be added to the race of best asset in the world. You can consider here non-renewable resources like coal, petroleum, gold etc. Real estate can also be considered as great asset to hold. But if we talk about digital assets, then definitely Bitcoins should be placed at number one. Physical assets take long maintenance and hard to store for long term holdings, but if we compare digital assets like Bitcoins, it can be stored anywhere and can be accessed any time. Now the decision should be yours only. Which one should be said as the best asset?",

Gold and Silver on the other hand is proven to be one of the best assets because they've been there for a very long time. Even Robert Kiyosaki holds a lot of gold and silver. Business on one hand is the best because of how much profit it can give. As long as you are successful in your business venture, it will give you profit. Bitcoin on the other hand is best because of it's volatility. Volatility makes an average investor a rich investor. Volatility can make an Average Joe a millionaire, but on the other hand, it can also make an Average Joe a beggar after a few days because of it's capital being gone. I don't want to say that Bitcoin is the best asset in the world, but if we will just look on it's returns on the past decade, no doubt Bitcoin is the best at that category.",

Bitcoin's supply is also very limited which makes its price rise into a whole new level. No other assets including real estate can match it.

Return vs risk.Bitcoin is one of them, long term bitcoin is pretty good at higher returns while behind that there is a bigger risk where when the market crashes the price falls more freely isn't that a big risk too? So this is only balanced in bitcoin, while in contrast to assets that tend to be more stable, for example property, gold, or other assets that can maintain a higher price behind all of that, with the assets mentioned, of course there is no bigger risk than bitcoin.Quote from: thecodebear on March 31, 2023, 11:23:35 PMThink of it this way, if you had to put all your money in a single asset, would you put it in anything but Bitcoin?
