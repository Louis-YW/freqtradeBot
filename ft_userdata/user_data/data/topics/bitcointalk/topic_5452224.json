Thanks for pointing that out, now this project has got a reverse promotion, if you can't manage a front-end, it's unlikely that you've managed customer privacy well, especially since one mistake or leaking of one of the sessions means a complete collapse of an individual's privacy.Cheap price is not the deciding factor, especially in privacy applications. You should focus on the technical development and security team to make users feel that the promises you make can be fulfilled.",

However, I like the website theme, it looks simple and user friendly to me and I navigated the website easily without needing a helping hand. If you are running a reseller page please notify and don't claim total ownership, but if the VPN is yours then be kind enough to provide relevant information about the VPN, and the team behind the project. It'll build trust and provide transparency for the business. Every responsive website should have those features, as stated by Zwei in his response.",

Just send me email via pm here if you can to send you one month. At user profile you can find all the ovpn files to use at your own client. More clients will come for macos and linux. As they need more work and we wanted to make a start. Not every vpn site became the best leading vpn in one day. And we are not gonna be. There are so many out there. We offer secure servers. Hopefully more will come on the way We know many things needs to be done. We need also trial users to test our speed and network. If you find it good you can give us some money as monthly or 3 months as help. We can also provide reseller accounts at a vps server of your needs. We install whmcs for you frontpage and thene and android aplication.",

As long as the service I would pay for is working, I personnaly don't mind about the apparence of the website.For example, the very first version of https://mullvad.net/ was looking like that : Things can change, no ? Why OP shouldn't be allowed to share his website even if it's still WIP ?

And he doesn't give many options about the servers location, it could be realistic from a money point of view.About the fact Mullvad is great and trustable, I never said anything against it. I am using sometimes their service, and I said in my previous message : \"if you offer a really qualitative and durable service, and you don't do anything shady with your user's logs\". So yeah, Mullvad is great, but if OP is providing a great service, the said service won't be not good because Mullvad exists. As I said, I am not OP and I don't personaly care about the future of his VPN to be honnest, but if the service is ok and if with time he gives proofs of good work, I don't see any reason to look at it with a negative point of view.",

Meaning if your service requires installing any program, you will be hesitant before installing it, as it may contain many security bugs.All I want to get to you is that the cheap price is not the attractive mark in this industry, but rather the professionalism of the developed team and the speed of the servers in addition to a good price compared to the rest of the services.so 4 USD and professionals service better than 2 USD.",
