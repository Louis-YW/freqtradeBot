      "body": "I just came here after you were making a few threads in a row and it's all about advertising the prediction that came from that site. Does that site linked to you as an owner or something else? It doesn't make sense to see that and why don't you create a single thread that will be focusing to give an update about your site rather than spreading the prediction like this? This is quite spamming the section. HNT was a crap project. If bitcoin goes to the dip and this project will always be dipping as well.",
