Â  Charles-Tim answered you correctly. The fee rate used in the transaction you shared in the OP was 2.21 sat/vbyte.One of the outputs was spent in this tranaction with the fee rate of 108 sat/vbyte.The total (virtual) size of these transactions was 368.25 vbyte and the total fee was 24,574 satoshi. So, the combined transaction fee rate was around 66.7 sat/vbyte which was more than enough for a fast confirmation. That's why both transactions were confirmed in the same block (776342).",

It depends on mempool status and if mempool is clear, you can get very quick first confirmation within 1 or 2 block. If you are lucky enough if a time between your broadcasting time and next block time is very small, you will get first confirmation even after 1 to 2 minutes.Watch mempool status and compare unconfirmed transactions in mempool, their fee rates and yours. https://mempool.space/",

Read what other people have posted before you which answered his question correctly.",

Even if the address was generated in Atomic wallet, there is nothing stopping the owner taking the seed phrase of the wallet or the private key of that address and importing it in to any other wallet software which does support spending unconfirmed outputs. Or even just creating a transaction manually and then importing the private key to a tool like coinb.in to sign it.",
