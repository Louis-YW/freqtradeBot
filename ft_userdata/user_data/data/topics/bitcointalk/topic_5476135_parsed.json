  "content": "FTX KYC Status On Hold. FTX requested new documents supporting claim amount to process KYC submission.Hello all,I sent 3 bank statements to the FTX support centre for KYC but got an email from them, It stated below:@@@Thank you for providing additional documentation. At this time additional documents are still needed for the KYC verification process. Source of Funds documents must support your claim amount when converted to USD. The documents that you have submitted do not support your claim amount.Source of Funds: Please provide one of the following from the list below with all pages. We can not accept credit card statements.3 Bank statements issued for the past 3 months - balance must support claim amount in USD3 salary or income slips issued within the past 6 monthsLast filed income tax statement (2022)@@@I can only provide bank statements as I haven't had work for some time. However, it stated that the bank statements' balance must support the claim amount in USD. it doesn't make sense at all. I emailed them and asked why the balance must support the claim amount in USD but they haven't replied to me.Does anyone have the same experience? I don't have the balance to support the claim amount in USD. What should I do?",

Maybe they want to make the CEX more secured and user friendly and to also revive the dying project. What happen to FTX has change people's perspective and need to be rebranded to bring back people. So I think this strategy is to make FTX famous and for investors to see reason behind coming back to it.",

      "body": "If you can't provide salary payslips and income tax statements then you have no choice as you've said to only provide bank statements that are going to be tallied with how much you've got in there. I didn't encountered the same compliance as yours and you know what? When the exchange that I am using asked for that, I have never provided them any follow up requirements because I've already sent it to them before. But on your case, it is your bank that can help you out with that and tell it specifically that you need your statement written or converted at least in USD. I guess that if they can't do that, they'll ask you to open a dollar savings account.",

I don't know about FTX's KYC policy, but I also experienced losses from FTX. maybe each exchange has its own rules but since this is a big deal so they ask for extra data to ensure that it is the original owner.",
