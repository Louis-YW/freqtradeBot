It gives me hope that for the first time Nigeria wants a president who can perform, this is the first time since I was born that I have seen the barrier of tribe and stigmatization having no say in the peopleâ€™s choice. Growing up, I was made to believe we will never have a president from the East, that if we do they will divide the country. Now it seems the man from the East is the only candidate that wants to keep the country united and free from terrorism.",

Collect the money if you want to, it's your money and vote your conscience.I'm rooting for PO. He's young, energetic, and a visionary leader. His track records speaks volume for himself and he has what it takes to steer the ship called Nigeria. I hope he wins today's presidential election because is the best qualified candidate and the people's choice.",

The youth have seen that buying of vote is one of the reaaon we suffer in this country because they kept voting the wrong leader in. Among the 3 candidates, Atiku, Tinubu and Peter Obi, the only person that is competent enough to rule this Nigeria is PETER OBI. He is so competent, young, Educated. I will vote for him with all my heart. Peter Obi is the man.",

Based on their campaign rally all d aspirat carry out few weeks ago made people to no who is good to lead ur nation as president and people are not choosing base on party or region, and the most qualified candidate in dis 2023 general election is Peter Obi the labour party candidate. His track record as a formal governor show that he is not a corrupt person and his speech made me to prefer him among other candidates in dis election .",

Who wins depends on who the masses vote for.Â Based on the campaign and his overall voice, Peter Obi is likely to be a winner, but only ifÂ 1. All Peter Obi supporters come out and vote just as they are preaching, and note that they do not vote with their mouths but with their PVCs.Â 2. The election is conducted free and fair.Â If these two are sure, I believe we will have Mr. Peter Obi as our winner.",

Personally I no dey vote any of them. They're all corrupt and once were part of the system or currently part of the system that has kept Nigeria in this way. Neither of them is a youth and if IÂ  remember correctly what we were fighting for was a youth president but now we're settling for a 61 years just because he's the better option among the three?Oh finally we letting the system detect who we're to vote instead of us making the choice. OBI lost my vote when he went to labor party. The election would had been more fun if he created a totally new party that the youth will be the flag barriers for other political positions and then we elect him the president and after him any other presidential candidate will be a youth but no we might be getting the same fate that happened when APC was form from same greedy politicians. Aren't they the same people in labor party? You think they're different, OBi might be a scent but what about the whole party itself. Sha this is just my opinion and it doesn't really matter since election has been conducted and we waiting on results.",
