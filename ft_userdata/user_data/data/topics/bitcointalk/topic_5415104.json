Few wallets support this feature, I've seen this in metamask wallet, the smartphone mobile version though, even if the speed is slow like waiting for confirmation metamask will show tab to increase few for faster delivery to the address you sending to.",

      "body": "Quote from: SadGoodbye on September 27, 2022, 04:28:15 PM1. Can a transferred token or coin be reversed? For most coins/tokens, the answer is no. You can't revert a confirmed transaction. However, the answer depends on the chain you are using, if it's centralized then the entity in control can do whatever they want with the coins. Quote2. If I send out BTC to a family friend can it get stuck and can I resend adding more gas fee?.Yes, a bitcoin transaction can get stuck if it's paying a low fee while the network is congested with other transactions paying higher fees.You can increase the fee rate to accelerate the confirmation if the initial transaction was flagged as rbf. Or by spending one if its outputs that you control (which is known as cpfp).Gas is for ethereum, for bitcoin it's fee rate expressed in sat/vByte.",

      "body": "1. Crypto transactions are irreversible, that's why if it's already has been sent and confirmed, there's no way you can alter that. But, if it's been too long and still unconfirmed then it can be dropped by the network and funds will be back to the sender.2. Many wallets have that feature for adding fees so that it will be pushed but most of them don't. That's why it's better to always check the suggested fee of the network before sending a transaction.",
