Do they know something we dont ? They know something we don't know. Probably their own agenda. They were taking huge amounts of their USDT. That proves that if there will be something bad happening. I may think if what already accused by a member here may become true. Tether has not fully backed by the dollars and those whales are feeling worry with it and they are taking their money from the market rather than put their money into the risk caused by UST has proven even stable token that can collapse anytime.",

It's not just that there are doors open to other financial industries. as you mentioned above what's interesting about this situation is that for the first time we can actually see how much USDT is in circulation and who owns it on the other hand Tether has no intrinsic value, it was the first cryptocurrency to exist and struggled for years below the 1:1 benchmark because people still believe it.",

It is in billions. This should not be a panic, tether was once worth less than $10 billion in 2 or 3 years ago but its price remain stable with dollars which it is pegged with.What I did not like about tether is just that the coin is centralized and can be frozen even on noncustododial wallet by Tether developer. This is a reason not to buy tether.",

Do they know something we dont ? \"investors\"You are pretty naive imo. I think them investors never existed. Do you really believe some big whale (or a few) whales) just decided to pull $10b out of tether (which was 1/8 of tether's total supply btw) just like that? When usdt marketcap was going down it was always round numbers like $1b, $2b, $500m. Now the marketcap is going down and the same thing is happening.So, investors my ass.",

Because investors withdrew all that much money, and they were capable of withdrawing that much money without the price moving at all. There are so many projects where if you withdraw 10 billion dollars, they would either not be able to pay it, or they would have a problem in the long run.This is something we need to care about a lot, if Tether is capable of paying this much, then it is going to end up with a good result in the long run. They are gaining a lot of trust with this move, and people will trust a lot more money to them when the bull market comes by looking at this move.",

So maybe they are slowly withdrawing some it and now up to 10 billions have been taken out in the past few weeks.Of course, for average joe this is scary and alarming because this could mean another crypto bloodbath. Hopefully though those whales are putting it back in the market in other forms of crypto, like bitcoin and any other solid altcoins.",

Do they know something we dont ? Even though on this scale I do see this as a giant collapse in absolute terms obviously but if you clearly see there have been some minor hiccups in the overall chart earlier also which means that there have been times earlier also when such things have happened, one major reason could be some upcoming bullish movement reduction in the amount of USDT might mean people are going to buy alts in upcoming month.

After many years the same rumors are still around, but still, it's being used widely! Can we make any conclusions from that?! I sure can't!I also believe it's just in & out money! From 80 to 70 billion market cap is a nice drop, but nothing alarming, in my opinion! Maybe it's Musk withdrawing funds to buy Twiter?!",
