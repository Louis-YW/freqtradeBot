I like how they let people click the 10-20 day shipping option knowing damn well that wasn't going to happen. Basically if you ordered to Octotank they say you will get it between June 30th to July 30th who knows if that's true or not.",

I did the cheaper one. so I paid 1500+500 (shipping) = 2,000But I paid back in Jan like the 24th.They said the gear was not ready to ship until Late FebÂ I paid the cheaper shipping.It is obvious they had 2 issues 1 is building it on time. China did have a lot of Feb lockdowns for covid.I also think they found out shipping it was harder than they expected.REMEMBER they are shipping chemicals and gear. I think getting permits for the cooling liquid slowed them.So far my delay is say feb 25 to Now.And I paid for slow shipping which means I believe if they give me tracking today it will be a month more. So Maybe June 15-25 it shows up in New Jersey.",
