Well, I understand your generosity but that's not the way it should be. Learners and students or professionals that wants to get those type of certifications should really pave their way in obtaining one and be prepared of it. And in your case, as you've said that it's a 100% that someone will pass, this isn't the type of service that they should avail. It's a leak, it'll make them dependent on it and could take the certification and go out in the real world incompetent.",
