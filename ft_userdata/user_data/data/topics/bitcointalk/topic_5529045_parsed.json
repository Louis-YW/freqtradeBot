Also not just any knowledge, but that of those who has had an experience with that market... Except you are holding and remember not all coin you are meant to hold... For holding, you just need knowledge of market structures and when to buy for long term hodl as well and keeping your funds safe. Knowledge is a long term archivements when it comes to cryptocurrency and trading in general so get it first then make your profits later...",

Trust me there are millions of gullible one's among us that will easily fall for those trick, you know why, most people are just too lazy to think with their own head, so they believe somebody else can help them do the thinking and at the end, they become another victim.Crypto is knowledge base, whatever urge your having in terms of making profit  on the immediate should be channelled in the knowledge part, the key to survival in a volatile environment as that of the crypto is knowledge, so seek yeh knowledge first and every other thing will be added onto you.",

And lastly, turn your crypto knowledge into skills, and that's where passive income starts.Knowledge is essential for success in any business or financial endeavor. If you understand the market and gain knowledge about it, you will avoid being a victim of online scammers. Probably I know someone who is into crypto trading, has a good understanding of crypto, and has made a lot of money from it. And he uses his skills to teach others how to trade by collecting funds and conducting online classes with beginners to guide them through the trading process. And everything is going fine, what I'm trying to emphasize here is that not all mentors in online classes are scammers, some are willing to help others reach their goals. But some are scared to learn because anything in this life you need to sacrifice before you can achieve your goals.  if you think you won't spend money to learn you will never satisfied and you won't understand all about it. Some people spend a lot of money learning so that they can educate others and make money from it. If you have acquired information about cryptocurrency, anyone who attempts to con you will be caught, thus we should be learning every day and becoming more experienced.",

It is an easier process for some people to just follow the signals or copy the trade of other people who have more knowledge. This is mostly because these people are more focused on making money in the short term and they have no long-term goals.For those who have also acquired knowledge, you should know that knowledge is a responsibility and that what you know can simply quickly become outdated if you do not commit to refreshing the information.

Online trainers usually only introduce Crypto as a promising investment field, but never explain the risks.then make a profit by selling paid event tickets, signals, ebooks, referrals and others.

Dancing, riding a bike, many cases of cooking fall under this category. But there are other things, which entail certain risks, and where it's better to be informed before moving forward. Medicine, employment contracts are examples of this. To me, Bitcoin is also closer to this second category, as it is a volatile currency, there are tons of scams around it, a lot of misinformation, and it is fairly easy to make very big mistakes (like losing a password or sending money to the wrong address).So knowledge is indeed important and empowering.",

Even if there are crypto coach that are knowledgeable you can still just depend on their own know because crypto is a personal journey which people needs to understand it well.",
