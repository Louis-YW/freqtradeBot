  "content": "Betcoin.AG has closed my account without my permission, and it has been over a week since my withdrawal request and I have received nothing.I loaded 4kusd via crypto and ran it up to over 8k in the sports book, i did their KYC, and since then my account has been inaccessible, when i login it says \"user is disabled Launch error 401\" - this error pops up even when im trying to do something as simple as making a support ticketI talked to their live chat on their websit which thankfully worked, and they provided me contact@betcoin.ag to reach \"management\"here is the email thread below:Initial emial:> Hi,>>  My account has been disabled and i am waiting on a pending withdrawal> still and also have an active account balance>>  this came after i did the verification that my support ticket> provided.>>  i did everything that was asked except when they said i have to use> the device that i played on i couldnt because i played from a computer> that doesnt have a web camera, desktops dont have that>>  let me know if i can be of further assistance i would like to play on> your site again and get my withdrawal.>>  thanksreply:Hello, your new account was suspended, as you asked for a 60 dayexclusion 3 days prior on your original account. We take responsiblegaming very seriously. Please do not create any additional accountsduring the exclusion period. Once the 60 days has passed, we can reopenthe original account, only. We will return the deposit on this account,as a courtesy. If any other accounts are found, they will have the fullbalance withheld, including deposit, per our terms of service. Pleaseprovide a BTC address to return the deposit.Regards,Securityreply from me:What original account i never had another account with you guys? I never excluded myself i honestly an unaware what youre talking about do you have more details? I would not self exclude. Something very wrong is going on here i want all my funds returned not just the depositPlease provide further detailsThanksthat's it, since this email i have not been provided any information, i have not been sent ANY money despite already putting a withdrawa request in weeks ago, and they've completely locked me out of my account with over 8k usd in there.added details: on my device where i made my bets, i can't even press the login button I have to go on data on my phone just to be able to access the login page now.I'm not sure if this is something anyone else has experienced or not, but i have not ever excluded myself from any of their products it seems like theyre just shutting me down, and waiting me out to keep all my fundsplease let me know if anyone has experienced this and how i should approach itthanks",

      "body": "This account was created 3 days after an account from the same device and location asked for a 60 day responsible gambling exclusion. There is also a 3rd account created, which was closed prior to any activity. We are not \"keeping\" anyone's funds. We have offered to return the deposit and are waiting for him to provide an address to send it. Had the player lost the funds, he would be on here asking for a refund, because we allowed him back after exclusion. Unfortunately, there is no great solution for anyone in these matters, however it would be irresponsible of us to reward players for violating self-imposed exclusions. We take responsible gambling extremely seriously and this is the standard resolution for these matters. If the player claims he is not the same person who asked for the exclusion, he can file a complaint with a mediator and we can prove it to them in about 10 seconds.",

So it's systems against your word here.Usually they gather:a. IP addressb. Device that you are usingc. OS of that device and other footprint that they can say that it come from the same person/account.Since you already gave a address to send your funds back, then you have to wait 60 days.",

July of 1990 to be exact.So the casino claims the better [jset21] did a self exclusion.I know self exclusion rules at Atlantic City as I live in New Jersey.But I do not know self exclusion rules for online casinos.In a real casino in AC. you sign a document with witnesses (notary republic)SO the real casino can easily prove you did sign the agreement and by law they do not have to pay any winnings.I would love to know what the exclusion document on line looks like and how the casino proves you did submit it.I would guess a selfie with a dated piece of paper that reads I want jset21 account to be excluded held with his drivers idSince you have your photo id on line for kya . you would have to hold it along with the exclusion request when you take the selfie.It that photo exists jset21 will simply get a refund and lose his winnings.But if it is a signed statement from his ip the casino know his ip and could easily fake that.So how does one go about getting excluded on your casino>My method of holding drivers id and a piece of paper dated requested exclusion for the selfie should be gold standard.I do know a lot of compulsive gamblers that went back to casinos hit big and got zip because AC casinos are very careful about the exclusion papers.So far I do not see any info on this exclusion process for this casino.Does bitcoin.ag have a selfie for id and a selfie for exclusion?I mocked up an exclusion selfie. The idea that ip's match is not enough but a selfie like the one below is pretty good.Obviously a bigger piece of paper easy to read.and maybe the other hand must touch your chest.and when you do the normal kyc the hand should be at your side.So far the casino has not described the exclusion process KYC at all.So if you score  big at the casino you may be falsely excluded and not paid your winnings.Since the casino is not paying winnings due to exclusion where is the proof?an ip and a machine = no proof since you know the ip and the machine already.",

I really would love to see the casino come back to the thread and explain the exclusion plan they do.The ball is in their court.I can tell you somebody is a liar but I do not know if it is the casino or the poster.the fact the casino only mention an ip and a machine makes me think they fucked up as that is good enough to proof the was an exclusion request.At the casino if all you have is ip and same machine that is not much and is pretty easy to spoof. You should thank the player for pointing this weakness out and go for cashing kyc and exclusion kyc from now on. waiting to hear what you have to say.",
