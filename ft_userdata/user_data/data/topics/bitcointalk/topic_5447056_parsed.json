You won't be wealthy by just saving because that will be defeated by inflation. But instead, start investing or create a business that will give you stable income and that's how you can enjoy being wealthy. As you save, your money is in the bank and what's next? You'll spend it for those wants that you won't necessarily need eventually. It's okay to treat yourself but make a principle that it's not going to be that much for you like buy those sneakers that you want. Copy what the rich people do, they use money to make another money. That's why investing is going to make you wealthier and will give you a lot of freedom.",

You have a point if we are still strong we need to save money so that if we become weak we can have the money to pay our expenses, there are big advantages when we do savings because if there is an emergency and we need funds we don't need to get a loan to pay the expenses because we have our own savings, getting a loan for an emergency is a very worst part or option  because loan has an interest and you need to pay it, while if you have saving you can you can avoid it.",

If we will have the knowledge that we have right now as far as generating wealth, they we could be rich when we are young. But the thing is that it takes some time and understanding to do it, so it's hard to achieved it. Unless when we got our first job and learn to save, then maybe there will be a point in time that the money that we save throughout the years might be enough for us. So start investing at a young age, and if you missed the boat then maybe with your experience and knowledge make the right decision to increase your wealth overtime, whether thru investing or putting a business.",

Being able to afford what you want is what is called wealth to me. I don’t go with the ideology of just saving and not saving on ones selves. There are people that invest or save at the detriment of even their health. As long as there’s death lurking around no matter what one saves he might have to leave some around. Some of these left over funds are sometimes not even used by ones kins. It is hard to reach a certain age where feels comfortable of not getting more money. So you can’t be that wealthy because even those wealthy people worried about accumulating more either to top the list wealthiest individuals. Nonetheless it is important to save at our youthful age just to have a comfortable old age",

This alone causes me to rethink how I'll spend and save my money when I get some. Everyone wants to save for the future, but when you save money, it will remain that amount for many years, with the only change being inflation. However, putting it to work could earn you more money, but it could also be risky because you could lose it all while putting it to work again. These are, in my opinion facts, and are too good to be false. So just do what will be the best and hope for the best.",

Saving as of this day and age seems to me as a form of securing your future for emergencies, not as a means for you to get profits from.
