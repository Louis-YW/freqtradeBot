  "content": "I have been writing quite a bit in their ANN thread so I’m going to clarify how it is and how they scammed me for 3600$.I’ve betted on Betnomi since the start of the World Cup (around 1 December).I started off bad and was losing at the beginning and since I was on their staging/testing environment (betnomi.me) their manager Sorsis e-mailed me and urged me to open a account on the actual website. Sorsis even wanted to give me 100$ for the trouble but I never took it. He thought I was a sucker since I was losing and wanted to give a handout. https://imgur.com/0xhrO1hAfter this I opened an account on their actual website and had a really good run, I was placing bets without any problems. I bet on football and at the time only on the World Cup and later on Premier League and La Liga. I withdrew and they cashed out on numerous occasions and the staff was superfriendly when I asked them about my withdrawals. Even though it took days it wasn’t a problem since they were so nice to me. I even wrote that I liked my experience with them in their ANN thread and wasn’t really understanding the fud that has been going on there. I later understand and learned the hard way.https://imgur.com/sMqSAzEAfter new years my account got limited, I wasn’t shocked really because this stuff happens if you are having a good run. However, when I wanted to withdraw my remaning funds which was around 3600 usdt they wanted me to make a KYC. After a lot of hassle I submitted the KYC where I literally gave them everything. https://i.imgur.com/HLbtGSa.png (I had a pending bet which was settled as a win after print was taken)I even gave them source of funds and sent them my private investments on the stock market from my personal bank since they didn’t accept that my source of funds has been coming from winning at sports betting with crypto. This is the truth, I make a living out of sports betting and when I claim this in the regulated market it has never been a problem. As long as I can prove the transaction between me and the book. Even here I stated and made clear that I wasn’t accusing them of anything in their ANN thread and wanted to give them time to solve this.However, after I completed the KYC my account got closed. They didn’t tell me straight up what I have done wrong and since I have been active in their ANN thread this is what I have been told is the reason for my account getting closed:”The user is manipulating the pricing, all odds dropped before the kick off, the user has a strong mathematical and analytical pattern of betting in the exact position, as the pattern was repeated again and again, the user is a strong opinion user and is using strategy to gain leverage in the long term, which is against our T&C. If a user feels that we have done something unfair, please tell them not to hesitate to file a complaint with the Curacao gambling authorities and we will be happy to work with them to resolve the issue. Also, if he needs help getting in touch with them, please let us know and we will provide him with their contact information. We will continue to enforce our fraud prevention policies and take appropriate actions when we detect fraud or abuse.”https://i.imgur.com/2w3n4UE.pngThis is an insane reasoning for banning my account. They are basically saying that it is forbidden to win at sports betting and that I'm a fraud because I'm winning. I haven’t manipulated the pricing at all and as far as I remember the odds of my bets didn’t drop as they claim. Maybe on some occasions but that isn’t something unusual in sports betting. It happens, price moves all the time in all markets, not just odds.For anyone who is into sports betting knows that their reason for closing my account is basically stealing. It’s really disturbing that we have these kind of books in spaces. Betnomi is really hurting the crypto-space with this kind of behavior. I even contacted The Pogg who is a solid ADR where Betnomi is listed. This is the response I got from them as well: Unfortunately after repeated efforts to contact the operator to discuss this issue we have received no response what-so-ever. At this juncture we have no reasonable expectation of this changing.Sorry we could not be of further help.ThePOGGhttps://i.imgur.com/ieahxxJ.pngSo Betnomi doesn’t even care to respond to them even though The Pogg tried to reach out on numerous occasions. If Betnomi have nothing to hide, they can stand up for the action they have taking against me and would have been open to solve it but apparently they're not.",

The goal in sports betting should be to beat the closing line as often as possible.QuoteFor anyone who is into sports betting knows that their reason for closing my account is basically stealing.

      "body": "So sorry for the experience you are going through as a result of the actions by betnomi. If I am not wrong, sports is a win win things for both parties involved. In sports, there must either be a winner or a looser which every gambler or bettor has the thought of winning their bets and also the casino too would want bettors to loss too so they could make more mone. Either way, both parties want to make money for themselves. Betnomi I know have not had any scam accusations before and for the first time I am seeing this. This casino is a reputable on here so in that case, I suggest we also hear their own side of the story too so as to avoid being biased but I was baffled seeing this \"the user has a strong mathematical and analytical pattern of betting in the exact position, as the pattern was repeated again and again, the user is a strong opinion user and is using strategy to gain leverage in the long term\" what do they expect you to do, not to do your analysis before betting so you could loss to them?  this is funny because that is not a good reason they should withhold your funds and getting your account banned. This issue i think is very important and would be taken seriously by high ranked members here.",

It is called value betting and it is completely normal. I am challenging you to find an industry leader bookie like Pinnacle who acts this way.Also, even i haven't noted it earlier, it is very suspicious when Betoni is only dealing with curacao licensor complaints when we all know that Curacao licensors will not give a shit about any case. So basically they say to OP ''Hey, you are free to file a complaint with Curacao licensors, we already know how they treat those complaints'' lol",

I know they advertise on the forum, and three days with no response in this thread doesn't look good, being an old, well-known casino with a good reputation in principle.",

You have heard 1 side of the story here. Should I assume you are an alt account of the OP? That's basically what you are doing by siding with the bettor before hearing both sides. We don't know what evidence Betnomi might have or will share, so it's best not to form an opinion until we have both sides.Oh please just stop it with the assumptions. I've seen you a lot in the Betnomi ANN-thread shilling like there's no tomorrow. You attack everyone who talks bad about Betnomi so don't come in here with that nonsense. I haven't attacked anyone, I simply said that guy/girl couldn't assume anything with 1 side of the story. You sure seem ready to attack though. No need for you to get on my case. I'm not on your side or theirs. I want to hear both sides before coming to a conclusion. Looks like this is site #2 to halt your betting activity though.Yeah and why do you think they halt me? Some books are just bad losers. Getting limited is a part of the game though, getting confiscated isn't. I won that case btw. Arguing with other forum members is not going to help your case. As long as you will present your evidences and can convince others then they will support you. You and betnomi, none are special to anyone except may be to few who are benefiting from it. But even receiving benefit does not mean one will accept a wrong if it looks an obvious wrong.Quote from: lesliegray on February 22, 2023, 02:39:13 AMSo Betnomi doesn’t even care to respond to them even though The Pogg tried to reach out on numerous occasions. If Betnomi have nothing to hide, they can stand up for the action they have taking against me and would have been open to solve it but apparently they're not.I will also PM them to check on the thread.",
