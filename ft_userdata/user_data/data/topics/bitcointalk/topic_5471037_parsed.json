As long as its fundamentals are stable (as I'm sure ZTX's is, having checked it out myself), you shld be fine. I'd recommend you don't go all in tho, it looks good nw but who knows what tomorrow will look like",

I'd recommend you don't go all in tho, it looks good nw but who knows what tomorrow will look likeI totally agree, Not smart to go all in on this one. Personally, I also think ZTX has some real potential, especially with the backing from jump crypto and zepeto, which is already a hit in Asia. If they can replicate that success on a global scale, ZTX might just have what it takes to rise as a top metaverse token.",

Sandbox and Decentraland stand out right now but they both have so few users. Also the games there might have been considered \"games\" when it was 1998. IF ZTX wants to have any chance, it has to have actual games. Also it has an edge in graphics (at least from what has been shown).",

According to my research, ZTX is a Web3 virtual world set to empower creators and communities.While it isn't too ideal to only make an investment decision based on the exchanges they're listed on, I think it somehow proves Credibility and Trustworthiness. Listing a token on reputable exchanges adds credibility to the project. Well-established exchanges often have rigorous listing criteria and perform due diligence on the tokens they list. By investing in a token listed on reputable exchanges, you can have greater confidence in the project's legitimacy and possibly, the quality of the token.",

You can at least try to wait for this token to be listed in all of major exchange sites before it will be trying to go to the moon. ZTX has not yet listed on the biggest exchange site and how can this token goes to the what you have expected if there was no big volume trade on this token. IM very skeptical with this token at this moment. It seems like that ZTX will not make it to be the top of metaverse token. The trend of metaverse token has been declining so hard. People were seeing this as unsuccessful project but the hype can come again anytime but this totally depends on the various things. I hope that we will see another buble for metaverse token someday. It seems like that the price will always be stable. It's hard to be the top metaverse token these days.",

IF ZTX wants to have any chance, it has to have actual games. Also it has an edge in graphics (at least from what has been shown).Talking about Games, you remind me of BigTime, a web3 gaming platform! It has made a good round of wave in the GameFi space, selling over $100 million in NFTs. I saw an update that it's becoming the most streamed web3 game on Twitch. Its native token, BIGTIME, has seen a rapid rise in market capitalization since its listing with some percentage rebate for investors on Bitget among other CEX. The token is providing an economic incentive for players and rewarding them for their time and effort. Despite being in its infancy, Big Time has already become a formidable competitor to established blockchain games like Axie Infinity, and its innovative gameplay has earned it numerous attention. Maybe you check that out along ZTX before you decide.",

Most of the Metaverse before are not active anymore and they’ve lose certain numbers of players, with Axie they are still active today but the number of players are not that high, they have promotions and event but the hype for Metavers is not active right now, its hard to tell for the possible opportunity with Metaverse project.",
