  "content": "The United States lost 18.54 quadrillion dollars in the 76-year-old Israel warThe United States lost 18.54 quadrillion dollars in the 76-year-old Israel war, Which means that every single American should own at least 5 million dollars in revenues, Instead of owing $65,625 in debt.(In this case if there is no Zionist occupation of America and Israel does not even exist)Israel only represents the European occupation of America, the European Zionists who robbed India of 97 trillion dollars in 1857 are currently occupying America and looting billions of dollars. Was America built on the name or ideology of Zionism or Israel? While Americans are running Israeli companies with their tax money and losing their companies. The Zionists who looted 97 billion dollars from India cannot estimate how much they have looted from the occupation of America because India is a poor country while America is the richest one. Did Europe also come into being on a Zionist ideology? Neither, The only difference is that American tax revenues are being stolen and Israeli companies are expanding. Despite being sovereign in everything, America still has a debt of 21 trillion dollars, Due to which every American owes 65,625 dollars in debt even after paying taxes. Because in a country with a population of 320 million, if 21 trillion dollars is divided by per capita, it becomes 65,625 dollars per capita. If the US per capita income of $76,370 is added to this, it is more than $24 trillion/year. In this way, US foreign exchange reserves should have increased by 244 trillion dollars every ten years, which is not happening, but on the contrary, the US is constantly sinking into debt. Which means that more than 24 trillion dollars are withdrawn from the United States every year from the Zionist occupation, the economies around the world are getting weaker and weaker with this debt and the Zionists are constantly promoting their power over Israel's war and stealing trillions of dollars annually. Which is of no benefit to America except that it continues to commit genocide and is moving forward in the enmity of humanity. Where its people are not as prosperous as the prosperous Chinese. If there was no Zionist occupation, the world would not have lost 307 trillion dollars, but America alone itself would have gained 18.54 quadrillion dollars in the 76-year war in its revenues.",
