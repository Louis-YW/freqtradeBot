Kraken bot is turned off for now but I can turn it on if any of you are interested.You can see it here: https://t.me/BitAssistPS. note that the buy price is always 0.2% higher than the best bid price. This is just a trick to get cornix to buy the market price.PS2. if anyone wants to help with development, hit me up on Telegram",

On which time duration the bot looks for candlestick pattern? I guess your bot works based on the available API of those exchanges and if yes then what type of pattern it looks for before generating a buy signal? I think if your bot is good enough then it may be used for DCA strategy and that way the ones who want to invest in Bitcoin by following the DCA strategy may get some help in the form of that bot. I don't really rely on bots myself but the way you described your bot seems good to me and it could be helpful for some people. I would also like to know that are you going to make the bot open-source or not?",

It is looking for the data equivalent of a hammer / bullish engulfing / morning star and then generates a signal based on it. I will not make it open-source. I plan to run it for free for a bit then take in 10 subscribers in a private channel.",

You might want to stick to just several pairs that yield better results at first, and tweak your parameters according to volatility and other criteria for some of the others. Would be great if you can indicate some historical results too in that link you shared, as well as making a mention of any updates you make to your code going forward. Good Luck",

I plan to run it for free for a bit then take in 10 subscribers in a private channel.your service does not differ much from technical analysis indicators, as they all take price data and apply certain calculations to it to give the results either in the form of charts or intersections that determine whether it is better to buy or sell. You just give the user signals instead.What do you mean by Accuracy: 50.00% and how is its average calculated? Is it over a weekly, daily, monthly or what? An accuracy of 50% is not good.",

Good LuckI'm pre-selecting the coins. You can read a bit more about it here: https://github.com/MihaiIsvoranu/BitAssistThanks a lot.
