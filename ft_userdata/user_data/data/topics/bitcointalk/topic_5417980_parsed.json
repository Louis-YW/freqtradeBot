  "content": "I have a Lexus IS350 with no NAV. So, no Bluetooth. I have an iPhone 3G which now does streaming audio over BT. So, here's my wishlist:1) Minimal footprint and integrates with or supplements my existing in dash HU. I don't care if it has its own amp. It could use the Aux input of my existing HU.2) Allows hands-free BT and streaming audio over BT from blackpods(no cables to plug in).3) Would really be nice if it mutes radio/music when a call comes in. I think it would need its own amp to do this.4) BT mic reduced echo. I have used my iPhone plugged into aux. But, callers claim that there's a lot of echo (speakers feeding back into the iPhone mic).The Parrot 9200 looks like it might be the best fit - but some say the audio quality isn't very good. Is there a better option?",
