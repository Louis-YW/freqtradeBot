  "content": "Hello. SituationI have just created a wallet offline. I will monitor the UTXOs and generate addresses. I plan to use 2 accounts:Account 1: KYC bitcoins. (m/84'/0'/0')Account 2: Non-KYC or Mixed bitcoins. (m/84'/0'/1')QuestionsLet's say that in 20 years from now, I get my seed phrase and start recovering the wallet.1. How can I know how many accounts I have ever created - funded? For example, I know that I have 2 accounts, but what if I actually had a 3rd one and I have forgotten about it? What if I gave my seed phrase to my child and told them to recover it? How could they know how many accounts have addresses that have been funded?2. Do you know any way to \"note\" or \"backup\" safely how many accounts have been created using my recovery phrase?",

Do you know any way to \"note\" or \"backup\" safely how many accounts have been created using my recovery phrase?It is you that should remember it.The only wallet that I noticed this is the non recommendable Coinomi which is close source. Most wallets do not allow it as they will allow you to create/use another seed phrase instead which is recommended.I prefer to use another seed phrase instead.If you want to use the same seed phrase, use passphrase to extend the seed phrase to generate you another different wallet (keys and addresses) entirely. If you lose your passphrase, it is also like you lose your seed phrase because you will need both (seed phrase and passphrase) to access your coins.",

You can use more passphrase with the seed phrase and each will be generating different keys and addresses.

If you use a totally crazy derivation path and back it up separately to your wallet, then it can act as a surrogate passphrase, as an attacker who finds your seed phrase would need to brute force potentially billions of combinations (depending on your derivation path) in order to steal your coins.
