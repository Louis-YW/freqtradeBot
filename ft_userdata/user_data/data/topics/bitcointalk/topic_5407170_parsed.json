  "content": "LG is planning to jump on the NFT bandwagon by creating a TV that will be able to issue and trade non-fungible tokens.This comes as no surprise, given the recent craze surrounding NFTs. They're planning to offer TV software for issuing and trading NFTs,as well as software for NFT and crypto transactions.Plus, they'll be offering digital token brokerage and wealth management services.It's good to see that LG is getting on board with the NFT and blockchain craze. However, I can't help but feel that they're a bit late to the party.After all, there are already a number of established players in the space.Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see what LG has to offer.I'm sure that their experience in the T.V. and electronics industry will come in handy.Check out our newsletter at https://ambire-newsletter.beehiiv.com/",

Back to the topic of discussion, the era of smart tv has given room to a lot of development, and is quite exciting to know that LG is taking a lead in this direction, cryptocurrency is becoming a mainstream business and NFT development has encouraged a lot of content inclusion in digital currency so it will be more exciting if LG will start accepting cryptocracy as payment for the purchase of the devices soon.",

However, the hype is little lower this time unlike before.They're trying to get those customers that would be hype by such news. How's that possible with that TV?Since there is a USB port, that will be possible through connecting a mouse to it and do those clicks and logins, whatsoever?",

Let's stop this shit.People are should aware, NFTs more shit rather than a coin/token because the liquidity is really low.It is to be observed since NFT had been the talk of the town in the past months.  Although its hype died down, the idea of having NFT-related stuff always comes out later after the NFT market hype since it takes time to develop stuff.  The news made me curious about how much they will be charging per unit if LG successfully implemented a TV with an NFT exchange/creation feature.",

Credit to them for the futuristic innovations but I think it's just over the top and will not be consumed by the public except the elite coiners. Not that I think I could afford one but it's madness to own one at this point.",

For me personally, I will not buy this kind of TV. But a news about a big company jumping on any kind of crypto stuff is always a good news. I wish after this TV LG would consider to dive deeper into the blockchain world.",

One shit standing up for another shit! LG is a shit TV marker no one gives a damn about anymore. Then NFT is another shit concept joining hands with LG. This one was one of the dominant  brand in the world consumer electronics market but since last couple of years they are constantly loosing their market share due to lack of innovation. Now this plan of NFT is another hilarious one which wouldn't bring any impact at all. Both are failures and this one is also going to be another big failure.",

And now you can used to trade and issue NFT's?What happen if the whole NfT craze suddenly died down and lost the hype? So those TV are going to be relic? in any case, not sure if this is a good idea for LG though, they are just jumping on the bandwagon and they might be late, in my opinion.",

There are better brands than it. It's a good thing snce adoptions like this is a good sign thaf crypto is really emerging but I find it risky to trade on that brand. It wouldn't also be much effective since most traders prefer computers, laptops,, and mobile phones for trading. NFTs wouldn't also be a good start since people nowadays have trust issues when it comes to new projects.",

Because, all the crypto news portals that I am following have not covered this news yet. I just want to ensure about the credibility of this news and moreover what would be the need of having a TV when they plan up for NFTs? In my understanding NFT must be a one of recent invention by this crypto community to push rest of world to get participating with cryptocurrencies in one or another way.Still, I could not figure out what would be role of TV on issuing and trading NFT. I usually do not follow the links from this forum; otherwise I might have got answers for my doubts if I would have visited and spent some time on your blog probably.",
