  "content": "Hello to everyone, I have account at Duelbits Casino, and I asked for withdrawal at 10. October. Withdrawal is still not processed. I opened account and made two sports bets. Both was won. Initial deposit was 300$, everything above that (283$) was profit from these two winning bets. When I tried to withdraw, and saw It's not going through I contacted them on live-chat and asked what is wrong. They asked me for KYC. I did it. After that, withdrawal is still on \"Processing\" status. I contacted them again, and asked whay withdrawal is not paid. They told me I made suspicious bets and investigation is needed. Wow. I told OK, I will wait. 20 days passed and still didn't get my money. Support from Live chat keep giving same replies: \"no updates\", \"be patient\" and similiar. They can tell me that after 5000 days of waiting. What to do? Screenshots: https://postimg.cc/gallery/z3S20TJ",

      "body": "What you do is wait for them to reply about your investigation. There have been multiple people say that an investigation can take upwards of 90 days. Duelbits has to wait for a response from their provider I believe. You can try contacting their account here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2859659",

This casino has been active for several years and there are no complaints against them either here on the forum or on any other site.I suggest that you continue to contact the support team, which is undoubtedly verifying the activity on your account. You can also post on their main channel : Duelbits.com | Casino & Sportsbook , or directly contact their official representative on the forum, as suggested in the comment above .",

We are yet to hear their side of story if there are any but the account is not online from over 20 days. If you are convinced, you are not going to get paid then create a flag. But I will suggest to wait few more days, a week and half maybe. I saw in some cases some sportsbooks even took more than a month to resolve a case. Sometimes patience pays off.",
