Any big upgrades on Polygon so that ETH whales see potential from this token and this layer-2 project?From its all time high $2.92 to $0.89 is not a big drop of $MATIC. What do you think about future growth of $MATIC?Fro $0.9 to $3 is only 3 times and it does not give more profit than invest into ETH if ETH reclaims its all time high at $4891. Polygon had some downtime so I feel safer to invest in $ETH, not $MATIC.",

ATH was around $19.5B and currently hovering around $7.7B which is still high compared to others. I see it definitely having a change to challenge BNB marketcap especially now when binance is under a microscope and has fud to deal with.However if matic would rise to bnb marketcap level, it would most likely mean that NFTs are far from over. And making a comeback no one asked for in the scale no one is even dreaming of.And as matic didn't tank as badly as most altcoins out there, it's a clear sign of strenght, so of course whales smell it. But i don't understand your last sentence that they would be taking it seriously now. As i have seen them taking it seriously all along.",

Itâ€™s still way undervalued as of today.That is uncertain as I never see such a thing happen in the market. Matic might grow someday and the pump high but that will happen when Bitcoin is also in the rally. But as we look at the current momentum, seeing this project make its own Bullrun is somewhat impossible (just my opinion). I have no strong basis for this but we know the sentiment of the market before and know that altcoins are dependent on Bitcoin. Whales are buying Matic as an opportunity but never I think this will make Matic have its own direction opposite to the current state of the market.",

If I use my capital to invest in either Ethereum or MATIC, I am sure I will go with Ethereum, not MATIC. Ethereum does not need to prove anything more but MATIC has to upgrade a lot and must be tested a lot by community and bear market.I don't invest in MATIC because others are hyped about its potential which is not real. Potentiality of a project is shown more clearly in bear market not in bull market. MATIC must have to go through another bear market, in 2025 or 2026, to be considered as a strong layer 2 project.",
