Many of them will have many things to buy in mind but not having money or because they are savings and not want to spend from it will let them wait for the next salary and if they collect the next salary they will spend more. But that does not mean they are not still spending wisely. If anyone collect salary and save from it and also have emergency fund and other important funds saved, that does not mean the person should not go for his needs after collecting another salary but also saving wisely. Although some people spending unwisely.",

You can't really said they buy things they don't need. Because whatever thing they bought with their money is sure valuable to them. Choices are different. Like me when I was working whenever I get paid I buy all necessary item needed by the family in other not to walk around the grocery shop. It's just like a compilation of required items buying in balk. So that isn't caled unnecessary.Quote from: cafter on November 21, 2023, 05:29:11 AMI said majority of people because my dad owns a grocery store, I have noticed that most of the customers tend to buy more stuff on the 1st and 10th day of the month because on these days they get paid in my country. You sound like someone who is from an African country. Maybe someone from Nigeria. Because due to economic inflation people always like to buy things in bulk because of price changes. if you don't buy those things as fast as possible you might need to spend more anytime soon. They buy such thing to cut lost because if they use like $200 to buy those stuffs, and price hyk comes up dey will not need to spend much next month or upper, and I will save them unnecessary expenses. Or can be call price hyke elimination strategy Quote from: cafter on November 21, 2023, 05:29:11 AMI already seeing this pattern on news or business related youtube videos, but I didn't think it was a big deal.

Everyone seems to be like that; their monthly budget is refreshed, and they can buy whatever they consider important and makes them happy. But many of them don't manage that limited money well. in my area, it's common for people to struggle to buy things at least 7 days before they get their next paycheck... this is actually a problem in the financial world.People who don't have other income that brings profit every week or every day are usually spendthrifts in the beginning and very thrifty towards the end. Their budget is always out of control, making them happy at the start of the month and miserable at the end. It's a lifestyle pattern that needs to be modified to achieve better planning.",

There are other people who get paid and buy things they don't really need right away. They are the type of person who thinks they will never run out of money, and their spending method is actually wrong.",

Additionally, people tend to make use of this in online shops as well and consider the paydays as well.

Also, your family may not be relying on the payday which is why it might not be obvious to you. Those whom you are referring to are paid job employees, there might have been a long list of what they need, which could be a pressing one or needed for the whole month. It happens everywhere, not only in your country, there are needs and wants every time, but to them, money is a constraint which is being solved when they receive their monthly salaries.For those who are business people or are financially free and not depending on the monthly salary, you would never know their spending culture because they get what they want when they want it. Even if they spend more on frivolities than those who depend on their payday, you will definitely not know because there wasn't a time limit for their financial freedom.Payday or should I say payment week is also the week that ATMs are mostly busy and debt paid in my country. It's also the time that sellers claim they record the most sales, which I believe is normal and for obvious reasons.",

Using your father's grocery shop as an example is not valid because groceries are an essential need. Usually, people always buy what they need at the end of the month when they receive their pay. My family makes a list of what is needed for the month and it is bought immediately after salaries are paid. There are also people that a wasteful spenders. They don't plan how to spend what they earn and don't even save for the future. I know some people who drive straight to nightclubs immediately after they receive their salaries. They are not concerned about investing or having emergency funds. These set of people buy not because they need it but because they can afford it. In most cases, they will access loans or credit before the end of the month because of careless spending. I live in a country where if don't plan, you will end up a debtor or a beggar. The economic situation has forced most people to spend only on what they need. I have a monthly budget that enables me to spend only what I need and also assist me in keeping aside funds for investment and emergency. There is no difference between my payday and other days because I already have a plan.",

This may trigger a desire to reward themselves or indulge in immediate gratification by splurging on purchases they have been delaying. There might be pressing financial obligations or bills that need to be addressed resulting in a significant portion of the paycheck being allocated towards necessary expenses. The combination of these factors can contribute to a higher level of spending during the initial period after receiving a monthly salary.",

Does your father's grocery store prohibit large purchases? No, it actually provides benefits and buyers feel satisfied with the product they are looking for. Your father is still happy because his goods are selling well, right? I don't think this can be generalized as overbuying.So it's not about buying things you don't need, but about what you need differently from other people's needs.Do you ask the person directly why they are buying items in large quantities? It could be that the goal is to meet your needs for 1 month or you have a large family so you have to shop in large quantities.",
