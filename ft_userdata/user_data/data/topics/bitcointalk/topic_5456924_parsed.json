  "content": "Firstly I will like to say Trading scammers come in multiple forms today now are days others are more unpretentious they can come from brokers and other non-broker sources. The simplest aspect of it is that identifying scams is that many services and features available today are legitimate. Now are days scammers use some scenes called TROJAN HORSE STYLE TACTICS to exploit what are generally genuine offerings. Here are some most common legitimate services that are often exploited by scammers. * THE FOREX MUTUAL FUND (PAMM) SCAMS÷ This scam is known as the percentage Allocation management module (PAMM) it takes inspiration from the traditional hedge fund model, and as a legitimate product is a fantastic way for investors to take part in a managed fund. That is why it is important to strengthen due diligence first before investing some scammers will claim that their fund managers are qualified professionals but in fact, they are not and also could claim massive historical returns and will show numbers that way exceeds market norms to lure new investors in always be sure to check this thing.*EA/Trading Robots Scams÷ EA means (Expert Advisor) modules and Trading Robots it can be powerful automated trading tools and are often a value-add offering with some legitimate brokers I would advise investors should understand that trading software only automates a manual strategy. I would likely say that automation has its inherent benefits but generating unlimited profits is not one of them. Unfortunately, some scammers offer solutions that are not what they claim to be, there was a time were a scammer claimed things like \"churn out endless profits from the market round the clock\" or \" guaranteed profits \"tell from my experience.*Trading Signals Scams÷Wee all know that the trading signals are there to provide trade ideas and suggestions to traders that will help them take advantage of opportunities in the market cap. We all know that signals can be generated manually or automatically by individuals or companies. They can use technical analysis or fundamental analysis, or both to generate trading signals. There are many legitimate signal services, but once again there are scam offers and key warning signs to look out for. * \"HOLY GRAIL\" FOREX SCAMS÷ This is where the scammer understands the hardest part of the entire trading activity is identifying and taking advantage of the best trading opportunities in the market. Some Naive investors believe they will be on the path to unlimited cash when they can get their hand on a \"holy grill\" trading system that market ⚠️WARNNING!!! Any promotion of a software or trading company that claims to have a \"holy grail\" trading systems that will insulate you from losses in the market is a scam and should be always avoided entirely.*Guaranteed Returns scams÷ I will say that this type of scam is not-so-subtle but it is still this scam some investors are encouraged to join a service or company that trades in the forex market and they will earn a fixed period profit, but I will call it a scam also because the forex market is fast and dynamic and profits and losses are part of forex trading and cannot be forecasted.*PERSONAL DATA SCAMS÷ When signing up with a brokerage firm, you will be required to submit some of your private and confidential information and possibly even payment info like credit card and details, a legitimate and regulated broker is required to take necessary security measures to ensure that your data remain private and is never shared or sold to a 3rd party when it comes to scam brokers they do not take the necessary precautions or worse, they may sell your information to a 3rd party. These parties may start sending you unsolicited emails or contacting you with whom you've never opted.Identifying thefts and selling personal information can potentially result in losses for the innocent investor.*FAKE BONSES AND PROMOTIONThesehese are quite common offerings by brokers, including legitimate ones licensed and regulated brokers have to ensure that bonuses and promotions meet regulatory guidances and do not \" lock\" the treat in however,  some shady brokers lure in investors with misleading promotion and have terms and so stringent or outright unattainable. *PRICE MANIPULATION ÷ This is the most common scam performed by scam brokers, some broker manipulates their trading platforms to always be at the disadvantage of traders, it can come in the form of negative slippage, where entry and exit orders are filled at price undesirable to the trade. For instance, a buyer order is filled at a much higher price which limits the eventual profits that can be realized on the trade if any at all.TAKE NOTE☑️Remember that a fool is born every minute,  so don't be one - read, research, get your act straight, and always pay attention to your cybersecurity habits.Source https://www.avatrade.co.za/education/trading-for-beginners/forex-scams",

Then the long explanation you made here that came from the articles, it's actually boring to read. I'm sorry if this is what I said, if you would have summarized the topic you want to convey here in this section at least maybe our discussion here would be healthy.Now, for us to know the scammer you must be critical, and you know the steps to take to determine if this person we are engaging is a scammer. You must have a basis for this. And research it somehow.",

My advise is to use brokers that have been long in the business because they have proved themselves and won't allow their company to go down. There are licensed brokers, so be sure to search for them and ask around to know reputable platforms to trade on so that you can also withdraw your profit when you have one. Surely if it looks too good to be through, you have to be careful.",
