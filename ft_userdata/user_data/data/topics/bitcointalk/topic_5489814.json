  "content": "Hello folks,for personal use I developed a Telegram bot that notifies in a Telegram channel the changes of Bitcoin Core fee estimation.I need it in order to use softwares with automatic fee selection: with this bot I know when I should use these softwares.I track the output changes of the command Code:bitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee 20.It is designed to avoid too much notifications: it sends a message only when the current feerate is the best or the worst of the last 6 hours.This is the channelhttps://t.me/estimatesmartfeeEnjoy itThanks",

Plus the wall observer thread is always there with constant updates thanks to Chartbuddy.As for fees , sincerely I hardly check the Mempool before I make decisions on the best fee to use ever since the creation of the Mempool Observer Topic thanks  to stompix and fee buddy.Also, op how often does the bot send updates on fee rates . ( I am asking about the time interval).",

TryNinja bot relies on mempool.space data. If @inaltoasinistra was able to create a bot that relies on jhoenicke.de or both of them, I think the data would be more accurate. In general, the beginner will not notice any fundamental differences, as both services are good.",

I always see it being the main cause ofmost hacks from people I have heard stories about.It’s better to be safe than sorryDamn, this is a thing in Telegram? How does it even work though? Do you like download some attachments on Telegram or is when you do other things because the only time that I believe that a malware or a virus is a possibility is through what I've mentioned which is the download of attachment files from an unknown sources, that's how it is in most cases and if there's no need to download anything on OP's program and it's just a bot that notifies you of price changes, it's probably all good, I'm not updated to how scammers in Telegram try to get into your phone or any devices so I'm not sure that you'd be totally safe. Regarding the notification thingie by OP, it's a really awesome project for you to do but I hope that you've got more features on it rather than just being a notifier because Coingecko already does this, you know what I'm saying?",

I've been using telegram for 5 years now yet never had any kind of malware both desktop and mobile. To OP, can you tell your sources/API of where the recommended fees shown in the bot?",
