Finding the address you withdrew the funds will obviously not be of too much help. That's not going to help you know which wallet did you use to store the funds, or to access the funds either.",

Quote from: Abilenetxx on April 09, 2024, 02:16:00 PMThank you for the advise I know it sounds to good to be true and lately I've sounded crazy to family and friends when I ask for help with In 2009 I was sitting in the waiting room at Abilene regional hospital when I purchased the Bitcoin I spent 20 dollars on pay palI love how you added the hospital to the story so it hits right in the heart man, I cried like a little baby.. and the family! because you would never lie to your family, so it must be truth! Crème de la crème...Maybe we can exchange wallet files, I bought my coins as well in 2009 for a hundred bucks - at the time I was saving Ethiopian kids with my dying wife... At least some forum people have place to advertise their gambling sites thanks to your posts (your kind of people),",

Do you know how to check if Coinpal is still permanent? I saw a question like this a few days ago outside the forum, and when I tried to do a little search on it, I found out that it has been permanently closed and is no longer being used.  And if you want to see your transaction history, it is impossible to do so if you have your wallet address on the blockchain. If you ask any detailed questions, it will be nice to get an answer.",
