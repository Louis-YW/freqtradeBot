You know, in this space I know there are a lot of devs who are spending money, time and knowledge to develop products that they are really determined to change something.

By the way, I am with FireDAO team, in charge of the global community. Please contact me if you have any question. With Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency giants plus thousands of altcoins in the market is very difficult to stand out from these projects, There are also a lot of projects and tokens getting launched daily, especially in the bear market is also hard to get the support of the community. In my opinion, a different approach or project that solves a different problem would work, we know that bitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies but they have different structures, bitcoin is a form of money that can be used for digital transactions while Ethereum is a different platform for decentralized application and even smart contracts.If you could create a unique project that solves a problem it might work, because that is what the community is looking for, if the project doesn't have any world use it was basically a useless project, Of course, you might get lucky like what happened to meme token but since they don't have any use we are not sure if the community will stay just because of hype or popularity.",

Communities form around teams that are building cutting edge tech and have actual working usecases for them. You can't have a strong community without balanced team and vision. Code that's visionary, mindblowing and setting a new standard. That's something people get behind easily. Also marketing right targets and communicating with the community and having a good pr team that signals your vision clearly.Then there's the fact that there are just not enough people in this space for every medicore project.",

I am not really one of the hardcore fans of Bitcoin and usually I am just like an average user of Bitcoin. For other fans, they surely know the loops around it and that's why they're really devoted into supporting Bitcoin all in all. Maybe try to find what Bitcoin cannot solve and you might get a solid community of supporters? There are tons of shitcoins out there already and non-Bitcoin coins are quite notorious for being just crap so your project might need to excel more than what's expected.",

Your point of view is mainly from drawing speculators' attention and rewarding their \"original\" support, which is useful. Our project is more like a tool oriented DEFI product and hope you'll be interested.

Developers being transparent to other people increases the trust of the investors towards the project. Being honest and answering investor's questions without hiding or lying anything will increase the chances of our project to be a successful one. Marketing of course is the most vital part of every project because you want your project to be heard worldwide, and now that most of the people are spending time on social media, promoting your project has never been that easy.Of course, having these 3 isn't guarantee a success towards your project. You need even more than that. You know that building a project in crypto isn't an easy thing. Good luck.",

I think especially nowadays team members of a project have a very hard time to gather a significant amount of supporters behind their project, because obviously nowadays we have like at least 20 new projects or so appearing each and every day. From those 20 of course at least 19 are useless shitcoins that are dead again within a few days but still those projects also take away attention and money from \"real\" projects.A lot of projects are giving away free tokens via an airdrop where you have to follow the projects twitter and join the telegramm channel and stuff like that, but to be honest i am not convinced, that this is actually worth it.There are hundreds of \"professional\" airdrop hunters out there from poor countries that are just farming every airdrop and then immediately sell it again once they get the tokens.

People that are active as airdrop hunters do not have any loyalty at all. If our project FireDAO  conducts airdrop one day, we should also think about this problem.

Getting community members is quite easy by holding contests with prizes or Airdops, of course there will be many people who become community members in a project. But indeed the most difficult thing is to maintain the continuity of the community as active users in the network. Maybe what you need to pay attention to is how effective and efficient your project network service is with the same project developed by other developers, how big the utility and ecosystem are, whether or not the market needs it, and who you partner with, and one more thing, what are the benefits that you will give to the community as a member of the community.I think those things are a consideration for community members whether to stay or not because basically everyone needs the benefits of mutualism.",

That's the first into building a community where people will gather, if they find an altcoin project good then it will be a natural increase in the fanbase. Another important role of the team behind the project is their activity with their investors. Try to answer as many questions as possible and be polite to every answer. Even if they are repeated queries, a community manager should not get fed up and just answer them directly. I have been in an altcoin project before with a lively Telegram group, most questions are relevant and they are answered quickly by the team. Sometimes it's the old investors that provide the answers if they already knew about it.",

And being unique and the prime mover in the market, maybe there is a big chance that they are going to succeed in the future.",
