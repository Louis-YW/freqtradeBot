In addition, all actions on behalf of the administrator are password protected, that is, each time you are asked for permission to do this, In addition, you can set up regular password changes for greater security.Even inexperienced users can easily figure out the UFW utility that serves as a firewall. In addition, you can encrypt your physical drives and install the minimum programs that you need. Also, with regard to viruses, Linux is considered the most secure system, since there is an opinion that such systems are less popular. But you should not completely rely on this, since everything always depends on the owner of the device, who is responsible for the cleanliness of the system.",

This discouraged hackers, but that does not still mean that there are not malware that are specifically designed for Linux, but better than Windows that have more users and more malware.Quote from: Outhue on November 04, 2022, 06:37:10 AMIs there any other ways I can add more protection to a Linux operating system?Yourself is the extra protection. What you know about how to avoid malware and online attacks can help you, even if using Windows. You can begin having fun with this: Good topics on security and privacyAvoid ads, visit the official URL, avoid unknown sites, avoid torrents. But more ways to avoid online attacks, you can learn many from the above link.",

What I suggest is to read some articles on how to improve your security on what OS you choose and be mindful of what you are doing because that could be an entry point for the attacker",

      "body": "Ultimately it is your choice as to which operating system you decide to use. We all have our own preferences and should feel comfortable using the option we choose. While it's impossible to know whether the Windows or Linux OS offers better security, most experts agree that both are secure enough for most purposes. This is especially true if you use common sense when browsing the web and downloading files. But, it's important to remember that security is more than just operating systems. Running a firewall, using a VPN, and running anti-virus software aren't just for crypto users: they're essential tools for anyone with a computer, no matter what operating system you use. In addition, the security of any system is only as good as its weakest link. If you're using an OS that hasn't been updated in years and has tons of security holes, then it doesn't matter how secure your software is. The same applies to running outdated apps on your system: if there's a big security flaw in your browser or Java, for example, then even if you have the most secure Linux distro in the world installed on your machine, hackers can still exploit that weakness and find a way to get into your system. Therefore, it's important to keep your computer up-to-date and secure on all fronts, not just with software but also by keeping an eye on any security vulnerabilities in the operating system itself.",

I don't think the make/product one uses is reason or security enough. Linux is good and I think unlike window who produce antivirus and other security apps , Linux has too.

Both Windows and Linux operating systems have good firewalls and security features, but Linux is often considered to be more secure due to its open-source nature and the fact that it is less prone to viruses and malware.2. Yes, a properly configured firewall can add more security to crypto software wallets on a PC. It helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the device.3.
