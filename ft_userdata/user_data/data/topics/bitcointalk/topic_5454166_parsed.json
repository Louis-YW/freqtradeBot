People stay in a particular project because they might have discovered the niche they want and somewhere to stay, like here in the forum. Then that will be the part where \"long-term\" is the goal.If you think about it, a quick build project could look better. It's a baby, and are you sure you can take risks with those kinds of projects? I don't think people will jump at that opportunity unless you can.",

      "body": "I have no problem with long-term investments, the problem is that in the crypto world there is no guarantee that a given project will last for a longer period of time. The \"buy it and forget it for years\" approach is very unreasonable to me. Even the most promising projects can face many problems as they develop. I believe that you need to constantly control what is happening with the projects in which we invest and in the world of cryptocurrencies in general. Trends change relatively often, which may be associated with interesting earning opportunities, but also involves the risk of a significant loss of the value of a given asset after a change in the trend.",

Their understanding about \"long term\" is no longer years but weeks.Some project need time to build and shape. What do you think?If it is long-term, it means it could be years. But if it's weeks, it means it's short-term. There may be coins that can provide profits in the short, medium, and long term, but that is difficult to detect because the movement of the coins will depend on the movement of bitcoin. So I guess if you invest in Bitcoin, it can mean investing for the long term. But if you invest in altcoins, it will probably be short- to medium-term.And that's where our patience is tested so that we can really hold Bitcoin and altcoins until it's time for us to sell and make a profit. So be patient if those coins haven't been able to upgrade because if it is a potential coin, it will surely increase one day.",

What do you think?Why not, just that it takes risk going for such decision because some coins will definitely survived through the years and remained profitable while some may drop down along the way due to some internal problems from it developers, that's why investment in altcoins has it own risk higher than on bitcoin because you don't know which cryptocurrency is next in line for going down, but if you take the risk and invested in any and the whole thing turns a testimony, you will never regret taking such decision in life forever because you will earn pretty well.",

A foundation so to speak. If said foundation is so weak it was basically nonexistent, I wouldn't blame investors for trying to avoid the said project. I do understand how some people look at \"long term\" being weeks or months, it's exactly how newbie investors see Bitcoin, kind of unfortunate really. I also wouldn't blame them, that's how I looked at Bitcoin as well initially. On the other hand some projects just pop off all of a sudden and investors come flooding in. That's the moment where they should have released the project, not before. It may be due to lack of funds but hey, investors aren't exactly charity.",

Even btc didn't wait until 10 years before people where able to make profit, rather people made money at different stages as btc advance and grow. My point is, if the person has a different source of revenue and don't depend on returns from the investment they can afford to invest on such long project otherwise there are other options that does not necessarily require such a long period.",

What do you think?If they think that investing is just for mere weeks, they failed as a long term investor. Actually the growth of project/altcoin investment here is too fast compared to traditional investment which literally took years for your investment to get a significant amount of profit. I guess the cryptocurrency volatility is what makes them think that a long term investment will only need weeks to grow. We invest on the project product and that kind of product doesn't come in an instant and some product take years to create or build. Investing on that kind of real project is what long term investment is. When the time comes that they grow, you also grow.",

Investors is just maximizing the opportunity to enter on trending project rather than make their capital stagnant on an asset that still building since they can enter once the already started. It’s not that big profit if they enter early but that 1 year duration can give tons of profit when invested on right project is on hype.Quote from: FireDAO CY on May 27, 2023, 08:10:52 AMSome project need time to build and shape.

That's we still have like Ethereum or even Litecoin or we can consider Doge (although meme coin), part of that group.But now, with a lot of projects being tossed around and literally thousand of them in the crypto space, for sure there are investors who don't understand that but just wanted to make quick money in the market now. And most likely this is a meme coin or shit coin, a good example is $pepe which I read that someone become a millionaire.

Because in the past, there were not many investors in the market and it was very easy to make money. When we look at the current order, it became difficult to earn money as the number of investors increased. In the same way, when we look at the past periods, we see that the market evolves very quickly, so many projects are wasted in the long run and this causes loss of money. For this reason, I prefer to take profit in the short term instead of the long term, except for marginal cryptocurrencies, including me.",

It is better to invest in short term project for fast earning. We can't blame investors nowadays for having a hard time trusting new projects when it comes to long term investment. We've been through a lot that made us gain trust issues since most long term projects before have turned into bubble after a long time of waiting. Only a few could take the risks these days and they're only risking on well established coins. If there will be short term profit opportunities then it would be better to grab and invest on it than letting our funds sleep without any assurance of gaining profit in the future not unless we're going to invest it with coins with a strong foundation like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB and more.
