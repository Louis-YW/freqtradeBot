Those that gives you full control over your wallet, you have your key and phrase and they are open source which their code could also be verified by other developer. For security reasons we should avoid custodial wallets, checking their terms and conditions might be useless because they can be change them when ever they have your money under their control, so just avoid them even when they say no KYC, trusting a 3rd party with your holdings is a very risky thing to do.",

To be sincere I do find this topic funny.Op, you should start by researching the difference between wallet and exchanges... I guess what you read about or referring to is an exchange and not a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet.Same here, but I think that the Op is confused about something here. Kyc(know your customer) is mostly used by exchanges or crypto accounts and not wallets. Using kyc exchanges sometimes is a choice that depends on  the individuals goal and specific use cases eg business purpose. and such for someone new to the crypto verse, the non-custodial wallets are usually suitable since you just want to store or hodl  cryptocurrency.Since hardware wallets are expensive, it is sometimes adviced for users to use a non custodial wallets which require no kyc, and is less expensive. you just  have to download from legit source (play store, or their original website) and then install on your device with few mobile data. Quote from: Mia Chloe on July 05, 2023, 03:40:38 PM kyc puts you personal information and privacy at risk it also gives ability for your transactions to be monitored.So please before making wallet registrations always read through terms and conditions as well as privacy policyIt is not advisable to use kyc required platform as it puts your identity at risk. Here is a thread that explains fully why you should avoid kyc Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless",

It's really funny seeing newbie advising newbies but that doesn't matter anymore since some of these newbies accounts are being operated by some high rank members as alt.Creating post is not actually a bad idea because Practice makes one to be perfect. Maybe OP finds it difficult to locate a thread that's a compatible with what he wants to say and decided to create a thread. Op, You should embark on research before you attempt to advice others.",

      "body": "While software wallets whose source are verifiable and open-source are entirely safe to use but on the other hand hardware wallets such as Ledger require us to do KYC to use quite a few of their features and for receiving the wallet on the customer end. Some libertarians such as Lopp has went to greater extremes to own a house to receive hardware wallets and to do the KYC. Through this way, they should be able to maximize their anonymity thereby feeling safer from hacks which has happened in Ledger at the past.I would recommend if someone is planning to own a large sum of Bitcoin, they should be opting out the Lopp's way of hiding one's identity as we can never be sure or trust centralized companies such as Ledger, Trezor or Keepkey with our information. When Ledger's email and address database leaked, many individuals who had purchased wallets from the website were contacted by scammers and were threatened in the process. On top of that if you really want to maximize your anonymity and be safer from hacks while dealing with large amount of bitcoin, it would be better to use open source OS's such as Linux too.Nowadays storing seed words on cloud storages has been increasingly dangerous as the company providing such services has the ability to always work towards governments and seize our digital assets.",

That address can be used to receive and send coins from or to other addresses. But you don't have control over the wallet that generated the address because you don't have the keys. The exchange keeps your funds so they might decide to release or hold your funds at any point. The exchanges are custodians of your assets because you don't have the keys. But when you have the keys to your wallet and no third party is holding them, you are using a non-custodians wallet. No third party is in custody of your funds. You should also know that there are closed and open-sourced wallets. The best ones to use are open-sourced wallets.",

So your privacy will be compensated only when you transfer funds from KYCed address to your wallet address since it will bring the connection between two and it will never be erased since every data on blockchain is available in a public ledger.FYI, bitcoin is not really created to bring complete privacy while there are other cryptos has such characteristics but bitcoin is Pseudo anonymous.",
