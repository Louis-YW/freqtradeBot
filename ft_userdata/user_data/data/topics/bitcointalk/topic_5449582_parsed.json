All this makes different opinion of bitcoin to them why it should not stay. Countries also have view it in different direction of affecting economy and capitalism system, some sees it in a positive direction while others sees it as negative threats to the country's economy.But most believe the bitcoin to be best when considering many other offers. We see what other can't see in bitcoin, we trust bitcoin to improve standard of living, we keep buying for the project to survive threats. But we never ask what if the whole stuff varnish overnight?What is your reason why bitcoin should stay in the next 100 years! when the government are worried about it?Maybe our opinions about bitcoin can give hedge to the government.",

Unbanked on internet.  Have you seen how many people complain about Paypal's fees, Terms of service and how they reserve to freeze funds and do whatever their want? The future without Bitcoin and other decentralized assets would be like that, but even worse.Either accept whatever they want you to accept or suffer economical starving and isolation. Since I got into Bitcoin, I have ditched Paypal and I don't have any plans to go back there.",

It's really proven and tested, especially in the long-term issue, try to see, as time goes on or time passes, the value of bitcoin continues to increase in the market. Take note that there are many other countries that are hindering the concept of bitcoin in terms of blockchain technology, but they cannot subdue and control it, meaning that bitcoin actually has something that the majority do not have.",

I am no longer deeply focused on making money using fiat currency, but also with bitcoin as a main and other cryptocurrencies. I believe that blockchain technology will eventually dominate the financial world in the future, as it is simple and secure without the need for a third party to handle your money, such banks or any other platforms. A lot of people be complaining about banks fees and TOS and aswell as some people don't want to share their identity with any of those companies so the better way is to use Bitcoin since you'd be anonym and no one would ask you for your name or your age.. etc.In addition to that, Bitcoin can serve as an extra source of income and can also be a great long-term investment due to its security. It is remarkable that Bitcoin is very secure as I never heard that it got hacked since 2009, and I'm really convinced that it will gain tremendous value in the future and it'll be very precious.",

Bitcoin was created for a reason and for a purpose, which in turns as an alternatives to fiats to accelerate and foster the payments system whenever there seems to be a barrier in the banking sectors. Just as what have happened across Silvergate bank and among other banks is sole purpose why bitcoin should stay, bitcoin have really given us a financial freedom whereby you controlled a total assets you own with or without you visiting the bank for a transaction that won't take you 2 seconds but you will queue up to gets to your turns for the payment to processed, most times which may result so much questioning about your sources of income.That is not even enough the banks and government keep stealing our funds directly or indirectly via charges, but with bitcoin you don't go through those stages.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 20, 2023, 01:55:13 PMGenerally everybody have of opinion of bitcoin or cryptocurrency, I guess that's why some people do not care to invest or trade, most people also had once invest and failed probably loss their money. All this makes different opinion of bitcoin to them why it should not stay. In all investment, it is said everyone is liable for their lost and i believe they aren't educated enough before making their investment or do i say they haven't fully accept the risk involved in investment.",

Nothing beats that.In the past couple of years as a result of investing in Bitcoin, I have experienced financial freedom in the shortest time beyond my wildest imagination. I have gone from looking forward to a paycheck at the end of every 28 days to having employees in my payroll.I don't even worry about inflation. What's that? I am living my best life (a digital nomad) not a perfect one but a happy one filled with fulfilment and satisfaction because of Bitcoin. This is why I want Bitcoin to stay.",

What benefit does the government gain from Bitcoin? Nothing. They get nothing from Bitcoin. They are losing income because of Bitcoin. If you hold your funds in a bank, they know how much money you have. They can charge tax over your holdings. Moreover, Banks give your money to someone else as a loan, and they take profits from them. So, If you hold your money in the bank, they can do business with your money. Now, If you use Bitcoin and don't use Bank anymore, Banks won't know how much you have, and they cannot charge tax. They cannot do business with your money. You should understand why Banks and The Government don't want Bitcoin to stay. After all the point I've discussed, what do you think? Why I want Bitcoin to stay?",

Until newbies understand that BTC is not a pot of Gold, quick to rich scheme and their basic fundamental knowledge about BTC is what will make them thrive in BTC investment they will always fail in their crypto journey.What BTC presented is the benefit and it is now left to every crypto investor to make the right decision to make fortune through the benefit BTC presented.
