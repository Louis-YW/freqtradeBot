But can you tell me, why would you want to trade with altcoins, when you already have bitcoins? Do you know the risks it can bring you? especially new altcoins you want to find them on uniswap or pancakeswap exchanges? You should do your research carefully before deciding to invest or trade with altcoins, unlike bitcoin, they are very volatile and the risk can even disappear after just a few days of launch. I advise you to research everything carefully before making a decision.",

I don't understand those who neglect cold wallet when interacting with different services and use only browser or mobile wallets.Keep all valuable NFT and altcoins in cold wallet, use metamask in browser to swap and exchange small transactions. If you want to sign messages to access some seris, exchanges, etc, you can also use a separate wallet in the same metamask for that. Although there are coins and wallets without EVM-compatibility, but if such blockchains are used, it is better to use their official wallets, not wallets like Trust Wallet, Atomic wallet, etc.",
