I heard it's just like having a PC in a tiny shape. It's possible, since it is a small form-factor PC, so it runs basically any Linux software.I would probably recommend to use Electrum or Sparrow, but I'm not sure why you'd want to do that.One reason, as jackg suggested, is if you fear that your main machine is fully virus-infected and don't want to risk getting your coins stolen. Or you may want to run a full node without consuming too much power.I don't think that in the first situation, storing BTC on a Raspberry Pi is the best solution, though. It has the same attack surface as any other online computer and it will be cumbersome to use, since you'll need to SSH into it every time you make a payment.For everyday payments, I find hardware wallets to have the best offer in terms of usability and security: you can use them with different devices (at home, at work, with the phone, etc.) and they're more secure than storing BTC directly on computers and phones.If you want something for long-term 'HODL' storage, you don't even need a 'wallet' at all. You can create a Tails USB stick, boot off of it, open Electrum (preinstalled), create a Bitcoin seed and write it on paper or metal. Also write down a few addresses. Then shut the computer down and you have a fully offline, never-touched-a-live-system seed that you can use in the far future to access any coins sent to those written down addresses.",

Windows has a lot of pre-installed software that could be a problem with privacy and security. What's worse is that you couldn't uninstall some of them without doing registry stuff.",

Honestly, that's mostly just a prepackaged Linux OS with Bitcoin Core installed. I'd recommend to just do it yourself.If you want the benefits of a prepackaged OS for single-board computers, better use something like Umbrel that also gets you a complete 'self-sovereignty app store' with useful privacy software such as Pi-hole, self-hosted image database and of course Lightning Network, amongst many others.",

Then you are doing something wrong. Maybe your OS boots from a HDD and that is its biggest obstacle. I am using 3 different laptops (sometimes 4) depending on where I am and what I do. All run Windows and none of them have problems while booting. Only one of them has 16GB or RAM, the others have 8GB. 3/4 have SSDs and the one without it only has a HDD. The HDD machine is of course significantly slower, but that's because of the old HDD, not Windows.",

Most runtimes such as Python build aarch64 versions as well, and Bitcoin Core has one too, but wallets that come in AppImages probably will *not* work.If you limit yourself to precompiled binaries, sure. But I'd generally advise against downloading binaries and recommend building everything from source, like in my full node install guide. If you build from source, it will always run on ARM (of course if it doesn't rely on some random binary as dependency).Quote from: DaveF on May 08, 2022, 11:24:59 AMAs as been discussed over here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364742Older laptops are probably the way to go.

Save them from e-waste and save some money. But honestly, I'd do this for running a node, maybe even for Lightning nodes, sure, but not as a daily wallet.Especially if you don't already own the hardware. If OP has $100+ to spare for a Raspberry Pi (or laptop) setup, he might just as well get a Trezor One or save up a little more for a Passport; both reproducible by Wallet Scrutiny.",

If YES is raspberry PI safe for running crypto wallets?Yes, it's entirely possible, but whether or not it is safe depends entirely on how you use it.What are you trying to gain out of setting up a wallet on a Pi? Is this a wallet you are going to only be using inside your own home, or are you going to be taking it places with you? Are you going to connect it to the internet directly, or are you going to be using it in a permanently airgapped set up? Are you using it for cold storage which you rarely access, or will you be spending from it weekly or even daily?I think most of the use cases can be better served by other devices. A hardware wallet which can link with a phone is much more practical for on-the-go spending than a RPi. For a cold wallet, although it is indeed easier to keep a RPi permanently airgapped, my problem here is that people usually share peripherals between live systems and RPis, such as keyboards, mice, monitors, webcams, which poses a security risk for an airgapped set up. Better to use an old laptop which is entirely contained and does not require any additional hardware to be connected.",

      "body": "I tried using Raspberry Pi's as airgapped cold storage but it did not work as expected.  The cost of a Pi that is able to run wallets without long waiting times is close to or higher than a Hardware Wallet like Trezor is, which to me immediately makes the idea of purchasing a Pi for airgapped cold storage obsolete.  I still tried however, just for fun, which in turn ended up as an annoying experience of me trying to get wallets working since I fully forgot architecture was a thing.I would rather purchase an old computer off eBay, get a keyboard, an old monitor and a mouse and use that one instead.  You can get 64-bit, upgrade to more RAM, SSD or HDD and many other things, all for the cost of a decently running Pi.  More over, you can even get your preferred Operating System running on it.  And if you think about theft, if I was a thief I would rather steal an interestingly looking computer board than a 2008 brick.-Regards.PrivacyG",

Sure, lot's of people are using raspberry pi devices for bitcoin wallets, or even for making DIY signing devices that work similar like hardware wallets.Regular Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 400 can be used like any desktop computer with Linux operating system and you can install Electrum wallet or most other wallets including apps for Trezor and other hardware wallets.There is also project called SeedSigner that uses Raspberry Pi Zero for creating open source air-gapped device, and popularity among bitcoiners for this is growing every day.",
