  "content": "Hello everyone, I am SZ, and I am from mainland China. This week, I spent about $26,000 to purchase my first Bitcoin, or to be precise, 1.12 Bitcoins. I am very happy and have stored it in a cold wallet that no one knows about, not even my wife.I am thrilled to become a Bitcoin holder and part of the Bitcoin community. I have been following digital currency since 2021 and have bought some stable coins but never owned Bitcoin until this week. My small wish has finally come true, and I am very happy.As a person from mainland China, it is not easy to come to this forum smoothly and safely, and I won't discuss political issues. My friends around me know about Bitcoin, but many of them do not fully understand and hold Bitcoin, which is regrettable. I try to inform all of my good friends to hold Bitcoin, but it's only a suggestion.Bitcoin has a magical power. In just two years, it has made me a super fan, and I respect and believe in it. As for my purpose of holding Bitcoin, I do not expect it to skyrocket to a certain price in my mind. I just like it.Just like when you like a girl or a boy, there is no reason, you just like them.In the coming days, in addition to loving life and working hard, I have a new personal hobby, which is to accumulate Bitcoin. I hope to reach a two-digit number of Bitcoins, which is my next small goal. For early investors in digital currency, it may be easy to achieve, but for someone like me who is not wealthy, it may take a long time. However, the process is fascinating, isn't it?All of my Bitcoin purchase funds come from my pocket money. I have reduced my travel frequency, unnecessary expenses, and purchases of clothes, shoes, or other electronics. In short, I am very happy. Holding one Bitcoin makes me feel like I am walking on the street with the wind at my back.This post is used to record my first Bitcoin in my life and my first post on a Bitcoin forum. Perhaps in 10 years or 50 years, it will still be fascinating.",

It truly allows for personal assets to be sacred and inviolable, truly belonging to oneself. I believe that there are many Bitcoin users with double or triple-digit quantities, especially in China. However, they may not be holding it for storage purposes, but rather to sell at higher prices, primarily for speculative investments. Nonetheless, I think they would also keep some Bitcoin for themselves.Furthermore, I think it's up to individuals to decide how they want to handle their investments, and we should focus on managing our own.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Actually, I believe that it's not important how many bitcoins you own, what's important is that you truly own it from 0 to 1. I will definitely hold it for more than 20 years, that's for sure.If you think the price of bitcoin is high now, then when you come back to read this post in 5 years, you will feel that its current price is very low. Of course, holding bitcoin is a long-term commitment. You can accumulate it slowly by depositing a certain amount of bitcoin every week according to your income. Bitcoin has never disappointed anyone in the last 10 years.I wish you all the best.",

For early investors in digital currency, it may be easy to achieve, but for someone like me who is not wealthy, it may take a long time. However, the process is fascinating, isn't it?Two digit number of Bitcoins is a small goal?  Then you got a big future ahead.  If this is a small goal, most of us will consider you wealthy already too.It is actually not easy even for an early Bitcoin investor to achieve two digits.  Two digits of Bitcoin years ago were a thousand or even just a hundred if you go back to 2012.  It was worth almost 'nothing' at the time.  You think they all held until Bitcoin touched $24,000?  I do not.  Many of them sold way before then.Remember.  We all have things we need.  Maybe a car.  Maybe a house.  Maybe starting a business.  Some people hold up to a particular price and then sell their Bitcoin to fulfill their needs.It will be just as hard for you to hold on to your Bitcoin up to $1,000,000.  The higher it gets.  The more tempted you are to sell and spend it.  'Enough' is subjective.  What is enough for you may not be for me.-Regards,PrivacyGI have been onto Bitcoin since 2017 and I can boldly say that selling Bitcoin to buy what you need in life or start a business always comes with a regret later especially if you like and support Bitcoin so much, the best strategy to never be out of Bitcoin and still build your dream business in life is using bear and bull market to your advantage. Buy Bitcoin in bear market and sell in a bull market, use part of the money to achieve your life goals and wait for another bear market to buy Bitcoin right back again. This way, you are not entirely out of Bitcoin and you also keep growing in life.",

My friends around me know about Bitcoin, but many of them do not fully understand and hold Bitcoin, which is regrettable. I try to inform all of my good friends to hold Bitcoin, but it's only a suggestion.Bitcoin is not every ones cup of coffee and that is perfectly alright. As you have done, you can only suggest to your friends to hold some bitcoin or learn more about it, but the final decision is theirs to make.You can visit the 中文 (Chinese) local board and discuss with like minded people from your region.You seem to already have the general idea of how the whole things works and experience dealing with cryptocurrencies. This would make your stay on the forum more meaningful and I look forward to learning more from you and possibly also acquiring 1 whole BTC sometime in the future.Quote from: zhangshuo163 on February 24, 2023, 07:56:45 AMAs for my purpose of holding Bitcoin, I do not expect it to skyrocket to a certain price in my mind. I just like it.Just like when you like a girl or a boy, there is no reason, you just like them.There technically have to be a reason to throw in $26,000 on an asset besides just liking it... Are you attracted to the freedom it offers or transacting without regulations, or some other feature?- Jay -Yes hopefully the OP knows of the benefits of HODLing and using Bitcoin, for example:Store or wealthStoring large amounts of wealth relatively inconspicuously Control of funds 24/7/365Security of funds when secured and stored correctlySecurity of the Bitcoin networkGlobal transportability of large amounts of funds over all bordersall the above at the same time Well done to the OP buying 1 Bitcoin is not easy or achievable by the majority of people.Very good move by the OP.",

Yes, this is for security only, and you can leave a note about how they can use your bitcoins later. This will help them to understand how bitcoin works in case you can't be there for them, and hopefully, they will be able to use it properly without you.While you still have time to accumulate more bitcoins, you can use them to buy more bitcoins at this point.",

I'm hoping that you took into account Bitcoin's volatility and don't panic during the first crash that the market may experience in the future, while at the same time you didn't take extreme measures in order to conduct such a purchase (you mentioned pocket money, but there are other newbies that resorted to loans).As others have already mentioned, invest in a hardware wallet; they are extremely affordable and reputable brands are starting from as little as $70.",

I might just want to suggest, be careful in storing and using your wallet, nothing I'm just worried about the unwanted (hopefully that never happens). I am very happy when I hear that someone has managed to muster up the courage to own bitcoin, because in my opinion what you are doing is a very brave thing, because not everyone can do that. I'm sure you have considered everything before you finally decide to buy your first bitcoin. Once again, congrats.",
