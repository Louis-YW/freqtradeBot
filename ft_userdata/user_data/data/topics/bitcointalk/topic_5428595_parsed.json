  "content": "Last month a friend bought a phone from a merchant that offers Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) program. In fact it wasn't planned. Her phone had just gotten broken that morning and she had to get another one ASAP so as not to miss an important deal. She made initial deposit and then a repayment plan plus interests of 6months. Before I go on, what is Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)?QuoteA buy now, pay later plan (BNPL) is a loan offered to a customer at the point of sale so they can purchase merchandise on credit but without a credit card. Popular options include Shop Pay Installments from Shopify, Affirm, Afterpay, Sezzle, PayPal, and Klarna. Many will run an instant soft credit check on the customer (the type that doesn’t affect your credit score), and then release funds for a point-of-sale loan. Customers have different options for paying off the loan balance, which typically depend on the company used and the amount borrowed; some payment options incur interest, but others do not, and some companies charge late fees or fees for missed payments. BNPL companies may offset the lack of interest charged to the consumer with a fee that they charge the retailer. Okay, back to the main gist. If she fails to make repayment on the loan plus interest within the said date every month, her access to most of the functionalities on the device will be locked. Since then she has been thinking, who really benefits from the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) -  the customer,  the company or the BNPL vendor(third-party credit specialists that manage the BNPL program)?",

No risk of missed payment. 3. The BNPL company acquired an asset (loan is considered as an asset in banking) and earning interest on that. So no one is at loss really.

There are probably banks behind this that sponsor the program and give part of the interest the consumer pays over to the merchant, but it isn't the traditional mortgage or car loan debt burden. It's often predatory, high interest rates if the consumer misses a payment and people that aren't great with their finances are more inclined to take on loans that eventually pile.Is it worth taking a loan for low ticket items that you're forced to pay interest on?",

      "body": "Buy now pay later financing deals allow consumers to pay over time with no interest charges. It's a logical thing. It is possible to be approved for this type of financing, even if you are deprived of other loan options because of your low credit rating. BNPL loans do not increase your credit card debt and normally do not affect your credit score. The downside is that buying BNPL and paying it back also prevents you from building a good credit score. You also miss out on the benefits that credit cards offer. Like reward points and cash back. Things can get complicated if you want to return an item you purchased with BNPL. However, using BNPL in an inflationary environment is profitable.",

Of course, this is business, if people aren't well-aware and disciplined with their expenses then they will suffer the burden of paying the interest. We should be using the BNPL only if it is very important. If the phone is broken and there is no money to buy another one with cash then that is the time BNPL should be used. But still, avoid the expensive ones. Personally, I will not use this BNPL, I prefer to pay cash even if it is a downgrade to the item I like to buy.",

The buyer doesn't have bulk money to pay for the phone at once but this package grants him the opportunity of owning a phone. That's the customer's benefit.

But according to OP, his friend needs the phone urgently to enable her take advantage of a profitable opportunity. It is possible that the benefit of the business she needs the phone for outweighs the consequences of the credit facilities. I know of people that would loose huge amount of money if they don't have access to their phone for few days. It would be wrong to buy or get a phone on credit just for pleasure.",

Some customers find BNPL more appealing than paying instantly for the service ( which I don’t think it’s necessary, if you can afford it, then pay immediately). I don’t see the big economical advantage of BNPL for the customer, the interest may be higher if the repayment plan is longer than 3months so it’s best to keep a payment plan of 3 months or less in order not to incur more expenses.",

Those who do not understand what exactly BNPL is and how it works then they should not really use it. BNPL is not offered by any third services out of the blue. The funding is provided by major finance companies and banks to the third party services who are \"agents\" and get commission for bringing such potential customers. These all services are linked to or traced back to your CIBIL!!That's most critical part of your life if you know what it is. If she misses payment then her status will turn to defaulter and same will reflect in her CIBIL report.Missed a small repayment of phone? No issues, CIBIL got you covered. Now, the day comes when she wants to buy her dream house and go to the bank for loan application. Oops, it just got rejected, know why? Well because she missed repayment on BNPL!!That's why not funny. And as far as recovery is considered its insured by reserve banks. That's entirely different book subject.",

The customer (your friend) got to purchase a phone immediately when she apparently did not have credit to buy one outright, the loan company was able to benefit because they made a (hopefully) small interest rate for agreeing to be an intermediary party who shoulders some of the financial risk and the phone manufacturer benefits from this setup because they're able to sell additional phones while another party takes on most of the risk. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement, as long as the interest rate and phone price are not jacked up too high. This goes to show the benefit of having an \"emergency fund\" for cases like this instead of having to rely on borrowed money.",
