  "content": "I was using coinplaza a few times last year. If I can remember correctly, I have seen the maximum daily limit without KYC back in the days when I used was around 100 EURO or a maximum of 200 EURO even if I'm wrong with my 1st guess. But today, when I went to exchange a little amount of BTC for USDT, I just noticed the limit is 20000 EURO a day without KYC. Since when they changed this? Do you think it's trusted enough to have a big amount of exchange here? Have you used it recently, if yes, what was the maximum amount you exchanged here?",

Maybe the point is what he can use for various operations throughout the day. Anyway, the number is huge.Advice to everyone not to use these platforms to exchange large sums of money. There are no guarantees that the platform will not freeze the amount or request files to prove identity. Coinplaza has been in operation for years and I have not heard any complaints about it. I used it many times in the past but left it after the high transfer fees.",

Do not trust instant exchangesI have used this exchange a few times but have never used it for a bigger amount as I said in the OP. They have increased the limit which is making a concern, I have never seen such a service offer such a high limit without KYC. They claim themself a non-custodial too but that's funny lol.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 12, 2022, 09:56:30 AMPersonally i would recommend you to also ask this question on their ANN thread[1] or use more popular/trusted exchange.--snip--[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5093055.0Their representative has been active since February 2021, I think it's not going to work since they are not active here.

I will recommend you select a reputable no-KYC exchange from their list since they always do some reviews on their exchange list.",
