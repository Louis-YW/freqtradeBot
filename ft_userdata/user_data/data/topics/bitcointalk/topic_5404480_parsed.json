Stop and think for a moment. Why whould anyone pay 13% per month to investors when he can borow money from bank at ~~10% per year... Why would anyone want to borrow money at all if he has a way generate more than 13% per month (investors interest rates plus his profit). Quote from: markvin on June 29, 2022, 10:40:40 AMTheir plans seem to be serious. They even do co-financing.You are right. Its serious because their plan is to scam investors.",

This project is very new to me hence i cant say much. And don't forget to apply the golden rule of investing in crypto projects - which is invest what you are willing to loss.However, if you are looking for a good staking platform, you can also check mycointainer out, they have been around for some time, the apy% for staking is reasonable, always do your own research beside what other people may suggest.",

It's impossible something like this is legit, stay away.Operating crpyto platforms paying interest rates stay around 8% yearly (over solid cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum), with the best packages disponible, which don't come without counterpart, usually involves investing in a native token with large sums of money.I see Intelfin built their scheme using the trading bot excuse to justify absurd profitability. However, even bots can fail and lead to losses, therefore the platform is lying when offering those returns.Moreover, I see typical scammers' giveaways on their twitter, distributing 350$ to 7 winners quite often. That is a strategy to grab attention for the scheme, creating a sudden hype where enthusiasts start believing it's easy to earn generous amounts of money there.",

Here's the firm’s link: You need to use your common sense, 13% per month means a yearly profit of 433%, you do not need to be a genius to know that if someone could obtain those kind of profits with regularity then they will not need to get money out of anyone else since they could use their own money, sell their assets or get a loan from a bank and then become millionaires in just a few years, in fact if you only had 10k you will only need a little bit more than 3 years to become a millionaire, so if those facts do not tell you this is a scam then there is no way we can help you.",

Never put your money on such sites. 13% per month, this indicates that this is just a ridiculous temptation to deceive people and attract them to this dubious site. I advise you to invest in good currencies and stake them on famous exchanges and take reasonable profits without the slightest fear. Never risk your money in fake companies that no one knows or whose link was sent to you via email or telegram, many innocent people lost their money due to rushing and not taking people's advice.",
