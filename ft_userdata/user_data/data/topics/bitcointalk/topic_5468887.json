Back then I believed it was one of those investment schemes that usually crash within a short period of time . My friend tried everything he could to make me understand that bitcoin is the future of money, but I gave him no listening ears, he got tired of talking to me about bitcoin. I was waiting patiently for the day he will come crying to me that bitcoin has crashed and all his investments gone. But to my biggest surprise and to my loss, I have been waiting for over a decade now and bitcoin has never crashed instead it has been gaining popularity and global adoption. My friend who first told me about bitcoin is now a millionaire in dollars. This happened before my very eyes and I have been a regret for not listening to him when he was talking to me about bitcoin.

In reality we are still early. So, no panic. Just understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, learn how it works, engage with other bitcoiners, stack sats following the best practices and you will be good. None of us can be compared with old-school bitcoin stackers that accumulated before 2016-2017. However, in 2030, no newbie will be compared with us who buy bitcoin now.Cheers!",

It's a shame because if you had invested in Bitcoin right when your friend asked you to invest in Bitcoin, you could be a millionaire right now. Anyway there is no reason to regret as you have realized your mistake so you should invest in Bitcoin now because this is the best time to invest in Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin halving will happen next year in 2024, many experts believe that Bitcoin will go above $100k next year in 2025. So if you want to grab the golden opportunity ahead, you should invest in Bitcoin as soon as possible without delay. You will be wiser if you invest in Bitcoin than regrets.",

Ask yourself if you would have really become a millionaire if you had bought Bitcoin then, because if you had done it at the beginning of 2013, you would have paid only about $13 for 1 BTC, but by the end of that year the price had reached even $950. Could you refrain from selling considering that it is a very big profit? What I want to say is that you could have made a lot of bad (wrong) moves in that period, and nothing would have changed in your life to this day.

Only then will people believe what you say is true, otherwise you are just wasting your time.My advice, you should focus on changing yourself because it's never too late to start with bitcoin. Don't try to be a good person when you can't even take care of yourself. By the way, I see you always repeat that you will help people understand bitcoin, but I don't see you mention that you invest in bitcoin, have you invested in bitcoin?",

He could have sold at a loss at the first market downturn. At that time, when the price was at $13 very few could have imagined that in a few years it would be worth thousands, and, many sold at the next milestone with a few profits, others at a loss and only a select few had enough long term vision to hold at least part of their holdings for several cycles. Examples of this can be seen on the forum, where people who knew about bitcoin and this forum in 2013 or earlier are not rich. I myself knew about them in 2017 and I am not a millionaire, although I am better off, that's for sure.",

The price of Bitcoin has increased and it can make someone a millionaire depending on how much you invest. But it is also good that you have decided to adopt bitcoin. You can not change the future but you can maximize the present opportunity. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and still has the potential to keep growing in price and adoption. It was also great that you have decided to spread bitcoin awareness in your locality.  But ensure you teach them that bitcoin is not a money doubling or a get-rich scheme. As you are already aware it took your friend one decade to become a millionaire from his bitcoin investment. They should also know about wallets and how to protect it. Teach them about privacy cybersecurity and the concept of not your keys, not your coin.  I can see that this is your first post, thank you for sharing, and enjoy the forum.",

Because you could say that at that time you had wasted a golden opportunity to change your financial situation for the better. Even if I were in your position, I would definitely have the same regrets. But even so, continuing to think about regrets will not change anything. Therefore, I really agree with what you are doing now by daring to enter the realm of bitcoin investment/trading. Because even though you just realized it and have just started (investing in bitcoin), believe me the steps you have just taken now are not too late. So, make the experience you went through as a valuable lesson and make this experience a motivation in the bitcoin investment you are currently making.Quote from: Justbillywitt on October 02, 2023, 12:32:41 PMI decided to take the bold step to adopt bitcoin and spread the knowledge to others.~SnipTaking the decision to spread bitcoin to the wider community is indeed a very good action. However, in my personal opinion, at this stage you should first focus on carrying out and studying the science of investing/trading Bitcoin thoroughly. Because you need to know that spreading bitcoin or giving bitcoin ideology to the public is very troublesome. But if you really enjoy doing this (spreading bitcoins), and you are ready for the consequences, then do it.And welcome to this BTT forum, friend, I hope you can contribute well to this forum.",

They do not trust bitcoins and are waiting for it to crash.- The second category who are earning well, trying to look for something to invest in, but do not just trust bitcoins and are looking to invest in other things except bitcoins because they expect that sooner or later, they will be validated for making the right decision of not investing in bitcoins because of it's crash.- Then the third category who are still struggling to earn, do not yet even have enough to invest but because of ignorance or misinformation just believe that bitcoins will crash.I have pity for third category because they are ignorant that investment in bitcoins offers then good opportunities to level up, by investing the little they have in a strategic way.
