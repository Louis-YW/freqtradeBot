  "content": "There are many privacy coins on the market each with their own features and approach towards privacy. I've read about various obfuscation methods such as CoinJoin, ZKPs (Zero Knowledge Proofs), RingCT, and Mimblewimble. Yet, I'm wondering which of these techniques is the strongest in terms of preserving your utmost financial privacy and anonymity. Is it the one used by Monero (RingCT + Confidential Transactions), Zcash (ZKPs) or Grin (Mimblewimble)? Please enlighten me. A detailed overview among the strongest/weakest points of said privacy techniques would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

IIRC, there is a thread on Bitcointalk that compare most of the privacy-coin methods and technique, does anyone have the link? Because AFAIK, for example, as you stated, that Zcash used zero-knowledge proofs, but the subset of it was also used by Monero and Grin. So it should be noted that ZKPs, were generally used in privacy coins, specifically, Bulletproofs for Monero and Range Proofs for Grin. I don't know what specific techniques that are implemented on Zcash.",

Based on what you've described here, does that mean Zcash has the strongest privacy technique? If that's the case, I'm surprised to see XMR being hailed as the #1 privacy coin in the world. ZEC's limited supply (21m like Bitcoin) and innovative approach to privacy/anonymity should've made it one of the most valuable crypto coins on the market today. It's very undervalued to say the least. The majority are not focused on privacy coins these days, so don't expect things to improve anytime soon. I'm yet to see if developers will launch new privacy coins that will challenge existing ones in the future. The lack of innovation in the privacy space, tells us developers are afraid of increasing regulatory pressure. It's likely privacy coins will remain a niche forever. At least, people have a choice. As long as decentralization wins, nothing else matters.",

It's likely privacy coins will remain a niche forever. That is simply a sheer bull. There is no lack of innovation in privacy spaces, and developers are not scared of regulatory pressure. Monero specifically is still openly researching financial privacy (https://www.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/).The lack of \"innovation\" is simply because privacy coins can't be easily pumped and dumped. It has real utility, so please make a distinction with the regular Web 3 project.",

It's very undervalued to say the least. The majority are not focused on privacy coins these days, so don't expect things to improve anytime soon. Zcash was disgusting at launch. It used a zero-knowledge proof with a trusted setup. In simple words, the people who were involved in the launch could break the protocol, if cooperated, hence the trust. I find it unacceptable for a cryptocurrency.This is not the case nowadays, since they authored a new ZKP named halo2.Quote from: Abiky on October 18, 2023, 11:05:35 AMI'm yet to see if developers will launch new privacy coins that will challenge existing ones in the future.

As long as decentralization wins, nothing else matters. Folk are working. For example, there is a decent paper Zexe: Enabling Decentralized Private Computation that generalizes what Zcash accomplished. BTW, they also discuss regulations  It was written in 2018, and they still work on a new blockchain.

Why would Monero be much easier to use than Zcash? I'd say XMR is harder to understand than ZEC because of the way it's designed. It uses three keys instead of two used by coins like Zcash and the others (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc). ZEC only has shielded addresses, whereas Monero has a public key/address, a spend key, and a view key. If you want someone else to view your transaction history, you'd need to share your view key to do that. Using only the public key won't suffice. It takes quite a bit of understanding to get your way through the XMR blockchain. And it's even worse with Mimblewimble coins such as Grin, BEAM, and Litecoin (yes, Litecoin added said privacy feature some time ago). I think that's one of the reasons why privacy coins are very unpopular. At least, there are plenty of options to choose from.

My current area of research is, how much there is room for privacy on a scalable programmable proof-of-stake blockchain, and what trade-offs to make among the four.In addition to my first message, there is one more criterion to consider: future-proofness. Can a scientific or technical progress pose a threat for privacy of your past actions?- CoinJoin transaction says that N coins were simulaneously spent, all the values are transparent, so there's nothing to break in this sense.- Zero-knowledge proofs have different variants. Quantum resistance and even more strength is possible, but this is a nuance of concrete cryptocurrency.(The other two protocols are outside of my knowledge and interest)",

The developer team decided to take this route instead of switching to ZK-STARKS. ZEC is now more decentralized than ever with the upgrade and the removal of the \"founder's fee\" (which was a sort of tax collected from miners to fund the project). The cryptocurrency is aiming to become a full-fledged PoS blockchain network in the future. This will set it apart from Monero, Grin, and the likes. But I hardly doubt adoption will increase, especially when governments are against privacy coins. They've spread false propaganda/misinformation to prevent as much people as possible from getting into such cryptocurrencies. I believe both Monero and Zcash have strong privacy methods, but none can replace the other. After all, each method has its own advantages/disadvantages. Which one to use would depend entirely on your privacy needs. As long as the aforementioned coins stay decentralized, nothing should be able to stand in their way. Just my two sats.",
