Gold has a (almost) unlimited supply because gold will always be mined every day, whereas bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. After 21 million bitcoins have been mined, there will be no more bitcoin mining. So maybe bitcoin will be more than gold",

It all depends on how you choose to  use or see it either as an asset, an investment,digital gold or even a currency. Compared to gold, Bitcoin is better because nobody controls it, unlike gold which can be affected by the government and the economy.

However, when considering the overall journey from acquisition to future prospects, Bitcoin emerges as the superior choice.Nevertheless, I must express my disagreement regarding the means of obtaining them. Gold lacks transparency in terms of its mining process, as it is extracted by entities that can withhold information favoring certain groups. The public is often presented with ready-made gold available for sale.On the other hand, Bitcoin is truly decentralized, with no entity capable of altering the blockchain data. Its high transparency level makes it more equitable for a broader range of individuals. There is no room for any party to engage in deceitful practices for personal gain.",

It's just a phrase that people say a lot because it probably relates to maintaining values. But when talking about scarcity and decentralized nature are not the same, bitcoin has a limited amount but gold has more. The resilience of bitcoin and gold is similar because both are able to survive inflation and recession conditions. The difference is that gold is not as volatile as bitcoin and its price tends to be stable and does not provide big profits in a short time.In terms of investment both have advantages, even if the profit is different. Gold has a long history in the past and until now there are still many people who try to invest for various reasons people still defend gold. If both can be invested then there is no harm in doing it simultaneously.",

But if you think about gold we just know that it has a high demand on the market but we don't really know the supply of it I mean yes we know gold is a natural resource so it might be rare, but who knows we didn't explore the whole world yet, but I guess gold has some kind of value into it.

For bitcoin to surpass gold, we need to have a higher demand for bitcoin than gold, and with the limited supply, we can expect it more than gold.
