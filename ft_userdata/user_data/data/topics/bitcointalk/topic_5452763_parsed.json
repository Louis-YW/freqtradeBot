True, casinos might block withdrawals or delay it if within their own TOS and that is to protect their own interests and business. The OP should make a scam accusation if they think it is appropriate in the proper manner and then allow Stunna to review that. The reputed casinos have till date never scammed its users like this.Just making a thread like this without backing evidence does not make sense. Both sides evidence needs to be there.",

You did not share any information about your deposits and withdrawals nor the conversation with their support. An incomplete accusation like this won't help you.

Otherwise they are running a business which potentially launders money and is breaking international laws.",
