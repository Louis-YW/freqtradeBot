But people should understand what that dip is. Bitcoin fell to $15500 already last year and some people may not know that they are still buying the dip at $26000. Anyone that is buying bitcoin now are buying the dip. Some people may buy and the price may start to fall, they should not panic but hold.",

Since we all know that the next halving event will take place in 6-7 months from now and after that event the pre-bull run may start and within 1-2 years from the date of halving we can expect another all time high. So by keeping that thing in our mind we can safely say that 2 years is going to be enough time on holding for most people who want to earn some good profits from Bitcoin investment. However, I still agree with you with that long term investment point. Those who can hold their Bitcoin investment for 1 decade or two can earn substantial profits from their investment.",

What if a situation arises wherein we cannot withdraw even if the value of bitcoin increases as it will be of no use.Bitcoin is unregulated and even banned in some countries. Despite that, People from that country still buy and hold Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created to provide this kind of financial freedom that the government will not be able to control. It can be risky and put you into jail but this is not impossible so bitcoin is a challenge for the government. Quote from: kentrolla on October 01, 2023, 07:02:27 PM2.

An 8-hour working job ensures your financial security, enough time to relaxing your body and provides you the chance to spend time with your family. Some think freelancer get more freedom than someone who is doing a full time job. I think its the opposite because freelancing breeds fear and uncertainty. You will be slave of your fear due to the constant need to find new work. Quote from: kentrolla on October 01, 2023, 07:02:27 PM3.

What if a situation arises wherein we cannot withdraw even if the value of bitcoin increases as it will be of no use.When one is expected to consider the risks of investing in bitcoin - then points about regulation and potential trading bans should also be included. The government can easily change its regulations on bitcoin - meaning you don't have to put 100% of your investment budget into bitcoin without diversifying.After all, no one is advising you to invest if your country's government doesn't legalize bitcoin trading or investing - but you should still consider the risks even if your government strictly regulates bitcoin. The point is to keep investing as much as you can afford to lose - that's good advice to consider.Quote from: kentrolla on October 01, 2023, 07:02:27 PM2. We need to earn a lot before hodling as most of the users in this forum are joining campaigns where the payment is not even guaranteed especially bounty campaignsIf you want to be an investor – then you must have a budget that you can invest. Forums allow users to earn additional income - but you don't need to focus on earning your budget just from forums. Set aside your income each month differently if you want to invest - but you don't need to force it and just set aside as much as you can afford.You can apply useful investment strategies as the best way to accumulate whenever you have a budget. DCA is the one I mean - but you can also buy a lump sum as long as you are sure that you are buying at the right time.",

This is a good answer, hodl doesn't entice them. They're other products like falling victim of \"invest 1 to get 2\" scam, that makes them happy. Barriers as these, can't stop a person interested in bitcoin from holding bitcoin. Low income earners have different priorities, not including bitcoin. Hodling bitcoin is not a bet, the small investor can't get higher rewards like the big investor. So, if the low income person finds out the little invested funds, won't yield enormous profits. I don't see any need, why they'll hodl bitcoin, if it won't skyrocket their earning capacity. Except hodling for fun. The big investor gets the most profit, that's why people are encouraged to invest with huge amount of funds. So, hodling bitcoin has little or no barriers, whatsoever. I'd say it's a personal decision. Different users, different reasoning and ideas. Yet it's obvious, a good percentage of ideas and thoughts of bitcoin is targeting huge opportunities. Only few participate genuinely and invest gradually. Hence, they omit these barriers. The high profit guys, seeking quick cash, worry about such barriers. After holding for months, with no positive results, they'll rush to ponzi scam. Despite not hesitating to quit bitcoin, they won't hesitate to blame it on bitcoin",

People are like that, if they don't like it there is always a reason to refuse, and no one can change that.

Therefore, we should not care too much about what other people think or do, but should only focus on ourselves.

What if a situation arises wherein we cannot withdraw even if the value of bitcoin increases as it will be of no use.There are often talks about the government banning crypto currency due to which people are not able to invest in crypto currency freely. Currently all the exchanges are working in our country but they have no legal status. Due to which the government can stop these exchanges from functioning at any time. I think people should use personal wallets especially hard wallets where we can keep long term investments safely. We have to explain this to the officials sitting in the government positions, that they should give crypto currency a legal status and make the common people able to earn by themselves instead of being a burden on the government.Quote from: kentrolla on October 01, 2023, 07:02:27 PM3.

In my opinion, even if one enters Bitcoin at the wrong time, one can still face losses. Therefore, the time of buying and selling in the market should be very important and correct. Therefore, we have to make people aware that investment in Bitcoin is not harmful, Rather, investing at the wrong time is a cause of loss. The fear of such people has to be removed and they have to be made aware that investments made at the right time can give them good returns.",
