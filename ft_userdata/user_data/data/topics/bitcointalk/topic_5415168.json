If you have ETH as collateral you can get your loan at fixed terms and fixed interest by your own in few minutes, in a completely decentralized way ( so without any intermediary : no need to trust anyone) with average lower interests than the ones usuallly practised here using the service in my signature : this is their site https://smartcredit.io/ and their web app https://appv2.smartcredit.io/app/dashboard if you don wanna click on my ref link.",
