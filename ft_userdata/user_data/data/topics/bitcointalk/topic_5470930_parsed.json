Now that they're on a war against Palestine, it's scares me that they're probably going to do anything for their country to survive, this will probably be the conflict that's going to answer that question. I don't have the link to that interview but I can remember it, hopefully someone knows about that interview too.",

So, either Russia knows about the existence of those nukes in the middle east and did not say anything about it to the public, or Israel is not actually armed with them. I have not read about whether Israel having a nuclear program or not, but if North Korea, which is a nation which is pretty much almost isolated from the rest of the world by sanctions could do it, I do not see a reason why Israel could not develop their own underground program as well. Hopefully neither of the parts involved have access to those kind of weapons and this conflict de-escalate rather than heating up...",

I don't know about their mentality in the past but it is surprising to me why they had a lot of scientists and many of them were instrumental in the development of the world's most dangerous and destructive weapon. Einstein, Meitner, and even Oppenheimer himself (the lead scientist who discovered the atomic bomb) were Jews. I read a lot about history and wars and there's a high probability that Hitler would've developed the atomic first if he had not persecuted the Jews.",

And the silence of the Israeli politician is confusing because he didn't answer the question. Even if they have they should not be used on the people of Gaza. The Israeli Defence Force has almost destroyed Gaza, using a nuclear weapon will show clearly that it is a genocide. Western leaders are now becoming conscious of civilian casualties an example is the Prime Minister of Canada who was vocal about the killing of civilians by the IDF. My biggest challenge now is the order by Israel for the evacuation of about twenty hospitals in Gaza. Many injured people are on mechanical ventilators and some are gravely injured and cannot survive in transit. But Israel is insisting that there is no humanitarian crisis and they should leave. Some hospitals have started complying, while others have refused to move. Peace in the Middle East!!!!",

So, you allow your neighbor to get fruits and vegetables from your garden, but now you see that he's not eating those, but instead throws them at random people passing by his fence. The people see that vegetables come from your garden and ask you to stop supplying him, but you refuse because you had a deal from before.

All of these wars are taking the lives of innocent kids, grandpas, grandmas, boys and girls, everyone's lives. Peace should be maintained in all of these regions but I think that's a utopian dream. Now, these ideas of strengthening the military for each country will always be the case for most countries these days allotting a budget for that as a priority because it seems that everyone is just waiting for something to trigger and this is not a good thing.
