  "content": "The Ethereum blockchain serves as the foundation for the layer 2 network known as ARPA Chain or ARPA. Users can collaborate on a function using this secure multi-party computation network while maintaining the anonymity of their contributions. To protect the privacy of user data, the chain uses smart contracts. To increase its marketability, the network uses the sharding technology in its infrastructure.Application in Real LifeThe Layer-2 framework created by ARPA Network protects privacy while being adaptable enough to support a variety of use cases. Among the sectors it can help include fintech, insurance, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, digital marketing, and retail. It can act as a network for data processing and archiving. Along with data marketplaces, key management, blind voting, dark pool trade, and personal data wallets, the system can also be used for these things. In order to maximize risk management readiness, institutions can share credit blacklists using ARPA Chain for credit and anti-fraud activities.Key Features of ARPAIt is commonly known that ARPA Chain has a feature called Secure Multi-Party Computation (SPMC) that offers transaction validation and protection with a faster transaction time. The chain in question includes the following SPMC operations:Security. The crypto network was created to stop nodes from accessing secure data that they do not already possess. For sovereign networks, this strategy can reduce processing times and increase total network scalability.Scalability. Due to the chain's design, on-chain networks will never run out of fuel. The method is therefore able to significantly increase Layer-1 blockchain transaction speeds.Independence. Off-chain computation controls the complexity of the computation. SMPC can therefore be implemented in an interoperable manner on any other blockchain network.Project BackgroundYemu Xu, Jiang Chen, Felix Xu, Derek Zhang, and Yemu Xu are the co-founders of the project. CEO of ARPA and co-creator of the Bella Protocol, Felix Xu. Felix earned a degree in information systems and finance from New York University. Yemu Xu is the CGO and co-founder of ARPA. In 2018, the business published the whitepaper.ARPA Distribution2 billion tokens are available for the project in total. Following is a breakdown of the token distribution:Bootstrap Rewards of 30%20% of the group.basis of 15%Raise: 13%10% for personal purchasesPublic sale: 7%5% environmentHow can I purchase ARPA tokens?The instructions are as follows for purchasing ARPA on MEXC:Enter your MEXC account credentials, then select [Trade]. Select [Spot].To view the trading pairs that are accessible, type \"ARPA\" into the search field. Use ARPA/USDT as an illustration.Go to the [Spot] box by scrolling down. Enter how many tokens you wish to purchase. Open a Limit order, a Market order, or a Stop-limit order, as appropriate. Use a market order as an illustration. To finalize your purchase, click [Buy ARPA]. The purchased tokens can be found in your Spot Wallet.",
