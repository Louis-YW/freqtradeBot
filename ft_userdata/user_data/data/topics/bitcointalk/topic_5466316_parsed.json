If truly they want to know the outcome of the death of the DPO, I don't think it will take the IG of police a week to bring those bad guys to book, if other police men are not involve in this matter because, police men no how to fight themselves for position and money. Well, we all no that the country is not too save for ordinary citizens, that is why we need to mine our business as a crypto users so that we will not use our mouths talk what will back fire us later.",

I come dey ask, what is the way forward in this country. Because our lives are no longer  protected.It is very sad on how our security system have become so porous to this extent. I really think the brutal killing of this man was grand conspiracy. It's very bad that those that stand out to take the risk of saving lives and property of our dear country have been led to cruel brutality of this nature over the years. Remember this man single handedly brought the crisis in Ogoni to a hault.I think the government have jeopardize and compromised the security of this country by not equipping our security personnel with adequate weapons.Imagine a situation whereby a criminal or a terrorist is holding a sophisticated weapon and a security personnel is holding a weaker one. It isn't gonna work at all because irrespective of the fact that they are securing lives and property they are human as well, blood runs in their vain as well and they have families and friends to also take care of just like normal bloody civilians.Now again let us also think of how these bad boys and terrorists get their sophisticated weapon. It is still the same security operative that are being compromised. Tell me how these bad gangs get guns and bullets if not with the help of these so called security operative.It is just unfortunate to how the security of individuals and properties are given less attention. The incessant occurrence of such cases of this nature can put fear among the citizens and even on security personnel. No one will be eager to join the forces again.If our security system will keep on being jeopardize and compromised like this I just think the best option is to legalize arms to all citizens. Let every individual take care of their safety period.",

I don't know how we get to this stage of ordinal citizens having bad intention toward our military personnel, but what I know is that, things can be done to curtail it. Let the police officers go back to their drawing board to know where they are getting it wrong, that made Nigerian citizens to have so much hatred on them. That made them to be happy when a police officer is been killed. Wey be sae citizenry and police officers suppose get cordial relationship between them two.",

It must have been a more serious altercation than this one. You claimed that your lips could not adequately describe the entire situation, but I believe that I have seen brief recordings of the assault and the simultaneous recording of it, and I was troubled by the lads' apparent lack of regard for human life. It even went to the point of killing a DPO, but nothing was done. Currently, my state government has established a task team to address possible problems like this, and other governments should do the same if not it will be more difficult to control.",
