  "content": "Bitcoin has benefits to us, it is why we speak positive about it and support it because if bitcoin was in no way of benefit to us, supporting it will be difficult maybe like the government. Maybe we have all been selfish and just been discussing the benefits that bitcoins have offered us and not how it has also benefitted the government too. Is the government a part of the benefit list of bitcoins, is there any benefit that bitcoin offers to the government? If your answer is \"no benefit\", do you think that it could be a reason why the government do not support bitcoin? If your answer is \"yes, but not enough benefit\", do you think they are just ignoring the benefits to them and focusing more on the benefits to the people which is making them angry?",

They were using USD and BTC is an alternative to them and so they are mining. I'm not sure how true the news was but recently, Russia was said to be mining BTC.",

Then there's also El Salvador, and I suppose it's easily true to say that Bitcoin is beneficial to the government there. Bitcoin is also beneficial to the governments of the countries where Bitcoin is reasonably regulated, so people feel okay with paying taxes. So I do think that those in power of various countries can also benefit from Bitcoin and it's not merely beneficial to non-governmental agents. But some may not support it because of focusing on a risk, a risk of showing people that they don't need fiat, monetary policies, central banks etc.",

The government can get these benefits with many investors involved.The government can apply a percent (%) tax on each transaction from an investor's activity on the exchange where the transaction is made.For example, where I live now, which has implemented tax rates on several exchanges that are registered with communities that are under the auspices of the government, which are regulated by law.The second benefit is probably the Bitcoin system.So far, we know that the government banking system still cannot beat blockchain technology.",

I mean government can easily use bitcoin to overcome the inflation situation such as the current one. Many of us think inflation is due to covid only or wat at one corner of the world etc etc. However, I think it’s because of the westerners printing money out of thin air and without any final calculations to it. If this burden could be shifted to bitcoin and we inject it in main stream then it can easily get huge valuation and peeps can divide their assets, investments between the two. It won’t do much but we will have two options to play within ecosystem of crypto and fiat. I think beyond this there are application such as making bitcoin as main stream currency as well. One can have a currency alongside fiat in the banks to have easier overseas trade and what not. Obviously to make this happen one will need to put efforts in infra. But it’s doable.",

Plus Bitcoin's blockchain technology is much convenient to have transaction which could be benefit to it's user and customers. And the fact that Bitcoin is a decentralized system where government can't put taxes on any transactions in crypto if that's possible for them to make it happen then it would benefit them huge.

      "body": "The main benefit to the government itself is as a store of value. Governments hold lots of Gold as a store of value. The US Treasury report from a couple years ago says the US Govt and Federal Reserve have about $500 billion of Gold. And obviously Bitcoin is replacing Gold as the worlds store of value so it would make a lot of sense for govts to convert at least some of their gold reserves into Bitcoin.If nations were smart they would covert even just like 10% of their Gold reserves into Bitcoin. So for the US that'd mean about $50 billion of Bitcoin. Which would obviously within a few years (if they bought today) be worth more than their entire Gold reserves. Of course it will likely be many years before the govt gets smart enough on Bitcoin to actually do this so they will get much less benefit from the growth of Bitcoin.Of course all govts get the benefit of the taxes from trading of Bitcoin and other cryptos. So it is in the interest of the govt to let the industry grow and flourish. The only reason not to allow this is if the govt is so authoritarian (like China) that they fear the freedom Bitcoin gives to people more than the benefit of higher tax income. And a govt that wants the most freedom for its people would also see the benefit to the country at least, not the govt itself, of allowing people to use a monetary technology that gives so much freedom as Bitcoin does.Obviously El Salvador which has made bitcoin legal tender and therefore doesn't collect taxes on it doesn't get the increased tax benefit. But they do get the benefit of Bitcoin's long term growth in the bitcoin the govt has bought and will continue to buy for national reserves and the bitcoin they are mining. They also get the benefit of increased tourism because by being the first nation totally accepted of Bitcoin lots of bitcoiners now travel there. And over time, as the people become educated on Bitcoin and Bitcoin usage increases in the country, they get the benefit of moving away from their reliance on the USD and the people getting much more of their money from remittances since Bitcoin is far cheaper to send than what the companies that do remittances charge. I think it was Western Union themselves who said if all El Salvadorian remittances went through Bitcoin the company would lose like $400 million a year or something, and so if that was all done through the LN rather than on-chain so that the fees are near zero that would mean $400 million more each year for the El Salvadorians and so roughly that much for their economy.The downside to govts is that they are worried about less use of their fiat because people will prefer Bitcoin. Controlling the national currency is a good bit of the govts power so that is a very real fear for the govt, that their power will decrease as Bitcoin's influence and usage increases.Overall I'd say its a larger benefit to the govt and the people if the govt allows and promotes Bitcoin. They will over time lose some of their power they get through controlling the currency, but the benefits for the people and therefore the country will be large, and if they hold a lot of Bitcoin in reserve then the benefits for the govts reserve holdings will be very large.",

Apart from cross border transactions and tax collection from the citizens, there's literally no benefit for the government from crypto adoption. However, the bitcoin is not getting governments favor due to the fact that they do not control it and bitcoin is pseudo anonymous in nature. So it's highly unlikely that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become greatly adopted and appreciated by any government.",

You can't say that they won't benefit from it and then listing cross-border transaction and taxation as benefits, that's contradictory, one benefit that I can think of is if the government gets in the market too, doesn't China have a bitcoin too?

However, if they start to track people's transactions and tax them, they will likely get some benefits from Bitcoin. The problem, as @Dave mentioned, is that people do not want to be tracked since the fundamental idea of Bitcoin is to allow people to transact freely without the need for a third party. In fact, that's what makes it unique, so people feel uneasy about the idea of government tracking. Nonetheless, if proper regulations are in place, cryptocurrencies can provide benefits to both individuals and governments imo.Either they should legalize Bitcoin and let people do whatever they want, or they should come up with a good proposition that allows people to use Bitcoin without being tracked but also benefits the government in some way. I think striking a balance between privacy and regulation is really important for the adoption and success of bitcoin and other crypto aswell.",

It builds confidence on potential investors that can put their money into bitcoin and crypto-related things, which means more money for the government.
