  "content": "If he wanted to. But he wouldn't, why would he now? He could actually apply for all the licenses and register at the federal level and absolutely CRUSHHHHHHH it. From Wiki: \"Suspension of sale of Casascius Physical BitcoinsAs of Nov 27, 2013, Mike Caldwell suspended sales of items that contain digital bitcoins.[1] The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury Department, informed him before, that minting physical bitcoins qualifies him as a money transmitter business, which means he needs to register at the federal level and probably get state licenses too.[3]\"All i'm saying is that it would be really cool, but he would never do it. Would be absolutely insane though I mean could you imagine the coins that he would make today? Any who, if they went after Mike then who is to say that they would never go after another coin maker and make them abide by the same thing that shut him down?",

It is already three years old but maybe it pleases the one or the other still Let me know what you think of it. I've listened to this interview before, but that was a great refresher! Its evident that Mike wouldn't be inclined to do any loaded BTC, due to his flawless reputation and that is very wise. I think the DIY themed coins would be incredible though, particularly  gold, silver, and copper varieties.",

People have a strange obsession with destroying the things they love. I think he made the right choice for himself and his products. Maybe someday he’ll come back with something else cool and innovative, but I don’t think it would contain a private key he had access to for liability reasons and current 2fa methods leave something to be desired.",

Mike did say in that Shrem interview he’s not totally ruled out making another coin, and that he may prefer to partner up with someone on it  (imagine a Kialara Casascius co/project). This would have been really cool for Theymos proposed forum coin.",
