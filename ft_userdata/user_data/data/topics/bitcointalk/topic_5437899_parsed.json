If they are for free why then sell them to others as NFTs? But if there is part of the Terms where selling may be allowed then there is little you can do about it unless maybe they are not doing the selling Â properly. I however don't think it's moral/legal to sell things that should be free.. . And by selling i mean giving it to others only when they have paid or agree to pay for them. I'm OK asking for donations, which shouldn't limit those who really need the works but can't afford to donate. *You may only sell free things if you have modified or added things of good quality/value to them.",

It is not that thing. Owning an NFT doesn't mean that you own the thing it is associated with. You just own the NFT.Here's an example:This is the SHA-256 hash of your post: 49D06F5C298BC68E14A652D88056041B8EFF795B5D156E63D8D782C62B0C49C3The hash is an association with your post because only your post has that hash. I could use the hash, along with a URL, to make an NFT of your post, and I could sell the NFT. Now, would I be selling your post, or just the hash of it, or just some abstract association or representation of your post?Now, to answer your question:Laws vary by jurisdictions, but I don't know of anywhere that is illegal to sell an NFT of anything, unless the seller is committing fraud or is violating trademark or copyright laws in their effort to sell the NFT. IANAL",
