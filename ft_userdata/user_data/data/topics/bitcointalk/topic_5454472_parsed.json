  "content": "Bitcoin was created in 2008 and launched in 2009 and followed by the media handle which is the Bitcointalk Forum for more highlights on Bitcoin and it Value. And people [Users] those who are interested on the coin join the platform from different parts of the world and contribute, analyse, educate, correct and give awareness to others. And the interested people started registering in the medium to know, and learn also to educate and the number of user increase day after day so the forum admin creates a platform for advertisement of businesses to grow and expansion of their businesses and those (participants) who advertise the projects, products in the forum are compensated with a unit of bitcoin which makes the forum has traffic. And the number of people increasing every day in the forum. And through this, people are meeting (chatting) to know themselves everyday, some are through PM or DM while some give their numbers to chat on WhatsApp, some on Twitter, Facebook Skype, Instagram and phone call. People have meant and still meeting from here in different ways. Some have even seen themselves in the physical world and hang out. Hook up and other enjoyment plazas.Through this forum people have meant across boarders and not only thier Communities, Local Government Areas, States and Countries but across the seas to see each other. And the unity in the forum became firm and bond. Though there are some disagreement among members and that is how unity is. And also there are some users that have not seen one another but there is a strong bond on them in the forum, they are of best friends which they use the forum as a way of communicating to one another either through comments or pm. So with all these meetings. I see Bitcoin (the blockchain) and bitcoin (the asset or currency) and it Media channel (Bitcointalk) as a means of uniting the world together and it is more stronger than before. Because those who believe on the asset also defending it from the opponent of the coin so they are united to defend the ASSET. There are some people that are not in this forum but they are strong believers of bitcoin while there are some people that are in the forum but they don't have bitcoin but they believed that one day they will also have it. Please let make things easy for us to use through bitcoin. Unity can remove inflation, because it is man made. One voice can make your country and the world a perfect place to live in. One voice is what the ruling class speak against. And that is what we ask for. Through bitcoin the lost Glory will be restored in world.What is your Opinion about the Assertion",

People have different sides, supporters for Bitcoin and protesters against Bitcoin. No way to unite the world completely by whatever mean and Bitcoin will fail to do this.Bitcoin give people chance to choose to use fiat currency, stick with centralized bank system or move to a new system, decentralized, censorship-resistant and if they choose Bitcoin, they will have freedom without censorship, control of bank systems.It won't succeed to turn all people to Bitcoin supporters and there are people who will stay with fiat currencies like with books, we have different options: paper, e-book, pdf, voice book.",

      "body": "How many population do we have in the world and how many of them invested into bitcoin, very tiny compare to the total number of population in the world. Bitcoin can never unite the world because government and banks are kicking against it and there are also people that hate bitcoin and spread the FUD. The aged ones don't like bitcoin concept because they are use to their old fashion fiat and banking system. We read on the forum about a member that had issues with his uncle because he is into bitcoin investment. Bitcoin has come to put enmity between its adopters and the government with their banks because bitcoin is not centralized and is beyond censorship.There is hatred in the world presently that we are using fiat currency, which is highly used by everyone in the world. It is only when we change from our evil and corrupt act that there can be unity in the world. Presently there is war between Russia and Ukraine and these countries have bitcoin investors, so why hasn't the war stop,if bitcoin creates unity. Bitcoin is only a digital currency and don't forget that it is money that brings hatred between two friends,brother can kill his brother,friend betrays his friend and so many evil is carried out just because of the love of money.This forum is a lovely community and everyone is showing that love to forum members but you shouldn't trust anyone here because people can take advantage of the love shown here.",

My experience with this forum has been so good and I got opportunity to make some friends with the help of this forum. I must say that I have learnt everything about Bitcoin from this forum. I joined the forum in 2016 and that was one of the best decisions of my life.With the help of this platform many people have learnt about Bitcoin and its usage. The reputed members of the community are so helpful that even newbies love their way of answering the questions. There are many fantastic minds who use this forum on daily basis and they have truly contributed a lot to this forum and for the lovers of Bitcoin. I appreciate their efforts on promoting the crypto-currency with their communities and helping them to be financially stable.This forum is a best place for a Bitcoin enthusiasts because they have same-minded people who love the concept of this digital currency and that's why they converse with each other via posts, private messages, and via other methods. That's a helpful thing to remove the barriers set by negative people and those who promote hatred. I'm quite lucky to have some brilliant minds as my friends, and I have got those friends with the help of this forum.Although, I'm very fond of this forum and Bitcoin, but I still think that it's not possible to untie the world with the help of these. I know that the forum has members from different areas of the world, but they are just few in numbers as compare to the world population, and there are many people in the world who are totally opposed Bitcoin and its concept. They will never accept the innovations that remove the barriers from the lives of other humans, and they will do their best in opposing anything that can unite the world together.",

Bitcoin has not only revolutionized the concept of money but also fostered a sense of community and connection on a global scale. And this is always the main topic of discussion.

And secondly, I don't see anyhow we can make things easy for the use of bitcoin rather than the regular discussion done here each day, where people who have difficulty about it could as questions and get help from experience users, because though Bitcoin was created by man (Satoshi Nakamoto), I'm sure nobody has control it anymore, and as such it's price value is a factor of market demand & supply.",

I’m not sure what you mean by Bitcointalk is the media handle of bitcoin, the forum is predominantly occupied by bitcoiners but there is also room for people who believe in altcoins and we have a whole board for that. There are other forums and platforms where one can discuss bitcoin but with bitcointalk you are sure to get the gems and people here aren’t afraid to call your BS.

Bitcointalk is very different from other socials, from topics discussed, I believe many people here care a lot about their privacy and do not often share their information (phone numbers, Facebook) with other members, they may share their telegram link but that’s it.",
