Interesting to find out it's by consensus rather than by majority vote. Kinda like ASEAN and how China basically can veto anything that it disapprove via its proxies in the bloc.",

He says 'This is not populism', and it really is basically throwing this out just to be as neutral as much between Russia and NATO. Banning terorist organisations? A Turkish authoritarian pointing fingers? Also, havent PKK been off Europe's terorist organisation list since 2014?",

But yes Russia might try to surpress this movement in Finland too by planting some official indirectly to change the government.",

I bet the Chinese would love to see Russia try to take on Finland and make itself even more vulnerable. What would Russians throw at them? Those traumatized soldiers who are thinking of giving up or harming themselves to be taken home? At this point Russia wouldn't be able to win against Finland alone, and if Finland gets attacked Sweden will send troops to help. If they join NATO, attacking them would be throwing all of your army away because Russia was no match for NATO even before the war in Ukraine. All Russia can do at this point is stall and hope to negotiate a ceasefire. If it attacks another country it's going to weaken its presence in Ukraine and Ukrainians will liberate everything and put Russian towns along the border under artillery fire.",

They just shot themselves on the foot because more nations are joining the alliance because of fear that they might suffer the same fate with Ukraine. NATO has stated that it would take Finland and Sweden up-to one year to to join the alliance. For me I would have wanted NATO to speedup the process this is to ensure that these nations join NATO before Russia withdraws from Ukraine because Putin is unpredictable. He might invade Finland and Sweden just to make a political point or to portray Russia's fearlessness.It is also important to state that Turkey is a major military player in the world polity. Turkey produces cheap but potent and sophisticated military hardware such as drones. Hence, they shouldn't be overlooked by Finland, Sweden and NATO. Turkey's  differences with these two nations should be settled peacefully. And we shouldn't forget that all members of NATO must give approval before any new nation is allowed to join the alliance.",

But if their entry into NATO entails existential threats to Russia in the form of NATO military bases or US nuclear arsenals appearing on their territory, then Russia will make its military-technical response, whatever that means.Now, it should be clear to anyone with half a brain that the 'problem with Ukraine' was not about its NATO membership or 'prosecution of the Russian language', but simply full access to the Black Sea, farmland, and Donbas resources.Finland's and Sweden's NATO memberships are not a 'problem' for Russia now even though Russia's border with NATO increased substantially.The 'problem with Ukraine' is the dementia and courage of Ukrainian nationalists. Scandinavians are more balanced people.Quote from: af_newbie on May 16, 2022, 06:05:32 PMOf course, there will be nuclear weapons and NATO bases in Finland. Why do you think they are joining? To get membership cards?Sweden has already stated that its accession to NATO will not entail the appearance of NATO military bases and nuclear weapons on its territory. I think Finland will prudently follow its example, because Putin, in a conversation with the President of Finland, clearly said that this was a mistake. It's time to start listening to what Putin says, because he has already shown that he is not bluffing or joking.Quote from: af_newbie on May 16, 2022, 06:05:32 PMBTW, Russians are eradicating the Ukrainian language and culture in the occupied territories. School curricula have been changed to completely Russify the population, and completely ignore the needs of the native population of the occupied territories.Russkiy fucking mir. Russians are the true Nazis.I hope Ukrainians will keep killing Russians until the last one leaves their lands.The hopes of young men are nourished.",

Turkey's ambassador to Sweden says the main reason Turkey opposes Sweden's NATO membership is that Sweden should sever its ties with the YPG, which Turkey has branded as terrorist. In general, the Kurdish issue is already a hundred years old and it will definitely not be possible to solve it in a couple of days.And all this does not negate what I said above - Erdogan owes Putin for saving his ass from a coup d'état and Turkey really does not want to quarrel with Russia, because the Turkish economy is now in a steep peak and formally there is already hyperinflation.",
