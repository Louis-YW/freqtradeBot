  "content": "Manchester United won city yesterday to move to within a point behind Manchester city and six points behind league leaders Arsenal who play Tottenham later this evening.With what we have seen from Manchester United I now believe the can be considered a serious title contenders for this season based on current form winning nine matches on the bounce.It's been long time we saw this type of Atmosphere in the theatre of dreams and should this Manchester United form continue I see them closing the gap on arsenal and if arsenal it's not careful Manchester United will put pressure on them and don't forget it's six points and a win for Manchester United against arsenal later this month might prove a key factor in the race to the title for both Manchester United and arsenal. Tho it's too early to talk about Manchester United been title contenders.",
