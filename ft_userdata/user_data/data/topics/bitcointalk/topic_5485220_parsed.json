A bunch of tokens just isn't going to cut it.Even after reading the BIP proposal[1] and some documentation[2], it looks like there's nothing much you could do. The only somewhat interesting i find is ownership by multiple people and perform atomic swap between BTC and certain asset.[1] https://github.com/Roasbeef/bips/blob/bip-tap/bip-tap.mediawiki[2] https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taproot-assets",

You are right they are mostly meme coins and Meme NFTs.As for novel things taproot assets could be used for: StableCoins, tokenized stock and tokenized options traded on lightning is what we could see one day. It can also be used how ticket sales and voting. People also want to sell names / domain names on taproot assets.I am sure there is many more applications of taproot assets we can even think about.",

We are seeing use cases with stable coins, domain names, tokenized stock, tokenized options. This would give people who run Tap on top of their lightning nodes the option to trade these tokens. Adoption of Taproot Assets will result in wider BTC adoption.I admit that the coins I have shared in the original post do not achieve this and are mostly just meme coins. As for the world needing / not needing meme coins and NFTs:You cannot deny that there is demand both for NFTs as well as different alt coins. Tiramisu and Taproot Assets Protocol is simply serving these needs and with something running on Bitcoin blockchain. If we don't lure these people into BTC they will go into ETH and SOL. As for Tiramisu serving Bitcoin:It is an onramp for people from ETH and SOL ecosystem into the BTC ecosystem. Tiramisu uses BTC as a default currency and both LN and unchain Bitcoin is supported. Also all coin Liquidity pools hold BTC. This increases BTC demand.",

You will not be able to see the amounts on blockchain as this info is stored in universes.there is no splitting out of the airdrops to 26k people to settle out of the tiramisu management to claim real solo ownership independently....the junk stays in the tiramisu ownership(used loosely as its junk IOU scheme of faked ownership claims people can never get) thus individuals dont have ownership. just IOU claims of junk#not-your-key-not-your-junkyes tiramisu keeps a separate list hidden from blockchain of the number of actual/potential scammed victims that just have IOU list of the tiramisu database.. but those supposed 26k cant jump out of the tiramisu ownership to settle and claim independently.. else there would be more then 1 output and 1 change address in the minting spendand yes i totally agree with you. tiramisu having a list of 26k channels it purports to give airdrops. but this does not mean there are 26k owners that are trading it actively, nor officiating their claim by settling their property outside of tiramisu \"ownership\"(used loosely)..remember.. from the 1990's to 2008 there were reason the cypherpunks group had many idea's of digital money/assets but each found a piece missing that left all their idea's flawed, and why their digital money and digital assets would not work in reality.. .. until bitcoin.. because bitcoin solved the missing piece of the puzzle that allowed settlement and proof of ownership.. something these junk dont do and dont havelearn why bitcoin was invented and how it works and what it does thats different to non-chain idea's..  then you will see the flaws of the non-chain schemesAll of the 26K holders of MAXI can independently jump out of Tiramisu and self-custody their tokens if they can pay the onchain fee of ~10 000 SATs . Here is a manual how to install Tapd on top of lnd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obqQXlxa1Ws . You can validate that the coin was minted correctly on other taproot asset explorers such as https://terminal.lightning.engineering/assets/ and searching the asset by ID. As for settling a claim and exchanging MAXI for BTC: Tiramisu is the only operator of a Liquidity pool as of now who will exchange MAXI for BTC as of now. With other coins for example $AC there are communities that exchange $AC for BTC outside of Tiramisu. $AC coin has 50 sanding orders as of now just on Tiramisu. There however isn't a non-custodial LP like you see with ETH and SOL tokens.You are correct Tiramisu processes transactions internally. It however supports withdrawals in taproot assets as well as deposits. This means that you can hold the assets in your own node and only deposit them into Tiramisu to trade them.  This will be improved as Taproot Assets become transferable over lightning network. At that point Tiramisu will become an edge node between taproot assets channels and BTC channels.",

Tokens are the mistake people brought to the world of cryptocurrencies.The only question worth answering is what Tiramisu does to improve bitcoin usage. Talking about tokens is a red flag.As for why have tokens:You can use tokens to represent something other than Bitcoin on the blockchain. We are seeing use cases with stable coins, domain names, tokenized stock, tokenized options. This would give people who run Tap on top of their lightning nodes the option to trade these tokens. Adoption of Taproot Assets will result in wider BTC adoption.I admit that the coins I have shared in the original post do not achieve this and are mostly just meme coins. As for the world needing / not needing meme coins and NFTs:You cannot deny that there is demand both for NFTs as well as different alt coins. Tiramisu and Taproot Assets Protocol is simply serving these needs and with something running on Bitcoin blockchain. If we don't lure these people into BTC they will go into ETH and SOL. As for Tiramisu serving Bitcoin:It is an onramp for people from ETH and SOL ecosystem into the BTC ecosystem. Tiramisu uses BTC as a default currency and both LN and unchain Bitcoin is supported. Also all coin Liquidity pools hold BTC. This increases BTC demand.no its notby having people stuck in the tiramisu group trying to re-scam (selling) their IOU position in the tiramisu scam hidden list.  doesnt allow them to exit independently with said junk they are claim to be owed. thus not a real token under any definition.instead the tiramisu creates junk, annoys actual bitcoiners with junk TX  onchain, with tx's that has no signature independent full nodes can distinguish, which.. if the majority of a block is junk thats not independently verifiable by a distinguishable signature.. and causing congestion.. and fee's. it just ends up with people switching off their full nodes and stop transactingbut atleast we know one of the clowns advertising this scam junk. thanks for revealing yourselfeditand another clown that loves making bitcoin annoying to promote a scam and the flawed subnetwork responds below.. pretending to be against the scam whilst not wanting them to stop. even when he then cries that genuine purchases using bitcoin should stop being done using the bitcoin networkAs for there being no exit from Tiramisu:You can self host taproot assets in your own taproot assets node. Tiramisu supports taproot assets withdrawals . You can self-custody the coins on your raspberry Pi. Here is a manual on how to do it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1jl4SVEo3MAs for taproot assets transactions being junk: We are paying unchain transaction fees like everyone else. If you have better use for the block space you are free to pay more . That being said Taproot assets are very block-space friendly. When taproot assets start trading on lightning there will be no need for one transaction per minting / asset transfer.",

The protocol is developed by Lightning Labs. Here is the repo https://github.com/lightninglabs/taproot-assets .Hosting your own taproot assets node and holding your own token does not require Tiramisu. Users can mint their tokens outside of Tiramisu and import the coin into Tiramisu to make it available for others as well.Tiramisu provides services of:1.) Access to tokens + NFTs - you can buy coins either in an OTC fashion or from the LP2.) Discoverability of tokens + NFTs on the protocol - you can find what coins there areI do not understand your argument with group association / request communication.",

The full metadata that is stored in \"hashed\" form on blockchain is stored in its full form in a taproot assets concept called Universes. Universes are federated and any node holding a token is also hosting its data in its own universe.You can find all assets minted with Tiramisu herehttps://terminal.lightning.engineering/assets/https://explorer.royllo.orgTiramisu is the only actor exchanging the assets for BTC but I would say the ownership of the asset and its metadata on Taproot Assets in pretty solid.",

Tokens are the mistake people brought to the world of cryptocurrencies.The only reason I've ever seen for making tokens is for the creator to try to get rich quick.Each market cycle as tokens go through their fad moment and then plummet, the cryptocurrency world is slowly realizing tokenization is not a thing anyone wants.The world doesn't care about having a million tokens, useless meme tokens, a token for every app, copy-pastable NFT pictures, etcThe only question worth answering is what Tiramisu does to improve bitcoin usage. Talking about tokens is a red flag.As for why have tokens:You can use tokens to represent something other than Bitcoin on the blockchain.

Also all coin Liquidity pools hold BTC. This increases BTC demand.As DooMAD said, \"demand\" is not the same as \"need\".There was plenty of demand for NFT pictures in 2021, not really any need for them though. It was just a speculative fad. There are actual real use cases for NFTs, but pictures aren't one of them because anyone can copy-paste the important data in a picture - the image. For an NFT to have a real use case it needs to ALLOW the owner to do something rather than the \"important\" part just being the data, cuz data can be copied so if the important part is the data it's not really non-fungible since anyone can copy it.Meme tokens have demand, and literally no need. 100% speculation, 0% use case.App tokens have demand, but I've never really seen any big need. The main reason to create a new one-off token for an app is to make the creators rich. There may be a few use cases but few crypto app companies mint their own tokens for any reason other than it being a funding vehicle.But sure there are some actual use cases for tokens, it's just that the vast majority of tokens have no reason to exist other than to make the creators rich, and the users only use them to try to get rich off of as well, and once the fad ends the token doesn't even have that anymore.",
