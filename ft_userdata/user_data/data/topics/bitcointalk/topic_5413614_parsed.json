Also what do you guys think of maybe trying prohasbI will switch to ethereum mining classic. The calculator shows a profit of $8 from each terahash, although these values ​​have risen to $12. But I still have to pay for electricity. To see a more understandable situation, I think it will take up to several weeks.In such a situation, I pay about half of my profit for electricity. Miners with a price of more than 10 cents per kilowatt will not have a profit, or it will be so minimal that the payback will be more than 1000 days. Therefore, at this time I do not even try to look for a better profit.",

Some will liquidate their gear others will keep on mining.We will know more in about a week or so when the dust settles.The first day though is showing us that we are in the middle of a huge exponential increase of the difficulty of the network of ETC,almost 1/4 from ETH has already moved here as we are now near 3 P for just some hours more and last time around I checked ETH difficulty was 12 P or so,25% is already moved to ETC which has made this coin for GPU home miners totally unprofitable from profitable that it was just less than one day ago.As you say after some days we will see where the rest of the 9 P will move at which coin and only after that we can make calculations again.",
