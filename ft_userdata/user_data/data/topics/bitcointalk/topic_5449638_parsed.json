      "body": "There are lots of new malware that were posted this year 2023, most of them are able to collect banking data so it is quite frightening how this malware is freely included on the apps we are downloading.  Aside from that, mobile phone security are often disregarded.Published on March 28, 2023, the article[1] stated a new android botnet trojan being out to collect banking dataQuoteStaying safe online feels like it's more challenging by the passing day, with even reputable password managers falling prey to hackers. Bad actors who cannot be bothered to develop their own utilities from scratch can even use turnkey solutions like MaaS (malware as a service) to infect devices and distribute a custom, nefarious payload. Security researchers have discovered the resurgence of one such MaaS called Nexus, designed to capture banking information from your Android device using a trojan.Cybersecurity firm Cleafy analyzed Nexus’s modus operandi using sample data from underground forums (via TechRadar). This botnet was first identified in June last year, and it lets its clients perform account takeover (ATO) attacks for a $3,000 monthly fee. Nexus makes inroads into your Android device disguised as a legitimate app packing a malicious trojan on shady third-party Android app stores. Once infected, the victim’s devices becomes a part of the botnet controlled by the hacker.Just to get updated on these malwares, this link[2] has the list of android malwares and viruses and some tips to protect our devices.Screenshot of the given list of malware apps[1] https://www.androidpolice.com/android-botnet-trojan-steal-banking-data/[2] https://www.malwarefox.com/android-virus-list/",

And we should used our mind not to click to any links given to us thru emails and other methods.",

      "body": "Chameleon is a popular name used by malwares and viruses, I could find some which date as far back as 2014 or earlier. This could be a new strain with no relations to previous versions or an updated version of an earlier one to make it spread through unlikely means like attachments in discord or compromised websites.Quote from: Dave1 on April 21, 2023, 12:59:09 AMSo just be careful downloading Coinspot, if you are using it, be sure you got it from reputable source.Be careful when downloading any application. Ensure you get it from the official website and verify the PGP signature.- Jay -",

Many people make use of the Android device to log into their profile portfolios, wallet and other means they use in hosting their assets, but we often advise that when you're using a device for the storage of your bitcoin, it must not be the one that is connected to the internet, which means an open source wallet on an airgapped device is a good recommendation in this aspect, Android devices are fast means of malware carrier and most were often assic to the internet connectivity when we go online, click links or make downloads on our devices.",

We learned before that there are a lot of malwares getting into our laptops and PC if we are not careful.So the same thing with our mobile wallets, we should be better implementing a lot of security practices otherwise it will be the same going to be laid out to us by this criminals. We can't really emphasized on security like not clicking a link or downloading softwares from a unknown source.",

Those are the people that needs to be careful.Better not download anything on the playstore without DYOR. It's easy to download but knowing what you're downloading takes now responsibility or else some unexpected hack may happen.That icon of a blurred woman, that's for sure where many will fall.",
