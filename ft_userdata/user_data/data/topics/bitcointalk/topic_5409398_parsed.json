  "content": "Hi Everyone,People in the other thread said that I should post this here. Original thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409162.0My name is Richard and I am founder of 4K.com (We turning physical items - collectibles - into NFTs/tokens)I am here to ask the community and get feedback on what to do with this Casacius Coin when it comes back to Earth?Packaged and ready to go! https://imgur.com/91UjX362012 Brass Unpeeled 1 Bitcoin - Authenticated by Elias Ahonen (https://www.cryptonumist.com/encyclopedia/)This particular coin has a lot of history as well. Originally owned by the founder of Defcon.More info here: https://vault.4k.com/collectible/ethereum/0xEBf19415d94be89A1d692F82af391685dC1Bff79/68----I have the opportunity to send a personal item on top of a Falcon9 rocket into Space and have it retrieved. So I thought it would be awesome to launch a Physical Bitcoin up there!\"First Bitcoin in Space\"We will receive a certificate from SpaceX stating that this has been into space and back. We are most likely going to NFT it.My current idea is to donate it (along with NFT) to a museum like the Smithsonian Institute. Is there somewhere else where it could be better displayed for people to visit/view? Hopefully there will be a Bitcoin museum one day  Open to feedback and other ideas",

You should contact the ANA (American Numismatic Association) the largest money museum in the world and see if they ever plan on doing an exhibit on digital collectibles. If they don't now they will one day, mark my words! Here is the website and instructions if you want to send that to them: https://www.money.org/moneymuseum/donationpolicy Good luck with this!

I wonder what other things are being sent up there and retrieved. Seems a little risky but Elon has a pretty good track record of retrieving those rockets. I imagine your friend has to be a pretty important person to be able to do this. The price of doing something like that I imagine would be quite a bit more than any of us would expect.",
