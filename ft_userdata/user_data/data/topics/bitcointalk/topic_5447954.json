There are only few possibility that you will be getting bitcoins which were previously used in criminal activities or some money laundering stuff. I mean that’s the only reason sometimes peeps are stressing a lot on mixers. The more time give to mixer the more freshly minted coins you will have. Now you decide whether you want those bitcoins fresh for the future storage or just want to assume they might be all fine as it is.",

This will depend on your convenience because some merchants don't use a bitcoin mixer to mix the bitcoins they buy from an exchange and send them directly to another wallet.But some feel they need to hide their wallet address and use a bitcoin mixer. Maybe it would be safer, according to them. I do not use these methods but directly send it to a new wallet.",

If you care about your privacy --then it is yes.Because there is a chance that you may link to a scammer's bitcoin address and link to your personal hardware wallet for example. Bitcoin mixing services will enhance your privacy and this can make it more difficult for others to trace the movement of your bitcoin where is the final destination from where you bought it.

There is no risk if you stay on a decentralized exchange or any platform.But whether we like it or not, sometimes CEX is useful for quickly converting our bitcoin into fiat and it could be risky to your side if you will mix them up. But if you are going to ask me, I am willing to pay a small amount to use mixing service just to have these four important storing bitcoin, [Privacy, Security, Anonymity, and Traceability]",

There's nothing wrong with mixing your coins just to be extra cautious.The mixers has to be decentralized too as using a centralized mixer wouldn't be safe, Also lets say you bought Bitcoin from a centralized exchange or you got sent Bitcoin from a centralized exchange, you should mix them to increase your privacy as well.

Do you think it is a necessity to use a Bitcoin mixer to mix your bought Bitcoin before finally depositing them in your own wallet? What is the risk associated with Bitcoin trading most especially when the source of the Bitcoin is unknown since you using it as an exchange? Depends on the exchange. If it is a known scam exchange, then you might want to do that however... what are you gonna do for your mixed coins? I mean the coins coming from a mixer are also problematic because you don't know if you are getting somebody else's dirty coins.In my opinion, unless you are one of those people who are into shady shit, you don't need to use mixers at all.The fact is, if you are using mixers just for the privacy reasons and that's how mixers promote their business btw, providing privacy, you are just getting fooled because they are using your \"clean\" coins so they can white wash the other \"dirty\" coins.So, a person like you, who is just picky about his privacy, feeding the mixer with his clean coins is only scamming himself. You can't even be sure if these mixers aren't logging your info even though they say they don't. They very well may be honeypots for the secret service. I would stay away from any crypto mixer.",

Sad story. I think that one safe approach is to use a completely different bank's services when doing crypto. And it's best if that bank is crypto friendly and has a bit of knowledge on the matter.I guess that the arresting part is overkill and they don't have anything real for pressing charges, still unpleasant.On the other hand there are services that don't like mixed coins, which one will have to learn to avoid if he has mixed money (or, actually, even if he didn't mix; those services do deserve a boycott).",
