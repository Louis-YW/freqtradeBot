Of course they will bring more member but actually how many member, how participant will they bring?I think bounty pool is much more important for bounty hunters than the name of the bounty manager. For a project that runs a bounty campaign, a manager may have the effect of eliminating account farmers and cheaters. It is also important that the manager is punctual and that the distribution of rewards is accurately calculated and fair.",

Of course after this huge investment, the CEO have two decision either make his project bigger and widely or he will run with investors money.

The main purpose of bounty was for the marketing and that means if that being used to make the project to gain more popularity and members. There are bunch of successful projects that have been running legit bounties like aave, CRO and many more. I think that if the bounty manager has much bigger community and followers and that means the chance to bring thousands of people to join or follow the project is possible.",

Of course they will bring more member but actually how many member, how participant will they bring? It is not the job of a bounty manager to \"bring\" in participants. That is upto the decision of the participants free will. What happens is that when a manager becomes popular, they get a followership from a number of bounty participants, but by no means that gives a fixed number as to how many participants are going to join that bounty.I am reminded of the days when hoards of alt-accounts would join in bounties often orchestrated by the manager itself, but these things have reduced now due to the strict merit system.To be honest, if you are going to run a bounty for your own project, escrow the money and contact a reputed manager, you will get participants - the scent of free money is irresistible for them.",

These days a lot of projects are using gleam because it manages the bounty program for you. Although some others, like Candle Chain for example, are manually managing their bounty campaigns using google forms. I think it all depends on the complexity of the bounty. The CNDL bounty involves beta testing a DEX, so that is probably too hard for gleam to verify.",

They will just manage the members in this forum so that everything will go smooth and that includes listing in a data sheet their week run. Deciding how many bounty hunters will still depend on the company owner and what/how much they are offering. If they will not be providing numbers then I guess it will depend on the manager on how he would calculate the bounty amount divided by the number of members participating so that they won't receive dust if too many will join.",

If it is a altcoinbounty then the team behind the project that offers the bounty is primarily responsible for that task because first of all their projects needs to be worth investing the time for the value of tokens that you get. If it is just the 10001th meme-coin that is doing a bounty then i would guess that not a lot of people want to join their campaign anyway. The job of a bounty manager is to make sure that everyone that is part of the bounty does what needs to be done and that there are no cheaters and no duplicate accounts or stuff like that.",
