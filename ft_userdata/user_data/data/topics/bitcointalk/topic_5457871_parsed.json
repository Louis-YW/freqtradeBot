  "content": "We recently launched a site called NAKAMOTO ROULETTE .comWhile it has had some interest, we have not had the marketing budget or partners to push the site to make it a success, and it really can be with the right person!After developing and recently launching the site, NakamotoRoulette.com - We have decided to sell.So we would be VERY interested in finding the right partner or just selling the site to someone who wants to operate it, under the same ethos it was founded upon: Anonymity and Trust.Sale includes website, server setup (in AWS), live roulette game source code (javascript, nodejs, python), result fetcher, etc. The LOT!HIGHEST BIDDER WINS! Some details;Games immediately available are LIVE Roulette Games, the source code to which is fully provided (game server, game client) and the video streams and results are available on a monthly contractual basis - negotiable. Possibly a small revenue share of action over those games specifically or something like that, so to ensure the site is profitable no monthly minimums or other service fees would be charged.We can offer more games later when we have them ready, as we plan to roll out a slots and traditional casino game (RNG suite) to all our sites.Hosting is really cheap using EC2 VPS instances with AWS as well as Hetzner - this could be shrunk since much of that is development environment, currently on the order of 100-200 per month but could be pretty much halved.Incoming revenue is near-zero right now, there are 2-3 players a day and the site is winning maybe 1k-2k satoshi daily - it is absolutely tiny right now, since there is no marketing activity going on. With marketing, this site could do VERY well! We have been involved and setup sites before that have done amazingly.All it needs is a marketing plan and budget!STARTING BID: 1 BTCitcoin.",

We hope whoever operates the site can find the right slots games provider where those issues are not concerns.LIVE Feed Provision (included);Really excellent point: we would offer a monthly contract or revenue share for the continued ongoing provision of the live feeds - we have license to the source feeds via another company and can continue to offer these to whoever operates the website. We would include some months free, no monthly minimums and a basic capped fee - ensuring there is only a cost when there is revenues and always low enough to ensure profitability of the site.",

We hope whoever operates the site can find the right slots games provider where those issues are not concerns.Allowing players to invest to casino bankroll is one way of casino method to get bankroll investment especially if your casino is running for a long time. I think you can do this here to help you get enough budget to operate the casino smoothly. I just think that you really need to add games like the popular blackjack and bacarrat to make your casino attractive to players. You have a fair point about license and anonymity. What I’m really pointing out with more games is more live feed games from the same casino that you are getting the feed of your current roulette. I’m sure that casino is not limited only to roulette. maybe you can try to partner with them to provide even 1 Blackjack and Bacarrat table dedicated for your live feed.Quote from: nakaroulette on June 28, 2023, 11:22:38 AMLIVE Feed Provision (included);Really excellent point: we would offer a monthly contract or revenue share for the continued ongoing provision of the live feeds - we have license to the source feeds via another company and can continue to offer these to whoever operates the website.

Of course we plan to add more games eventually also.With the right partner and marketing, it could be great!",

Sometimes it really could suck this way to find a lasting solution to pending issues at hand and you could not hold it back but put it up for sale. I was wondering what really happened if you could not do a good advertisement calling for investors to partner with the roulette and possibly you could get one rather than putting it up for sales because merely putting it up for sales, you have already made the community having some thoughts about it and maybe that might not be the real deal as they have such thoughts running on their mind.A marketing campaign as you have mentioned would likely be the answer to your predicament currently and I believe that would ease some headaches and possibly attract much traffic to your roulette casino.",

It is when you guys didn't we a buyer as you stated that is when you guys are still on service. Marketing was the problem that your casino had,because the casino doesn't have adverts and it will be rare for you to have potential users. This is why when you are setting up a new business,you should consider have a marketing strategy to sell your products or services out to the people.",
