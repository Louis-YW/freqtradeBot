If you don't have time, just like the typical gift of money will certainly suffice.But if you want it to be memorable and you want him to use something then some tumbler or mug while gambling to have something to drink is also a good idea.",

      "body": "A gambler would like to go to a thematic casino he hasn't been before, possibly in another region or country, with accommodation, transportation and food included on the package. It's a very expensive gift to give someone, but that is an ideal one many must dream about. On the other hand, there are cheaper gifts possibilities as well:A simple credit of few hundreds of dollar for a gambler to play at the casino of his preference would be already a very welcome surprise for most of them in this Holidays' season.",

Owning Bitcoin is a gamble, this gambling friend will really enjoy it. This way they can see the ups and downs of what is the big risk that gamblers can see. Bitcoin is an exponential industry that is growing, most importantly having knowledge of cryptocurrency can support gamblers. Your friend will be bestowed in a brighter future with a gift that can flourish, and your friend will absolutely appreciate it.",
