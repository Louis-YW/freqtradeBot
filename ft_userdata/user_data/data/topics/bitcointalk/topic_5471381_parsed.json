      "body": "For sure, this issue of highness is getting out of hand, especially among the youth, both male and female. It is not a good thing when they say a girl is drinking alcohol and even smoking, but most of our youth take it as enjoyment in life, which is very wrong. Apart from the complications that you just mentioned in your thread, there are many other complications that may include damage to the liver, cardiovascular problems such as high blood pressure and heart attack, cancer, which include breast cancer, liver cancer, throat cancer, and many other cancers, and also metal issues most involved, like depression and anxiety, which might lead to death at a young age.So I will urge youth outside their homes to sustain themselves and abstain from the use of alcohol. It is very hazardous and can lead to death at a young age, and not only death, but those health problems that I mentioned earlier can be inherited by their children. From there, you see, you have already created a problem for the family and, at the same time, for the community.",

Na so them been dey celebrate these huge religious anniversary (I no wan mention the name) for here. Wetin start as celebration come end up take two people lives. One them chook am knife for neck and in the cause of revenge, the guy wey dem kill people follow the other guy go machete am too. Now e don turn serious community crisis as dem no born you well make you trespass the other side without being injured or killed as a result. The thing they surprise me well well how our young people self they behave now and why violence no hard to happen now.Before these celebrations are meant to bring unity amongst community people and friends and family but now it id used to cause more fights between different groups of young people and what not. I wonder why our society has degraded up to this point now and I wonder what the security agencies and human rights are doing to bring these things to an end in a developing country like Nigeria.The thing they surprise me these days as you go young even teenagers at their 17s taking knifes, cutlasses, screw drivers and other sharp objects with them when they go out to celebrate religious anniversaries like that. Na so the other day, e never pass one month as we dey drive pass one village on transit, we saw boys and girls trooping on the street with bands and speakers dancing and singing religiously but at the same time, you will see some of them with those items under their shirts, ready to cause any problems that will lead to fight.I believe many of those boys are under influence and that is why they have that effrontery to become violent at any given time they are high. Na why I dey always drag human rights, security personnels and other related law enforcement agencies into this as I can boldly say that there is little or no advocacy on the effect of drug abuse and punishment to the perpetrators and sellers of those drugs.Lack of jobs, causes high rate of unemployment which results to many of those young people rendered idle. It is said that an idle man is a devil workshop and this is why these young people have resulted to those violent acts always looking for an avenue where they can converge and cause havoc. It is that bad but we pray that God will continue to perform it's miracle on us.",

Am not saying celebrating your graduation in school is a bad thing but over high yourself with alcohol and drugs is not good and it can make you to lose some part of your body, you will live to remember and share the story with your children in the future. I don't think bitcoiners has such spirit in this forum because, if you over high with the influence of alcohol and drugs and login into your Bitcointalk account and you break the rules that deserve ban from the forum, I believe you will avoid such drinks and drugs for the rest of your life.",

      "body": "Actually, it is commonly said that too much of everything is bad, and what they mean by \"everything\" is actually \"everything\", which includes happiness, over joy can kill, and i am not saying this based on assumptions, but based on fact and experiences.There was an incident that happened in my area when i was still living in Lagos before i relocated to the place i live currently, a boy of a little above 17 years of age managed to save some money from all of his school handouts, amounting to thousands of naira, he used the entire money to play lotto (baba ijebu), and luckily for him, he won, and the amount of money he won was a little above 30 million naira, this after checking and seeing that his numbers played and he won the money, he instantly become over joyed, started running over the entire place while some boys were all chasing him out of excitement for him.The guy was running the entire place and shouting, by now, he don pull shirt and trouser, was running with bare body and feet while the ones that are chasing him were still chasing him, all of a sudden, this guy run enter express road, na so one inter-state bus on speed hit am, the guy died on the spot. That was how what was excitement turned into tears for everyone around there, las las, the family collected the money he won, used out of it to give the guy a supposedly befitting burial, and life went on for them.So, this incident personally thought me that, over excitement can indeed kill, which confirms the statement that too much of everything is indeed bad.",

What I'm only against is people ignoring safety precautions during celebration thereby turning happy moments into moments of pain and sorrow like the tikme Buhari won election in 2015 where many people died during the celebration of the victory. It is understood that many people resort to drinking during celebration but I wouldn't want you to equate highness to celebration because people high even when bad things happen.
