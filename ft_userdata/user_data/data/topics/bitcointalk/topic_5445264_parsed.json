I became a big fan of fun tokens after freebitcoin took over because of the great offers from your casino. Maybe you could consider making the announcement thread more interesting and including a roadmap of fun so that more people can read and be interested.",

I was expecting for this before, although recently I've felt FUN in second plan by freebitco.in's team, without further announcements and updates.But now with this thread and frequent updates I hope FUN can spread among more crypto enthusiasts and grow stronger than ever.FUN is the most powerful gambling token in crypto market and to remain on this position for longer, constant development of new features is needed.",

But on this specific token that OP is representing from freebitco.in. It seems that it's a yes that it was the fun token that you pointed out because I've done my quick research and I haven't found the other fun token and probably removed by the websites coinmarketcap and coingecko. I agree that the chart isn't attractive looking at the perspective of how the development went. But for short term people, they'll be encouraged to dive in because of the daily volume as it's looking good.",

We recommend you write this on ANN, and you create an official thread specifically talking about FUN tokens. There you can update information continuously about the development of FUN tokens. Whether it's about the community or other things related to the FUN token. What's more, you gave the topic title \"announcements\", so it's appropriate to discuss it in the announcements sub.",

Bitcoin in the short term can deprive many traders of their money, and a fan token that has no bottom and no strong support can deprive money ten times faster. Fan tokens are a profitable tool only for their creators, any owner of these tokens is already in the risk group, so if someone wants to profit from tokens in the short term, then look better at projects from top-100, they are much more reliable and attractive.",

If you want to make this one as an announcement thread or even as a discussion thread for FUN token, you should include more details about the token. Team behind it, tokenomics, roadmap and recent developments.The thread is lack of all those information and if I didn't know about FUN token, it is hard for me to know what is the token. At least you should give link to Coinmarketcap, Coingecko and available exchanges and trading links. Nowadays, many tokens have same token ticker that can be very misleading and confusing for new people.",
