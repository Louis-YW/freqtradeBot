  "content": "I've been using their services for years and just thought I should let others know how good they are.I'm talking about Paynote.euI can usually cash crypto to bank in 5 minutes with minimal fees. It might take a little longer depending on your bank and time of the day, but generally it is extremely fast.Their support is also always ready to respond, and they actually solve the problem instead of giving you a useless answer like all the big exchanges do.",
