But the best is to go for a cold wallet or a multisig wallet on different devices.If you are concerned about your seed phrase, you can use passphrase with it to extend the word so that it will be difficult for offline attackers to compromise your wallet as different keys and addresses will be generated.Know that you will need both seed phrase and passphrase to recover your coins.

The simplest scenario is that you (for any reason) lose access to the app that you have installed on your phone, or laptop and you have absolutely no way to restore the wallet.Having a hot wallet (as Charles-Tim said) can lead to wallet being compromised due to malware etc, but not backing it up, you are helpless against the strongest enemy, which is the human error.",

There are other ways your wallet can be compromised even without backing up your seed phrase. You should be more concerned about backing up your seed phrase and securely storing them in an offline location so you don’t end up losing assets. Precautions can be taken against seed phrase hacks and your wallet will be safe from hacks when these measures are implemented but without back up your coins can be lost easily when you lose access to your device.

Enjoy your day friend.   It’s not about dying sometimes, it has a screen that can get damaged when it falls either to the ground or into a fluid in any case it is never a good reason not to back up a wallet seed phrase even if you trust the device. Even hardware wallet producers warns of backing up your seed offline. Also using an old phone you don’t longer use might be a bit secure for storage than the one you’re using daily for your social activities. But that still doesn’t eliminate the risk that the device might have caught malware in the past when it was been used. Some malware’s don’t go away by just wiping the phone alone.

Yes there it is better to do a duplicate back but make sure they are not that much that you’re even creating a redundancy. Too much back locations might expose some of them",

The trade off of not having a single offline back up (very small reduction in risk of theft versus very large increase in risk of loss) is simply not worth it.

But if I would do this.. I would not do it on a phone I am using daily it would be a phone that just laying home in my house.   If you never ask, you never know or learn. This forum have already learned me alot and will learn me alot more.  Quote from: LoyceV on December 06, 2023, 09:57:38 AMAs an alternative, you can just backup your wallet data. That's how Bitcoin Core backups work: copy your wallet file to a USB stick, test it, and make another backup on a different brand stick. Then, just to be use, make a new copy on a new stick every year.Thank you. I love to learning new things. , will try this later.",

You seem to be thinking in just one way that is the hacker accessing the funds by hacking the seed phrase by attacking the backup(s). Yes, its one of the most common ways that people lose their funds to hackers but it's not the only way that is the difference here. Assume the device where the wallet is installed is prone to be attacked so the user's wallet safety can be compromised in many ways from clipboard malware to getting complete access to the device so they can execute whatever the hacket wants from a remote location.So by not backing up you attain nothing but losing your chance to recover the funds if anything happens to the device where your wallet is installed.",
