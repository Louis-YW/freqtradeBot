A little patience would really be needing before this transaction would be getting confirmed.",

The change address will start with bc1.According to cash app support withdrawal is toÂ  any address but deposits is to the segwit addresses. But the transaction isnâ€™t looking as though he is receiving in segwit address currently because the receiver address from the explorer is certainly a legacy address while the sending address and the corresponding address is both segwit.

Â It's two weeks have passed and eventually, if the transaction does not push through in 14 days, it will drop from the mempool and back to the sender's wallet. Â I think OP needs a few more days before that will happen since it was already 14 days have passed.We should always check the mempool space for the transaction fee if you're in a hurry and don't use below 10 sat/vB fee for transactions because it will eventually stuck and you need to wait a couple of days.Â  Â Use a high fee if necessary for convenient transactions based on mempool space transaction status.",

This is completely wrong. First, there is no such thing as segwit network. There's only one bitcoin network.Second, it's not that transactions are usually confirmed in 1-2 hours if you use segwit addresses. Miners prioritize transactions based on their fee rate and the confirmation time depends on how busy the network is and the fee rate (in sat/vbyte) you used for your transaction. And where did you get the 10 and 18 hours from?OP's transaction was made around 11 days ago and that's still unconfirmed.",

If you have the technical knowledge, you will know what is causing the delay for a transaction not to have been confirmed fast. The main problem is the fee rate that was used. If you go and check the mempool fee rate suggested for fast confirmation, your transaction would be confirmed in most probably the next block or in a block that is not far away but that will be soon mined. You do not need to check the fee rate from time to time, use a wallet that has RBF, check the mempool, use the suggested fee rate and your transaction would be fast if you use the fee rate that can make the transaction to be confirmed in the next block. What I just noticed is that many people like to use altcoin wallet with bitcoin and they do not have the opportunity to use RBF because those altcoins wallets are not having RBF.",

But those wallets do not have extra features that a dedicated Bitcoin wallet like Electrum has. As you may already know, Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet or any other multi-currency wallet does not offer RBF for bitcoin transactions. In OP's case, I can see that RBF is disabled for this transaction. That means he is not using the Electrum wallet, or even if he is using it, RBF was disabled. The only option he could do is CPFP with his change address if he imports his private keys into Electrum wallet.",
