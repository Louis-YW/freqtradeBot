Can anyone suggest an alternative coin?For the moment there is almost none and those few who are profitable for some time soon become unprofitable,in general is a very bad timing for mining and especially those high end cards that you have.What you can do if you have cheap electricity is to mine the new EthW the coin which should continue the Eth road as PoW coin and keep it for the future,you can make enough of such coins with those cards that you have no that it has a low difficulty,so even if mining at a loss for these 3 months can result in a great idea and great profit for the long term.If you cannot run your operations because of expensive power costs then nothing to do except waiting for a better time to come.I would not sell the gear you have as they can be relevant for a long time in mining and we don't know how things will go.",

      "body": "Wow, 24 RTX 3090, impressive  With such cards, and at the moment I would divide You can divide in 4, so 6 cards each coin/algo1 - ETHW2 - ETC3 - ERGO4 - RVNThis way you can accumulate 4 coins and sell in a future bull market or a pump. If one coin fail you have diversification to help you recover the money.Don't expect profits right now or in a near future.",

Repair of the cooling system will then cost more than your profit. It is better to keep the video cards in good condition until the next season.",

Have you studied the profit when mining on Ethereum POW?If you pay for electricity, then it is more profitable for you to buy these coins, and not to mine it.And the RTX 3090 Ti video cards are better to keep, but the new bull market and video cards will be relevant in mining for a very long time.",

If you can use the money to pay for electricity to buy more coins. Repair of the cooling system of modern video cards is also expensive. I bought video card fans in china for $10, they broke after 4 months.",
