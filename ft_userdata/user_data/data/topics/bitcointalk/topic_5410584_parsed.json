If you are an experienced short term trader, you are used already to the high volatility. You can always try this one and see if you can make better returns on here than in your normal trading sessions.You can't just say that a trader will do this on other exchangers such as binance because they don't have a similar campaign like this but this campaign might only exist at the moment on probit global. The fees on this exchange can be a little higher but all the expenses will be recovered soon once you successfully win their campaign.",

And if I am the trader I will just go on much reputable one because for sure the profit we earn especially when it comes to huge volumes of winning we can get it without any problems. Even if they cast a contest like this with huge pot prize offered still this is not convincing factor for me to go and trade there.",

Turning a small amount of money into a high reward in a short time seem not possible, how would that be possible? You should professionally create an ANN thread about this.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on August 21, 2022, 08:43:41 AMI advice against taking part in this campaing.

I only use Binance and OKX for trading, but I have not done anything like trading campaign of turn small amount to high reward before. Although there are many promotional offers from Binance, but which I always do not look into, I just prefer to trade, but while reading the promotional offers (which some maybe can be called trading campaign), I just do not like the task given, nothing like money is involved from customers, just tasks would be given which can be related to trading, like customers should trade this so amount of money and be qualified to take share in 10000 BUSD reward.",

The fees on this exchange can be a little higher but all the expenses will be recovered soon once you successfully win their campaign.This only proves that you are not a daytrader/scalper. Fees, spreads, latency, liquidity is crucial for them. Pay 0.2% fee + 0.3-1% slippage for in and the same for out and your trade profit is gone. Many BTC trading pairs are free from fees on binance. Calculate exit scam risk while trading on unreputable exchange and this campaign is really not worth the try. No matter how much they pay.Quote from: doomloop on August 23, 2022, 12:56:32 PM will be recovered soon once you successfully win their campaign.Few will win, all will pay.",

Binance hadÂ  also tried doing the same since the time when they weren't this big yet. And Probit supports the shitcoin also. It'd be great if the exchange can really pull this off since they have been in the business for a while listing since ICO days but have not really make it big.",
