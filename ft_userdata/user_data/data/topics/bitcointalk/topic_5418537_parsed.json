But we are yet to see that.  However I believe some offline land based casinos have tried to go online during the COVID lockdown time to keep their revenue rolling but they are definitely not crypto based casinos. But if I think from a profitability perspective, an online casino can be more profitable if we only compare their gambling income. Because you don't have to maintain a huge establishment and many employees. But offline casinos earn the most from food and drinks. So these are two very different proposition.",

Do you think it will be good for increasing profit?I have never seen any offline crypto casino in my location by they are many fiat offline casinos around me. I think people prefer using offline casinos in places that lack basic amenities such as power and internet facilities. Others prefer offline casinos due to some other benefits such as interpersonal relationships and the environment. Therefore, some of them can be seen in urban areas that have basic infrastructure.It is also true to a large extent that gambling firms that operate both online and offline games would make more profit. This is because they would have more customers and greater share of the market.",

Most of the Casinos in my place already have their own fiat online gambling site and they started doing this when the pandemic happened where gamblers are not allowed to go on a physical casinos. This adoption allows them to operate and run their business even if there’s a pandemic, well if the question is about crypto gambling site and getting into a physical casinos, I guess there is still none and probably it wont happen since crypto are more logical if it’s remain online.",

Do you think it will be good for increasing profit?Yes, it could be like that, the chances of a land-based casino go to online casino (both) are pretty high considering what they suffered on this pandemic where lockdowns affected the business industry of land-based casinos.About the profit of course you will consider it profitable, but before having it, you will need a lot of budget to build online casino although its not that much compare of building a land-based casino, so this is really possible.About the other way around, an online casino having a land-based casino is highly unlikely, budget-wise, it needs a lot of money to build a casino considering the location, machine games, number of hired people, etc. So its much better for them just stay online.",

Do you think it will be good for increasing profit?opening a casino in the real world would need to invest a lot of money, then it would also be necessary for the casino to operate in some country where there are laws about cryptocurrencies and these laws about cryptocurrencies allow people to use cryptocurrencies without problems, that's how crypto casino could operate, knowing that there are very few countries in the world that have laws about bitcoin so don't expect them to see any physical casino about bitcoin anytime soon. now one thing i've been thinking is that even online casinos should have a company headquarters, but a real world headquarters",

First of those reasons being that going online will cost far less but the profit it brings is huge, -2. Going online will automatically increase the casinos user base, as there are no longer limited by distance, people from all works of life and jurisdiction where gambling is legal can sign through their online platform and start playing ...This and many more indeed proves that a landed casino going online brings more profit to the casino, than an already online casino building offline branch.Quotebut what are the chances that a casino that has started online will consider opening up a Land based casino in a very good gambling location? Do you think it will be good for increasing profit?I dont think this is good for increasing profit, this can only increase the reputation and trust score of the casino, but i personally do not think this approach will increase the casinos profit, except on an account that where the casino is opening the landed branch has no internet access and has great population, then maybe doing this might bring the casino a small profit, but in reality, i dont think a place like this exist on this earth.",

Do you think it will be good for increasing profit?I don't think this is a good idea for a known online casino to put up a land base.I mean they will have to compete with the top names in the landbase casino industries so that will be tough, in my opinion. If they are taking over the online world, business wise, it's better to stick with that business model. Instead of venturing out in the landbase market wherein it is obvious that it will be a different world for them. And that is why well known online casino just prefer to market thru sports and athletes, because they known that this is the best marketing ploy to reach for more gamblers that might be playing landbase. So at least they will be in competition but not necessarily having their own landbase casinos.",
