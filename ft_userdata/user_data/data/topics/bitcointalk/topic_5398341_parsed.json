They're not as risky as they have been and people market them as protections against inflation which fiat currencies don't but I think it's a bad idea to call them safe.Most safe investments have fallen recently, even some government bonds are trading at -% with only commodities out performing everything else.If you invested $5k into most stock markets you'd have $4k now.Forex investments are more stable because they're investments in diversified economies (essentially). Crypto has more growth potential then forex though as they also don't grow and have inflation.",

But in the future, he will definitely earn a huge profit with bitcoin, as long as he chooses to stay with it. Third, make him prove that he can turn $5000 to $10000 with Forex. If he has the capability, why didn't he choose Forex the first time? I bet that profitable investors will not frequently ask advice from others, especially Forex traders. Is USD becoming 2 USD in the future? No, It will never while bitcoin has turned from $1 in 2011 to $68,000 in 2021",

Outside of bitcoin, pretty much every single cryptocurrency outside stablecoins are very very experimental.But to answer the currency question: most currencies are widely widely adopted and have been traded for multiple decades. Bitcoin is like more than a decade old, and most people don't even know what it does and why it's important.As to your friend: if he thinks he can profit off of forex far easier, then why even force him to this industry? You don't necessarily need bitcoin or crypto to get rich.",

I've tried to explain to him but I can't. Well, when it comes to crypto Investments your friend needs to understand that it is a highly risky investment especially if you don't have patience and you are investing in the wrong coins. As for me, Bitcoin might have dropped in price like your friend pointed out but it went to as low as $25k+ and now trading back up @ $29k+ so you see, some people will say otherwise because they just made some good profit today which is the whole essence of crypto trading/investment, High-risk high reward.",

Once you reach the point where he says it's uncomfortable for that much to throw away tell him that's the maximum he should be investing. Also, tell him that if he does go over that is his risk and he shouldn't be running back to you and complaining.",

Expect that in cryptocurrency that volatility is high.Patient and know when to enter is what I preferred. You can maximize you patient efficiently if you will buy at a price point that is not on a sell zone. Bitcoin maximalist will typically say you just need to hold but what if you purchase at peak or near it? You will wait for a year or more just to breakeven or gain while you can maximize your profit if you will buy on proper zone and and patiently wait. Holding is the key to Bitcoin but don't let whales eat your money for there liquidity exit but rather use there money on TP.",

If you're having big drops, and big rises that's the best investment someone could make looking to make a big difference to their wealth in a short period of time.
