Blackjack.fun offer a staking to their bankroll that rewards user passive income.

It’s a site for gambling, so definitely if you deposit your money into it, then it’s for you to gamble and entertain yourself. However, if you tend to gamble almost everyday, then maybe you can deposit your money in advance and save it for your weekly budget. But still, I don’t suggest doing it because gambling sites may easily stop its operation without prior notice. Once the site is closed, I don’t think your money will still be accessible for you.",

What the hell will I even be thinking for me to do that? I see that as the most dangerous place to even think of moving one's fund into for the purpose of saving; it's not even as if you won those funds on the betting platform and you decided to save them there; that might be a little more understandable than just moving your money from Pan (the bank) to Fire (the betting platform). There are possibilities of you even losing those funds that you are saving on the betting site even when they are licenced. You can also be tempted so much to use the funds and make some betting in order to double the money. @Op I see that as a ridiculous idea that should not be added to a part-savings plan at all.",

Some gambling sites do not allow inactive accounts for more than one year not to talk of when it is an account with huge amount of money been kept there for that period being inactive. They would confiscate the funds or what if the gambling site shuts down and there is no access to them again do you  not think that is possible. At least you have been on this platform for some time now and if you really frequent the scam accusations board then I think you would have no such thought of saving funds with gambling sites because at any point in time some gambling sites shuts down without informing their clients and there have been lots of complaints of that nature of lately. Moreover, it is not advisable to save funds with a third party agencies or organisations when it comes to crypto matters. Not even exchange is safe with your funds that is why the slogan was formed \"not your keys, not your coin\" which is still applicable to any third party crypto organisation or agency.",

It is possible to save money in gambling sites and the platform has no right to temper with your money but it is very risky. Wait, OP why would you even want to save your money in a gambing site when you have a bank account where you can easily save money, in my country here it is believed that people who save money in their gambling wallets are criminals because it is known that criminals send stolen money to crypto wallets or gambling wallets where it cannot be traced. Saving money in gambling wallets is very risky, it is just like saving money in an exchange and when something happens there is no any near by physical branch where you can easily lay complain but when you save in your bank account you can easily visit the bank to lay complain when there is a problem. Also there is a risk of hack attack because I have heard some gambling sites have been attacked by hackers in the past and alot of money was stolen from people on the site and the money saved on the site were all stolen. Most of what I mentioned above doesn’t happen often but you never can tell when they will happen so we should be cautious about saving money on gambling sites. Though the most important reason why we shouldn’t save money on gambling websites is the temptation of placing a bet whenever you see a good game that you may think is worth playing, you will always want to gamble even when it is uncalled for. You will gamble against your discipline and you are likely to lose all your money. Sometimes casinos encounter withdrawal problems and it may affect you when you are in desperate need to withdraw your money so i advise you not to save money on any gambling site if you don’t want to lose your money.",

Casino is more on risk of losing money while putting money that is not meant to be spent will be exposed to a possibility for spending.I don’t recommend bank savings either because it has a limited amount to be insured.

It happens usually because they keep money there for too long or when they want to make a large withdrawal, and suddenly there is a notification that their account is frozen. Honestly, I don't understand why this happens, but maybe some casinos just can't be trusted and they might be trying to commit fraud.

Well now there are so many digital wallets available, everything is facilitated and we just have to choose the one that we think is safer and more comfortable.
