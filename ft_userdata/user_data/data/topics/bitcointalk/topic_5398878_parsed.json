Many investors lost their money as the cryptocurrency went from being worth around $80 to just $0 in a few days. There's a lot of FUD surrounding crypto right now, especially with Terraform Labs' inability to restore the peg.

The situation surely have created a temporary scare for investors who like to invest particularly in new projects. Many have lost a lot and most definitely their faith in the market has definitely reduced. The crash was substantial. I however feel that although people may become more reluctant to invest in new projects, it will not stop people from the crypto market which to some have given more than it has taken from them. There is still hope for LUNA by the way.",

The LFG funds were not enough to give whole of refunds to the all of investors. The ability for the project to wake up again from its sleep is almost zero for now. Many people in the market have been loosing their life and some even ended their life by doing suicide which was the worst decision that can be taken. The life was only once and it can't come again and people must think about that but the problem was developer didn't even care.",

If not, why?It could, but i would argue that it will only scare away people who know little about the crypto network, let us be honest, quite a lot of investors who bought that project did so basically cause of hype, and a bid to get rich quick, i am pretty sure most of them did not do their homework/research, they just thought of it as a medium to double their money, and we all know what is likely to happen when investors do that.Now the thing is this, for investors who have been around for so long, and who know a lot about pump and dump coins, they would not be too worried or scared away, even if they lost money to the project, they would understand that it is the risk one has to take when you invest with such pump and dump project, but for investors who are prolly relatively new to the network and straightaway lost money to Luna, i am pretty sure that could be the last time they invest, at least in a long while, till they do their homework.Having said that, non-crypto people are not left out as well, all of the news about Luna would give them many more reasons to avoid crypto all together, but quite a lot of them wouldn't understand that the problem isn't with crypto generally, but the particular network you invest in.",

The fud and fear come along with tragic Terra Luna's demise.The bear market alongside LUNA's collapse will scare away investors within the short-term. Long-term speaking, things will get better as crypto/Blockchain tech continue to take the world by storm. Even though prices are going down at a fast pace, development is still happening behind the scenes. Cryptocurrencies will become much faster and cheaper than before as new scaling techniques are implemented into the Blockchain. With the upcoming ETH 2.0 upgrade, the increasing adoption of Bitcoin's Lightning Network and new \"De-Fi\" platforms with attractive features, crypto is bound to become Fiat's biggest rival in the future. As long as decentralization prevails in the long run, nothing else matters. Just my thoughts",

I think it won't scare investors who want to buy crypto. but on the other hand there will be long-term impacts such as regulation. It's undeniable that for the past few days everyone's attention has been on the Luna problem, and that's why this could be an excuse for the government to make regulations.",

If potential new investors in crypto are frightened by the news about Terra (LUNA), then the market cap will be very difficult to increase.Quote from: Abiky on May 16, 2022, 12:10:46 PMIs there light at the end of the tunnel for the whole crypto/Blockchain industry?

I think Luna's issue has had a great impact on the participants' perception of investing in financial markets, not just the crypto market. I am very bullish on this market, but my priority is always safety and not the search for instant profits. Everyone will probably be happy or sad with the strategy they follow. Currently, the problem of not having a clear direction from the beginning always comes with risks, and subsequent excuses are only superfluous when all failures do not help those who see the problem of money as unduly important in society. I personally think there will be a significant rebound or growth in the near future, but I won't see this anytime soon and patience has been a factor that has kept me out of the crowd these past few days.",

I definitely think that the whole event around Terra (Luna) will scare away some or eve a lot of potential investors from the crypto market, at least for a little while now. I mean just look at what happened in the last two weeks or so. Even the people that were already invested into the crypto market were suddenly scared and began to massively sell of their holdings. Even USDT was at around 0,95$ at some point a few days ago if i remember correctly. So if people that are already in the crypto market become scared then guess what happened to people that were only thinking about to invest into cryptos in the future.

Investors may hold off for a while in the short term to start again in any coin because of the fall of Luna, not a few people lost, but that's not in the long term, I'll also answering OP question, I think Investors not scare, and will start again to profit from the losses incurred because of Luna, they will Invest do this either on the main coin or in another new trend later.",
