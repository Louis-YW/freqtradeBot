  "content": "During the weekend I was listening to an evening programme from one our the local radio stations they were discussing about gambling, the effects and how to manage it if you might be struggling with  addiction. And they had listeners calling in to share personal experiences or of a loved one that gambles and amidst many callers there was this very caller story that caught my interest and curiosity.She told about how the family members of a particular young man that is like a plunger when it comes to gambling, his compulsive gambling is to the length of him selling his personal properties and gadgets to make sure he gambles. So what he family did was to print a photograph of him and giving it to all the gambling shops within their neighborhood and around the locality, threatening that any of the gambling shops they have pasted the photo of their brother should they find their brother allowed to gamble in the shops they will sue the gamble shop owner to court as one that is abetting their brother's compulsive gambling lifestyle.Now, while I was quietly listening to the story in my head I began to ask myself several possible  questions and one of such questions was; is it not possible that this young man can take a cab away from their location and move to a far area to carry out his gambling since his a compulsive gambler.Just two questions here:1. Dis the family of this young man went too extreme in trying to help stop their brother from gambling addiction or not?2. Assuming you are this young man and you had to run to a distant location to carry out your gambling as you are allowed to gambling within your neighborhood and luckily you won huge sum of million dollars. Would you share that money with your loved ones who were barring you from gambling or you will just stay off from them and live new found wealthy live alone?Share your thoughts!",

While many people are gambling dreaming about acquiring enough money to purchase properties and gadgets, this man is selling his in order to gamble... He is going on the exact opposite way he should. Since he already has properties, he should care for them and make them work for him to generate profit and prosperity in his life. Instead, he is wasting everything on gambling, and for what reason? That seems so sick and pointless!Of course this man needs help, because he is completely out of his mind. His family is trying what they can do help him, and every attempts are valid, in my opinion. They are doing their part to help the young man, although nothing will happen if the man doesn't want to help himself...",

      "body": "Okay, so if his family doesn't have any real proof from legitimate institutions saying their brother has a gambling addiction, they probably have no legal basis for a lawsuit.  I mean, the guy's an adult after all.  Unless he literally cant make choices for himself anymore he can do whatever he wants that's legal.  It doesn't sound like the casino did anything wrong here.  The brother makes his own choices, even if they're bad ones.  His family might not like that he gambles too much, but that doesnt mean they can blame the casino and  he goes there of his own free will. So yeah without evidence their brother is actually addicted, the family doesn't have much of a case.",

So for sure, the families have no case,  because just by declaration that the brother havean  addiction problem alone is not a guarantee since the revelation is made only when he has lost everything.",

      "body": "This is the reason self exclusion must be an enforceable measure! If a family member is causing substantial harm to his peers by exceeding limits over his addiction, then it should be reasonable for his family to try and limit him for his and their own wellbeing as well. But if that person is completely cut off from the family and independent the family should try to become overreaching.It honestly all depends on the context. There could be legal grounds on the \"brother\" to also sue and win himself because if he's sand and not putting himself or others in danger while living alone and maintaining a job for instance, then he's not bothering anybody. Gambling down to your last remaining penny is your right, even if it keeps you poor, but so long as you don't become a burden to others by doing it, no matter how degenerate, wasted potential isn't a good enough excuse for a family to try and commandeer your life. Furthermore, if a problem gambler doesn't realize the effects of his addiction on his own, he'll never get himself out of the hole he's really digging to his own detriment. Value also exists in understanding your own situation after acceptance. You need to work on yourself other than just being restricted.",

Can you confirm how young is this gambler? Is he below the legal age to gamble? If that's the case then it's probably not that extreme for the family to ask the gambling shops not to accommodate him and also to uphold the law prohibiting underage gambling.The family's way of intervening isn't going to last though since that man will be of legal age sooner or later.",

The family has no legal ground to sue any sportsbookies. If they try it, the bookies can counter sue them and win a lot of money from the ignorance of the family. Neither the sportsbook, the boy or the family has any signed and written contractual agreement so there is nothing binding them. QuoteJust two questions here:1. Dis the family of this young man went too extreme in trying to help stop their brother from gambling addiction or not?This measure they took can never make the boy stop betting. Instead it will increase it because he will want to make money from gambling so that he can get as far away from them as possible for tarnishing his image. Quote2.

Would you share that money with your loved ones who were barring you from gambling or you will just stay off from them and live new found wealthy live alone?If I win, I keep all monies to myself. My family has got nothing on me. They have already done an irreparable damage by publishing my pictures and distributing it around without my consent. I probably will never forgive them too.",

It is for your own good and we know that family knows best on whats for you, if they do saw you that you are addicted already too much with gambling then the thing they have done is just right. They dont really just like that you would really be ending up miserable or mess up your life with gambling.2. Im not that a selfish person, even if they have been stopping me lately about my gambling urge or activity but still family is family. Money is just a tool or thingwhich family cant really be replaced. Of course it would really be sharing up in case i have win significant amount of money.ACtions made out by your loved ones just to make you stop gambling because they've already seen something bad will not be always a negative thing.The wrong this is upon you.",

Gambling addiction is in divers parameters that when you come around some compulsive gambler whose addiction is so intensive you may wonder if they are cursed as a result of how they acting in the opposite direction with their gambling habit.Just in similar manner some drug addicts behaves in selling their properties to have cash to buy drugs to satisfy their urge that's in same manner some gamblers exercise their addiction too.  Gambling can be an activity for leisure and calm down from stress and at same time it can be harmful if we are not watchful of how we manage our gambling life.",

If said person sold his assets and properties to gamble, then you'd better be sure as hell that his/her family would do everything to stop his addiction. Heck, this is already light enough really, would've placed him in some sort/form of house arrest if possible just to calm himself down and maybe find a new hobby. An addict doesn't share jack, they gamble it all again. Greed is insatiable, and they're always at that point in time where \"just one more big win\" and stuff like that. Though I guess there'd be some that might move on, those are really in the minority imo. And to add, having a lot of money doesn't exactly remove the idea of being addicted in the picture. I mean, look at some lottery winners who spend their money like water after getting a large sum all of a sudden. I reckon the same would happen to addicts really.",

Or just play online. If the person wasn't grounded and offline, there's only so many ways to restrict them. Better way would be convincing them not to gamble, and find them something else to do.
