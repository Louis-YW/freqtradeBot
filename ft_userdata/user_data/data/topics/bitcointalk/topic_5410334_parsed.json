This something interesting. Why Satoshi Nakamoto has not spent even a single Bitcoin ?  What if Satoshi even has more than that amount of bitcoin? Nobody knows that, bitcoin can be mined anonymously. If Satoshi is truly a single person, he could have mined more bitcoins and leave that 1.1 million bitcoin for good by not having the private key to the wallet again. If Satoshi is a group of people, they might have concluded to just destroy the private key that can be used to spend the coin so they can separately start to mine their own bitcoin.Quote from: DigitalMonk on August 18, 2022, 08:28:36 AMCan any one hack into his Wallet ?

No member here, or any other person knows why, it is impossible to know why someone else has not spent any of their coins for sometime, unless the person tells you the reason why, other than that one can only speculate. With all the investigations trying to discover who Satoshi is, nobody has be able to find out who he truly is, let alone know why he has not moved any bitcoins from those addresses since the world stopped hearing from him; maybe he has other addresses that people have not been able to link to him and he spends from there, and in order to hide his identity he would not want to move coins anymore from addresses that are suspected to be his. The mystery behind the creator of bitcoin is huge, and i don't try to know too much about him, i just concentrate on the network he created.",

I have looked through the Bitcoin Wikipedia and Satoshi Nakamoto Wikipedia, also I have noticed that more than 16 people are thought to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Most of those people denied, except one man, who has been nick named as Faketoshi Dr Craig S. Wright of Australia. But he has failed to prove that he is Satoshi. I am curious to read more about Bitcoin history instead of Bitcoin story. There are so much false story out there in the Web regarding Bitcoin and its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. I am just a Monk, a Digital Monk. I have expertise on numerical computation. Now Bitcoin mining mechanism supposed to be based on numerical computation logic and math but I see its opposite in the Bitcoin mining which is rewarded numbers Bitcoins to each manner. Did Satoshi set a mining standard based on math ? What is the proof that Bitcoin is mined logically ?",

This something interesting. Why Satoshi Nakamoto has not spent even a single Bitcoin ? Seen from the perspective of a society that measures everything by value, and through all crypto projects whose sole purpose is to maximize profit, it seems very strange to most when they read speculations about how much Bitcoin was allegedly mined by Satoshi, and that they are still intact. But whoever Satoshi was, I guess it should be clear to everyone that he didn't do it to get rich, although of course it's hard for most people to understand. It should also be taken into account that Satoshi was the first person to mine and that he had no other way to test and remove all possible flaws and vulnerabilities, and the reward per block was as much as 50 BTC. Under such circumstances, it was very easy to mine a large amount of BTC in a very short time and it simply could not be avoided.",
