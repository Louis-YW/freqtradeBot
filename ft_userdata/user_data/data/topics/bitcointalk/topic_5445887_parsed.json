  "content": "Hello dear community!If this post is unwanted or breaks any rules, please delete this post.It really only fits in this category. I have a Binance NFT account and Binance's rules require that you need at least 10 followers to post your art there. I'm looking for followers. It is of course totally voluntary and I would be inestimably grateful if you would follow my account. Many thanks in advance!Here is the link to my account :https://www.binance.com/en/nft/my-nfts/collected/noransana-d67b4b99b6ee2bab67ccfc63aa15c54fHave a nice day and best wishes,Nora",
