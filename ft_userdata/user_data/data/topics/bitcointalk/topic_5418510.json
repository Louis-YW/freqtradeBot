Our aspirations towards building an AAA-level game are what first sets us apart from others in the NFT gaming industry.Such an undertaking used to be impossible for independent studios, but today with the fundraising capabilities of the crypto and NFTs this is a realistic and achievable goal.Paying homage to the old-school fighting games we all grew up with, Wrestling Shiba looks to take that inspiration and apply it to the industry-defining innovation possible with blockchain technology.Wrestling Shiba is focused on building a free-to-play competitive fighting game with PVP & eSports at the forefront of development and design decisions. Fight Legends is fight gaming, simply improved through blockchain technology as opposed to being the center of attention at the behest of gameplay that’s dynamic and fun.SHIBA WRESTLER AI Fair Launchhttps://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0x3b114ADFF9F0263c37c45c3ef8fc79C5907B8B03?chain=BSCTotal Supply   1,000,000,000 SWWEAITokens For Presale   360,000,000 SWWEAITokens For Liquidity   179,928,000 SWWEAISoft Cap   50 BNBPresale Start Time   2023.09.21 11:00 (UTC)Presale End Time   2023.09.23 11:00 (UTC)BIG DATAContract0x30318737756Db8239859fc697426016eAB525f35Explorerhttps://bscscan.com/token/0x30318737756db8239859fc697426016eab525f35Sourcecodehttps://bscscan.com/token/0x30318737756db8239859fc697426016eab525f35#codehttps://github.com/WrestlingShiba/sourcecode/blob/main/SWWEAI%20sourcecodeTokenomicshttps://github.com/WrestlingShiba/tokenomics/blob/main/tokenomics-incl-wrestling-SWWEAI-shiba-inu-tiken-crypto-eth-0x30318737756Db8239859fc697426016eAB525f35.pngWhitepaperhttps://github.com/WrestlingShiba/Whitepaper/blob/main/WHITEPAPER-Wrestling-Shiba-AI-SWWEAI_V.1.02.beta_0x30318737756Db8239859fc697426016eAB525f35%20(1).pdfAudithttps://blocksafu.com/audit/0x30318737756Db8239859fc697426016eAB525f35Roadmaphttps://github.com/WrestlingShiba/WWE_Roadmap/blob/main/RoadmapTOKENOMIC`Shttps://i.postimg.cc/CL1chN0y/tokenomics-incl-wrestling-SWWEAI-shiba-inu-tiken-crypto-eth-0x30318737756-Db8239859fc697426016e-AB525f.pngOUR MISSION AND VALUESPLAY2EARNWrestling Shiba will offer players chance to earn WWE token everytime they play our game.Weekly GiveawaysEach week Wrestling Shiba will give away a PlayStation 5 to a random lucky HOLDR.
