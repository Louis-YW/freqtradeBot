Or do you want a writer for additional input on an e-book you are working with?",

I have firm belief that the generated text from Chatgpt is misusing of other authors hard work and is mainly reproduction of a writers copyrighted work without even mentioning their names or original articles in references. An e-book purely created by AI is not a good thing to loot money from innocent readers because if I'm not wrong then the users have to pay you to read that e-book, and that's totally injustice with those users because the writer of the e-book hasn't done anything to write that e-book but used an AI called Chatgpt to generate the whole text.If your intention in writing of the e-book is to help others in mastering of Chatgpt prompts then count me in because that's going to be a useful thing for the readers to learn. I will surely help you in creation of such e-book that could help the readers to master the prompts of Chatgpt so that they could use that AI to learn some good things or create something unique. The AI is quite capable of writing programming code and may help you to learn some basic concepts regarding many topics. However, using it for commercial gain isn't a fair thing because that would be against the rights of the authors whose texts have been used has datasets to train that AI. I hope you got my point, if you really want to help others with that e-book then I'm in and I assure you that I will write the e-book in cheap rates because I believe that such e-book could be very helpful for students.",

      "body": "I am not interested in this, tho. But I would like to give you a suggestion. Use Merlin ChatGPT (web access and GPT-4 engine available) or Harpa AI. These extensions can be added to the browser and, with built-in commands, you can use them to enhance your own prompts. Give it a try and there are many tutorials and other AI tools that uses the same thing. DYOR.",
