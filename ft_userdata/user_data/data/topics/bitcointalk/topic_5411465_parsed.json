  "content": "A powerful notepad is essential if you want to keep your information private. There are a lot of great note taking apps out there, but you can never be too sure about what's going on with your data in the background. What are some of the best note taking apps? What should we look for in a note taking app, and how do we know if it's safe?Some of my preferences that I think a good note-taking app should meet:A note taking app needs to be simple.A note taking app should be secure.The best note taking apps will sync with your other devices and desktops.The best note taking app should integrate well with other apps on your phone or pc.It should be open source? (I'm not sure about this, is it safer that the app is open source or not?)Preferably, it should be free.What note-taking app do you use? What are your recommendations?",

      "body": "I'd query the topic for the type of notes you'd want to take too.If you're drawing diagrams do you need drawing features like straight lines and features like a paint brush so you can draw a basic outline of some shapes and make it neater than predrawn shapes without needing to edit them much?There lots of note taking software online that can normally be searched for by Google drive and will offer you free storage and do most of those - I can remember draw.io off the top of my head. Most presentation software is also able to do this (libreoffice - open skuffe - and PowerPoint - propriety).",
