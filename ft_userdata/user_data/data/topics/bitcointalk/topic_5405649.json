Can this get me anywhere? Everyone started small at one point, no matter with what in life. Building even something small will make a huge difference over time, if you stay at it consistently. Even small steps will make a huge difference over time, compared to just standing still. If you just wait till you already have a lot of money, you will never get there. And this kinda applies to everything in life, the bigger risk is doing nothing.So yeah 100$ is a completely appropriate amount to start with. And then just find a monthly/ weekly amount you can afford to save into Bitcoin, then it will really make a difference over time and can better your financial situation a lot, if Bitcoin succeeds. So what matters is more what you do after having invested the 100$. But never forget:Never risk money you cant afford to loose.There are no guaranteed profits.Understand what you are investing in, use this opportunity to really learn about Bitcoin, theres a lot of catching up to do.Now about the current situation, the prices are down a lot, so its a good time to get into Bitcoin. And as a rule of thumb i would say, 4 years is the minimum amount of patience someone who is going into Bitcoin should bring with. And then you can evaluate if you want to continue or not. And if it was worth it or not.",

Can this get me anywhere? I think it solely, depend on how long you are willing to hold,  like jackg said, if its money you will be needing anytime soon, then i will suggest that you invest the money in some other place, if it must be crypto, then looks for a very legitimate, promising, highly undervalued altcoin and invest your $100 in, this is because investing $100 in bitcoin or Ethereum will likely not bring you any profit in a short term period, except you are willing to leave it for a very long time until the investment yield you some profit,  even for $100 investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum to worth $1000 can take forever, so you have to really sure of your decision.",

Even more advanced people shouldnt solely/ at all go into leverage, because you can also get into debt quickly.

If you are asking whether this investment gonna make you filthy rich and sort you for life, then the answer is most probably not. That shouldn't discourage you from investing in bitcoin and turning to altcoins as that's the common newbie mistake, thinking that they are too late to make millions with few hundreds/thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin so they end up losing everything on some shitcoin.",

Then we also have an upcoming merge to a flawed form of security with unknown consequences. And ethereum is even more volatile than Bitcoin. Its only argument is to be platform for shitcoins and jpgs that are stored on centralized websites. A weak use case. Theres not a single reason why someone should prefer ethereum over Bitcoin, and especially not a beginner.",

Can this get me anywhere? If you are willing to invest for the long term, I mean to invest it at least until the next bulls era after several years, I will prefer to choose Bitcoin. The chance to rise up much higher between BTC and ETH may be higher in BTC, ALthough this is not guaranteed, but commonlyBitcoin has better chance to rise up. But as otehr said that you must be ready witht he risk because investin in cryptocurrency means that you have been ready with all risks.",

People are advising him to invest in bitcoin and wait. For how long will he be able to wait. Even if bitcoin moves from $21k to $42k, he can only be able to make $200 which is a very bad business, depending on how long it will take.Honestly, if Op has some trading skills or if he can learn. Day trading altcoins with $100 will be a better option for him. He could get 1 to 5 dollars daily to add to his capital. By the end of 30days, he could double his capital if he removed greed.",
