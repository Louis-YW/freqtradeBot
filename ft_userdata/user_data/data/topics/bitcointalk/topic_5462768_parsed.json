Occasionally the tenth slot is instead temporarily sold (at a higher-than-normal rate) when somebody is desperate to buy it; in these cases, there is temporarily no chance of a factoid appearing.Factoids fall into two categories: First, anyone can request that a factoid be added (for free) if it would be helpful to the community. The factoid can be a short bit of info or a simple, mostly-unstyled link. Links to for-profit sites/projects are much less likely to be accepted. Create a topic in Meta if you would like to request a factoid, and the community will debate whether it is actually sufficiently useful to be added. Second, anyone who can see the private Donators section is allowed to add one factoid with few restrictions; this type of factoid explains the existence of the few clearly-for-profit factoids.I think community should vote to remove some meaningless factoids to have open slots for more meaningful factoids.Good factoids\"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" -- SatoshiThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.\" -- Satoshi\"With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.\" -- SatoshiMake sure you back up your wallet regularly! Unlike a bank account, nobody can help you if you lose access to your BTC.Even in the event that an attacker gains more than 50% of the network's computational power, only transactions sent by the attacker could be reversed or double-spent. The network would not be destroyed.According to NIST and ECRYPT II, the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are expected to be strong until at least 2030. (After that, it will not be too difficult to transition to different algorithms.)\"This isn't the kind of software where we can leave so many unresolved bugs that we need a tracker for them.\" -- SatoshiEven if you use Bitcoin through Tor, the way transactions are handled by the network makes anonymity difficult to achieve. Do not expect your transactions to be anonymous unless you really know what you're doing.Bitcoin addresses contain a checksum, so it is very unlikely that mistyping an address will cause you to lose money.Transactions must be included in a block to be properly completed. When you send a transaction, it is broadcast to miners. Miners can then optionally include it in their next blocks. Miners will be more inclined to include your transaction if it has a higher transaction fee.Whoever mines the block which ends up containing your transaction will get its fee.The forum strives to allow free discussion of any ideas. All policies are built around this principle. This doesn't mean you can post garbage, though: posts should actually contain ideas, and these ideas should be argued reasonably.\"I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.\" -- Satoshi\"Your bitcoin is secured in a way that is physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter a majority of miners, no matter what.\" -- Greg MaxwellBitcoin mining is now a specialized and very risky industry, just like gold mining. Amateur miners are unlikely to make much money, and may even lose money. Bitcoin is much more than just mining, though!It is a common myth that Bitcoin is ruled by a majority of miners. This is not true. Bitcoin miners \"vote\" on the ordering of transactions, but that's all they do. They can't vote to change the network rules.There are several different types of Bitcoin clients. The most secure are full nodes like Bitcoin Core, which will follow the rules of the network no matter what miners do. Even if every miner decided to create 1000 bitcoins per block, full nodes would stick to the rules and reject those blocks.There are several different types of Bitcoin clients. The most secure are full nodes like Bitcoin Core, but full nodes are more resource-heavy, and they must do a lengthy initial syncing process. As a result, lightweight clients with somewhat less security are commonly used.Be extremely wary of relying on JavaScript for security on crypto websites. Websites can change JavaScript at any time unless you take unusual precautions, and browsers are generally not known for their tight security.What is consensus?How can the Bitcoin system be changed?What is a hardfork?You get merit points when someone likes your post enough to give you some.

Anyway I see you stated the good factoids, need to be updated and need to be removed, but it's not all of the factoids. So, where are the rest? it's like soft-bad report or?",

Factoids should be:- Interesting, informative, or funny. The ones I wrote (most of them) are mainly focused on Bitcoin technology and history, but other Bitcoin-relevant topics could also be discussed.- Not obvious to 99% of readers. Ideally, readers will learn something from the factoids, and maybe even be surprised.- Not offensive- Less than ~250 characters- Very unobtrusive. (Much less flashy than regular forum ads.)I probably won't add factoids that consist only of links. The factoids are supposed to be interesting in themselves. (Donators each get to choose a factoid, which explains some of the existing links and strangeness within the factoids.)Here is another topic by theymos Ideas for new factoids?Quote from: theymos on March 21, 2018, 07:21:49 PMAlso, while forum ads can't normally contain images, I would probably accept forum-related \"fanart\" here, perhaps in the style of 4chan's board banners.

Me: Thanks Op for another new piece of information. I will be looking at this thread for further information but my post here is in favor of your 1 factoid only about which you wanted some updates but the second one i think you just rephrased it. So, i am agree on the point 1 but second is ok though it need no alternation. A question here: how can we add the data you (op) provided in the \"suggest Factoid\" heading because those links contains useful data not some factoid provided or proposed by other member. Do we or moderators or anyone have to conclude some 250 character based statement/factoid from those data or what?",

The bottom line is, activity and post points still continuously if one do not exceed 4 to 5 post per day and these accounts even though they post 1 a day are still qualify to be counted within the next points period.",

I just don't think that it would fit with the current factoids as none of them currently direct the users to a specific service. Or where you talking about the factoid generally recommended getting bitcoin from non-kyc services, without specifying which ones (sort of to raise awareness about them?).",
