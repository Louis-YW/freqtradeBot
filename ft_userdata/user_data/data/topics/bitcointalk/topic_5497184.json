In fact their inscriptions are useless, valueless.Check if you have any rare satoshihttps://magiceden.io/ordinals/discover-raresatsDid they expand their idea from this?",

Some \"rare sats\" attached to inscriptions have sold for multiple thousands of dollars.Some may say its arbitrary, and you will no doubt get the usual Ordinals Deniers coming into this thread saying none of it exists at all.Personally I don't really care about the \"rareness\" of sats. There's already so much \"value\" being created on Bitcoin outside of its original protocol that collecting \"rare sats\" doesn't appeal to me. But if there's a market for them, and people find them valuable, you can't stop collectors/flippers from assigning value to them.BTW Rodarmor refers to Casey Rodarmor, who came up with the whole Ordinals idea in the first place. He even announced it on this forum but was shouted down by haters, and then left.",

(The Ultimate Guide to Rare Satoshis)Can we relate this to Bitcoin Ordinals or Runes? Because for my basic understanding, it's kinda of you turning your satoshi into an NFT and that satoshi has a different rarity, how rare it is.Rodarmor is the inventor of Ordinals.Ordinals is a protocol for enumerating satoshis and maintaining that enumeration while accounting for transactions and fee payment. The enumeration is arbitrary. Anyone can come up with an enumeration. However, Ordinals will always dominate because it was first and it works well.Enumerating the satoshis makes each one distinguishable from all of the others. Thus, using the Ordinals protocol, a satoshi can be treated as a non-fungible token (NFT).With Ordinals, all satoshis are equally rare -- there is only one of each. However, they can be classified according to Rodarmor' classification system, as well as others, in order to introduce ways to establish rarity. These classifications are arbitrary. It's up to you to consider whether some satoshis are more valuable than others according to the classifications you subscribe to.In my opinion, Ordinals is harmless as long as there is no significant number of people who take it seriously. Otherwise, the fungibility of Bitcoin could become an issue.Rodarmor also developed a related protocol called Inscriptions that associates data (such as text or an image) embedded in the block chain with an Ordinals satoshi.I am not as familiar with Runes. If I understand it correctly, it is not related to Ordinals. Instead, it is a token protocol that stores data in Bitcoin transactions via OP_RETURN. It might be interesting to compare it to CounterParty and Omni.",

Otherwise, the fungibility of Bitcoin could become an issue.If by \"fungibility\" you mean the property that each unit is interchangeable with another, then I would disagree. Unless you believe that \"taint\" has compromised fungibility, I don't think it's accurate to say so. While \"taint\" has certainly affected the space by misleading people into believing that some coins might be \"worth less\", reality proves otherwise. You can trade any bitcoin for any other bitcoin, making it fungible. The same principle applies if more people start taking Ordinals seriously; as long as my coins can be exchanged for equal value, it doesn't matter what others do.",

But rarity doesn't change the value of something on its own, especially since sats are so tiny. So the value is mainly sentimental.Bitcoin is supposed to be fungible, with any equal parts of it having the same cost at the same time. That isn't always the case because some might want to buy freshly mined BTC at a higher price, or buy BTC from a notable operation on an auction. So if the index was calculated for BTC rather than sats, I'm sure those rare cases would find their audience willing to pay more.But overall, that goes against what Bitcoin stands for and shouldn't be encouraged, in my opinion.",

I agree with OcTradism that 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi and the only thing it differs is that the amount of money that is willing to be spent just to get that satoshi which comes back to my explanation about they only want to earn money by introducing new trends or ideas like rare satoshi not that I hate them.",

Yet, it's completely possible to trade them for an equal value in a decentralized exchange like Bisq, or even in centralized swap services for altcoins.Quote from: odolvlobo on August 25, 2024, 10:28:42 PMTry to buy a U.S. 1943 steel penny for its nominal value of $0.01.The important difference between Bitcoin and the 1943 steel penny is that a Bitcoin buyer does not care if their Bitcoin is a \"rare satoshi\" or not, whereas a 1943 steel penny buyer is a collector. The Bitcoin seller might charge a premium if they know that Ordinal buyers are willing to pay for it, but a Bitcoin buyer will just want the Bitcoin, so they'll simply go buy it elsewhere. Or to put it this way: Nobody treats a 1943 steel penny as currency.",

      "body": "Thought experiment about \"rare sats\":- Look into your wallet.- Do some ord-inspired search, retrieving the position of your sats in the block they were generated, and the position of the block itself in the halving cycle.- Analyze if there is any good-looking number or formula you could apply to one of your sats or blocks. - Post your \"finding\" in all Ordinals-related forums and try to sell it as \"the last hot trend\".Some examples:In addition to the \"rare sats\" (first sat in block) and \"black rare sats\" (last sat in block), we could talk about a \"white/yellow/blue/red\" rare sat, which is the one exactly situated in the center of the block. This sat could even be more rare than the first or last sat of the block, because some blocks could contain an even number of satoshis, while only if there is an odd number of satoshis in a block there's really a \"center sat\". There could also be satoshis sitting at the \"golden ratio\" between two halving sats, or multiply the first halving's first sat with Pi or some other number math nerds love, or where the sat number is equivalent of its difficulty.We could do the same with blocks. You could try to sell sats of the \"center\" block between two halvings for example, but there may be other neat formulas you could apply.tl;dr: I think there are almost infinite ways to find some \"rarity\" in your sats. So the whole game eventually will become pointless, as every sat is probably \"rare\" in some aspect. Thus I predict that the market of these sats is very likely not exactly bullish.",
