  "content": "Cassandre (https://trading-bot.cassandre.tech/) is an open-source framework. Thanks to it, you can create your Java crypto trading bot in minutes with our spring boot starter.This is a major release and, sorry for that, it breaks some things (Import filename patterns, files format, Ta4J no more supported, mandatory java 17...).The main reason behind this is that I needed to fix all the technical debt and complexity that takes me too much time (as Cassandre is just a side project).I think I managed to make something stable and I hope peoples will build add ons on top of it as I want to focus only on the core Cassandre features and not add more and more features with time... For example, I would be happy if someone starts a Ta4JStrategy class as a side project (as I deleted this class!).This is what's new:- Runs on Java 17.- ta4j is NO MORE supported out of the box. I was spending too much time on it, you can still use ta4J of course but you have to integrate it yourself.- The \"id\" fields (linked to the database) have been renamed to \"uid\". \"id\" is not used for general-purpose id (like the id order given by the exchange).- GraphQL API has been updated to manage the uid fields. Tests have been improved!- Backtesting data files names and data format has been updated.- You can now import candles or tickers at startup.- Deprecated fields have now all been removed.- Refactored documentation & french documentation added.",
