      "body": "My question is, how best to look for liquidity outside the projects? I have seen a good number of projects contracting liquidity providers to provide liquidity fo their coin/token and at the end of the day, this decision will kill the project in totality e.g.,  when the liquidity providers decided to pull out of the contract. Instead of the project owner making out separate liquidity mechanisms and providing a good eco system for the token.",
