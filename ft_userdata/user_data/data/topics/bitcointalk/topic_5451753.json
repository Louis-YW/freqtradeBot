LocalBitcoins announced their closure on February first week. They announced that their service will close on 16 February 2023. The fact is, they were still releasing new features til January 2023. At least this makes me think the decision did not take long. The company decided to close its platform within a short time. According to them, The trading volume in LocalBitcoins has been declining for a long time, and there is no significant market demand for their service. No company will run a business that is not profitable anymore. So, they had to take this decision.",

Local bitcoin has been in the exchange business for quite a long term and to see how low volume the exchange has become long before their announced closer it is clear why they were in a rush to close down the exchange.Trading volume is one of the major ways to check and maintain liquidities and another operational cost, and any business that has low volume will have a high chance of liquidation, so anyone that has a balance on local bitcoin should have withdrawn them by now since the announced closure of the exchange stipulate the durations of time that withdrawal will be open.",

It’s just unfortunate that they have to close because of the declining number of traders in using their platform, so nothing is really permanent.But there are still other P2P platforms from exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, OKX, ByBit, etc., that we can still use as of the moment.",

Scammer issue is pretty much solvable, in the worst case they could have left just the cash option. KYC also doesn't seem to be the root of the issue - they could have just migrated to another country (somewhere offshore). I've heard rumors that they were having issues with authorities, perhaps they were forced to close? But then again: why didn't they sell the company or the domain? I guess there would be many people willing to take over.",

I'm not surprised either as there would have been a lot of scrutiny on their centralised platform after many scammers, hackers and criminals had cashed out large amount of coins there, as it was once the go-to-place to sell coins anonymously. Hence implementing KYC I imagine, no doubt because they were pressured into it by certain govs.I remember the likes of Bisq from years ago, so aware that better alternatives have existed for many years already, but sometimes it takes the most utilised platform to fall for the others to really take off...",

Incapability or what? I've been using it for atleast eight years. I encountered with some issues at the beginning and lost fund, which was due to my mistake. Later I have been using it till its closure and never faced any issues. It is a platform through which one can find the right person to buy/sell bitcoin with ease. Earlier it had face to face trading access, through which buyer and seller agree to meet-up at some location and exchange the bitcoin for cash. This has been blocked for security reason. Over the year its performance came down drastically and it is one among the licenced platform. It's average trading volume of $40 million dropped down to the range of $6-$7.5 million which is a big blow. With that they tried to sustain in the market and unable to increase. This has been cited as the reason for the closure.",
