As for this forum, gambling is not moderated. Besides, you can see on this forum how their users that put on 1xbit signature are tagged and how the managers are also tagged which means one thing, that people should stay away from the gambling site with the negative trust given.",

Exactly. Maybe we pretty much pushed them out of the forum and made it as difficult as possible for them to work here, but outside the forum, they still pour a lot of money into promotion. I've seen their ads in google ads, even on very popular sites like CMC.crypto gambling long ago exceeded the boundaries of the forum.what is a paradox in everything is that most often the deceived users first come here to complain.",

Given that gambling is not moderated in this forum, I'm not sure if users who have been given negative tags continue to promote them because they won't be allowed into any other campaign by many of the managers here.Do most users there receive negative feedback from the campaign due to their inexperience as newbies, or do some still get accepted despite receiving negative feedback from the forum for something else they did? Because if they are still accepted after receiving negative feedback from the forum, those users who are accepted there will have no regrets for their actions that caused them to be tagged.",

Is that all we can do? I am surprised this platform is still running till date. The only way to have a legal action against is to collect all the cases against them and file a class action for there malicious operation. The only problem was the funding on this kind of lawsuit is so expensive which maybe greater than the total value which the complainants want to claim. IIRC this casino has no active license to operate so we have nothing to do against this shady casino to stop since they have no reputation to protect. This casino spend shit tons of money for there promotion since they are owned by same company that operates 1xbet which is very popular outside the forum. The only way to counter them is continuously pointing out that they are scam on there ANN thread here.This is same a lot of shitcoins rugpull on crypto space. We know that shitty project exist but we canâ€™t do anything to warn everyone about the potential risk.",

I am surprised this platform is still running till date. what kind of legal action? those who can make reports are those who have been harmed by the casino platform. that is also if the location and owner of the casino can be identified. Of course, that can only be done in countries where gambling is legal.in the forum itself, we have done our best. I doubt active forum users will be fooled into playing at the casino. except for those who promote using the signature casino scam. it's even more likely that those who promote the scam casino don't play there either.",

As far as I know, 1xBit is an illegal casino site. The site is not licensed by any jurisdiction, and it is not regulated by any authority. This means they have no oversight from any government agency or international organization that could shut them down if they were found to be breaking the law.Besides, the 1xbit(dot)com domain is already blocked in many jurisdictions. That is why they are operating under a different domain name.",

In this forum scams are moderated so scammers can be active as long as they violate any forum rules but if you have any solid evidence that many people lost their funds from this forum then requesting theymos may find a solution for this like banning their signature is possible but I think we need a convincing reason for theymos to do it.About legal actions its only possible by someone who got scammed by the platform itself and its pretty much complicated since we are talking about an online scamming platform.",

Personally I've used this casino in the past and I've been able to withdraw my funds and my winnings without issues, that's all I can say about them.",
