  "content": "Greeting's fellow noobs.Computer Science should be free, open and reproducible.This is still in early concept stage.Apart from the domain and trademark, the rest of the content on this site is Free/Libre licenced. Allowing for the following freedoms:The freedom to:* Read* Edit/Modify* Share (this freedom may be restricted to NonCommercial use by the CC BY-NC-SA licence)The content of CompleteNoobs can be imported to your personal wiki by using XML dumps xml.completenoobs.comhttps://www.completenoobs.com/index.php/Local_CompleteNoobs_WikiThere is already a tutorial on how to fork this project on the site (can do with rewrite - tidy up).https://www.completenoobs.com/index.php/Host_Your_Own_Mediawiki_Online_-_UbuntuMediaWiki can be installed on your personal computer so you can have a local copy to use offline and edit freely. windows(using Ubuntu/Subsystem for linux), Linux, OSX (not tested, but should be fine), FreeBSD and any os that can host mediawiki.Learning as we go, site will need to be NonCommercial in order to host CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Licenced content.There is a lot of CC BY-NC-SA content already that can be pulled into the wiki.Why MediaWiki for Documentation, easy to post, share, edit, can install content locally and can export/print page/â€™s to PDF (and many others).Why Documentation needs to be Libre â€“ Writing Documentation is boring and tedious, If you are writing a long walk through, being able to copy and paste one section and edit where needed, is super useful compared to having to rewrite the whole thing yourself.Is Documentation Important? Try installing Arch Linux without Documentation or a walk through, better yet just try VI the text editor by just jumping in blind.It is easier to learn and grasp new concepts by doing practical things.This is still in early concept stage, the amount of work left to do is a little overwhelming.This project will require: Time, Talent and Treasure.At current time I may of burnt out all three.So releasing concept early,Â  may have to spend time away from this project again.In order to host CC-NC-SA Content site will have to be NonCommercial.Treasure can buy Time and Talent,Â  may look into crowd funding at later date.In order to create an account on the wiki at current time, request an account on the wiki and message user CompleteNoobs on reddit, be patient i am not online all the time.Thank you for taking the time to read this far.",
