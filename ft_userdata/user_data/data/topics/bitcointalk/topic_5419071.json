  "content": "As we've already seen, near the end of October there were buyers who were coming in with serious volume, bringing positive momentum back in BTC.  And it's not just BTC...  Most of the other coins have closed their monthly in the green.So the question now is will this momentum continue for November or will it fizzle out and bring BTC back to 18k - 19k range?  I made the poll a yes or no question as I want a clearer sentiment this time.Here's the monthly chart.",

So far many other central banks pulled back on hikes and there was some QE with others. So people are speculating the same for the fed. However there is the chance that they will be hawkish as before since these rate hikes didn’t do much to tame inflation just yet. I will vote tomorrow on this poll.",

November (many have dubbed it Movember) has often been a favourable month for Bitcoin from past studies and I don't see this year's November being an exception. The FOMC tomorrow will, somehow, find away to make that speculation realizable by moving it north bound whichever way we want to look at it.",

I though it would end in October which I generally think was Uptober despite others not expecting a better month. I was wrong although there was indeed a slight increase in the final days. But it wasn't really a big deal. It wasn't even a momentum. It was just simply a part of the bigger sideway movement of the price. It was well within the range of this seemingly stable behavior.As December is coming though, I think Bitcoin will be more green than red. So November will be more green most probably.",

If you look at the 68k to 20k chart, it means that the next recovery will still be around 68k. Although we can't say for sure what the bitcoin price range will be until the end of the year.Therefore, this year becomes a long correction or even in the coming year before reaching the next ATH. It is interesting that we wait for the actual bitcoin price until the end of the year.",

We need to go up to that price and then sustain it that run.We've seen it happened last October, it's that when we reach it, there are a lot of sellers and now it became the biggest barrier so far for our next rally.

If they raise rates at 1% this will be a bad thing for bitcoin, I think a big dumping will happen but if interest rates are at 0.5% then things could be favorable for bitcoin as well as stock market.

I won't try to pretend to be a forecasting guru, but it seems to me that the current momentum will fizzle out and bitcoin price will fall again, returning to past levels. I believe that this is primarily due to the general situation in the cryptomarket (bearish trend) and the current small jump in value is only a temporary phenomenon. The market is not yet ready for a bull run and there are no prerequisites for this, so we should not expect a serious appreciation of crypto currencies in the near future. The price will fluctuate at previous levels with minor changes.",

But we shouldn't trust how it move because somehow there's no events or good news we are waiting for so most provably we cannot see a more bigger pump which create hype and FOMO to the people to create more demands on how the market moves.",

I understand the doubt because it has been over a year since we reached the last ATH but that is how long it takes to get back there. Remember last time we reached ATH before that, it was 2017 December, and by 2018 October we were 6.5k or so, and dropped to 3k harder in November 2018 as well, so after a year it didn't not only recover but also dropped further. This means as long as we are here, we should be happy and accumulate more and have high hopes that it will eventually recover and go high.",

Be careful about FUD news.If the results of the FOMC and FED meeting again raise interest rates to 75 bps, it will be a successive increase.Investors will tend to withdraw their assets on the exchange and I think that will have a positive impact.",
