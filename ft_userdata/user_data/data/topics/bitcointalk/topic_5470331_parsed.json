But probably this can encourage the novices to invest in bitcoin some weeks or months before halving.Any news from outside will be widely discussed on the forum and indeed this is not new considering many speculations guessing the same year.Encouraging beginners to invest from now on is important for their awareness before it's too late and into the halving year although I suppose after that there is still time for them to keep investing.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, many people do not realize that subsequent halvings, from a fundamental point of view, have less and less impact on the price, and on the other hand, it is already becoming a large and significant asset tossed around by external forces such as wars, economic crises, etc. Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on October 27, 2022, 08:53:31 AM1st halving was important. It reduced monetary inflation from 25% to 12%. Thats a big deal. Second halving decreased monetary inflation from 9% to 4,5%. Now we are getting closer and closer to the 4th halving that will reduce bitcoin monetary inflation from like 1.5% to 0.7%. Both numbers are negligible compared to 8% official CPI in US, 10% in EU or 80% in countries like Turkey. So my bet is that halvings fundamental impact on bitcoin price is getting lower and lower with every next halving in oppose to macro data, FED decisions, interest rates, recessions etc. Bitcoin will be more like an asset that act sometimes like gold on steroids sometimes like sp500 on steroids rather than it will fallow \"bubble x days before each halving scheme\"So, in my opinion, a scenario is possible in which bitcoin will behave unexpectedly, because for example the news that China intends to keep part of its reserves in bitcoin so as not to have to buy American bonds. Such news will pump price in 2024 and after halving period will be \"take profit time\" instead of massive pump.",

      "body": "the reason why (2&3) is simplemining farms do not pay daily bills to need to sell daily.instead they mine and hoard seasonallybefore even mining they contract in bulk deals of asics for a 2 year life cycle and also they dont pay daily/weekly electric but buy allotments of GW at a preferred bulk price to cover 2 years of continual miningbecause they bought 2 years of running. it doesnt matter what the markets do daily. they have 2 years to mine so there is no point stopping/starting or pool jumping to altcoins to play the markets. they just continually mine no matter what and then count up the coins rewarded at the nd of the seasonit is at the end of these contracts where they negotiate the next seasons deal where they then look at the amount of coin they hoarded vs cost vs market price to then calculate the value they need to continue operation. it is at this point that they will move the market to meet their expectationsthis is usually done a year before a halving and a year after halvingwhich is why the historic patterns show the start of a bull is the year before halving and the end of the bull peaks a year after the halvinghowever. market traders know this pattern and will take opportunity to fight the pattern for maximum gain, so this pattern may not continue as expected because other traders expecting the pattern will trade against it for their benefit",

I believe that the past three halving, bitcoin followed the same pattern and this next one wouldn't be different, history will be repeated again. Everyone is waiting patiently and watching how the market is moving to see if there will be much expectations from the halving, and maybe that is when more nocoiners will start buying, when they are carried away by the hype. Just keep on accumulating and forget about whatever anyone is saying about the next bull run because bitcoin price will shock a lot of people.",

Just like how the past histories or trend have shown that bitcoin hits a new ATH like a year after halving so is the case of it getting to lower price before the halving. Some even predicted that the last quarter of this years would experience the price low of about $20k less and some people are actually waiting for the right time. But waiting for the price to go down before buying isn’t a wise move but rather using the DCA method to accumulate whenever you have the funds ready. This way you don’t get to wait for an opportunity that is not certain of happening.

I’m the past years the last month August and September are usually filled with red lines but this year’s we experienced something of a stable price with slight movement. So even if the market trend changes a bit after next halving I wouldn’t be too surprised, the only thing is I am hodling till my target gets reached",

After that, most of the time a year around that time is probably where the actual Bull Run could hit because it is probably where the actual effect of the event is going to be felt.",

And this is fine, because the price could move there and we don't know what will happen, considering the wild movements of BTC, this makes sense too.Buying DCA on the spot market is very effective for current and new traders or potential investors. So even if we buy at the current price and in a week or 2-3 months BTC's price drops it won't be a problem, because we will get the lowest average price too.
