But there are many transactions that involve huge amount of bitcoin that people thought the criminals will not be known, but later known.After the development of other coins which are altcoins and their swapping, altcoins like USDT on Tron blockchain and privacy coins have become what the criminals are using. Little amount of bitcoin is involved in illicit activities. Fiat is neither the solution because it has been existing before bitcoin and it is used very well for criminal activities. Fiat is used for money laundering, terrorism financing, ransom payment and used as a means of transaction in online and offline scam. Despite the central banks and many government say crypto helps in online criminal activities, their fiat helps more in criminal activities, both online and offline.",

Good luck with that, even big time hackers end up with Bitcoins or assets that they can't sell and they have the option to either return the stolen assets or get trapped with tagged address forever. You can't steal Bitcoin and escape with it unless it's small amount from normal investors, this days transactions can be tracked and your KYC information can be the shit that leads to your arrest, I hope you aren't trying to look for a way to go fully criminal? Kidding.It's why the government don't like mixing services, that seems to be the only secured way left that criminals are using to get away with crime on the blockchain these days.",

NoWhy did you only focus on mixers?Bitcoin is the most traded cryptocurrencies, but that does not mean it is the most used in illicit activities when talking of cryptocurrencies. It was before but as more altcoins come, hackers turned to other the altcoins. If you have been reading more about DeFi and DAO hack, you will know that hackers and scammers are moving away from bitcoin towards altcoins. According to TRM, bitcoin used in criminal activities is reducing and replaced by altcoins:https://www.trmlabs.com/illicit-crypto-ecosystem-report-2023",

All real crimes are committed using cash and the influence of btc is greatly exaggerated in this. Why would an average villain use bitcoin with all the complexities in the form of wallets, transactions and other things that will surely leave traces when you can use cash, the movement of which no one will track and it is impossible to understand who and to whom, as well as what paid for.You say bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. OK. But cash is 100% anonymous.I believe that all this information about the use of cryptocurrencies for criminal purposes is being spread on purpose because banks and governments can't control it. If they wanted to prevent crime, then why didn't they abolish and ban cash, as they are trying to do with btc? Perhaps soon this will happen with the advent of CBDC.",

Modify the source code so Bitcoin transactions can only be sent with confirmation of your retinaEnforce new address generation based on DNA samplesOnly confirm a transaction if the receiver completes a 15-pages long form about the purpose of the transaction/sWe don't really need anything. I'm quite sure most of the largest hackers and scammers in the crypto sphere have been caught due to not knowing WTF they were doing. Bitcoin ledger's transparency makes it easy for hackers to reveal themselves lol. Our lovely governments have taken the worst measures already. KYC, AML, seizing the wrong money, imposing strict surveillance and control everywhere.. it's happening, and they always say it's the best thing ever against terrorism and other criminal purposes. But guess what? It never works as a tool against crime but as a tool against your privacy.Stop taking this thing for real, the money you own inside that fiat wallet is so much dirtier than my Bitcoins.",

The absence of central control and the pseudonymous nature of transactions make cryptocurrencies appealing for illicit activities.What do you think can be done to mitigate the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for criminal purposes? What measures should be taken? Your concern are real and Digital currency like BTC definitely has been used for money laundering but it does not mean governments has to restrict it. Because money laundering has been done before with fiat currency too. Why they do not ban fiat?The thing is, transactions are so transparent on block chain and once a wallet is attached or tagged as hacker's or scammer's or frauder's wallet. Anyone could track those wallets activity and authorities could track them back by finding loopholes in the system or by their up address. So that's why it has become hard for the money launderers to launder money using crypto and they are just diverging the interest towards crypto. Because I have also done a little research of all the black money collected in previous years.That money and hacks are mostly related to north Korea. And we all know that how outside world is disconnected to them and they are to outside world. But we also do know the danger of atomic power they want to acquire and they have the facility to make 40+ bombs but still they are not able to make one. Why? One of the reason is lack of money to buy required facilities. And they are not able to gain money by trading or doing any other activity because they are cut off from the outside world so all they are doing is made some hacking groups who hack different def and other crypto-related projects and that black money goes straight into some account which are being tracked now.And it has become difficult for them to move the money which is being tracked that's why that money is just lies there in different wallets from many years. That's why I said it become hard for money lay refers to launder money using BTC or any other crypto currency.",

There is no way to mitigate these risks except the user or criminal in questions opt for a centralized service where they have to give out their personal details to in order to pass KYC checks. That's the thing with decentralized computing systems. No one system have control over other computing systems. As with public blockchains, all transactions are publicly available for anyone to read however, there's no way to link wallets to users unless the user in question explicitly expose themselves.It's one of the downsides of blockchain and crypto. The good thing right now is there is no service right now that provides on and off fiat ramps without some KYC or AML procedure.",

What measures should be taken? Usually, cryptocurrencies are traceable through public blockchains, meaning transactions aren't completely anonymous and the individuals involved on them can be reached by authorities through minutious investigation. Therefore, there isn't any advantage for criminals when using Bitcoin or similars on their schemes. Thieves are much safer and have more success chances by using paper money, since it doesn't leave any traces backwards.To mitigate risks of crypto being used by criminals, intelligence agencies from different countries must be skilled on informatics and cybernetic environment. This way criminals will think twice before using crypto. On the other hand, if the intelligence is amateur and inefficient they may feel encouraged to deal with crypto, without fearing any punishments.",

I'm not saying it's not possible; it's quite doable; I just don't see how it can be done without invading people's privacy, which is the fundamental idea of owning or saving in bitcoin. Fiat currency, like bitcoin, has long been used for unlawful operations and is still uncontrollable by the government despite having entire control of the money in their possession and knowing every data of the accounts these funds are used for transactions. Using it for illegal activity will continue, but claiming that it is because it lacks a central authority that it is being used for illicit activity is a false statement that should not be disseminated to the public as such so that they do not have or feel a different opinion about what bitcoin truly is.",
