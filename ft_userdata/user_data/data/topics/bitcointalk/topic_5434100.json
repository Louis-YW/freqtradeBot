Also uses a custom power inlet connector that BM does NOT give the spec on.",

One watercooled unit that is more efficient than 2 nonwatercooled is cheaper100Th for 3000W or 250Th for 5200W. Its obviously cheaperthree 100 pros can run on low and do 24-25 watts and 80thso 240th burning 6000 watts vs  250th burning 5200 wattsis a better way to compare. and the water cooled is cheaper to run but not by much since s pump and raditor system will cost you money.octominer sells an all in one cooler that will work it cost 2000 plus import tax.it would fit and cool the hydro.three air units are about 5100 . if somone sells you a single hydro for 5000 add 2000 for the colleryou are about 2000 dollars behind and maybe 20kwatts a day are saved that is 1-2 dollars.so in 1000 to 2000 days the hydrocoller wins.but if prices of btc sjump hard you could mine the three air coller at 100th which is 300 th which would make more miney every day even though you burn more watt. and the hydrocooler would never catch up",
