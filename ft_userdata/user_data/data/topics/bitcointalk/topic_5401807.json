  "content": "Dear esteemed bitcoin community, I have read some interesting articles focused on Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) accounting system and public timestamping of transactions and would like to share it for your comments. https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-research/price-implications-of-bitcoin-utxo-age-changes-6ec8e1dd6a62\"...increases in the warmer bands suggest that coins that were previously held are now on the move and indicate a higher velocity of the monetary base. According to traditional economic theory, higher velocity, ceteris paribus, leads to higher prices of a monetary base. We can also consider situations where longer-term holders moving “cold” coins to sell them should correlate with lower prices. Conversely, there should be a positive relationship between changes in older age bands and price: an increase in older bands suggest that individuals are holding more Bitcoin and therefore should correlate to higher prices.\"A couple of additions: Remember that every UTXO amount is written as a binary number in Satoshis. In other words, for example, instead of UTXO with .5999 BTC, you actually have 59,990,000 sats. But every Bitcoin transaction browser and wallet however, will immediately divide this number by 100,000,000 and convert it to BTC.Also, in Bitcoin, inputs and outputs do not have to be equal. In other words, outputs can be less than the inputs, and the difference is the actual transaction fee. Many miners reluctant to accept zero-fee transactions, so in effect no transaction's inputs and outputs are equal anymore and still getting into the blockchain.",

Some even attempt to look up a reasonable current exchange rate and then show the equivalent local government fiat currency value.Quote from: Hold-n-play on June 08, 2022, 12:47:09 PMAlso, in Bitcoin, inputs and outputs do not have to be equal. In other words, outputs can be less than the inputs, and the difference is the actual transaction fee. This is true, however, the outputs can never be greater than the inputs. Furthermore, if you add up the value of all the inputs in a block and all the outputs in a block, the sum of the inputs plus the current block subsidy (6.25 BTC today) will almost always be equal to the sum of the outputs. This is because the method miners (or mining pools) use to receive the transaction fees is to add them to an output in the generation transaction along with the current block subsidy.It is possible for a miners (or mining pools) to NOT add the full value of the fees into the generation transaction. If they do that, then the missing amount permanently vanishes from the global bitcoin supply.  This is a very dumb thing for a miner (or pool) to do. Why would they put all that time and money into mining, and then burn the value that they could have earned? It has happened a few times in the past though (likely due to bugs in the software that the miner (or mining pool) was using.",

So when you say something like \"We can also consider situations where longer-term holders moving “cold” coins to sell them should correlate with lower prices.\" you have no way of knowing whether the coins that were moved were actually sold or simply moved to another address. For example I have had old coins that I moved to a new wallet simply because I wanted to dump the shitcoin airdrops by importing the empty key into the shitcoin wallet like BCH for example, but that didn't mean I sold those bitcoins that I moved after many years.",

Exchanges for example, will keep most of their customer deposits in cold storage, and this cold storage may not move for a long time, even if the sum total of withdrawals from the exchange is very large, if the exchange receives more deposits than withdrawal requests. Some people may also have sent their bitcoin to cold storage years ago, and with the advent of new technology, they may decide to create new private keys via various means that were not previously available (hardware wallets, for example).",

My most hated example of this is the Whale Alert twitter, which I deliberate will not link to since it is such trash. I remember back in 2018 when Coinbase announced they were upgrading their cold storage system and therefore would be moving around $5 billion in bitcoin. They made announcements weeks in advance, posted constant updates on their progress, and all the large transactions came from addresses which were known to belong to Coinbase. And yet Whale Alert still spammed tweet after tweet panicking about these large transactions, which a bunch of low quality crypto \"news\" sites (you know the ones) picked up on with stupid stories about how some massive unknown whale was preparing to dump all these coins, which then spread through Twitter, Reddit, and so on. The whole thing was a great insight in to the complete stupidity of many people in the crypto space, and how they believe literally anything they read with absolutely zero thought.",

Every time fiat moves, does that mean it is being used to buy something? Of course not. People move fiat from checking accounts to cash, from cash to checking accounts, from their pocket to their wallet, from their wallet to a jar on their shelf, to and from checking accounts, savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts, and so on.
