When you purchase, price goes high.To attack the network, you need 51% and that will be 9.9246 Million Bitcoin which is worth 285828.48 Million USD.Why will Bitcoin's Mining Fee go towards your garbage or schools?

Also, we worry too much the environmental impact of bitcoin when there's more pressing issues that's more impactful than the impact of bitcoin to the environment like coal produced electricity, stripmining, no innovation in battery industries, destruction of nuclear power plants and reliance on oil for fuel. The wasted electricity is the problem of the energy sector, they should have a solution to that problem a long time ago not bitcoin. 51% attack is difficult to do because there are a lot of people that's not connected to each other so it's difficult to gather nodes to be able to do that, not to mention that it's economically impractical for someone to do that anyways.",

You might want to take a closer look at the main option in order to have a fairer and more balanced view. Only then could you pass the final verdict and set aside Bitcoin. You might actually end up with a much longer list. There's a reason why fiat badly needs to have an alternative.Also, Newton's third law of motion is true not just in physics but in other aspects of our existence as well.

It is left for you to believe or not and come up with something from your head instead of saying what you heard from other persons. Bitcoin has advantage than its disadvantage which has made it the best assest to invest on due to its volatile nature. And you told you that government can buy all the bitcoin when they don't even know how many people have bitcoin in their wallets. Mind you not everyone will sell to the government because bitcoin is better than their fucking fiat currency that depreciates. I will rather keep my bitcoin than exchange it for fiat. How will the government buy the bitcoin that would be mined in 120 years by then the government that planned such would have died,so this can't be possible.",

Buy all of the ASICs from all of the miners (coins do not count because you cannot manipulate blocks using coins in proof of work).2. Buy up as many warehouses as necessary to host them with proper heating and cooling (billions more dollars)2. Replicate 14 years worth of block history which will likely cost even more billions of dollars to electricity companies?If they do that, then it will just as well be the central bankers who bankrupt themselves.Quote from: davis196 on August 17, 2023, 06:04:34 AMQuotePeople have been killed for it and tortured (sure this happens with fiat but the blood is on your hands now).Are you kidding me?

Is this unique to Bitcoin alone?If you check some other industries youll note that the scraps that comes out as a result of bitcoin mining is relatively small compared to what comes out of them. Those power supply unit could be recycled into something else since they are metallic and as for the heat we have seen it before where miners constructed a system that uses the heat generated by their mining machines to do other stuffs like heating water etc.Quote from: hsdjkahskjdh on August 17, 2023, 12:25:44 AMPeople have been killed for it and tortured (sure this happens with fiat but the blood is on your hands now).What about fiat? Owning bitcoin gives you more privacy than owning fiat, in fiat a worker at the baking section could be able to look into your profile and know how much you have inside your account and leak it to the public but when you own bitcoin you can have all the privacy that you seek, that is unless you decide to tell others that you deal in bitcoin. Thereâs no way for others to look into your system when youâre into bitcoin but that cannot be said for fiat.",
