I told him that the day our government will announce that BTC is now fully legalized in the country, I will throw a big party to host all the bitcoiners in my environment to join me to celebrate. If your government decide to adopt BTC or make BTC legal in your country, how will you feel?  Will you be among the people that will be angry because i know there are some people in our various places that think BTC is a scam digital currency which is not true, will you go to make them to understand it better in a positive way?",

The label \"legal tender\" isn't so interesting to me. A tax exemption would make Bitcoin way more useful, even if it is up to a certain limited amount for single item purchases. Legal tender should not mean tax exemption, knowing that the state is, by definition, hungry for money.But if bitcoin becomes legal tender there might become pretty difficult to know who and how much bitcoin did spend, since the grocery store doesn't ask for your ID.I guess that sooner or later bitcoin will be recognized for what it is: another form of money. Then it should be no need for such tax and legal tender would be easy and normal. But governments need to be interested to do such a move, so my hopes are very low on that.",

Making Bitcoin/crypto illegal is stupid at best. The government makes (some of) the voters unhappy and also loses money it could get from taxing crypto gains.So getting it legal is an easy step and a win-win situation. The \"like El Salvador\" is another step, a much bigger and harder one. But I wish you good luck and may the right candidate win and also fulfill his promise!",

You can celebrate, but a party sounds very unnecessary to me, why will you want to host all the people into bitcoin in your environment, do you have any idea how many they will be and what it will cost you?  A big party like you have described will involve a lot of expenses for music, food, drinks and decoration, all these are unnecessary expenses, money that can be used for better things like even  buying more bitcoins to keep. Do not let your excitement make you make regrettable decisions.",

Pretty sure you guys have some pretty heavy restrictions against bitcoin in there, or your country has outrightly banned you. That's besides the point though. The fact that a country could even control bitcoin in manners like these irks me sometimes, coz it makes me ask if bitcoin's decentralized nature is really that powerful enough to warrant being used in some places, and then I remember if it weren't this decentralized governments left and right will have vied for power already since bitcoin's takeoff in 2018.
