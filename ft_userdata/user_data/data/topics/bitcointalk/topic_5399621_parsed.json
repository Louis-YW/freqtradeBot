  "content": "Hello, fellow crypto lovers & entrepreneurs, just recently some sh*t happened to me and I just really need some sort of income source and I don't know any other place where I can reach a crypto market audience better than here. I own a few subreddits with decent activity and following, with at least 1k< pageviews every day. One sub is in the Blockhcain niche, so all the startups could advertise there, and all the others are in the music niche, so if any crypto+musical project would like to spread the word - I have even more to offer in that case.I would accept crypto payments. Just trying to survive for a few months, not trying to make a living here. I won't be charging much as this is not my bread and water, and I don't want to take away business from other people. I think this one could be more suited for those who just started, and do not have big capital, however, bigger players are also welcomed, as they have more resources usually. Â Discord/Telegram works. Cheers!",
