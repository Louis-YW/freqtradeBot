I assure you that I will not repeat such actions again. You haven't learned much since you just publically admitted that you are ban evading whihc is against forum rules. Fyi, once you get banned here, that ban is applied for all your future accounts (If you get caught that is).Quote from: CZKushan on July 08, 2023, 02:47:08 PMIn my old account I had earned some Merit through my postings and now I would like to inquire if it is possible to transfer my sMerit to my new account.

It is only allow to post in Meta, in one topic, about your Ban appeal. If you post in anywhere else, it's ban evasion.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM25. Ban evasion (using or creating accounts while one of your accounts is banned) is not allowed.[e]25. If you get banned (temporarily or permanently) and create a new account to continue posting / sending PMs, it's considered ban evasion. The only exception is creating a thread in Meta about your ban.QuoteI realized it was due to my mistakes. I apologize for them.Please create one topic, to ban appeal and if you have positive net effect, you will be given a second chance with your banned account. Second chance is like a signature ban 6 months, 1 year, 2 year and some combinations of such.Quote from: Nwada001 on July 08, 2023, 02:48:52 PMNO. Any banned account is band from doing anything in the Forum, merit sending is not excluded.From posting, editing off profile, and every other thing can't be done with the account, online login and log out access is what the user can be able to do with the account. You will be able to edit your trust list. naim07 proved that it is possible with a banned account.Confirmed there",

That means you have done something extreme of rules violation. Youhad to read forum rules and maintain them with full priority. And as you are banned your new account will also be banned as for Ban Evasion. Anyway you can apply in Meta Board but the chances are too low to recover.It's a good learning for new users who is trying to send merits to their other accounts or violating forum rules. So be loyal and be safe.",

I mean you are the one who has a banned account. also, I don't really think it is possible, for one, you need to be able to view the posts in order to give merit and from what I remember when my account was temporarily banned some years ago, you can't visit boards or read threads when your account is temporarily banned.",

I have learned from this experience and promise not to repeat those mistakes.Your post certainly doesn’t make you seems like someone who has actually learned from the experience. Because from your ban the step you’re suppose to take is to read on how the forum works and if at all you have actually done that then you would have found out that you ain’t to create a new account and be asking for how to merit your new account rather you would have open up a ban appeal thread. But with this your thread I don’t think you will certainly have any hope recovering that account. You should ask yourself if the ban thing actually works like you asked where people just return back with a new account then transfer there things into the new one then the whole idea of ban will be useless. As you’re seeking for advice I would ask you to lock this thread and go and open up a ban appeal thread",
