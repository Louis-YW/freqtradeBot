They try to scam us and if they are scammers, they will not hire any expert from cryptocurrency and blockchain industry to make things right.Gary failed to protect his view that altcoins are securities. He could not answer Ethereum is a security or not a security.The first thing they should do is to fire the scammer Gary Gensler.QuoteI believe people like Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, and Peter Todd should be in a panel together to discuss, debate about crypto and educate the bureaucrats.They love freedom and they will not want to be controlled by government agencies.",

FIATwhen an employee receives fiat. its not capgains they need to audit. its income taxwhen a retail business receives fiat. its not capgains they need to audit. its corporation taxwhen a investor receives fiat from an investment. its not income tax they need to audit. its capgainsfiat held in a personal bank account is treated with different rules and policies to that of fiat stored in a brokerage which is treated differently to fiat stored in a retail business",

(consumer protections) and where scam coins should be regulated and prevented from being promoted/advertised and pumped.gensler diud actually spend a few years learning about crypto. and went on to then lecture about it to students.. not perfect analogies he used and he kept asking his students to inform the class. so not 100% educated, but he tried more then other types like warren, yellen and suchhowever he is more standback-ish by saying businesses need to be regulated but then not actually making clear guidelines on the process. it need to be formalised and set in stone like a proper policy guide. rather than an 'unofficial opinion'  of if something should be commodity or security with no clear final official milestoned answer/decision made.",

The US doesn’t want to lose value in the $ so they will do everything in their power to try & prop it up. The SEC & Gensler are not trying to protect investors, they are trying to protect big banking institutions & the $ value. Evidence of this is approving all kinds of bitcoin futures ETF’s, leverage ETF’s & not a spot ETF. Unfortunately them bitcoin isn’t going away & they will soon have to clear a path for bitcoin.",
