Its availability is also only on Chrome.Mnemonic code generation by a popular and trusted wallet is fine. The seed generation process is secure as it widely can be viewed by those who understand. Until this time, A popular wallet user is safe from any mnemonic code vulnerability that I'm aware of.The possibility of your friend getting hacked due to personal security issues is more likely than a standard process of mnemonic code generation and potential collision. So without knowing your friend's digital hygiene, it is hard to seek the actual reason for it getting hacked.",

I don't really know the numbers but as far as i know it is almost impossible to brute force the because there are millions of possible solutions obviously. So i would guess the reason why your friend was hacked was not the mnemonic phrase but the way he created it or how he saved or stored it. Usually you are connected to the internet when you are creating your mnemonic phrase no matter if you are creating it for metamask or for a desktop wallet. So if your PC is already infected with a malware or something when you are doing that they can already get the phrase there.",

What I do is often change the wallet if the wallet is used for airdrop transactions because it is so easy for hackers to get our wallet data by sending dusting tokens. but without the information experienced by a friend, I think it is an unnatural thing. did he make a mistake he wasn't aware of?This is why it is advisable to use a different wallet for Airdrops if you are the type that participates in airdrops however, I too don't think Mnemonic is that easy to break if you did not place them carelessly. Safeguarding your login information can not be overemphasized and connecting your wallet to every site is not advisable too, I would normally write down all my Info in different Dairies and have soft copies of them too, and these devices I never connect to the internet.",

But a reputable one doesn't have that control to all of their users. I'm guessing that this is another fault of the user for which your friend has been a victim of phishing or has downloaded a malware.",

Somehow I found Back my ledger and then was able to access it, obviously the first thing I did was to reset and took entire back up of it. Now if being owner of that I went through all that trouble, just imagine how hard it could be for someone third party to hack into someone’s non custodial wallet and gain access. Seems impossible. It’s safe for me.",

But from my experiences I think to hack cases can happen without any loopholes created by the hackers victims (in this case your friend was the victim).I don't know the popularity of coin98 and this just makes me wonder about its own safety too. I have used electrum for a while now and since I kept my mnemonic key/ seed phrase safe I really haven't had any issues I believe the security behind it is impenetrable except their are so vulnerable actions on my path.",

This seems like the most likely option, people are not really as careful as they believe when they are surfing the web and it is possible the friend of the OP installed an application which is monitoring his actions and extracted enough information for that money to be stolen, so the best thing that can be done now is to not use that computer anymore, backup your seed words and then make a fresh install and once that is done then generate new addresses with another set of seed words and move whatever coins are left there.",
