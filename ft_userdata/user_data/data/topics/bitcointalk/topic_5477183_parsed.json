I have not seen any bots make more successful trades while trading on leverage. If you can't have a bot that does the job better than a human, then you don't have to rely on a bot. The cryptocurrency market is just so unpredictable, and even with the tools that traders use to analyze the market, they have not been able to know every direction of the market. Unless a bot is designed to make accurate predictions of the market movement, it will not be able to make very successful trades at all time.",

Because as far as I know, AI is not as intelligent as people say, it is just code written by intelligent people who can process information and provide results according to their analysis. So the results offered by AI are based on the limited information it receives. While not all information is available online, there are sources of information that cannot be accessed by AI, trader experience, technical analysis, and other factors that make individual trading much better than what AI can offer.But maybe it would be no problem to use AI as a trading assistant, either to remind you to enter the market, to make deposits, and other things related to trading.",

And how long do you think it'll take to get to the point where AI doesn't need that supervision?I am not an expert trader so I will not expect some top-level analysis or profit-making technique from AI bots that I can recognize as a legit one. If I had some basic knowledge which I have then I might judge the results of AI bots, or AI chats that help us to make a trade. My point of view with these AI bots is a little different, which is, that they can't be used without human supervision, we at least have to give input and without input, we can't get output.And input can't be made automated. So, we have to get involved whether we are using AI or not. I did not use AI tools for trading, but I did try an AI chatbot to get results for trading, but almost every nontrading bot like Chatgpt or Google Bard will say they can't give you any financial advice. While a trading bot might give you useful insights but only ones to give you some ideas to do research. I think AI bots would give us tokens out of every other token that existed with filters like EMA, RSI, etc., and should give us the proper reason.",

Algorithms and bots play an incredibly important role in trading, both on traditional stock markets and here in the crypto trading sector. It even goes so far that the best arbitrage algorithms (i.e. those that are the fastest) change hands for incredibly large sums of money. This even goes as far as that around 70% of all executed trades are done by bots nowadays: QuoteAlgo trading bots, or algorithmic trading robots, are computer programs that use complex algorithms to rapidly buy and sell stocks on the financial markets. Today, over 70% of all trades are made by algo bots, and they're reshaping how the markets function.SourceMachines are simply much better traders than humans, if only because they are not influenced by emotions. What machines are not (yet) so good at, however, is recognizing large correlations at a glance and drawing conclusions from them, e.g. when analysing charts from the past. Here, however, I think AI-based algorithms could definitely be an asset in the foreseeable future.",

The bots that execute the orders are also completely unsupervised and act at their own discretion. This has already led to flash crashes on the stock markets, when bots have spiraled into a cascade of selling. AI is a great buzzword here, but ... what do you expect from AI in this context? The bots are already very advanced and can react to market situations almost in real time and make decisions independently. AI would hardly bring any improvements here, especially since they are usually trained on very old data.",

Because AI does not know which is right or wrong.In AI or trading bots, even if they are advanced to here or good to here, I'm still not convinced that, with the current state of AI nowadays, it will be reliable to predict the market or decide my trading move. The thing is, even though AI is advanced without data, it will not function; data is what AI needs, and we know the crypto market is unpredictable; the movements in the market are undefined. That's why we humans do technical analysis and such other things to find a good position, and even if we have a position or map in the market in mind, there is still a margin of error. But AI or trading doesn't think that way; it can only analyse and make decisions based on the data it has, but with market volatility, the pattern and data will be difficult for the AI to process.In short, I still don't rely on AI for trading, maybe in the future, because there is a possibility that as technology keeps on advancing, it's not bad to follow and use trading bots these days, as your trade is at your own risk.",
