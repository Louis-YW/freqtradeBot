  "content": "11 days later, it is finally complete!BitMixList is a single-page site with a directory of mixers on it that's constantly updated. Think LeGaulois' topic, except it lists all kind of privacy services like kycnot.me.It is lightweight, and requires no javascript! (well except for the \"Back to top\" button, but if you can't use JS, you probably don't need that anyway  )There is also a (very long) history of mixing and mixers on Bitcointalk, and explanations on how mixers work (and break) where they cannot be locked or archived.I believe this is the most comprehensive website about bitcoin mixers ever assembled. Nothing else comes close to it, not even Wiki pages.Go bookmark the page so you don't lose it, while the Google SEO works its magic.This thread is *not* self-moderated. Whether this thread stays or not is admin's discretion, but I'm not going to delete anyone's posts myself.Onion link: kmzvdt7443fqisu27xw3saxv7rn2pmgx33zd2cy54ev2mbba2xjoziqd.onionUPDATE 2024-01-01, posting links to mixers is no longer allowed. Therefore, in order to avoid running afoul of the new rules, I recommend people do not recommend specific mixers when writing a post about it. Instead, they should tell people to look at a mixer list like this one or the bitlist.co website by icopress.If anyone has any moderation concerns about this web resource, please PM me. I will be happy to talk.",

      "body": "I think in the future we will see and identify anyone trying to constantly shill for certain mixers, I mean some mixers might hire a shill service to have a bunch of strangers coming here and discuss about certain sites that has a directory like yours. This is not about whether it's a good idea to have such directories or not, this is more about malicious actors trying to bypass the ban.However I think having a page dedicated for mixers in general is useful as long as it has no malicious intent behind it and stays informative without advertising for a certain service.(such as your site).Good job.",

More lists by independent users means less chance for one of them to hide a phishing link somewhere.How about adding some extra metadata about each mixer, like what mixhub does?
