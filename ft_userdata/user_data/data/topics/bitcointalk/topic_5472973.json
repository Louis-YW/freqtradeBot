Give her the seed phrase and tell her to backup the seed phrase in three locations that are safe.If you do not have an airgapped device, you can still help her if she trust you and if you can format your phone for her. Format your phone, install Electrum on it from https://electrum.org and verify its PGP signature, copy it on a formated flashdrive that the phone support. Format the phone again, install the Electrum from the flash. Generate the seed phrase, keys and addresses. Tell her to backup the seed phrase and help her to fund the address with the amount that she wants.If I am the one helping her, I will advise her to use passphrase and I will tell her how she can lose her coins if she lose either the seed phrase or the passphrase and that she should backup both differently in different locations. Having passphrase can be very helpful for her against offline attackers.",

      "body": "Actually it's not only with bitcoin but generally in other areas of investments it's not wise to invest the only money you have into something that has to stay for a year or more before you start making profits. The question is how do you intend to survive within the times, you can't starve while you have money somewhere that's why if you have to invest in bitcoin without you having a sustainability source of income or a skill to make money for your sustainability while your investment grow you would be forced by hunger to sell your coins in a short time even at a loss to feed.  Bitcoin Investment is suitable for people with a source of income that's reliable as they can wait even when the bear market lingers",

      "body": "This doesn't only apply to anyone that wants to invest on bitcoin but rather anyone that wants to invest their money on anything at all. The mentality that most of us normally have when we are investing on any project is that we are going to make profits. Inasmuch as investment is concerned, our motives before investing our money is with the fact that we are going gain and not lose which is a very bad mentality. When investing on a project or a business we need to think about unforseen circumstances, like the obstacles that we may encounter in the course of making investments as these will make us have a frame of what to do when such circumstance arises and to make provision for alternative incase of such nature. We all should know that in life, investment is very important as through this investments that we can possibly secure our future because the reason why we make investments is for it to stand as an aid for us in the future or to stand as a way of relief at old age when we will no longer have the zeal and strength to work.Investing your money on bitcoin while you ain't doing anything is just like keeping your live at risk because all your attention and concerns will be geared towards the money you have invested and bitcoin though has started gaining popularity but no one can predict it's future as anything can happen though we ain't praying for bitcoin to crash but in anything we are doing in life we ought to think both the positive and the negative as it will stand as a guide when we don't get what we want or when things doesn't go the way we expected. Okay let's take a look at the Mavrodi Mondia Moneybox ( MMM ), when MMM came and people began to see the success others were making from it and they developed interest and started making investments and everything was going well, what most people did was to borrow money, some sold their lands and houses even people that first benefited from MMM even took the money they got from the Ponzi Scheme and their personal savings and fired it to MMM. Now when the Ponzi Scheme crashed, a lot of people were in tears, some people haven't even recovered from the shock till now so no matter how promising any investment might seem to be, never channel all you energy to it as uncertain things are meant to happen in the future so we should invest with caution.",

If you want to invest in bitcoin at least make you dey do small thing dey get money so that you will not touch the bitcoin wey you don invest. Na this topic dey make me dey create this thread Economy affects Bitcoin investors.. Because of the way bitcoin dey appreciate, everybodi want to invest and thinking that bitcoin go give them big profit for within few months of 3-5 months and dis people e no do anything and just want to depends on the bitcoin investment and thinking to have great harvest in this few months, and within this period, when thing are not going well with them in the side hustle then dem go remember say dey drop money for one wallet and dem no go kill or starve demselves when dey have money somewhere. And when you look at it na true, dem no go starve when there have money in the wallet. So dey will visit their wallets and sell dem to feed themselves. But to say dem dey do something outside di bitcoin investment then im or her go dey buy bitcoin small small every week or month with di money wey im or she dey get from side hustle. Na true talk be dis oo, because na who de alive de invest in bitcoin, you cannot be starving and have bitcoin in your wallet, the best option for you will to sell the coin and take care of yourself and your health.Having something doing that earn you money is good before kickstarting your bitcoin investment journey so that you can hold your bitcoin for long and gain more profit from the investment.QuoteA relative met me today and told me dat she want to invest in bitcoin and I asked her weti she dey do, so that when she starts di investment she no go touch di investment money until years to come and she told.me that na akara nai she dey fry. And she dey save #500 every day and she don save 100k from di capital and she want to invest in bitcoin with di profit and I was impressed. And I asked her how did she know about bitcoin and she said, she saw it in one my comment in a family WhatsApp group and she make enquiry and dem told her dat bitcoin na correct investment so she want me to teach her so she can invest. And I told her that all she needs na Android phone since we no get hardware wallet in di locality. And she told me dat when she buy di phone she go come back to me she she can invest and I told her dat dis is the best time to invest as bitcoin e still dey low.That is a good move for the lady, make sure you coach her how to keep her private keys safe and do not leave her bitcoin in an exchange for her, teach her all the basic things she need to know about bitcoin and wallets, and also let her know that bitcoin investment is risky, if she is willing to take the risk. Also let her know that it is not a get rich quick program or investment.",

Why many find it difficult is because they don't go into investing according to their pocket, they can even go as far as selling off their properties and making their life hard just to squeeze out something to invest in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Very much can relate to all that op have said, have a good source of income outside cryptocurrency is an important factor when it comes to becoming really successful in bitcoin and crypto currency investment, but this is an exception to those who are well skilled at Forex trading, as well as cryptocurrency trading as well, for as long as the party is trading and making profit every day, and the profit they are making can sustain them well enough to not touch that which they have invested in bitcoin, and possibly other crypto currencies as well, then it's completely OK.What is most important, is to not be idle, if you are idle and buying bitcoin with the little money you should and used for feeding and other basic needs, you may end up selling that bitcoin at a loss in a very short period in time, for bitcoin investment is most profitable in if done with a long term goal or perspective.",

Good luck to all newbies.This one wey be say you move from the topic wey you create enter another topic to they advise newbie to create better thread why you come create thread wey be say thread wey they like am already exist. If you want they advise people do something, make you try they lead by example. Apart from that thread other thread wey they related they for the local board, most of them full for other board.I have been thinking say na only me see that content mixing from the ops ooo,  but since the first member that comment didn't point that out and also a few other comments also looked away from that aspect,  so been no wan comment on that,  but now that you get better eye take point that out e come boost my moral to comment. The thread in its entirety is somehow since I was looking out to see some statistical analysis of what the one means in the thread title,  but then all that is mentioned was just a story of a family member trying to get into Bitcoin. My advice to the ops based on his second paragraph and on the condition of the family member as mentioned in the ops,  I will advise ops to advise her against investing in Bitcoin and she should use the 100k to advance her current business,  because is not as if bitcoin is a straightforward profit making scheme since anything can happen and we have a waiting period as always in bitcoin investment. Considering that a 100k Bitcoin investment may really have a long time of waiting to make something good in profits.",
