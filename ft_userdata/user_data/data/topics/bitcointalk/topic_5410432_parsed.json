  "content": "hello, I am looking for a good online wallet with the ability to create multiple accounts for users.I found something similar to this in coinbase, through api I can create addresses for each user, also identify the user through notifications from coinbase, but are there any better alternatives for this?maybe you can suggest something better for my purpose.the idea is simple, I need the user to have his own address where he could receive the crypt, preferably not limited to one currency and then on the site he could make transactions with other users (transactions on the site, of course, simply by rewriting from one database to another without blockchain) and then he could withdraw it from main balance of the site, the database will simply keep tabs on how much money this person has.",

If you wanted to do extra work on it or host it yourself you could look at payment processors for crypto which would offer much better security (as long as you can learn how to handle that).I'd imagine blockchain, coinbase and quite a few others would have APIs to do as you've suggested but I don't know whether doing something like this would violate their terms of service or something.",

Assign an address to a user and enable walletnotify. On deposit you will get notified and you can process the deposit however you like. Should be scalable.",

I don't know what do you mean your site does not allow coinpayments or BTCpayserver but I already have experience using them with WordPress. You can achieve what exactly you want in BTCpayserver someone I heard that they could make their customer have a single address each customer through WordPress and I'm sure you can also do that if you are a web developer or just read the full document on how to implement it. I'm not sure in Coinpayments their payment solution is only for receiving that support multiple crypto. About using ETH, ADA and USDC I think you can't able to add it on BTCpayserver I never heard someone succeed adding these Coins except on other coins that are similar to BTC. Anyway there is a list of payment processor you can try to check them and maybe one of the payment processors support your website.
