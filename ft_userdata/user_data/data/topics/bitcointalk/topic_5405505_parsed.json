  "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the thorn in the cryptocurrency market's flesh. Though, they are centralized platforms operating for a decentralized entity. But, they fail to keep themselves away from biased decisions. Recently, on July 5, Bitstamp posted that inactive accounts will pay a $10 bill on their next transaction. Such a decision became clear to them that users saw it as a biased rule to favor the platform; this morning they lifted the rule. However, users already left the exchange, and some users may lose interest in cryptocurrency due to such an order. An exchange with a reasonable board of admins should have thought things out before effecting such a rule knowing that they are many other competitors. On the other hand, users complain that the exchange is demanding a $200 minimum deposit per month to keep an account active. So if a user fails to deposit up to $200 per month their account will get deactivated. Such exchanges are making decisions outside the goal of cryptocurrency marketers or inventors. It shouldn't be this way. Some exchanges are centralized already. They should be a general central body that should govern every exchange in the cryptocurrency space. The decisions they come up with every day, and the threat of some exchanges going into bankruptcy in the cryptocurrency space is not helping this ecosystem. A rule should govern any existing exchange to keep things in place or the market will face more threats in the future.  https://blog.bitstamp.net/post/bitstamp-cancels-plans-to-charge-inactivity-fee/",

It's an idiotic move, since the inactives will not know and would just lose that money. It's indeed very close to stealing.I find it a desperate move, caused probably exactly by the fact people are no longer trade much there. But not problem, really, there are plenty of more welcoming exchanges - with or without KYC.Quote from: Accardo on July 07, 2022, 12:27:28 PMthis morning they lifted the ruleIt doesn't matter. They've just lost a huge amount of credibility and I expect people continue to leave in big numbers. And this means lower liquidity, hence one more reason for the users leave.",

Though, they are centralized platforms operating for a decentralized entity. But, they fail to keep themselves away from biased decisions.It is their exchanges, their lands and they have their own rules. I believe that none of us spend time to read all points in ToS (Terms of Service) of any platform. That means you will be trapped by their ToS sooner or later. Don't say it as biased strategy or decision.QuoteRecently, on July 5, Bitstamp posted that inactive accounts will pay a $10 bill on their next transaction.It is still good. If you know exchanges have rules to close account of user if it is inactively after a very long time, 2 year or longer ie. I remembered I read it on Poloniex's ToS in 2017 or 2018.Exchange can update their ToS and you will have to accept it. A good exchange will give you a window time to withdraw if you don't accept with their new policy. Scam exchange will take advantage of new policy to steal your fund.",

Most users stumble upon crypto for what may seem to be a different reason; for-profits, trading, investing, etc. Many don't read or are not readers or not interested in reading about the ecosystem. Like you said lazy investors that see the exchange as a bank account. It's like a bank account to them, they can withdraw their funds since nobody or they have not enlightened themselves about the main cryptocurrency wallets that can be used to save their funds. In this thread, I emphasized that such decisions may chase noob users away from using cryptocurrency. So if the goal is to reach mass adoption I think everyone into cryptocurrency should not be considered a pro in the market.",
