Developing effective gambling strategies requires a combination of knowledge, self-discipline, and understanding the inherent risks involved. Overcoming addiction or developing healthier gambling habits often requires professional help, support from loved ones, and a personal commitment to change!!In summary, participating in gambling discussions can offer knowledge, support, and awareness, which may contribute to healthier gambling habits. However, individual experiences may vary!!!",

Conspicuously speaking, being active here in this section has enhanced and improved my gambling lifestyle, that is to say I have been positively affected in terms of risk management.",

NO.I find it useful and interesting to read the section and I also find information that can help me but in the end nothing really useful or nothing I was already aware. I have developed my betting strategy before joining btc-world (playing a lot with geektoy-betfair.com)I haven't any gambling addiction and for years I have no placed a single bet Meanwhile I found some useful suggestions on which sites to play or some promotions ... this is definitely useful and I'm happy to have known this subforum.",

I have learnt and grown generally and have been able to identify some habits that lead me often to gambling carelessly and needlessly.  I have learnt more about possible outcomes, and how to strategically bet on the most possible outcomes of fewer games, than betting for easy wins on a lot of combined games. I have learnt how to place online casino bets, the kind of rewards to expect and how I can use the rewards, the kinds of verification needed by the sites I register on, the right time to bet and refrain from betting, how gambling addictions can be easily formed and controlled.Surely this information can be gotten anywhere, but for one who is independent, being both an active poster and member has been more than beneficial to me particularly.",

I learnt to always set time limit when gambling so that I can stop when the time has elapsed. This board has helped me so many ways but these are the two important ones.

I mean it has steadily made me develop the idea of how I should be managing my bankroll, identifying the mentality I have when I bet and well, just standard enjoyment of reading through discussions of tournaments as well. I was kind of a rough gambler way back after all, with no rhyme or reason. Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 05, 2023, 07:16:56 PMHas it aided you in overcoming gambling addiction (if you were addicted) or developing healthier gambling habits?Definitely. Just looking at some of the stories told here made me realize some ideas on how I should properly approach gambling after all. Plus a lot of people also tell about their styles and strategies of how to gamble, and with me realizing early on to only gamble for fun, made me develop habits rather helpful in the long run. Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 05, 2023, 07:16:56 PMHave you noticed an overall improvement in your gambling experiences?Well, I'm still losing, not really sure if that's an improvement. Overall though not that much. I do get bored, and hence why I switched to sports, but overall not much. Same old same old really.",

It did actually. Looking back from where I was in 2019-2020, I would say that I was in too deep into my gambling addiction, and if not for intervention from friends and myself, all thanks to the gambling discussion by the way which back then had no shortage of constructive topics that discussed the dangers of gambling addiction and how you can get off it in the quickest time possible. It had helped me create healthier habits when gambling which I in turn share to people. The problem with the current face of the gambling discussion board is that, compared to how it was in the past I can tell that people are just making posts about their gambling addiction to gain attention and not really apply all the \"help\" they asked for in their posts, which is a bummer.",

Addiction? I didnt go into this point for me to tell that im really that being helped out on this manner.

Unlike before.The frequently discussed threads about gambling addiction is something that has stick as a reminder in my gambling engagements that I don't have to take this gambling thing beyond the normal. There should always be a limit to avoid addiction.  Go through people's stories and the discussions that follows about the effect of gambling addiction on it's addicts has really built in a great level of consciousness in me about addiction to gambling.  Others are: never chase your losses as it would lead to more loss.
