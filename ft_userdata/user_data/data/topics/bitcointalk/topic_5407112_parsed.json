  "content": "Let me give you a way to make an image into an avatar via android.A very easy way in my opinion to do and this method is quite basic. I have posted this topic in one of the local threads in Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) [TUTORIAL] Mengubah Gambar Menjadi Avatar. Who knows what I'm showing here can be a benefit for those of us who don't have time to work in front of a computer/laptop/notebook.I work using one of the applications in the play store, namely PIXELLAB. Here are the steps.1. Open the Pixellab app then set the appropriate size.2. Select the image component you want to design. Incidentally I created my own username avatar and chose the BTC logo as part of the avatar.3. Adjust the size (enlarge or reduce) as desired and place it in the middle position.4. Press the letter A icon in the application to write the desired text. When it is done, then press done. The next step is to select the font you want and then press ok. For text size, just adjust it.5. Press the save image icon and select the format (JPG or PNG), then your edited image will be saved in your android gallery.6. Next steps as usual. Go to your BTT account profile and upload your created avatar.Thanks. Hopefully useful even though it's not a tutorial from a pro editor.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5225472.msg60603355#msg60603355",

There are many other, easier ways to resize images without having to download an android app like the site you mentioned. There are also other sites that have the same function as express.adobe available on the internet, such as iloveimg.com, imageresizer.com and others, but not for making photoshop-like images on a PC.QuoteBut by the way, your tutorial is also good.Thanks @_BlackStar.",
