  "content": "Remember the once awesome crypto Technical analysis and trading terminal, one of the best alternatives to Tradingview? Well it's no more thanks to Kraken. They acquired it sometime back and then decided to abandon it  I didn't know this until recently when I tried to check on their website. I usually used the software until to stopped working for a while. On checking the site, I would just get redirected to this blog Cryptowatch to sunset: Kraken Pro to integrate Cryptowatch features which I see as a lie. Anyway I don't use Kraken.What is it with this crypto exchanges and ruining good projects. I remember how blockfolio got ruined by FTX",

I've witnessed many important and useful trading pieces, tools, resources and software over the decades, which taught me the way you have to be independent of everything in trading so far there is a trading terminal to access from exchanges.Back to Crytowat.ch, the site didn't just disappear, Kraken issued the scheduled fade off of it until September.QuoteWhen will Cryptowatch wind down? On August 1, 2023, we will stop new and existing Cryptowatch subscriptionsOn Sept. 30, 2023, we’ll discontinue Cryptowatch Desktop, Mobile, and WebAfter Sept. 30, 2023, we’ll refund any outstanding purchased credit to Cryptowatch users with balances on the platformKraken acquired it in 2017 and has been able to handle it well and even brought it into more limelight. For this, it's not independent, but all hope has not been lost since Kraken promised to infuse the service into their platform, which I believe they would have done by now.",

I have been on a paid plan, until it expired recently. I am waiting for the Black Friday deals, so I can subscribe annually.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 29, 2023, 10:04:01 AMKraken acquired it in 2017 and has been able to handle it well and even brought it into more limelight.

The thing I liked most about it was the desktop app/terminal option. Also, you have to verify your kraken pro account, so I gave up",

Frankly, it has become annoying to search for alternatives, but I have begun to feel that any service that is acquired ends up badly.I don't use Kraken and was planning to use them this week.   Now I need to look for an alternative.",

Then I guess they decided to reduce the limit to 2 so that people are forced to subscribe. A few months back, the limit for a free account was 3 indicators.Quote from: BitMaxz on October 29, 2023, 11:23:00 PMIf you want to use it free without a subscription and you have a Binance account you can use the trading view there by changing the chart mode to TradingView it supports more than 2 indicators than waiting for black Friday to subscribe for a 1-year subscription.Yeah, Binance is trying so hard to add features that one would have to pay for on TradingView like time frames that are less than a minute. They also have an option for one to build his custom indicator using basic pine scripts but still lack that option to show community scripts like those on TradingView.",
