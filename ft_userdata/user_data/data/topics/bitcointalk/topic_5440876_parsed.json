There is a lot of information about investing that I have tried to learn. And from various online platforms I got some information and ideas about investing. So I decided to sell my bicycle and invest in bitcoins. But since investing, the Bitcoin market has gradually started to decline. I invested with a small amount of money and from that small amount of money I lost like 5 dollars. But I am optimistic that I will definitely benefit from the amount I have invested.",

      "body": "First of all, congratulations on your first Bitcoin acquisition; however, many newer members haven't properly comprehended the concept of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, and the so-called success stories are to blame. You shouldn't be discouraged over losing $5 worth of value. I perfectly understand how you feel because I've been in your position before, but you should aim for long-term holding and the accumulation of Bitcoin while having realistic expectations. Chances are, if you're starting from scratch, you're unlikely to become rich from cryptocurrencies. Focus on your steady growth and don't be discouraged.",

Judging by your posts and merit points, it appears to me that you are doing well to be here. Good luckI encourage and salute you for your courage to sell your bike to start investing with a small amount. This will be like a demo account to understand the basics of investing in a practical way and for a small amount. But the amount is too small to diversify your portfolio. I really hope that you will earn twice the amount you invested so that you can at least buy a new bike, so there is no problem in diversifying your savings.I advise you first to look at the various topics that provide explanations on how to use a private wallet (not on Binance) and how to save your savings yourself. Secondly, never venture into investing what you fear of losing, no matter how safe that investment may seem to you.",

But I am optimistic that I will definitely benefit from the amount I have invested.Just zoom out the price chart to see its history. You will see a different story there. Don't get emotional over the fact that you just lost $5. And while you are hodling the BTC, don't compare it to dollar. The amount you own will always stay the same if you consider Bitcoin as only Bitcoin. Halving is coming, and the market is going up and down a bit for now. But it will go up for sure. Keep adding small amount of crypto every week or month. Buy at different price to keep a steady value. I am sure you will get a good profit out of it. And also don't sell out of greed early. Make a target how much profit you want from this and keep working for it.",

But that is the first lesson here, invest what you can afford to lose so that you don't have to worry about it.So if I'm in your shows, it's bitcoin's volatility and learn to embrace it. And what others have said, just be a long term holder and keep that bitcoin and don't ever think of selling it because obviously you will not make any profit. Just wait for the right time to sell.",

If you really want to invest long-term then the decision is to keep it in a cold wallet as long as possible. I've seen people say they're investing but their assets are still on the exchange. Remember do not store your assets there if not traded. Investing means that you save for a certain period of time, so after buying, don't look at the estimated balance too often. Buy, withdraw and store in a safe place, forget about market rates and continue to accumulate with the DCA method.",

Next, if you're not going to trade it on exchange because it seems based on that picture, you're keeping it on Binance.My tip to you is to use Electrum or any other reliable wallets (Samourai, Wasabi) if you're for the long term keeps. You don't have the private keys there if you're keeping your first ever bits in an exchange and that means, you don't own it yet.",

Don't give a shit of what's happening to the market, is a phase' when it's time surface your enjoys your coins.But lol dude you're funny with your bicycle exchange! How much is bicycle I guess is fairly used? You must have sold it in small amount or do add money from other source? I always advised people don't do something because people are doing, do something because you feels is secured and convenient for you.Like you mention losses $5, what if you lost all because someone is somewhere telling juices stories of investment, when you heard something learn first OK but I congrats your bold steps with bicycle exchange for bitcoin, you will enjoy your reward soon",
