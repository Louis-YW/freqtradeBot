      "body": "Quite ironic keeping in mind Elon himself said that he would not allow Jones to come back to Twitter because the way he denied the death of little children as a government false flag. I wonder what made him change of heart, assuming he is actually considering to let him come back. I don't understand why Musk would allow Jones to come back in Twitter, by the way, he knows he will face massive backlash if he does and Jones has already been found guilty of defamation, because of the way he made the life of those unfortunate parents a living hell, even after losing their children to a psychopath with a rifle. Whatever, let us see what he is up to and what he plans.",

      "body": "Musk is practical. If he makes a mistake, he changes it. Alex Jones, though he makes a mistake or two now and again, is practical. Even if his style is a bit radical, he is in favor of non-censorship, as is Musk. The two of them would make a good team, applying their love of freedom in different ways that match their individual personalities.The massive backlash that you talk about - that Musk would receive if he allowed Jones back on X - is only backlash from the media, the Elite, corrupt government leaders, and those they have brainwashed. Average people love Jones's info even if some of them don't like his style. You can see this in his following that he had before he was censored off the major media platforms.Getting Jones back on would show the Trump story correctly... how Trump is being persecuted rather than prosecuted. Jones would show it. Musk is practical.Disney's 'Democratic Political Operative' Bob Iger Fully Exposed After Musk Spat: Thackehttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/disneys-democratic-political-operative-paul-iger-fully-exposed-after-musk-spat-thackerThe issue came to a head after Musk vented during an interview when asked about Disney and other companies pulling advertising over alleged antisemitism on his platform.\"If someone is going to try and blackmail me with advertising? Blackmail me with money? Go fuck yourself,\" Elon Musk said. Musk repeated the advice with a wave of his hand toward Disney's Bob Iger, a Musk critic and Biden administration donor and functionary.\"Go. Fuck. Yourself. Is that clear? Hey, Bob, if you're in the audience.\"Within hours of the interview, dozens of parodies began appearing on X, including this one. But if you read about the exchange in any media outlet, you would think Musk was coming unhinged, attacking advertisers who support his own company.This is far from reality. Democratic operatives including Disney's Bob Iger have been harassing Musk since he took over Twitter and released company documents showing the government and Democratic Party aligned organizations were censoring Americans.

There is where the problems lies on. The trouble with your line of thought regarding Jones is, it was not Jones that damaged the parents. It was they, themselves. After all, they were the ones that induced their own feelings of pain by placing any stock in Jones's words. Since they DID place stock in his words, maybe Jones was right after all. They really need to go back to the psychiatrist for more self-control training.Your whole line of thought should be applied to most Covid government officials and doctors, rather than Jones, who is helping to show the truth about the evil in the medical and government... even if he made a mistake about the school shootings.",

I didn't either.Then Jones puts the wording of the evidence and proof right on the screen for everybody to see... including the location of the info in law and policy so that anybody can go look it up.It's true that Jones stretches some of the info to mean some things that the info doesn't necessarily mean. But the other side is that he doesn't always explain how bad and damning some of the info really is. And, like everybody, he makes a mistake or two once in a while.At least, Jones gets the info out there so that people can look at it for themselves if they have a mind to.I don't want to remain totally ignorant of what is going on. Do you? Jones shows a lot of what we would never see otherwise.",
