  "content": "Dear community,From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude to LFC_Bitcoin and nutildah for their kindness and understanding in removing and revising their negative feedback on my profile. Their act of compassion will always hold a special place in my heart.I have reached out to everyone else who left negative feedback and humbly requested that they reconsider their feedback. The Sceptical Chymist suggested that I open a thread and let the community decide, so here I am, standing before you with the hope of forgiveness.I take full responsibility for the mistakes I have made in the past, and I deeply regret any harm or loss that my actions may have caused. I have never directly scammed anyone or stolen anyone's money, but I have made poor choices and worked with scam projects as a bounty manager. However, I did not run away, but stayed here and continued using the forum.I do not want to boast, but I have also done some good things. I have helped many people, completed several successful trades, and bought items from forum users without issue. I understand that my past actions were wrong, and I have no excuses for them. But I promise to never repeat them in the future. If I work for any project in the future and if the work involves anyone else, such as bounty members, I will ensure the project escrows the payment, or I will not work with them.In conclusion, I humbly request for the forgiveness of the Bitcoin community and for a chance to be a normal forum user once again. I ask for your support in opposing the flag on my profileand for Lutpin, Mitchell, The Sceptical Chymist, marlboroza, and JollyGood to reconsider their feedback.Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Jamal",

The trust left by nutildah says that the OP got a third chance. Read again—not the second, but the third. In this case, it can be said that a person who repents should not repeat his mistakes in the future. In the case of the OP, the third time does not mean he blames himself somewhere. He will get a third chance and soon break it, as he will repent of the fourth.Read his post; according to him, he did nothing to anyone intentionally. He did everything by accident.But I recall nutildah starting the thread. Read its original title.the aTriz/jamalaezaz farmUnfortunately, marlboroza has left the forum, but his tags will remain with the OP for a long time.Quoteaccounts connected: jamalaezaz, Digital_Lord, lady Royal, noah tall, Btcschool, involved in account trading (accounts OrangeSeller, Ardenyham, extrabyte)I would caution all hunters not to participate in campaigns run by this \"manager.\"",

You can see campaign managers and bounty managers with negative tags on their accounts who are still handling campaigns. I think you understand what I mean.By the way, you also said in the feedback you posted that you worked for a casino that was tagged a scam on the forums, although that probably has nothing to do with their case, and whatever job they gave you.

Be picky this time, give them whatever offer you have for them so that they give you projects. It will be hard but nothing is impossible. If these users give you another chance then don't misuse it again.",

Certainly, everyone deserves a second or even a third chance, so why not. but as far as I can see, the negative feedback on your profile is not related to just one mistake, but to several. also, many of them can be interpreted as an unprofessional way of running a campaign, which even as a neutral reference is not the best recommendation for your future business.also, some active members can withdraw their negative feedback, but several users have left this forum forever and such tags will surely remain. Lauda, Zepher, marlboroza, Lutpin...probably this post of your apology and self-reproach will not be enough, you will have to prove yourself with your actions.
