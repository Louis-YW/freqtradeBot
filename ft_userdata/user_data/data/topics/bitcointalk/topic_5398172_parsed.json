I have gone through some firmware upgrades for some hardware wallets (Ledger) and I have to say for someone with good technical knowledge, it was not a good experience.   If we are talking about Ledger, it was worse in the past, now it's easy-peasy. Everything is complete without the user having to disconnect the wallet from the USB cable. In the past, you had to press and hold the buttons, then let go of one button while you connect/disconnect.

I would say they already are. It's just like an installation of any other software. A few clicks on the 'Yes' and 'Next' buttons and you are done.

(Export seed to Electrum?) You can buy any other hardware wallet and recover your accounts from seed. If they use the same derivation paths for your coins, even better. If not, you might have to recover the seed in a software wallet to modify the derivation paths. You should of course secure your Bitcoin before you go meddling with software wallets for altcoins.",

Providing software upgrades that keep the device secure and state-of-the art is essential to make sure your funds are secure against the latest attacks and exploits.However, there remains the risk of malicious firmware update binaries and closed-source or non-reproducible builds. This allows the manufacturer or a middleman to give you a malicious (e.g. deanonymizing) firmware without you noticing; if however you have open source and a verifiable build, that provably comes from the supplied codebase, it reduces such risk.Regarding usability for newbies, as was mentioned before, hardware wallets as a whole have come a long way. You also get clear and concise instructions from the manufacturer on how to verify the hash and signature of the image file. Reboots and complicated keypress combinations aren't needed on the last few devices I've come across. Passport, for instance, just requires you to put the file on a supplied microSD card and plug it into the device.",

Good choice of words. I am glad you used that construction because that's exactly the way it is. Someone else might have said that if you use open-source software with verifiable builds, there is no risk or you are absolutely safe due to the publicly available code. The more popular the wallet is, the more user it has, and the more security experts verify every single piece of code, the lower is the possibility that the developers would get away with trying to introduce a backdoor or other type of vulnerability. Or if they just overlooked something by mistake which could have negative consequences. On the other hand, if the wallet is unpopular, it might take weeks or even months before someone discovered that something is off with the most recent update.",

In the case of a closed source code, you will have to trust hardware wallet developers, and if the source code is open, then you need to trust independent developers and enthusiasts who check the code and changes. In both cases, ordinary users are forced to believe completely strangers. I think it looks like a religion. There, too, \"users\" can't check anything themselves and they can only \"believe\" in one or another confession.Another important fact. People who buy HWs want to make a minimum of gestures: they bought a device, threw crypto into it, and use this device as needed. Will most of them follow the news and technical blogs where independent developers will post their research into the open source of HW? Even if a vulnerability is found in the code, such users will be the last to know about it after a long time, if at all they become aware of what happened. Until the balance on their device is reset. Therefore, I assume that from the position of an ordinary user, it doesn't matter to him which code is open or closed.They are more interested in HW appearance and the impact of advertising.",

You can also just trash the old device and import your backed-up seed into a new wallet. I recently thought about this and maybe it helps people think of hardware wallets a bit differently: think of the device mostly as a signer. Don't rely on it not breaking, not getting lost or not ceasing to turn on, to be able to access your coins; instead, rely on your seed backup(s) and use the device as a convenient way to utilize said seed in everyday scenarios.",

Or think about laptop / phone storage upgrades; people pay hundreds for those even though they could get away with putting in some time and deleting loads of old data and media they don't need anymore.Personally, I think even $200 is worth it for a device that can help you securely store and use money amounts larger than its cost by multiple orders of magnitude.

I don't know who came up with this distinction (or if it's just my own definition) but just wanted to bring this up, because HW wallets don't just sign. This would be the argument against calling them signers. But they shouldn't be the main means of seed storage either; it's just a feature that makes them more convenient to use (instead of typing in 24 words every time you power them up).",

If it comes to choices for newcomers, I tend to recommend something that works with their preferred hardware. Elderly people often just use a PC or laptop, so something like Trezor is perfect. Younger folks that tend to sometimes not even own a computer, obviously need something that can be interfaced with from the phone they have. So it can be USB (OTG) on Androids, QR codes on any phone with a camera or NFC for the latest devices that have NFC. I was about not to mention NFC though, since similarly to Bluetooth, it's not an interface I'd recommend using due to its hardware-based attack vectors.",
