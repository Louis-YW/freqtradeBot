  "content": "Hi, I need to pay for a product in Russia (all legal, just hard to get here in West) but the seller only accepts payments via card or Russian payment providers like robokassa/yandexpay/qiwi (which reject all western cards). Tried to find a way around but it seems all normal services have banned transfers to Russia. Are there any companies or services that offer middleman services for this kind of stuff? Would greatly appreciate some info. Thanks in advance.",

Tried to find a way around but it seems all normal services have banned transfers to Russia. Most Russian banks are no longer part of SEPA hence the payment cannot get thru.But I am not sure why you don't pay with bitcoin.Or, another thing that comes into my mind would be bestchange, which is an aggregator of various exchanges that buy/sell bitcoin, most of those being Russian (I think) and will probably offer also qiwi, yandex and so on.LE: A quick check there has shown that even PayPal USD to Qiwi RUR is possible. However, I don't vouch for those platform, be careful and don't work with big amounts until you're sure they're indeed reliable.",
