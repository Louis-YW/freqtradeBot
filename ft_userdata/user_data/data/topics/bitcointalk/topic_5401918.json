  "content": "I have come to realize that mostly on daily basis, petty traders; hawker stall, street vendors, street hawkers, market men and women, kiosks do transactions often and frequently and they are not amongst the top class citizens in the society. Some are uneducated and are not anywhere near technology to get acquainted with blockchain and Bitcoin. I believe if they are informed and have knowledge about Bitcoin properly they will want to key into it so as to save themselves of unnecessary stress and expenses from banks and other groups. What's your opinion in educating these petty traders and letting them know more about Bitcoin because  I believe this is amongst the grassroot adoption which starts from the base as they do transact more often than some of the big companies we hear of. Although the petty traders do little amount but it is most often on daily basis. What steps would you take in drawing the attention of the traders to Bitcoin?",

Daily transaction is super important to these people.",

Why would these folks want to declare to the relevant tax authorities what they are selling. The huge benefits for using bitcoin is that all transactions are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain - but for traders wishing to avoid tax , this would be a major disadvantage!",

      "body": "Doing tons of daily transactions when selling products in a kiosk or at a market isn't really trading. The price stay more or less stable, and the goal is to sell the products you have and get money for them in return. The purchases from places like this also tend to be small and fast, so I'm not sure Bitcoin is good for that. I think it's more productive to convince businesses that sell something pricey and probably online to accept Bitcoin. Transactions on a market happen very fast and are small.",

They have to get someone to help them go to bank to get their money too with all the stress in it. But nevertheless they’re some people who still are educated and still find themselves in the streets selling to get their daily needs because of lack of job opportunities. The best thing to do is to organize seminars for them at their convenience and let them know the important of having to learn bitcoin as it will help grow their business and reduce stress from transacting using banks. It will be easier if more of them are educated and are acquainted to the internet.",

We can't urge these people to adopt Bitcoin, perhaps it was not ideal to do so. Let things may come momentarily that the use of Bitcoin become officially considered legal tender as for sure that time everyone will think about adopting to new technology.  As to the extent of hearing some noise about banning and scam issues about Bitcoin, many were thinking negatively instead of giving support for this.",

I think at first is teaching them on how it works and maybe if they are willing, you tell them they could accept Bitcoin as means of payment for their commodity which would ease them the time and stress of running around to and fro the bank if the need be.",

Today, small fluctuations in bitcoin can become a big problem even for small merchants who profit from the shopping carts they care about.but sooner or later they will adapt to technological advances, depending on the future progress of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and actually there are already small shops that do that but it depends where you live because what they are afraid of is the government.",

Why not just accept the fact that many people are content with their current way of conducting business and bitcoin just brings them extra hassle. Technology will catch up with these traders and bitcoin is probably already integrated with many mobile phone based solutions, but you also ignore their customer base who likely have no interest in paying in such a volatile currency. Maybe you could educate yourself to have more respect for others.",
