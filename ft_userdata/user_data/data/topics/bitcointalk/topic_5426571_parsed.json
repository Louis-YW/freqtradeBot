  "content": "QuoteAcross Canada, journal calculates up to $136.8 M in savingsNew research suggests medically assisted dying could result in substantial savings across Canada's health-care system.Doctor-assisted death could reduce annual health-care spending across the country by between $34.7 million and $136.8 million, according to a report published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal on Monday.The savings exceedingly outweigh the estimated $1.5 to $14.8 million in direct costs associated with implementing medically assisted dying.\"The take-away point is that there may be some upfront costs associated with offering medical assisted dying to Canadians, but there may also be a reduction in spending elsewhere in the system and therefore offering medical assistance in dying to Canadians will not cost the health care system anything extra,\" said Aaron Trachtenberg, an author of the report and a resident in internal medicine at the University of Calgary.Cost has to be a part of the discussionThe researchers used numbers from the Netherlands and Belgium, where medically assisted death is legal, combined with Canadian spending data from Ontario. Trachtenberg stressed that means the work is theoretical and needs to be readdressed when Canada starts collecting large scale data at home.After June 17, 2016 when Bill C-14 became law, provinces began rolling out their plans to deal with requests for doctor-assisted death.Manitoba has set up a Medical Assistance in Dying team (MAID). More than 100 patients have contacted MAID, with 24 receiving medically assisted deaths as of Jan. 6.\"In a resource-limited health care system, anytime we roll out a large intervention there has to be a certain amount of planning and preparation and cost has to be a part of that discussion,\" Trachtenberg said, adding the provinces' differing plans could impact the cost structure of implementation.\"It's just the reality of working in a system of finite resources.\"The report estimated that about one to four per cent of Canadians will die using physician-assisted death. Of those, 50 per cent will be between the ages of 60 and 80.The report estimates a 50-50 split between men and women. About 80 per cent of patients will have cancer and 60 per cent will have their lives shortened by one month while 40 per cent will have their lives shortened by one week.End-of-life care has high costs in CanadaHealth-care costs increase substantially among patients nearing the end of their life, Trachtenberg said.\"Canadians die in hospitals more often than, say, our counterparts in America or Europe and â€¦ we have a lack of palliative care services even though we are trying to improve that. And therefore people end up spending their final days in the hospital,\" he said.\"Hospital-based care costs the health care system more than a comprehensive palliative care system where we could help people achieve their goal of dying at home.\"The report used Manitoba as an example, where 20 per cent of health care costs are attributable to patients within the six months before they die, despite their representing only one per cent of the population. Patients who choose medical assistance in dying may forego this resource-intensive period, the report said.\"Whenever we roll out a large-scale intervention there has to be a discussion around costs. But we do not suggest that costs should ever be considered at an individual level,\" Trachtenberg said.\"We are not suggesting that patients or providers consider costs when making this very personal and intimate decision to request or provide medical assistance in dying.\"The report also emphasized that it is only a cost analysis and doesn't include the clinical effects on patients. Patient-level research will need to be done before true economic evaluation of medical assistance in dying in terms of cost-effectiveness and utility can be done, the report said.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/medically-assisted-death-could-save-millions-1.3947481....Suicide rates trend upwards during times of economic crisis. Alcohol, substance abuse, guns, pills, chemicals, leaps off tall bridges and buildings are typical options in societies where euthanasia is illegal. Could it be better for the process to be painless and institutionalized, in contrast to alternatives? The discussion on euthanasia reminds me of abortion. People will do it whether its legal or illegal, in which case might it be better to offer better safer and friendlier alternatives. Years ago, someone I know tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide by taking pills. Luckily they received medical attention quickly and had their stomach pumped. Visiting them in the hospital, the doctor said a teenage girl died by taking pills only a few days earlier. They claimed that it was a very painful process as the organs shut down one by one, and a terrible way to die. While euthanasia might not be a perfect solution, perhaps it might be more humane than some of the alternatives.",

State plays no role in voluntary execution of its population.It starts with medical assisted deaths for people with chronic conditions, and slowly that window begins to expand far beyond what its original intent was. In Canada, you can apply for medically assisted suicide only exhibiting symptoms of depression. So no physical pain, but the state will gladly help execute you should you be so inclined.Also, Canada has \"free\" healthcare. State is incentivized to save costs through medically assisted suicide.",

We are slowly losing humanity, the government cares more about money than saving lives. Even if it's a terminally-ill patient, I would rather try my best for that patient to have his last breath than to take it with my own hands.

Abortion is done without the consent of the child hence is considered murder. By the way, the consent is taken away from those who deserve to die due to crime they committed. They are killed whether the consent is given or not. Euthanasia is a delicate matter that should be treated with care. I do not think it's moral to do that for economic reasons. Life must be preserved by all means. Do not attempt to put pressure on people (who probably have chance of surviving) due to economic reasons",

Do not attempt to put pressure on people (who probably have chance of surviving) due to economic reasons I was reading all the posts above posted to see if what I feel like asking is there and this side of your post corroborate what enquiry I have. At what point should euthanasia be permissible? This is the issue for me because I might not really be against it totally because there some health challenges that the pains are really excruciating and whose natural result is still death. So how do we reach to this level where it will be the most reasonable thing to do. It is difficult to take someone else life but some are not just bearable to see the person living.",

The only difference is that euthanasia is legal suicide. I have seen sick people in very pitiable and hopeless condition that I even wish they die the next second because of the suffering and pains they are forced to endure. But even in such situation I believe nobody has the right to kill himself because there can still be a miracle.But promoting euthanasia because it saves cost is going to the extreme for me. With little hope on the part of the patients and more efforts by medical practitioners some of these people that might want to apply for euthanasia might recover. We shouldn't legalize suicide because it would save us some cost because life is priceless. It is also important to note that euthanasia might not reduce suicide. In euthanasia the patent or sick person must prove that he/she is terminally ill and/or is in great distress and pain. And the doctors must equally prove that the patent has no or insignificant chances of surviving. Most people that commits suicide are young and healthy people that would have been alive today if they received the needed guidance or assistance. We shouldn't give people the permission to kill themselves.",
