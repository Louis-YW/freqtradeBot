And from that, I learned that sending round amount decrease the privacy of a tx, at least make it almost confirmed and identifiable that round amount is the amount which has been sent to (recipient) and the rest is change address. It makes sense. We are always doing this. We sent round amount most of the times and the rest goes to the change address. Anyone can identify which one is receiver address and which one is change address. If you are concerned about your privacy, this is one of the simple strategy to follow. If you don't send round amount and instead add small amount to the fund you would like to send, it will not be that easy to identify the recipient and change address.",

Which, with a little bit of tinkering and a good wallet, can be used to your advantage to obfuscate the change output. If sending to a legacy output as in your example, you can also manually send the change to a legacy output to help hide which is which. Even better if you are sending from segwit to segwit and you still send the change to a legacy (or P2SH) output, as most analyses will then say your change is the payment and the payment is the change.Quote from: crwth on August 25, 2022, 07:04:47 AMIs it going to be a concern if you have managed to do that but there's no record of you doing it in any website?There's a record on every bitcoin node on the planet, and anyone can see it using any of the many blockchain explorers in existence.Quote from: crwth on August 25, 2022, 07:04:47 AMHow would one know?

      "body": "Thanks tranthidung, it was thus helpful, haven't gone through the thread (What is the \"Change\" address on bitcoin wallet ? read to know !) you provided and am of course on course. Thanks to this response:Quote from: Henri Cartier on October 08, 2019, 03:49:10 AMIn this transaction, the total payment made was 10 BTC and the total balance was 10.89 BTC. So the Bitcoin wallet cannot just take out 10 BTC out of 10.89 BTC thus the whole 10.89 BTC is spent in two transactions.But a thing to note here is:One transaction of 10 BTC goes to one address (recipient), and another 0.89 BTC goes to another address which the spender of 10.89 BTC controls and this is the change address. And your wallet will have the private keys of the change address so that you can again spend the 0.89 BTC change that you have received.So effectively now the 10.89 BTC is spent in its entirety and destroyed hence preventing double usage or double spending of the same bitcoins.SourceFrom the above thread which offered more clarification to the topic of discussion and i find it relevant for other newbies that might be following up this thread.Although, a few more of my questions remains unanswered and would be checking as well to what response I would get.

Any help?I think The Cryptovator has answered your first question in the topic shared by tranthidung well.Assume that you have a 100 dollar bill and you want buy something which is worth 50 dollars. You give your 100 dollar bill to the seller and get a 50 dollar bill. Bitcoin works in the same way. If you have an UTXO worth 0.1 BTC and want to pay someone 0.05 BTC, you make a transaction with your 0.1 BTC. Your transaction will have two outputs. The one will go to the recipient and the remaning amount which is called change is sent back to you. Now let's go to your second question. Assume that you want to have 0.1 BTC and wants to pay someone 0.6 BTC. Your transaction will have two outputs. One of them will be 0.6 BTC which goes to the recipient and the change will be 0.4 BTC minus transaction fee.If the change address is same as the sending address, everyone can know which of outputs is the change and which one is owned by the recipient.  In this way, you may hurt your privacy. With using a different address as your change address and choosing the outputs amounts in the way no one can know which of them is the change, you can improve your privacy",

If you are consolidating multiple outputs in to one, then yes, this is bad for your privacy. But if you are sending the entirety of a single output from one address to another, this can be very good for your privacy since you avoid creating any change at all.
