  "content": "Hello! Faced the following nuance of using this pool.If you mine, for example, EThash + ZIL, then you must send shares to the main coin, and not just to ZIL.I only mined ZIL since it is not prohibited by the pool rules https://k1pool.com/termsMy balance is just over 200 ZIL blocked for payouts.After contacting technical support, they answered rudely, see the attached screenshotMe [11/07/2022 8:07 AM]@altpool Hello! I remove power from the pool.At the moment, unfortunately, the profitability of the existing main coins of the pool + Zil is significantly less than the outlet.Balance Zil (Pending Balance) = 204.26588 Zil , set payout threshold 200 Zil. The payment does not come.Payouts are \"Banned\" for violating pool rules. As it turned out, payouts are blocked if the rigs mine Zil, but do not send shares to the main coin.But these rules are not described anywhere.I ask you to unblock the payment, or indicate which particular paragraph of the rules https://k1pool.com/terms I violated, and on the basis of which paragraph the payment was blocked.Pool Admin, [11/07/2022 9:54 AM][Reply to me]go where you left, your balance will be transferred to other miners.",
