After all, people are not supposed to hold their crypto for longer period of time anyway.",

Bitcoin (> 0.01BTC) and most altcoins' withdrawals are officially for free. ETH, tokens are not free.Even more, of qualifying for free withdrawals, one has to actually trade, it seems:Quote from: https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034865571-Blockchain-Deposits-and-WithdrawalsNote: For free withdrawals, however, in the case of a user whose fiat/stablecoin deposit/withdrawal volume exceeds their trading volume, we reserve the right to charge a withdrawal fee of up to 0.10%.  We will reach out to any users affected before applying this.  So I don't know where the 100$ fee comes from and if it's for real (there are plenty of users complaining on the internet about this or that without understanding what they're doing and how this or that service is charging money from them, so without proof I tend to ignore most of those).However, I see FTX policy somehow related to Binance's no trading fees for this or that pair (and also an attempt to increase FTX user base) and I think that it is only a temporary policy.",

      "body": "Cryptocurrency companies should diversify their treasuries into other currencies especially strong stable coins or fiat currencies. It is terrible if they self-believe too much about their own cryptocurrencies or tokens and put their treasuries at risk if their tokens have terrible collapse in value.I don't follow this case too much but FTT is different than LUNA and UST. The token is not a stable coin and does not function like the pair of LUNA and UST in May collapse. If FTT token loses its value a lot, what will happen? No automatically technical algorithm to mint more tokens and put the FTT token down in price on market like LUNA or UST.The risk is whether FTX used their FTT for loan and whether they are facing with forced liquidations. With what I knew about Sam and FTX, they don't have that risk.",

But, it's different, this isn't the exchange that's going to dump it, not the developers but it is Binance that has said they'll be the ones to dump it. The FTX team is willing to mend and buy back those that will be sold in the market so I think, there's the sign of their willingness to cooperate with CZ. But, all of it lies with just some negotiations and talks with FTX and Binance.",

After all, people are not supposed to hold their crypto for longer period of time anyway.If you make a withdrawal in USDC there will be congestion and may not be able to withdraw during this time, it is because FTX's USDC reserve has been exhausted but if you withdraw USDT everything is still normal. It is known that Alameda is receiving a lot of USDC from Circle and then pushing it to the exchange for people to withdraw.Yes, I also think that to be safe, to avoid unexpected incidents like Luna, everyone should withdraw all assets. Anything can happen, it's best for us to stay out and do nothing not even catch a falling knife FTT.",
