  "content": "I know most people downplay the Mt Gox payout and most will say it will have no bearing on the price. This is why I am curious if anyone actually thinks this is keeping the bitcoin price down.When Mt Gox payout goes into effect, they will sell a lot of bitcoin to get the cash needed for the claimants who wanted fiat instead of bitcoin. This will be a huge amount of coins hitting the market. Then you have all the bitcoin being sent to everyone, will they cash in those bitcoins for cash? This adds huge risk into the price, nobody really knows what this is going to do and you can only speculate. Will Mt Gox sell all of these bitcoins in a day and crash the market? Who knows what could happen. This causes a a lot of uncertainty, why invest in bitcoin when  there could be a huge amount of coins hitting the market. Better to just wait for the payouts to happen after March 10th and see how it goes.I'm looking for anyone who agrees with me that this is probably causing the bitcoin price to be held back at the moment until this gets worked out. To me it seems mostly everyone says its a non-issue.",

Gox in this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441733.0.I think it's only natural that most people have ignored about bitcoin Mt.Gox so far, it's because of there were many delays and failures they've had over the years. I'm not even sure when it will actually be distributed, but of course the market is sure to turn into dump if creditors manage to get their hands on the bitcoin. But don't worry, this is an issue that may only be FUD for some time so you can invest at a lower price.",

In the past few years, every few months there was a news about Mt Gox bitcoins about to flood the market soonTM. Indeed, that made me wary.. first 2 times. Now I see it as a non issue. If will ever get released and if too many people will be dumb enough to dump their coins at this rather low price (since we're just after the crypto winter), so be it. But I think that it's rather unlikely. Hence I'm one from the \"non-issue\" group.",

Gox, the news on that failure is years old so its not new and not systemic so its not that relevant especially.",

Whatever decision they will make, I think there will be no problem whatsoever. If it means the price of Bitcoin will fall all the way to $20,000, $17,000, or even $15,000 and below, I don't personally have a problem. This is Bitcoin. This isn't some centralized and manipulated market. This is a free market. I'm 100% sure that Bitcoin will recover from this and demand will once again dominate the market. The big Mt. Gox supply that will hit the exchanges will be temporary.",

The silvergate bank is mostly why Bitcoin dropped and on the macro side it’s the huge inflation we still have. Most likely there will be more fed increases and it’s always bad for stocks and crypto.Until the coins actually move we won’t know what affect it will have on the price.

The compensation will not be in full at once for all those affected, but will be in installments in the long term, so there will be no dumping of the market.Also, those affected who will receive compensation will most likely not sell their bitcoins that they got at this low price now, of course it is possible that some of them will sell directly, but most likely they will wait for the market to rise.In any case, this is just speculation, and no one knows for sure what might happen until the actual distribution takes place.",

There is no scenario where something as small as this payout could ever keep bitcoin down, there will be a lot of people who think like that, and they will suspect this to be bigger than what it is today, but the reality is that bitcoin is much larger and it can't be kept down by something so insignificant.I believe that people are just not that much into it at this moment and they can't see it growing just yet and that is why they are not buying right now and that is the main reason why it is not growing at this moment.",
