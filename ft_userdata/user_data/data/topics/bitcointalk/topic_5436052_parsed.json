  "content": "I have fallen in love with Atomic Wallet,especially their exchange function built in which can convert almost all known crypto to each other with low fees.I have also seen that they have staking as an option for many coins but I am interested in Zilliqa since I continuously add this to the wallet because I am mining it.So I decided to stake almost all my Zilliqa and after a couple of days I wanted to get the reward,to claim the reward of 2.3 Zilliqa and saw that the validator Atomic Wallet wanted a 130 Zil by default or as a minimum a 60 Zil fee,that is crazy I think.Should I wait for a lot of time meanwhile I will be adding about 500-1000 Zil per month there and hopefully once the rewards become bigger there would be no problem of claiming the rewards.Or it will be always?",

No surprise its not worth to take out nad fees overtakes rewards. According to atomicwallet ZIL staking tutorial you only lose 10 ZIL by unstaking.\"FIrst of all, you can’t unstake ZIL immediately after you staked it. From the moment you delegate your funds to a validator they are getting locked for 8,000 blocks (approx. 1 day). After that you can unstake ZIL leaving 10 ZIL (unspendable balance) to a validator by doing this:\"https://atomicwallet.io/zilliqa-staking130 Zil = 3.2$ - its definetly a high fee for stake/unstake on a cheap and low traffic coins (like zil). It should be lower. At least I dont believe that network fees on network that no one is using (its not BNB. ETH, BTC) is that high.500 ZIL per month = 12$ Maybe its better to invest in books and education to improve skills to be able to save more than 12$ per month and than start to play with investment tools?",

      "body": "I have mixed feelings about this. All this staking is in hope that the coin does not continue tanking or at least in the next bull run it achieves a new all-time high is which is barely likely for such once very promising coins otherwise that 15% yearly yield you are looking at now won't make sense if you value your returns vs USD after a year and the coin price has dropped further.Let say bare minimum was 20,000 ZIL, that's yearly profit of 3000 ZIL. At the current price, not quite appetizing personally, but if the price of ZIL goes up, then that would be good. So it's your call to make.",

      "body": "I myself used to stake quite a lot of Zil tokens because it had a pretty good price and opportunity at that time and when the price went up I was still guided by my principle that Zil can give me a big profit because there is the support from the bear market condition makes me have such high confidence.But all of that was just a fantasy of my mind because after the market experienced a decline, Zil actually joined in following market conditions which made my belief and greed a big loss hole.From there I learned that staking without further research and prioritizing faith and greed will only make us lose a lot of money.",

Zil is still part of the top 100 and with that enthusiasm that you're saying then it's good that you're doing it with a nice approach and plan.I don't want to say something negative that's basically going to give you a bad mood but it's not bad at all, it's like the typical recommendation that we used to say and here about investing you can afford to lose.",
