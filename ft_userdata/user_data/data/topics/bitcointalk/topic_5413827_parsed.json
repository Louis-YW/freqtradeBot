In my opinion, I believe it should be the other way around and have the rapist’s family pay the restitution to the victim if anything.   I do not agree that the family of the rapist should pay compensation. Of course, there are different cases, but let's assume that these people themselves didn't know who their relative was. How can they be responsible for it? He is an adult person he made his own decisions and the blame for what he did is fully on him. It is very dangerous to spread the blame of one person on many like this, it removes responsibility from the true culprit.",
