It was too rare of a sheer luck to be able to flip that $50 into thousands of bucks in just a month. I don't think I can get my hopes up from  that right now considering the situation in the market. To be honest, it doesn't happen on just new projects, it may happen on already established projects that even existed years ago.",

It is very risky because you don't know when it will pump up, the most profitable there is the organizer and those who did not know will most likely fall into the trap. Shiba Inu was supported by a large community to pump up but in fact, this meme coin does not have utility in the community. You are probably looking a pump and dump groups that are the same that happened to Shiba Inu. To tell you frankly, that is not a good way of making a profit.",

The project like SHIBA has a huge hype before and luck to those who are able to get it at a cheaper price and right now, it’s hard to see another project like this. If you are looking for a pump and dump group, i can say that it’s not good at all. Making your $50 into a $150k profit in just a month is quiet not possible, don’t live for such hype and see the market on a more realistic price. We are still on a bear market, better to take this opportunity to accumulate good coins and expect nothing.",

Because that risk percentage of gain is beyond imagination. The only time I saw someone turned 50$ into 5000$ in less down a week was during the Luna crash and it gain through Binance future trade. Which was luck and risk he decided to take. When even I see analysis which are promising more than 100% in a month I found it too good to be true. Such huge profit only happens by luck, and it's ones in a while.",

To be honest, with that amount of capital you have.I'm not expecting it to be even doubled if it's going to come from someone asking the same question on how to make that much. Because, the reality will sink in that you're not one of those lucky folks that have made that gain.And at the same time, a little capital will lead you to little gains if you're for the reality and not with just some lucky investments.",

These are just lotteries that occur when you are having a very good time. I have seen people turning 150K$ to 50$ as well, so don't go by what a few can do. Trading Strategies can just give you fancy 30-40% gains per month at most. Another way out is to gather insider information if you can somehow become a member of some pump & dump club. Apart from this, there is nothing you can do to find these coins, even studying the projects won't help because these sorts of multi-baggers are rare to find. To b honest its not that hard to turn 1k$ into 100 or 150K $ u need to be at the rght place in teh right time or have the right experience n connections",

This is one of the story that many are able to make their money 100x time in profit but then again there's no assurance for this, that project can dump right away and turn into a scam project which means you are risking money for the things that there's no assurance. If you want easy money here, you might be on a wrong market. Well, analyze properly and look for those small tokens, if you think they will pump someday then you can buy, that's your choice and the risk for that is very high.",

There is no exact strategy to earn that high profit. Although an experienced trader, no guarantee that he can gain $100 by trading $50 in a month. But I guess, to earn $100 in a month, should often trade or trade on a daily basis. Anyway, trading a meme coin like Shiba Inu seems not effective anymore because the hype is over already. Instead of gaining $100, you may get a loss since no high demand to buy this meme coin lately.",

If you wanted to immediately reach $150k, then finding some shtcoins that would pump shortly would be the short answer but you need a really big amount of luck (and research) to even do that. Shorting for a day or two on some specific coins might actually be safer than investing on a shtcoin that who knows when it'll drop to oblivion.",

There are hundreds of new tokens created each and every week and probably less than 1 out of 100 will become big. So the chances of losing your investment completely are way higher obviously than making a x100 or even more out of your initial investment. So don't expect to get rich in the crypto space.
