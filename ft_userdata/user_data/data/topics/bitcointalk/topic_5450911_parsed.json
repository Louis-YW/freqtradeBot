Maybe the problem is only with your desktop and not with this forum.    So I hope you are not the only one who noticed it, most of the members here must agree with what you are saying, but as far as I can see, no such scenario has happened. Also, if the same happens, there is probably no problem as long as the thread sections that we enter to participate in the discussion of the topic are still here.",

If there was a changed in the forum we would have seen it on the news feed bar. I am suspecting that OP phone was the one confused or deceived him. Probably the phone background colour was covering the screen or the brightness not the phone screen was high and the op thought it was the forum background colour. Op the shinny colour you observed on that day was not general but from your side or device which control it screen colour by itself. And that is how mine is also doing. I believed you adjust your screen brightness to the weather conditions at the time of the weather. Many people set their systems in that way so that it will not affect their eyes. Like if the weather is dimmed, the screen would brighten itself to suit the weather and this happened at time base on the weather condition at the moment. So don't be surprised. It is normal.",
