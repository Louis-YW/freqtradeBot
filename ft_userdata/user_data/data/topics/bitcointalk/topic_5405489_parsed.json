  "content": "Duke Energy, a top US energy company, is reportedly looking to explore Bitcoin mining as part of its plans to integrate its demand response strategy.In a tweet by Duke Energy’s lead rates and regulatory strategy analyst Justin Orkney on June 4, he shared notes on electrification of transportation and decarbonization of the electric power grid through Bitcoin mining.In an earlier statement by Justin Orkey, he confirmed that Duke Energy is currently studying Bitcoin mining, in fact, his crew is exploring how Bitcoin could solve the problems faced by the grid as renewable penetration increases. Grid imbalance and other problems will only worsen as we approach renewable targets.Results of the study will show how to onboard miners on the grid before scaling up for the masses. The company leverages its micro-grid with different energy sources to conduct tests to measure the impact involving several levels of miners.“We are exploring general customer phasing concepts … I’m working on a Bitcoin demand response study about including Bitcoin mining capacity in our system with an eye toward the demand response functionality … We are hoping to do a technology test.”Continue Reading: https://mycryptoparadise.com/since-the-inception-of-the-current-market-downturn-the-crypto-community-has-been-witnessing-chaos-that/",

      "body": "just to as some detailsalot of power companies dont usually just 'build' power stations to supply todays capacity. they build to have capacity to cope with the demand of the next 10-25 years(for renewables, where as nuclear was 20-40, coal was 30-50). meaning for the first few years they have 10-25X of costs but only 1x of demandso they are happy to see more demand at the start to get more income from the start before the usual more timely growth of houses and industry growth that take the natural demand up over the decades...as for micro power stations that only power small towns and regions. these are not big enough to build out for long term because they know even in 20 years the 'growth' is still small. and so again having a large demand upfront can help cover costs to really expand and be future proof.",

It is a big opportunity for energy companies supplying energy for Bitcoin miners to earn more based on huge demand from miners. Bitcoin mining requires constant supply of electrical energy power mining machines and hardwares. There had been many energy companies that are into Bitcoin mining and I think Duke Energy will not be the first to venture into it looking at the vast demand of energy by miners.",

I support mining to be over tbf, the staking world has been around for a while and it is proven to be working. Yes, it hasn't worked as much as bitcoin transactions for sure, but it could get there if we work on it.

Not only it shows interest in Bitcoin mining, but it's also related to renewable energy, which is important to break the stereotype that Bitcoin mining is not environmentally friendly.Yeah right...QuoteAlmost all of Duke Energy's Midwest generation comes from coal, natural gas, or oil, while half of its Carolinas generation comes from its nuclear power plants. They don't have even 10% production from renewables, again, production, they have the capacity but since solar works only 1/3 of the day, the production is way below the same capacity as good old coal.Quote from: leea-1334 on July 07, 2022, 12:01:33 PMIt feels weird to me that they are exploring about customers and looking at demand,,, when a company these days wants to go into mining, there are no customers right? There are just investors.They are looking for the golden goose..What they're trying to find is miners who would consume just the excess energy and balance the grid, basically minimizing losses, but good luck finding somebody who would mine only when you have excess energy and shut down when you need to make power cuts.Already miners are looking at ROI times of over a year when it comes to new gear even with power at 2kwh, who would take part in this plan when you could make back the investment in 5 years, or more precise, about two years after the gear starts breaking down  What these power companies need to do is stop this patching of a broken concept and start realizing that nuclear power, cheap and constant is the only solution, not expensive batteries, not renewables that have a bit of producing zero energy for days, not anything else.",

(yep even if it needs 20x less fuel rods, the shielding needs to be the same thickness and the monitoring stations and maintenance guys need to still have he same costs. so costs do not divide down well if u divide the capacity)meaning only a capacity of 100k but a build cost equivelent to what should facilitate 1m homesand again in the first years only 50k are paying towards costs so costs are still 20xhoweverwithout waiting for generations of families to then need more homes to grow the housing demand upto 100k, 1m, 2m over many decades.. they can easily build the 2m power plant. and then ask asic farmers to set up nearby. where they will have a bunch of asic farms comprising of a total of say 500k asics which is the equivelent to 1m homes usage. taking up 50% of the capacity FROM YEAR ONE and there by give the equivelent of 1m homes electric bill money to the power plant from day one even while there are only actually 50k homesmeaning the power company is getting 1.05m house hold equiv' income so that the cost per bill is only 2x instead of 20xand by introducing industry(asic farming) into the area, also ramps up the need for housing, shops, other business to thrive in the area, to accelerate the normal growth of housing/other business to then take up the capacity to reach their 2m sooner. and get their cost to 1x per bill payer in years instead of decades..it would only be then, after years whereby the natural growth demand accelerates they would then say to asic farmers they wont renew their power contracts as they need that 1m capacity back for the normal population.but by this point another region is building out. and it becomes like 'corporate tourism' where mining farm businesses move to different regions every 3-5 years. (much like amazon ware houses), finding the next cheap rate location that accepts them and offers them tax free status or R&D grants or whatever state incentives that state representatives give..now you understand the concept from your favoured power production methodapply it to the other renewable methods that prebuild, not just for todays demand but for future potential capacity above todays demand..i know you think that if a ASIC needs 3kw/h = 72KWH a day. that a idiot is just going to put up 3kw panels or enough just for 72KW a day.. where you always cry about the 1/3rd a day means it only actually produces 24KWH a day from a 72kw set of panels.. reality is.. outside of your cries.. if they are planning an asic farm they wont just put up 72KW of solar panels. nor the 216kwh panels (to counter your 1/3rd cries). they would put up 450KW+ of panels to give them a head start for future proofing for a few years and having enough excess that even at a 1/3rd day sunlight, the 450KW+ field of panels is still more then the 72KW they needhowever when doing this. they have 450kw of panel cost. with a capacity of 150kw but a demand on day one of 74, meaning if they can intice a neighbour or other industry to buy into the other 50%. they will get full 100% income to cover costs twice as fast of the initial build",

The customer is not the mining customer but the utilities customer,  the one who will be able to ask for better rates or change peak times in power usage.",
