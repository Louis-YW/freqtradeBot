Having said that, imo, i think merit distribution is going on pretty well, the forum isn't lacking in that respect, i mean, when last did we get to see a thread in meta were a user complains about that, it has been pretty long, we used to see that frequently in the past. Well, i don't think there can be any such thing as too much MS's, so we might do with a few more, they'd still be ranking up constructive and quality posters, so it is a win-win for us all.Quote from: TheBeardedBaby on August 20, 2022, 04:35:10 PMI would love to be more active here  You can do that without being a MS.",

Some merit sources are inactive, a few are more focused on there locale while others do there best to be all about on the forum. With the great number of users on the posts, it wouldn't hurt to have a few more merit source.And if I may suggest, should the available merit sources be viewed to be so much and a balancing is required,As opposed to the usual reduction in allocation, \"A monthly review of merit sources just as its done in the weekly DT reviews could be done\".Possibly considering there inactivity for a period coupled with the amounts of awarded smerits and the merits that where actually sent out.Perhaps after this, applications could be considered.@TheBeardedBaby, should your reopening of application mean bumping it, ofcourse you should if you feel its been long enough.",

Shall I reopen my application or it's not needed at the moment.In the poll, I chose the answer - \"yes\". It seems to me that it would not be superfluous to add at least one more merit source as a replacement for Ratimov (since he temporarily relieved himself of these duties), which will be fair. There was one less, which means that this vacancy can be filled. Discussion of such changes is best done together with the entire community and I would like as many forum members as possible to vote and express their opinion. The manifestation of their active position will allow to influence the decision-making by the administration of the forum, which, I hope, will take into account the wishes of those who voted.Quote from: TheBeardedBaby on August 20, 2022, 04:35:10 PMI would love to be more active here  If you want more activity (I doubt that's what you meant) and create a topic with a poll about the need to increase merit sources, then maybe you should try your hand as merit source? Of course, if you are ready to devote time and effort to this for a long time and don't abandon it in a couple of months under some pretext. Would you like to take on the duties of a merit source?",

I would love to be more active here  I have conflicting answer to your question.We do not need more merit sources if only the current merit sources would distribute merits effectively. I know they aren't paid for it but I am sure majority of the merit sources whose allocations are high doesn't exhaust their smerits within 30days. Some aren't regular and some doesn't care much about their status as merit source.If all merit sources would be like the ones that create threads to issue merits, the ones that follow up the created threads, the ones that spray merits across every month and the one that offer post reviews via pm, there won't be need for more merit sources.If I were theymos, I wouldn't make the merit status permanent or semi permanent, I would be rotating it for unserious merit sources, while those that spend all available smerits and even ask for more would remain and even have larger allocations.",

Shall I reopen my application or it's not needed at the moment.There is nothing bad to reopen your merit source application, if you voluntarily want to render the help to be a merit source, you can always let theymos know that. Few people, including me applied for merit source, mine was September last year, that was almost a year ago, I applied not long after theymos made some people merit source, ever since that time, theymos did not make anyone of us a merit source. That means merit source is not needed for now. If you check the merit distributed monthly, it is more than before new merits source were added while inactive ones were removed, I do not think merit source is needed for now, but it would be good if theymos also make those that voluntarily applied for merit source to be merit sources. If they are worthy of it, the more merit source we have, the better would be merit distribution.",

If they were inactive, they got less or were removed.The question whether or not we need more Merit sources basically comes down to: \"Do we think users rank up fast enough?\", or better: \"Are there users left out from ranking up even though they shouldn't be?\".I think this is much more important than the total Merit distribution.",

For instance you are the most merited in the forum and yet you receive more merits, that is because every post you drop is quality. It therefore means that at the abundance of merit sources, merits would tend to flow to a certain group of people (the quality posters). That is why my emphasis is on how willing is the sender of merits to hand it out, because if all merit sources maximise their spending, obviously there would be increased rank up.",
