  "content": "One of the earliest challenges I  faced as a newbie and even as full member in the Bitcointalk forum was how to create a table with columns and rows. I would later discover the  Search button . It was a lifesaver. The search results generated some links to tutorials by some forum members on to creating tables. I read them thoroughly, and I  was able to create my first table. See it here.Creating tables can be complicated and also confusing for newbies and even for some members. So in this post, I have compiled a list of my favorite tutorials on creating tables in this forum that I use in practicing a few times. I hope you find them useful .Name|Post Topic|_________________|_______________________________________________|1miau| Some suggestions if you want to use tables on Bitcointalk|_________________|_______________________________________________|so98nn| Tutorial - How to create Table in the BitcoinTalk Forum|_________________|_______________________________________________|pkmoney| How to create Table with BBCode|_________________|_______________________________________________|roslinpl| [LEARN] BBCode Lessons & Tutorials [+tutorial videos!]|_________________|_______________________________________________|so98nn| Reference Thread for Different Colors | Multiple Shades |]|_________________|_______________________________________________|Kindly note that you can also use the Search button  or as recommended by recommend @aysg76 the google search or https://ninjastic.space/ will give  optimised results for you if you do your search for these tutorials.",
