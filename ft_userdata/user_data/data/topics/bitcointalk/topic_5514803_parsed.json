The topic title should be changed to  Re: Just a reminder: How shitty fiat could be Vs Bitcoin It's called inflation and is a result of governments always wanting to see growth in their economies - guess what drives growth: the vicious circle of people wanting to earn more for the work they do or services they provide. That in turn means they have to charge customers more which in turn makes things more expensive so folks have to earn more to buy things. Rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.I defy you to find one example of any economy that has had sustained deflation.",

They just can’t have enough of it.  Maybe it is because the trade around the world still depends on the usd. Nearly every god damn business is keeping their books in usd. Bitcoin will never achieve that kind if worldwide adoption. Maybe we should be happy with what we got instead of chasing the impossible dream… Bitcoin will never replace the dollar. It is physically impossible.Yes bitcoin has far better purchasing power and it gets better and better unlike the dollar but that’s pretty much all about it. Some countries (like mine) don’t even acknowledge bitcoin as a currency. Here, you can’t use bitcoin as a currency because it is banned by the government. If you are going to buy a car, you can’t say I paid this man 1 btc for his car. This has zero meaning in the eyes of the government.How can btc thrive in an environment like this?",

Risk always there and comparing different assets, to say this one is better, is the best than others is very controversial and people will never agree with your comparison.Because the best for me has to match many things I have, like available income, capital, social economic status, health status like age and how many years I have in rest of my life.

Bitcoin's rise in value is stunning, yet it's equally noted for high volatility and speculative risks that may not be fitting for every investor. Diversification amongst assets, such as Bitcoin, with other stable assets including the USD, is done by many financial experts to balance growth potential with stability.Bitcoin has shown promise in the way that it works as an inflation hedge, but it remains an emerging asset in respect of its utility and regulatory frameworks. Where Bitcoin hasn't quite equaled the unique value of the dollar yet is in its relative stability and broad acceptance in a global finance context, despite wider institutional adoption and new products such as ETFs. It's all about balance-while Bitcoin might be a formidable asset in any portfolio, relying wholly on it ignores some practical benefits of a currency such as the USD in the current world economy.",
