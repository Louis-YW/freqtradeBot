  "content": "There's tons of businesses that accept crypto as a form of payment, but restaurants were the biggest surprise for me personally. From snack and sandwich shops up to michelin-star restaurants, it seems like crypto is penetrating more and more in to the service industry, and I'm curious on what's your experience with it. Is there a restaurant in your area that accepts crypto, what systems do they use and how was the whole experience? I just went through this article on CaptainAltCoin.com and found out that there's one in my location, so I'll def jump over and chat a bit with the staff about the whole thing, I'm really curious how they did it and how many customers actually prefer to pay in crypto over fiat. At the end of the day, after the pandemic most of them accept contactless, so it's just a tap of the phone - the source of the funds shouldn't matter.",

Hahaha yeah, you know when we talk about Bureks I am a sort of maniac  I even own a BTC address related to (1Burek87Lx48SR97fN8HJvGwTEBQMxjWpH). In 2019, I took 8 months to travel through Balkans with the idea to find the best burek everSlovenian ones are not crazy yeah, but you can find excellent Mesni and Gorenjska bureks near Kranj Â !As you said for bureks, Bosnia is the best place to eat on earth IMO",
