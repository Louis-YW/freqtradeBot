Also on another note....I tried the google search the same way I did on my phone and that top results was actually the real site...not sure why the fake one comes on my cell though",

      "body": "Proof that google doesn’t give a fuck about anything but money. They are hands down the most advanced software company on the planet, and they aren’t able to quickly research ad companies before allowing them to advertise on their site. They already allowed this once, and not too long after (post having received countless complaints from people that this ad site they were promoting was actually a scammer pretending to be a legit company).  You guys think google might have software capabilities to ping past scams quickly even if they somehow unknowingly (which yeah right) allowed them back on.  I can’t even post a btalk link or write the letters “btalk” on YouTube without them deleting it within minutes. They allow for bot scammers to have fake convos all the f over the place, no problem.  Have google TV and want to share your password ? Impossible thanks to their industry best  GPS tracking software rendering it impossible.. Sickens me that they’ll never receive any sort of fine or punishment for these corrupt and illegal practices.",

However if I am sending a 1 BTC or more transaction, I would not mind eating a $20 twice to make sure my BTC ends up at the right addy. Small price to pay for peace of mind IMO.",
