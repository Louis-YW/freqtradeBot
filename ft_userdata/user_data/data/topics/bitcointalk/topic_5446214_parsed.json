  "content": "In conjunction with what happened today [failure of some features on the platform], a report was issued on the CNBC website confirming that employees on Binance are providing solutions to Chinese users so that they can bypass KYC verification procedures, after analyzing chat messages published on some Telegram and Discord servers managed by Binance.Crypto is banned in China, but Binance employees and support volunteers tell people how to bypass the banThe report states that more than 220,000 Chinese users have succeeded in verifying their accounts on Binance with the help of workers in the Binance support teams.This is contrary not only to the laws of use on Binance, but also to the legislation of China, which has prohibited the activity of trading platforms since 2017 and banned cryptocurrencies since 2021.Experts in financial regulation shared concern that Binance’s KYC and AML efforts can be so easily thwarted :QuoteWells Fargo anti-money-laundering executive Jim Richards agreed that the techniques for bypassing Binance’s KYC controls could have implications beyond China. “What about North Korean customers, or Russian customers, or Iranian customers?” Richards asked.Quote“If I had a eight out of 10 concern about Binance from a regulatory perspective and from a national security perspective, this takes it to a 10 out of 10,” Duke University professor and former FDIC Chief Innovation Officer Sultan Meghji told CNBC.Meghji’s concerns about the laxity of Binance’s enforcement of KYC guidelines extend beyond China. “I think explicitly about the national security implications of how terrorists, criminals, money launderers, cyber people in North Korea, Russian oligarchs, etc., could use this to get access to this infrastructure,” he said, referring to some of the techniques described.Source from the same article.",

Is this a weakness of the system for which it was designed?If CZ counted as an employee, he was Chinese in that sense. However, China is the most promising market share compared to other countries which might be a shame to miss.Well, it hasn't been 24 hours I've talked how to take down competitors.",

The number of 220,000 users represents only a very small percentage of the Chinese population, that's right.  But it represents a significant percentage of the total number of Binance users, and in the best cases it will represent the most important percentage of users in Asia compared to other countries.  If anyone should be held accountable, it is Binance itself for its indulgence with users it said it did not support.  As for China, I do not think that it acts against its own citizens.  China cannot know them without Binance providing them with their data.",

That's the only thing he can do when news like circulates on the web on how flawed their system was.My opinion may have a certain amount of prejudice or bias, but my general observation is that Chinese people are first and foremost Chinese and it is only secondary that they are businessmen or employees or law enforcers or professors or even sentient or moral beings. For what it's worth, the Chinese people are Chinese more than people. So I don't think the problem is just that the KYC system is flawed and weak. It is that Chinese people are controlling the system and that they are accommodating their fellow Chinese to get onboard surpassing all the necessary processes. And CZ is probably not in the position to tolerate it or not. However strongly he denies that Binance is not a Chinese company, it essentially is.",

If they had to detect something, it is the outflow of money that somehow reaches CEX, and that is not easy to hide.",

As it is very easy, according to the article, to create a verified account on a reputable platform, since the price of $200 is a very small amount compared to the product provided. Also, I am surprised that there are customers in such a market, since the seller must be trusted, who can close the account he created at any time or manipulate wallets. Also, how can a person trust an account that is not in his name, send money to it, and risk that no one notices it? I find this really crazy.I agree with you I mean 200$ is not really small amount but if this only for bypass KYC this really cheap amount I mean the buyer can sell his kyc or making his data to do kyc in other platform for free",
