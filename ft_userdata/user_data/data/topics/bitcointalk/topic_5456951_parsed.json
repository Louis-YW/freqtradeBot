Have a good reputation before you start escrow service on this forum. You are not even on the list of escrow provider.he doesnt do escrow anymore Many lists here are outdated, when we talk about the escrow service, you should definitely be careful. The last list and the most recent one I know of are here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406507.msg60582815#msg60582815I don't know why there are only two members, but if my memory serves me well, it was after checking all the active members who offer this service. It could certainly be a recommendation for GazetaBitcoin, (if it still provides that service) because it is an active and reputable member here.Keep in mind that it is not mandatory for escrow to accept the proceeds in every store because sometimes it is not possible to determine the actual situation and whether all the details of the agreement have been met.",
