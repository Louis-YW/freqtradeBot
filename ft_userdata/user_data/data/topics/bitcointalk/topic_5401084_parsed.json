  "content": "https://www.worldchasetag.com/QuoteTHE FIRST AND ONLY GLOBAL LEAGUE FOR COMPETITIVE TAGWorld Chase Tag® was formed by Christian Devaux in 2012 after a game of Tag with his son in their back garden. A year later, he was joined by his brother, Damien, and together they set about turning the oldest game into the newest sport. From organising casual meet-ups in Hyde Park, within a few years they were hosting international competitions with some of the world's best Parkour athletes and Ninja Warrior competitors. In 2020, they teamed up with Tupelo Honey CEO, Cary Glotzer, who, together with Gray TV, became equity partners in World Chase Tag®. World Chase Tag® is responsible for creating a standardised competitive playing arena & set of rules / formats which has allows athletes from around the world to train & compete in international competitions.World Chase Tag® (WCT) events are divided into three tiers - National Championships, Continental Championships and World Championships. In 2021, WCT hosted National Championships in the US, China and the UK, which act as qualifier tournaments for the upcoming World Championship (WCT5) which will be held in London in June 2022.https://www.worldchasetag.com/aboutRules:QuoteCHASE TAG® - CHASE-OFF™This is our most popular format and is used at our main events (eg. WCT national Championships, WCT4, WCT5 etc.).It is a team format that is played by two teams of up to 6 athletes.Each match is the best of 16 Chases.Each Chase is 20 seconds long with one Chaser and one Evader.There is a 25 second Rest Period between Chases.The winning athlete in each Chase stays on as the Evader for the next Chase.A team is awarded one point for each Evasion they make (I.e. when the Evader lasts 20 seconds without getting caught).Tags must be made with the hand (I.e. NOT the foot).If an athlete steps out of bounds, they lose that Chase.If a match ends in a draw, it goes to a Sudden Death Chase-Off.https://www.worldchasetag.com/rulesThis game/sport had been gaining a lot of audiences now thanks to social media. I was part of that audience that just happen to bump on one of their clips on social media and I am already hooked on watching it. Now, I am a follower of the game. It's fun to see an old-school street game is now being played as a sport and televised. Takes you back to playing it as a kid. I am not yet familiar with the teams and still learning the rules. And my other problem is I don't see it listed on the gambling platforms that I checked. Let's discuss the game and share where we could put our bets. (if its available)",
