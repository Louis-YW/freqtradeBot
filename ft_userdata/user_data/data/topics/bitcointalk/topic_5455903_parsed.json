I would see more interesting how it could (in the future) deal with big constructs of data and find patterns people are missing out. Similar to comparing google trends but with a huge capacity to do that with all areas. I see it being used in fields of medicine, logistics, psychology, game theories, planning cities, planning for economies, and even designing more efficient and fair, progressive and sustainable models for government.",

If a business is becoming more productive with the use of it then that's a good thing for them because they're automating the process and the way they get leads and other stuff that they need. It saves them time, money, and effort. While looking at the perspective that it is replacing people's jobs, these jobs are also going to upgrade and will require them to be more knowledgeable with AI. AIs have been there for a long time and I've firstly used them with games and I know that people understand what I am talking about if it's with the games.",

They also carry out tasks that are deemed monotonous and complex. As an academic, it has assisted me in research, student evaluation, student/parent feedback, attendance recording and computation, online learning, language translation, lesson planning and delivery, test and examination assessment and records, plagiarism check, etc. Our students have also benefited from this technology because it also said them in carrying out thier academic activities. One of the major challenges we are facing in the academic field is using these tools to cheat. Students have become too lazy to carryout research to find solutions to assignments and tests because they solely rely on these tools. Artificial intelligence tools are designed to assist humans and not to perform the entire task. There is always a need to revise, evaluate and review the outputs from these tools because they will always give out answers like machines. So in a few years, we are predicting that if not checked these machines will reduce innovation and creativity in students.",

All these jobs which a lot of you think will be great to get AI involved in doesnot enhance our lives.The one area which could benefit us is in medicine.",

But right now let's just enjoy the benefits it gives and the convenience it does for the complicated jobs we have in this world. I'm pretty sure as of now, everyone is thankful to witness such kinds of future only those people who lost their jobs due to it will curse it.",

It has been noticed that AI are more efficient than human in carrying out operations and this has made some companies to replace human jobs with AI. Anything that has an advantage also has a disadvantage,AI can't reason like human and can't think fast or can involve in conversations and get quick answers to resolve problems on ground. I hope that in the nearest future,AI governments or the programmers wouldn't use it to hurt the society. It also makes human not to use their brains anymore to make researches for a better understanding.",

There are simple disadvantages that can easily be identified now, but as time goes on, some more disadvantages will emerge. AI technology will become normal soon, and no matter how much disadvantages are examined, it will not take them away because that is what change is about. My expectations for developers of this technology is that they make it really safe and ensure that it is not given too much control. If used in an industry, qualified humans should head over them and be able to control them.",
