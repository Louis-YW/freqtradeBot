  "content": "Hi, Im old trader i had a lot losses,i realised If you want to win the game you got be on the both sides of the game.So i decided to start use hedging trading methods. And Also the averaging down and flash crash buy orders for example even If btc don't go to 3000-4000$ just in case i'll have those orders.About futures trading i'll Open btc long and short on different exchangers but same coin with wide stop loss on the monthly high or monthly low.Why i need investors ? I have not any money myself i been losing all and i got hit by FTX case when i was using the FTX bull /bear tokens the idea was good but i have learned Lessons hard way when CME GROUP CEO Terry D told about FTX i should been listen my way now is i try to deal with regulated and trusted assets like btc and eth related. So i have no money my own and Im in huge debt because all those years i been learning \" but i take it as School\" Anyways If you want to go to university to study finaces you will pay 30,000$-70,000$ so nothing comes for free in life but i payed with my financial losses my healt time and everything else.I could make this as parable i took the hit so you don't have to i made mistakes so you don't have to so i sacraficed myself for others.And If you really want to earn money on financial markets and with trading you either pay for learning or you learn best by hard way but the point is in life you pay either way for something If you want. \"The hard way is not for everybody it can devastate and destroy all your life \" yes after hard way you will have best experince and a lot knowledge but it doesn't come without sacrafices so for some people it's best to use knowledge of other people.  The greater the end results the bigger sacrafices and the price you pay for it.Im looking for investors to join i pay 10% weekly ROI becouse i actually make money you get 10% ROI Every Friday so 5 days you wait monday to Friday and Every friday you will have payday. + Special rewards for clients If i do better then i will give out rewards aswell.What else i want to do ?  Im looking for landlord or Property owners with who i can make some deal so i can use their property as my office so all the investors can come to visit me there and my team (so Im looking for team members aswell who want to join hedgefund)Needless to say the office location got the one of the WORLD best locations and wealthy postal code area only i want to provide only the best and well presented experince to my clients.Also Im looking for Luxury cars dealership partnership and contacts so i can make some nice Ferrari or lambo as gift to one of our clients.Also Im looking for hotel owners flight companies who will be working on partnership with my hedgefund and my clients will have some special treatment and some nice rewards.But we don't need to go large we just work with long term clients we don't need large base of clients we are not going to be commercial bank.And off course as hedgefund we are our clients should have some nice yacht parties and events becouse we are hedgefund and our investors will feel special and they are special for us. And i want to give out clear message,my hedgefund clients are VIP and they should be treated best.We work hard and enjoy the fruits of hard work and success.I can't run this service for 1-2 person i definately need some more people so If you guys are interested to be part of this then let me know.",

Why not use leverage if your only issue just funds since exchange allows you use up to x100 leverage to increase your capital siginificantly.Can i really get some results with 30-50$ ?? That's maximum of my funds i can come up to Im honest my financial situation are in big mess and i can only use other investors funds If not i can't even get job because i don't have any other skills then markets and finances and trading i been apply to companies like blackrock i got rejected they want university degree they don't care about your real skills and experinces.If you use 100x you might just get liq both positions Short and long there is things like long wicks and short wicks they hit fast and your position get liqutated so it's not great way to trade.So i know If i borrow funds i'll be very successful but i allready own money and my reputation not trusted i have some low payed Job yes i pay back money little by little but my salary is low i can barely survive. Next step for me will be just not existing here on earth If things don't improve soon i have allready paid high price and what i get it is more suffering after suffering. If i paid the price i want rewards for it despite the fact that the material rewards can't even make it even the struggles but it will be something atleast Even all the money in the world not enough to make it even what i been through but atleast it's something and it's better then nothing.",

Sorry OP, but trust and a solid reputation are crucial in this space. The return you're claiming to generate is not realistic; it's difficult to achieve sustainably and consistently. I think you need to explore alternative funding options and consider refining your trading strategy with a lower-risk approach and from there demonstrate your success.",

In crypto-market traders are the bosses themselves and they can really earn a lot of profits if they build a good and working strategy with a proper trading plan. If you are someone like that then don't ask money from others because no-one will give you their money as it's quite risky to give money to someone who can play with your money. It's far better to arrange $1 to $10 by selling your old stuff and then start trading with that amount. You'll surely learn risk management in the process and who knows you may make good profits if you're really good at trading.Your offer seems like a scam attempt to me and other members of the forum and that's why suggested you to start with small amount of money and grow it slowly. The compounding thing works for everyone but patience and good understanding of the markets is necessary for it to work. Sorry, if I sound harsh, but I won't lend you even a $1 for your trading purpose because as a trader I know that how volatile is the crypto-market and anyone who trades based on 1-2 factors will end up liquidating the money.",
