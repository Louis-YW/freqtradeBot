I double checked all of my bets and saw that i deposited 0.01874467BTC & had wagered 0.12296BTC(I have pictures of all my bets).Then finally my second withdrawal went under review, and 5 days later im banned.Additional Notes: Got this email from Trustdice after getting banned:Im not sure what they are exactly accusing me of, so i will answer to every point:QuoteWe regret to inform you that your TrustDice account has been banned and the withdrawal funds were confiscated, this decision was taken according to the following terms and conditions. 18.1.

Also multiaccounting in Trustdice makes 0 sense, because there are so many clones(sportsbookies) w the same odds.I have pictures of all my bets, if anybody wants to check them.I have used over 50 bookies in my lifetime, and i have never seen anything like this before.So @Coinbox1, please explain what exactly did i do wrong, meanwhile i will finish my Askgambler&CasinoGurus complaints.",

      "body": "Hello,TrustDice team here. Could you please send us your account details via DM? Unfortunately we cannot locate a user id based on what you provided. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------Final Update 20221229:As both party agreed, an AskGamblers ticket was opened. Following a careful review and consideration of all the information, details and/or proof presented by both parties, AskGamblers decided to support TrustDice team's stance and declares the TrustDice team's decision has been in line with the T&C. As of now, AskGamblers team considers this case as revolved. So do we, as OP has been confirmed to be in violation of T&C by the mutually-agreed reputable arbitrator, AskGamblers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Bitcointalk community,Throughout this entire thread, we discussed with Mr. holydarkness about this case for days. Initially we thought he might just want to act as an unbiased arbitrator, but later we realized that he’s been deliberately misinterpreting our statements and attempted to put words in our mouth, and he has done it for 3 times in this single thread. Fearing such misinformation techniques might mislead the audience, we decide to make these public. The 1st time: he asked us about a clause in our T&C.Quote from: holydarkness on December 08, 2022, 07:50:56 AMQuote from: Poika5 on December 06, 2022, 11:16:57 AM[...]Quote* We determine that you are using TrustDice.win in a manner that gives you an unfair advantage, for example making bets on insight or professional knowledge about a sport gained via personal involvement or participation in the particular field of sport/esport[...]Were you saying that an educated guess in your sportsbetting is not allowed? Suppose I'm a retired professional soccer player who spent his time compiling data and player's statistics, then analyze them and guessed the strategy their coach will utilize based on my prior experience as a professional player, and I won. This is illegal?We then explained it in details to him:Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 08, 2022, 09:04:32 AMQuote from: holydarkness on December 08, 2022, 07:50:56 AMSuppose I'm a retired professional soccer player who spent his time compiling data and player's statistics, then analyze them and guessed the strategy their coach will utilize based on my prior experience as a professional player, and I won. This is illegal?(Note: This is not related to this case in discussion here) Most definitely not. \"personal involvement\" here typically means - the player himself or herself and individuals who are connected to the player and therefore have access to the internal info, or even able to influence the outcome of the game;- personal presence on the field of play during the game;18.1. Without restricting our ability to rely on other remedies that may be available to us, we may suspend and/or terminate your account, cancel any outstanding bets and/or confiscate any or all funds in your account at our absolute discretion if:* We determine that you are using TrustDice.win in a manner that gives you an unfair advantage, for example making bets on insight or professional knowledge about a sport gained via personal involvement or participation in the particular field of sport or using the late bets strategy;However this clause would most likely be triggered if you were in discussion with your old pal who is inside the team and paid him to access information that most people don't know about. The same applies if your old pal pays you to bet with his internal info. Unfortunately, crypto sports books like ours attract insider betting these days. He then claim we confirmed that OP was breaking that clause:Quote from: holydarkness on December 08, 2022, 09:14:56 PMyou banned their account because they had suspicious behavior --i.e. insider info This is simply not true. No where in our statement says it was the clause of the ban. The explanation was addresses to him for his question. Plus, in fact, we had explicitly written there that the explanation is not directly related to the case of this thread. Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 08, 2022, 09:04:32 AM(Note: This is not related to this case in discussion here) We didn’t understand how he could make the mistake, and thought he might be just a very bad reader.  We had to respectfully correct him:Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 09, 2022, 07:34:29 AMI am afraid there is a major misunderstanding here. As I previously stated:Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 08, 2022, 09:04:32 AM(Note: This is not related to this case in discussion here)  So when I discussed about insider info above, I was simply answering your question about the T&C clause related to insider info.  Such explanation has no direct relevance to the OP's case, or any specific cases. It was just to explain the clause. But that didn't stop him from misinterpreting things. The 2nd time was when he he claimed our Customer Support mentioning 1 clause means that’s the cause of the ban. Quote from: holydarkness on December 09, 2022, 12:36:09 PMThe way your team explained to OP on email suggested that their account is banned due to insider info --why else would you mention this point on email if that is not the reason or related at any degree to their account freezing-- and I take that it's far from it, then? OP's account is not suspected of insider info?In doing this, he completely ignored that fact that our Customer Support mentioned 3 clauses in the email, which all could be the cause:QuoteWe regret to inform you that your TrustDice account has been banned and the withdrawal funds were confiscated, this decision was taken according to the following terms and conditions. 18.1. Without restricting our ability to rely on other remedies that may be available to us, we may suspend and/or terminate your account, cancel any outstanding bets and/or confiscate any or all funds in your account at our absolute discretion if:* we determine that you are acting in a manner that is detrimental to the conduct of our business;* We determine that you are using TrustDice.win in a manner that gives you an unfair advantage, for example making bets on insight or professional knowledge about a sport gained via personal involvement or participation in the particular field of sport/esport or using the late bets strategy;* we suspect that you have registered, manage or direct your betting activity on multiple user accounts in an attempt to hide your betting activity, bypass our set trading limits or violate any promotion Terms and Conditions;The 3rd time was when he accused us of not providing reasons for the ban:Quote from: holydarkness on December 09, 2022, 04:59:02 PM by refusing to specify the reason like this, you actually cast an impression that you're the one being wrong here. Anyone reading this case would probably think like me, that if you have nothing to hide and sure that OP is an abuser, you'll be more than happy to provide --at the very least-- the reason why they're being banned. But we clearly did, and that was even directly addressed to Mr.holydarkness himself. Yet he chose to ignore it and makes false accusations:Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 09, 2022, 07:34:29 AMQuote from: holydarkness on December 08, 2022, 09:14:56 PMHave you studied OP's account closely and have solid proof before freezing it or were you just ban-first-ask-later? Prior to the ban, our Risk Management team have found substantial abnormalities surrounding the OP's account and other suspicious behaviors. As the nature of this conversation gets increasing non-factual, we decide to cease engaging in this thread because this kind of conversion doesn’t align with our company policies. With regard to the OP's accusation, as both party agreed, an AskGambler ticket was opened in case anyone wants to follow this up. Thank you.TrustDice Team",

Have you studied OP's account closely and have solid proof before freezing it or were you just ban-first-ask-later? How do we know that it is not a foul play by your platform, that you didn't just invent the situation and you won't use the same reason for other user(s) in the future?",

As I previously stated:Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 08, 2022, 09:04:32 AM(Note: This is not related to this case in discussion here)  So when I discussed about insider info above, I was simply answering your question about the T&C clause related to insider info.  Such explanation has no direct relevance to the OP's case, or any specific cases. It was just to explain the clause. Quote from: holydarkness on December 08, 2022, 09:14:56 PMHave you studied OP's account closely and have solid proof before freezing it or were you just ban-first-ask-later? Prior to the ban, our Risk Management team have found substantial abnormalities surrounding the OP's account and other suspicious behaviors. This means we found OP's account had been acting in a manner that's impossible for an ordinary human player and its various signals shall be considered abnormalities for an ordinary human player. And all of such data have been well documented. (edit: longer explanation added to highlight and avoid being overlooked)However, kindly note that our updated internal policies forbid us from sharing such details in public forums, unless particularly authorized by our management and approved by the player. This is for both privacy and anti-abuse concerns. In fact, for the sake of open and transparent communication with Bitcointalk community, we had shared such details on the forum in the past, which did get us quite some compliments. However such transparency was later exploited by abusers who saw it. As a result, our marketing team has received criticism internally. We have no problem sharing such details to a 3rd party arbitrator. Quote from: holydarkness on December 08, 2022, 09:14:56 PMHow do we know that it is not a foul play by your platform, that you didn't just invent the situation and you won't use the same reason for other user(s) in the future?As you may have noticed on this forum, plenty of forum members have been using our platform for a long time and have no trouble playing and withdrawing. Some of them are high level users like you, with Legendary or Hero badge. In this regard, I recommend you to post a thread on Gambling sub forum to inquire what most gamblers on this forum have experienced so far. Truth to be told, we spend much more money doing marketing on this forum than the amount being discussed in this case. As one of the established crypto casinos, and an operator who has been in this market since 2018, we have no reason to arbitrarily ban users just because he or she wins. We have more money to make in maintaining our reputation as a reliable casino and sportsbook. With regard to \"is TrustDice legit\", we have prepared a page dedicated to this question.  You can also take a look at the chatroom on the right to see for yourself. And TrustDice is also pretty much the best rated crypto casino on TrustPilot. All in all, we strongly encourage OP to complete KYC procedure as requested, otherwise there is not much we (aka the marketing department) can assist at the moment. We do our best to assist every player, but if a player refuses to assist himself, our hands are tied. Best,TrustDice Team",

You still didnt answer the question, why did Trustdice ban me before the KYC?QuoteWe have no problem sharing such details to a 3rd party arbitrator. Good to know, i started a complaint(Askgamblers). Hopefully Trustdice will respect Askgamblers decision/judgement.QuoteWe do our best to assist every player, but if a player refuses to assist himself, our hands are tied. Try and look at this from my perspective, i was unfairly banned & my money was stolen. Why would i send my personal information to casino/thieves who stole from me?",

Such explanation has no direct relevance to the OP's case, or any specific cases. It was just to explain the clause. [...]Ahh, I see. Yes, I'll openly admit that there is a major misunderstanding from my side. The way your team explained to OP on email suggested that their account is banned due to insider info --why else would you mention this point on email if that is not the reason or related at any degree to their account freezing-- and I take that it's far from it, then? OP's account is not suspected of insider info?Would you elaborate more on the reason? You can't give evidences due to the backlash you received on previous case, okay, arguably understandable, but certainly a casino --or any business entity-- should inform their user the reason of the banning so their user could defend themselves with proper evidence?From what we can take from the email, the possible reasons are (1) misconduct, (2) insider info, (3) multi-alt abuse, or (4) a breach in TnC.I think we can safely cross reason number (2) based on your own statement, and (3) because if OP is multiacc-ing, they'll quite reluctant to do KYC instead of offering them. So, point number (1) which would need you to to explain which misconduct is it because the term is very wide, or point (4) that's even more vague and widely open for misinterpretation.I'd like to say OP raised a good point, they've offered to willingly perform KYC and you cut their way by freezing their account instead, for no clear reason if I may add. So certainly we can agree that they reserve a good degree of caution upon who they submit their info to. So, maybe all we need right now is for you to give a good gesture and tell us why you banned them in the first place. After all, as you said yourself, you have your reputation to maintain. So I think explaining why they're banned is not only a cheap price to pay for OP to do KYC and you to maintain your reputation, but also your duty on the first place.",
