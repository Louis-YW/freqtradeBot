  "content": "Hello everybody, About a month ago, I managed to save up 0.10 BTC and I transferred them to my Ledger. I did not really pay much attention to it since then, but this morning I opened my Ledger and saw that I had 0.20 BTC. Apparently, the transaction happened twice! But what does this mean? Do I really now own 0.20 BTC, or is it not spendable? Thank you very much for your insight, as I'm quite confused   Have a great day everyone,Thomas",

If they know who you are, they might come after their money. Depending on where you live that may or may not mean something.Ethically: no. Keeping money that isn't yours not the right thing to do. Contacting the sender might even get you a bug reward if this happens more often.Technically: yes. If you have Bitcoin in your wallet, nobody else can touch it.Quoteor is it not spendable?You could just try, by making a payment to yourself.",

      "body": "First of all thank you very much for the help! I sent the BTC from Coinbase to Ledger Live.   This is the address at which I received it: bc1qk3mjlg6jjr23sczgnr4jn3q8afrxjvh59pz743  When I check Blockexplorer and Blockchair with the address and transaction ID, it only shows 1 transaction of 0.10 BTC. I live in Germany, but I have the possibility of withdrawing my crypto to a bank account which is not submitted to taxes. What would you advise? Should I contact Ledger Live or simply withdraw 0.10 BTC to my bank account and consider myself lucky...?I'm quite confused lol",

Consider yourself lucky that your balance miraculously doubled, because it would have been a completely different experience if you had seen 0 instead of 0.20 BTC. This is not the first and last time such things have happened, and it is not specific to just one software. If you think about it, would someone just mistakenly send you 0.10 BTC and then not ask for them back? Sometimes it really happens that your balance increases and it's not a bug in your crypto wallet, but it's still the result of someone's mistake - see this example -> link",

Blockchain explorers show only the 0.10083079 Bitcoin you withdrew from your exchange account. People make mistakes, and I have witnessed several different cases myself. I once withdrew from a sportsbook and received only like 30% of what I requested while the correct amount was removed from my balance. After speaking with the support, they told me I got mistaken for some other player who received my withdrawal amount and they gave me his. It was cleared up later. In a different situation, I was credited with 0.15 BTC in a signature campaign when I should have gotten only 0.015 BTC. Someone forgot the zero. The point is, people make mistakes, just be honest about it. That's not what happened with your coins, just remember that it could. When it comes to Ledger Live and their servers, I haven't seen many glitches. But I remember an instant when my total balance fell to 0 during synching and then went up to the normal state a few seconds later. Not a pleasant experience as you might imagine. There was another situation where LL displayed I had like $100.000 more in BTC than what I really did. That again happened while the app was syncing.",
