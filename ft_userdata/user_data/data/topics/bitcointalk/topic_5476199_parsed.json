      "body": "I don't understand what this thread is supposed to be about or what you are trying to imply here, to be honest. First off, zone of conflict or zones which are widely affected by war are very far away from rich communities like those you mention, perhaps the only exception would be Ukraine, since it is quite close to the rest of the European Union. Also, in the most of the cases war refugees cannot choose where to live or under what conditions they are going to live while their legal situation gets cleared. In the best scenario nobody would be forced to flee their home, unfortunately, this is not the case in many of the situation we see nowadays.",
