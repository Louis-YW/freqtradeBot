It's good to see that a western country is not trying to stifle growth or innovation, but is trying to protect its consumers. Of course we all prefer complete freedom, though it does seem like they are at least trying to keep the scales somewhat balanced. I have actually heard in an online community that Binance recently have let go of the vast remainder of their employees in the Australian base as of recently, after they have already been doing so throughout the year there and around the world. I wonder if the two scenarios are correlated.",

I don't about your claim about tracking though, they probably already have that tracking that you're talking about even before the passing of this regulation, I mean Australian citizens are paying their taxes already, I am sure that the Australian version of the IRS has their calculator kids crunching the numbers to track the wealth that each of their citizens have, of course there's never going to be any changes, pretty sure that you already know how slow the bureaucratic process is in the government.",

However, this is only for balance and the government there is considered still friendly compared to the policies of several countries which completely prohibit cryptocurrency transactions, especially Bitcoin which is much more decentralized. Therefore, create policies that are mutually beneficial to consumers and the government. Even though most consumers want freedom, living in a country like it or not, they still have to accept the rules. Consumers just need to be smart about securing their assets in a way that is more undetectable.",

There's no law against that, so we do have competing currencies.\"So, Bitcoin is clearly seen as legal in Australia.But yes, in future you can see payments in Australia moving towards CBDCs. Basically less access to cash and a push to use more digital money only.Here's a post I wrote in Stacker News about this: A view into the future of payments in Australia",

That's why they specifically mentioned big exchanges having a lot of money. I checked and saw that only Kraken had their ASIC license back in time. Which I think might not be considered in the list of gaining a license soon. Overall, that's a good step, into the world of digitalization, and we might see many startup companies from Australia just like Hong Kong is coming up with many new companies promoting and adopting crypto. This would be a positive point for the GDP of Australia because more companies means more tax will be paid and hence the reserves will increase and more development would occur. And in the end, it is also bad for those, who don't want to agree on the ASIC or any other terms.",

I'm interested to see what happens next there...I'm glad you are able to corroborate on my earlier submission;  I have been following Australian government policies for a while and I know how they subtly bring regulations that look good on the surface but with clandestine motives that is not far from control and censorship. Several companies that I know have been badly hit by such rules and those that have their headquarters there have to make changes to their conditions of service that it even affected those outside Australia. I know they will have a hard time with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general considering that many people are opting for DEX over CEX. Well, in the near future, many things will become clearer.",

When you are in bitcoin world, you should agree that you take the responsibility of managing your own funds yourself on your own and you also take the responsibility of making transactions and exchanges without involvement of 3rd parties. That's why Bitcoin was created but now we are stealing its fundamentals from it and only give it a trading value. If bitcoin is traded on centralized exchanges and we use Blockchain Analyzes companies to filter transactions, we simply transfrom bitcoin into stocks that have additional options that includes payment and self-custody wallets.",

Centralized services get our data such as IP address, transactions and many more once use their service. This kind of regulation is really good for consumer protection since there’s a lot of shady exchange like FTX that do use consumer money without any consent on different matter.
