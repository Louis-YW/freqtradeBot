You should first double check if receiving address was correct, but what fees you used when you sent your coins?Mempool is really full right now (blame it on ordinals) with many unconfirmed txn, so you either wait until transaction is confirmed or you pay more fees if you used RBF in your transaction.You can check mempool state on mempool.space or any similar websites.",

Please be patient, but you must make sure you have sent to the right address.Maybe the confirmation is bit long because the mempool is stuck as dkbit98 has explained. 40 satoshi per byte is the recommended fee, but if you are using wallet that supports RBF, then you can pay higher fee to get faster confirmations.",

If not then we can't help you get the funds back but if it's the right one then ot should be okay and go back to copper membership page to activate it or set the copper membership. Once you have done it then you can see copper membership in your profile.Well, he's proudly wearing it now",

The OP shouldn't have to do that because I think this thread is worth referencing when other newbies ask about the same problem. Thread content should be persisted, that is my suggestion even if the problem is solved. Simply lock the thread and leave one appreciative reply to anyone who helps.",

Alternatively you can edit in the appreciation text without removing the initial content or you can make a new reply.I would recommend the former, but do not think too much about it.- Jay -",
