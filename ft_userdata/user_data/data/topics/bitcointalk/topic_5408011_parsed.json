  "content": "I am looking to finally get a new Frame after building my first official mining Rig, this frame will take the following cards:-2x 3070 Ti2x 3060 Ti3x 3080they are already working but been mounted on a desk for sometime, so anyways...they are currently on two motherboards but i want to have them ALL on a single Rig/Motheroard,The motherboards am using is a Server Board and with just 6x PCI SlotsI am considering this:https://www.amazon.com.tr/gp/product/B08XQHRBG2/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A8RRNMM75PDRA&psc=1Title: \"Benedict PCI expansion card 1 to 4 PCI slots USB 3.0 converter adapter PCIE riser card new/PCI expansion card 1 to 4 PCI slots USB 3.0 converter adapter adapter PCIE riser card\"Never tried it before, will i be able to connect all my MIXED RISERS AND DIFFERENT BRANDS to this and connect all 7x Cards successfully and get them working on a single Rig ?...thanks,",

      "body": "All video cards are from the same series and there will be no problems with them. If you use Hive OS or similar systems for mining, then everything will work fine for you. Cooling problems can occur because the graphics cards are close together and will get hot.You need to buy this adapter and check how it will work on your motherboard. I would not use it, but would do a mining farm with 6 video cards.",

      "body": "There should be no problem running 7 or more cards in a motherboard that supports them.The fact that they are all Nvidias makes it a bit easier for you as you can use one single driver for all of them.What is that you should be careful when putting all these Gddr6x cards together in one rig the 2 x 3070 ti plus 3 x 3080 is you need to provide a very optimal cooling to such cards because when they will be in a single board,they will be close together and we all know that the gddr6x memory tend to over heat quickly.Once you have taken care of cooling there is nothing to worry about.",
