There is also the saying \"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" This saying is also true.  There are also many rich people who say that they will help with the events, but in reality, it is also true that those promises are not fulfilled. It's rare that I see billionaires who always help those in need, especially during times of calamity. Only a few people know whether it is the rich who really care about the poor or the so-called philanthropists.",

I think there could be those who really giveaway so much just to feel better or not to feel too guilty... but not without expecting something in return from the receiver/society. If they do not expect anything in return they would be giving without anyone (except maybe their wives) knowing.",
