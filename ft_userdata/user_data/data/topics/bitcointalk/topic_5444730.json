Personally, I don't want people to over exaggerate Bitcoin as it only causes side effects.Let Bitcoin grows naturally and remember a saying \"Be careful with things are too good to be true\". Don't mention about Bitcoin as a 'too good to be true' cryptocurrency or asset.",

If you're not a merchant, the best thing you can do is to ask merchants if they accept it, so they can see it's demanded. We don't need a lot of social media activity around Bitcoin. Only if there are some fake news that need to be debunked.",

It is not like people are no longer interested in bitcoins, that's an assumption, To me I feel that people are now more generally reserved about asking or talking about bitcoins to random people they meet on social media because of how fraudsters can take advantage of their ignorance and curiosity to lead them to bad websites and fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms. I have had chats with self acclaimed cryptocurrency professionals online and almost all of them want to lead me all the time to invest or buy bitcoins from a website that I am sure belongs to them. It is better you ask information from someone you know that is into bitcoin, not just any random person on social media claiming to know all about bitcoins.",

Friday last week I have to boost my social media handle with a new name? And I surprisingly wake up this morning to see millions of follows, talking and updating their views. Nobody who is interested in bitcoin is unconcerned about it. Social media is a separate type of forum where something only trends when there is negative or positive news attached to it. You may have noticed a low impact of social media talking about BTC, but that is not the case; people are still talking about and joining the adoption and use of bitcoin on a daily basis.QuoteBitcoin is our future currency we should encourage people, government and nations to always see it as one value assets every country should invest on. This has been going on for a long time and will not end soon. The manner in which we disseminate information about a project is also critical to its public acceptance. As they have become more knowledgeable about bitcoin, and the benefits of investing in it has become valuable. The side effects and disadvantages should also be considered valuable information to the general public.",

US, China, Indian, Nigeria and many more needs this project, let's make the government understand the values. Do you really think the government doesn't understand?The problem with the government has always centred on regulations and the fact that, bitcoin is decentralized such that, they cannot control it and the government operates a centralised system. This makes the system a hard to adopt as they don't wish to be accountable over anything and then the issue of it being untraceable as it could be prone to crime use. These are not issues but, its what the government have capitalised on to turn a blind eye on all its benefits",

Not because your handler doesn't have any comments about BTC means the world don't talk about it.  Just look at this forum, almost every seconds different replies and comments are posted about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  If you search youtube and other social media, Bitcoin is still the hot talk there.  I wonder where you get the idea that no one is interested in Bitcoin anymore.  Wake up and see that Bitcoin is still a hot topic and the interested people are growing.  You can also see that Bitcoin is heavily traded just look at its trading volume.I believe the Government know much more than we do in regard of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  They are a bit hesitant because Bitcoin is disrupting their traditional financial system.  But I believe once they designed a regulation that is favorable for them, they (the government) will eventually accept Bitcoin",

And I surprisingly wake up this morning to see millions of follows, talking and updating their views. I don't understand this sentence. How did you boost your social media handle with a new name? do you mean the new name fetched you more followers who talk about bitcoin? Moving forward, social media is niched based, that's why people use hashtag on platforms like twitter and instagram. Between twitter has an interest board feature where you choose the kind of contents you wish to see on daily basis. And the cryptocurrency community is always active on twitter, reddit, medium and youtube. These are 4 social media platforms where cryptocurrency enthusiasts publish, regularly, contents about the market. So, I don't see much decline in the discussion rate of bitcoin users, but it can't be compared to the heavy amount of contents that follows the bullish season.",

I talk to my friends and relations often about bitcoin.Exactly my thought bro, let's take the social media app like Twitter for example, I mean bitcoin is massively talk about there and so many fraudster are also looking for their next weak victims as social media discussion are all over rated with so many untrue and unrealistic messages. people claiming to be experts on bitcoin was certainly the trend of 2020-2021 as bitcoin pull waves over hitting its ATH that year but this great achievement was used by so many fraudsters in these so called social media app like Facebook and the rest as a target spot for naive and greedy humans who get all pumped after hearing about so many untrue promises of they can get rich over night through an investment in bitcoin.",
