      "body": "There exist torrents out there which you can find if you look for them. I'm not going to link them directly since I would not trust them, however.The slowest part of the process is not the downloading, but the validation. If you perform the IBD through Core, it will validate as it goes. If you torrent the blockchain, then Core cannot start validation until your torrent is complete, and you will likely have to wait the same amount of time for the validation anyway. Given this, then I would be suspicious that any torrent of the blockchain would contain something malicious hidden inside since there is no real reason to have a torrent of the blockchain in the first place.",

Will speed it up a bunch.Quote from: pooya87 on January 19, 2020, 03:32:11 AMyou have to keep in mind that you are downloading 11 years worth of historical transactions and it is not just raw bytes that you download and store like you'd do with a video. it is bytes that you have to also convert to transactions and verify using cryptography which is what @NeuroticFish mentioned about your CPU and storage. and it also involves RAM.one way to speed up bitcoin core's syncing is if you have a lot of RAM and increase the amount of it that core uses using your bitcoin.conf file. just add dbcache=XXX where XXX is the amount of RAM in MB.for example if you have 8 GB RAM set it to dbcache=4000Since you have 16GB if you are doing nothing else with the machine then you can easily get away with 8GB cache [ dbcache=8000 ]After the initial download and sync you can comment that line out.-Dave",

Unless there's a reason you don't want Electrum, I wouldn't use Bitcoin Core on this hardware.QuoteI have now switched the HDD to an HP Elite 8300 SFF and it seems to be working better:CPU: 3,4 GHz (boost up to 3,9 GHz I think)RAM: 16 GBHDD (same as before)Do yourself a favor: get an SSD  It's the best upgrade you can get. In case you already have an SSD and just use the HDD for block storage: move your chainstate directory to the SSD. It makes all the difference!",
