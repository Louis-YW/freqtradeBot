  "content": "A few months before joining the forum. It still shakes me how a relationship with a close friend of mine went bad. We are 10-12 friends and have many fun memories of hanging out and visiting different places outside of studies.One of my friend name Jason, None of the friends knew what Jason was doing. But I knew he was with Bitcoin Transactions and holder. I tried and learnt a lot from him about Bitcoin. Jason kept his work a secret because there are restrictions on Bitcoin transactions in our country.At that time, one day my another friend curlos was in a good mood and told me that he got a very big customer job. I told him have you any Bitcoin wallet? I told him about Bitcoin Wallet because I knew many buyers now feel comfortable paying in Bitcoin and curlos was a freelancer. He immediately became very angry with me and abused me. Because he had absolutely no confidence in Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. For this reason of Bitcoin word he broke our relationship and he didn't talk to me for a long day. After this incident, even if I met him in the campus, he avoided me and did not talk to me. After 1 months of this incident, curlos came to my house one night and hugged me with a crying voice and sincerely apologized to me. I could not contain my emotions, the moment of the return of one of my close friends after so long was very happy. My eyes were teary with joy. It is not possible to explain the scene of that moment in words.However, curlos later regretted his disinterest in Bitcoin and misbehavior with me. Even his interest in Bitcoin increased and I helped him in creating a wallet.My friend is now very confident and I am very proud of him that he got the wrong idea about Bitcoin. I'm so glad that I helped him. Currently he is a bitcoin holder.",

It is even better when using lightning. Your friend Carlos had not reason to be upset with you unless you tried to shove it down his throat. I expected that the story would end with you saying that Carlos began to accept bitcoin as payment for his freelancing jobs rather you said he is now a bitcoin holder. In anyways, being a bitcoin holder goes above receiving payment in bitcoin or opening a wallet and holding bitcoin. Carlos needs to understand the fundamentals of bitcoin, wallet security, the market and other bitcoin stuff. The more knowledgeable you are, the more confident you become.

One has taken it in a positive way, whereas the other has taken the incident in a negative way. Finally, the reality was understood, and both got united. I have briefed my friends about bitcoin and haven't experienced something similar. During the beginning days, I shared about bitcoin with my friends and a nearby young generation. By this time, everyone was eager to know, but they weren't confident enough to invest. People who had an opportunity but missed it now used to praise me for the support during the beginning.",

If he had doubts or anything, he could ask gently or say he was not interested, there was no need for all this drama to create a scene and keep it going for months.  Anyway, it's your friendship and the people you like, what I'm mainly confused about is why he reacted this way. I understand that you mentioned Bitcoin has a lot of restrictions in your country so people need to be careful when using it, but this has nothing to do with why he got angry and abusive and then regretted what he did later on.It could also be your mistake because if you had explained everything properly from top to bottom, the risks involved, how he can manage restrictions, and how he can operate staying within the country without getting in trouble, and maybe he could understand.",

      "body": "The story is like reading a fairy tale, there are many tragedies full of emotions that occur in it, but all of this can be suppressed due to patience and not responding to unpleasant treatment from your friends. Your friend (Jason) is too sensitive and doesn't really trust you with his knowledge of Bitcoin, even though Bitcoin transactions in your country are still considered illegal or something like that, he should be more open to you because of the first relationship that has existed so far. Curlos gets emotional too quickly, he should have properly digested what you told him before drawing conclusions. As a friend, you should be more open and trusting of other friends, friendships are like a family who are always together when they are in a happy mood and support each other when they are in trouble. Your patience has succeeded in making Curlos melt and start to believe in the potential that can be generated from Bitcoin. The stubborn attitude of people like Curlos must be faced with patience to make him realize and rethink what you said to him.",

You asked your friend a very simple question but he took it very badly, he got very angry at your very simple words and he wanted to break up with you. After that he realizes his mistake and befriends you again. Sometimes there are secret conversations between friends, so I don't find any reason to behave unpleasantly. I also have friends who are involved in crypto currency for a long time, I also discuss bitcoin or bitcoin wallet with them, they never got angry or broke up like your friend.You guide your friend about Bitcoin so that he can patiently invest in Bitcoin as you mention that your friend is now a Bitcoin holder. But be careful of him again, he might want to break up with you or abuse you again (fun  ).",

You didn't even talk bad thing about fiat and banks. I see your friend is a problematic person, better to stay away even though you and him already in good relationship because sooner or later he will back become like that when you suggest something new which he don't like.",

However I think we don't have to blame him for his bad attitude towards you back then I  guess he must have been going through something, or I think is afraid that you might tell people that he's holding bitcoin unlike as you said that  bitcoin is been restricted in your country so I think he don't want anyone to know about it.
