      "body": "It will be easier if you'll include in the post the openings and as well as the qualifications. I've seen companies do this but they rarely reply to the applications that have been sent to them because the roles are not specified. It's easy to say that anyone can contribute but it has to be specific. I'm sure that there will be interested folks to come on board with your company as long as they know that they are qualified for the post.",
