He did not mention specific exchanges, however, there is someone on Twitter who said that there are rumors that Kucoin will halt withdrawals in the near future.There was also someone else who replied that Kucoin has started implementing KYC before being approved to withdraw.I am not very sure if this is true or fud. This is why I am asking you. I traded in Kucoin last week and I had no problems using the exchange. I deposited my cryptocoins and withdrawn my stablecoins within 1 hour.I am hearing rumors that KuCoin is about to halt withdrawals in the near future.I have closed all open trades and immediately taken all money off KuCoin. From what I’ve been hearing, this ‘rumor’ will soon be a reality. Do not suffer the same fate as others who had their money stolen by irresponsible platforms.Source https://mobile.twitter.com/buckleupbrandon/status/1542933313043693568",

He did not mention specific exchanges, however, there is someone on Twitter who said that there are rumors that Kucoin will halt withdrawals in the near future.Well, Kucoin can be hardly called \"smaller exchange\" so I don't see any connections between what that FTX guy mentioned and Kucoin itself. He is generally true thoigh, a lot of crypto exchanges will disappear during bear market as God know swhat they did with deposited money (I wouldn't be surprised if they deposited client's money into Celsius and similar platforms) Quote from: bbc.reporter on July 02, 2022, 04:48:08 AMThere was also someone else who replied that Kucoin has started implementing KYC before being approved to withdraw.That's always a possibility when withdrawing, especially if you are doing it with bigger amounts.Quote from: bbc.reporter on July 02, 2022, 04:48:08 AMI am not very sure if this is true or fud.Since that source is just some random guy on Twitter is hard to say, but what he is saying about withdrawing your money from there is absolutely true, no one should hold their crypto on exchanges, including the most popular ones.",

But, I see this to be partaining to just only one user or few users if they see the person's account to be suspicious. Any centralized exchange can do it. Nobody should be surprised if an exchange user's account is suspended one day and KYC is demanded for.So, I do not see this as a reason Kucoin to enforce all their customers to provide KYC documents. But, we should know that centralized exchanges have full control over their users coins and funds generally, the reason we should not leave our coins on exchanges, anyone not used for active frequent trade should be moved to a noncustododial wallet. Conclusively, anyone using a centralized exchange should always know that the exchange can at anytime freeze their funds or block their account and demand for KYC.",

Even Binance once halted Bitcoin withdrawals. Coinbase did it in a different fashion. These exchanges are larger than KuCoin. And now KuCoin supporters are rallying behind their favorite exchange, discounting any insolvency issues, and even trying to be 100% certain that KuCoin will remain liquid amidst this bear market when custodial services are crumbling one after another. It seems the response is more problematic than the FUD itself. How far-fetched is the idea that this FUD could even be coming from KuCoin itself so that by the time they finally admit to the public their insolvency they could easily point to this FUD as the real culprit?",

The same for Voyager. No exchange on the brink of insolvency is going to make that obvious. Just because things are running fine right now doesn't mean they will continue to be running fine next week or next month.For what it's worth, I don't think KuCoin are about to freeze deposits like these centralized lending platforms, but I still wouldn't be storing a single satoshi on any centralized exchange right now.",
