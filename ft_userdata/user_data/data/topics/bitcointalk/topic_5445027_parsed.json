I'm not sure which wallet you're using, but you can use Electrum for that.Inside the \"Pay to\" field, use the following format:Code:address_1, amount_1address_2, amount_2address_3, amount_3You will notice that the \"amount\" field is summing up all the amounts you're entering.",

Don't forget with fees sending keep cut off for ten transaction but if you want looking tipping or sending bitcoin without fees try with exchange market.You can send trough BinancePay and there are not any fees yet but not ability for sending above two user in the same time, manually add one by one account for sending Bitcoin but get advantage without have to pay fees.",

If there are lots of transactions coming in and/or you are spending from multiple UTXOs into that one transaction the fee would be relatively high.- Jay -",

Yes, bitcoin has been improved in many ways and this also comes with the improvements made by introducing bitcoin lightning network to help make bitcoin transactions more faster and sent to multiple addresses at the same time with lesser transaction charges, you can read more on bitcoin lightning network here https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-the-lightning-network-in-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work",

I've read about this before but it's about a altcoin that supports multi sending, not Bitcoin. As somebody already mentioned, just use the Electrum wallet. You can also use the lightning network with it. If you use lightning, the transaction fees are so low that you do not have to worry about tipping transaction fees. Unless you are worried about 5 cents per transaction. But for most people, 5 cents is nothing.Also, you can send your transactions in groups. Which means you can send Bitcoin to different addresses at the same time. Tipping with Bitcoin on the lightning network is almost free. There is absolutely no reason why tippers would not want to use Bitcoin.And unlike with paper money (fiat), you can retrace the transactions so everybody knows who gets how much tips and from whom. So its fair and transparent too.A much better system than paper money tipping, if you ask me.",

I've read about this before but it's about a altcoin that supports multi sending, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be a good crypto for tipping business, as it is widely accepted and has a large user base. But you always you may need to consider the transaction fees and confirmation times, which can fluctuate depending on network congestion.To send Bitcoin worth $10 to ten different addresses at the same time, you can use a Bitcoin wallet that supports batch transactions. However, Bitcoin itself does not have native support for multi-sending, so you may need to use a third-party service or a wallet that supports this feature. Be sure to research and choose a reputable service to ensure the safety and security of your funds",

Sending to 10 different people will not take more then 10 minutes to do manually. Because then you would be paying a lot more, and then taking up 10 transactions instead of 1 single transaction.It's the most efficient way, to end up with 1 single utxo as change. In fact, I like to use up all my little inputs to send in 2 or 3 people, if I like (but usually I just combine everything to make 1 tx and leave the rest of it as change.You are talking 10 minutes manually, we are talking less than 1 minute manually.You can save this even in a sheet and do it.I guess you don't know about fees huh.",
