Reminds me of the BCH and Roger Ver days of 2017 when they were spamming the network and we had to pay huge fees for a simple transaction. Hopefully this doesn’t go on for long.",

What they need to do from a business point of view is to raise the withdrawal fees in line with the fees that are being paid. So there shouldn't be a problem. People wouldn't even think of withdrawing much unless it's strictly necessary. In the same way that I think we now think more about spending bitcoin than we did when we could send transactions at the minimum fee and they were confirmed quickly.",

Yes, they would miss out on some of the high-fees they could otherwise rake in if they wouldn't prioritize their own transactions. But isn't that a price you should be willing to pay to maintain a stable and reliable monopoly-exchange such as Binance?Just a thought.",

It seems that users are starting to fear that the predicted increase in Bitcoin network traffic will be even worse than today. Neither Binance nor any other CEX can actually change their withdrawal rates if for some time there is no significant reduction in network activity, as it is not possible to hold customers' money during this network crisis which is not certain for how long.",

They might only be using that as an excuse. The exchange had a quick outflow of 175,000 bitcoins. I speculate the real reason was really because they needed some time to replenish their hot wallet. However, I am always skeptical, so you might be correct hehehe. The important thing, they were not hacked and they are not insolvent.",

      "body": "Quite a reasonable decision from the position of binance. Like any exchanger, they have always had a fixed rate for a withdrawal fee of bitcoin (any cryptocurrency). Normally, binance made good money on every transaction, as their flat rate always exceeded the bitcoin's network current fees. Now, the rules have changed and binance doesn't want to pay extra out of pocket for users because their standard commission no longer covers the cost of the commission. I think that the pause was necessary for the management to discuss the increase in commissions and determine the price, as well as for the technical implementation of this. But why was it paused a second time? They didn't raise the price again..If it is very necessary, then the output of other cryptocurrencies has not changed, which means that binance is operating normally (with the exception of btc).That's interesting to know. Was it only binance that raised the commissions, or did other exchangers follow suit as well?",

Generally the withdrawal fees of exchange for Bitcoin is higher and even with the current state they still can make profits because they process the withdrawals in batches so charging 25 from one user snd combine it with 25 or 50 will nowhere near even if they pay fee required for next block so this is something related to their cap fee and they will work it out soon and resume the withdrawals.But why the hell the fee has been pushed to this much.",

The good news is that they've integrated and allowed LN. With this, the fees aren't that much but will it cater all of our transactions if majority jumps into it?",
