At the same time, though, he said climbing to the top 1% of crypto takes an \"extraordinary effort,\" work, and knowledge of the market...cont.",

Meanwhile like CZ said, you just need to buy and hold bitcoin and basically do nothing and you will still get profit at the end. Just know when are the bullish season and the bearish season and time when will you buy and sell properly. Those who want to indulge themselves in altcoins are hoping for immediate profit while bitcoin will give you profit but it will take quite a long time. If you do not want to get stressed and is patient enough then buy bitcoin and hold.",

Not many have the time to do that because they are working in their real life job, going to school, taking care of kids, etc.But crypto is much more unforgiving than the stock market, which trades only 6 to 7 hours a day, allowing you take a long break everyday, and closes on the weekend.But crypto is trading 24 hours a day 7 days a week and anything can happen at anytime. You have no time to take a break.If your shitcoin tanks at 2am in the morning you will have no time time to react because you are fast asleep. If your shitcoin tanks at 1pm while you are working you have no time to react because you are busy at your job or school.Not many have the time and technical knowledge to research thousands of different altcoins to make \"good picks\" among the ocean of shitcoins, then have to constantly monitor what they are all doing day and night. To me there are no good altcoin picks because they are all garbage. If you don't believe me just ask CZ. Shitcoiners are always juggling several even dozens of shitcoins at a time, as all the influencers tell you to do in order to \"diversify.\"And if you do that I can guarantee you will have no life. But what you will have is an incredible amount of stress and anxiety....and most likely a lot of losses.Just buy and hold bitcoin and you don't have to worry about anything else and have plenty of free time to enjoy your life.",

Most of their prices pump, and within a few minutes or hours, they have started dumping. So you would have to be alert all through because a few minutes of distraction can make you lose a fortune. CZ spoke the Gospel truth. But people are mainly influenced by greed, and others don't have enough information, hence they still invest in shitcoin. If you consider the risk involved in buying these, you will appreciate the peace of mind that Bitcoin investors enjoy.",

Bitcoin is the OG and father of all crypto currencies. It's a coin in which you can invest, sit back and relax and be confident that the value of your capital will grow while the rest of the cryptocurrencies are mostly a gamble compared to Btc. One slightly bad thing about Bitcoin is that it can't grow as much as it grew years ago but other cryptocurrencies have the chance to exponentially grow.",
