Here on bitcointalk forum, you wont find much ppl dealing with altcoins such as waves (in your case), hence less replies.Quote from: MarquiseMuseum on February 07, 2023, 02:55:43 AMPolice didnt accept my charges Most polices dont even understand how crypto and blockchain works, so they'll most likely ignore you as this thing is just beyond their heads, lol. They are just rote learners of old schools.",

And, although I've kept my WAVES for longer than I should have, I still sold them many years ago so I can't tell more.Quote from: MarquiseMuseum on January 21, 2023, 07:51:24 PMI have reported him to SEC months ago no action, the dude needs to go.I don't know where Sasha resides in, especially now because of the war, but I don't think that SEC can do much outside of USA. And the world is bigger than that.Quote from: MarquiseMuseum on February 07, 2023, 02:55:43 AMBut the options are fading.I would try my luck on Twitter, as already said, and maybe I would also try my luck in that altcoins area too.",
