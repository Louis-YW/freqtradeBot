I like the way our people are sharing information in this local board to educate people in this local board not to allow any stranger or scammers to collect what belong to them than to always identify all those evil people in the community.If scammers succeeded to gain access to your wallet, they will empty your coins in a way you will like to end your precious life and you will be thinking how to start from square one again and that one we not be our portion,but we have to be very careful with those cheap transaction in the exchange market.",

As for the FTX format,it isn't something that is new because I have seen a scenario, where someone took advantage of a scammed victim as an opportunity to also scam that victim and it worked.This is why we need to be very careful and vigilant when we are online and never to trust anyone  that we don't know and not to also click on any link that you are not expecting. Always put it in your mind that your safety is in your hands and scammers are around looking for a way to scam you.",

Poverty and quest to eliminate poverty go actually fit cause people fall for these cheap scam and I agree with you absolutely @mate2237 but on the other hand, I think say government  dey try reach some limits and na out top  representatives dey embezzle the small ones wey for reach the poor masses like for instance with the case of the palliative distributed during the covid and how them embezzle  these things and I been also hear and watch videos of some ware houses uncovered even after the covid-19 and that's a clear evidence say at some point, government dey disburse, but na our top representatives dey hold this things back.",

Well, it's just for every crypto user to be very diligent, and before they engage in anything they are aware would compromise their security, let them be sure to cross-check the things over and over again, making sure everything is accurate. Just like some sites that get recreated by hackers, everything will just look the same, but there's an error somewhere, and if you are not very careful to check the site, the person can mistakenly log their details into the fake site.",

Even if someone has been duped, it is never too late for him or her to learn from the encounter and take precautions to protect oneself in the future. And we can do this by holding the criminals accountable, since they frequently operate with liberty because they know that many victims are too humiliated or ashamed to speak up. However, if we may start to shed a light on the problem, we can foster a culture in which fraudsters are not accepted. This may necessitate legislative reforms as well as greater police service.",
