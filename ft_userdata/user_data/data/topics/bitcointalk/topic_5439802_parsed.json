Your contribution is highly appreciated. Thank you.If you're using LED as data transmitter your receiver would probably not be LED as it's light emitter rather than receiver. You could build something that receive the data from the LED light and translate the data back into something human can understand.Â Google about gadgets that can translate data from LED back into something readable/understandable.",

Our computers might be watching us through the screen, and sending the streaming video and data over the Net through a back door.To see what? A bunch of perverts jerking off? Lol. OP seems to think LED's are reliable for data transfer, firstly, we already have fiber optics, they use light to transfer data over the net. Imagine sending some data from an LED to a receiver 40 meters away, they would essentially receive less than 5% of the data. Lasers on the other hand are different but they are not good enough.Data transmission should be done via radio waves, wi-fi networks etc.",
