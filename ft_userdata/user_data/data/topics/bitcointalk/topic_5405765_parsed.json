I mean any developer will know that you wouldn't know half the stuff you do, or at the very least wouldn't be as efficient without StackExchange. I understand StackExhcange has now developed into a wider community, but that place is like knowledge central. They have a decent way of going about things from a moderation stand point, to suit their needs. So, you generally get well constructed answers, which conform to their sort of standardised approach. Ultimately though, Bitcointalk can't be compared with StackExchange, and the same goes for most of the sites listed here. They appeal to different needs, and users. Bitcointalk I'd say is the best community spirit, only probably rivalled by Reddit, but then Reddit's internal systems let it down hugely for me, and its community generally encourages lower, off topic, and more funny responses than here. I'm not going to knock any of them. They're all popular for a reason.",

If we are talking about Telegram groups that belong to big cryptocurrency exchanges, then the first thing you will come across is a scammer PMing you for this or that reason. But you are free to create your own communities, invite whoever you want, set your own rules, and apply them in practice. After that you can discuss whatever you want with people you know and/or trust. Telegram groups can be invite-only, so that helps in keeping douchebags out.
