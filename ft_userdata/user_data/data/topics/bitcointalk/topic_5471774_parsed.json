He didnt even bothered on telling on whats the use case of this project and come in mind that he had been talking about having no funds on getting listed on which does simply imply on how shit this project is.@OP, dont expect that you would really be getting even $1 on just simply posting up CA and your TG group. People on this forumarent that dumb enough for us to believe with those words and blindly just investing into your 1-minute creation kind of meme project. LOOOOOL!",

However, it's not costing them that much in generating this one and they just have to try it again until some investors will be fooled and believes them.Anyway, I am not one of them.",

In fact more scams and useless tokens there will be, it just speaks about the freedom you get with cryptocurrencies. I would be more worried if there would be less of them.Think anything you want from millions of scam and meme tokens, they still are feature and a proof of working platform, not an undesirable quality.",

The season is now holidays and some people, and the Halloween punch is a trend, so scammers create a token and pump the price. You will find that it is an excellent opportunity to make some quick profit, but you will be the one who is being scammed.We have some tokens in similar seasons and they were all scams, such as the Squid game, which coincided with the end of the series.How a Squid Game Crypto Scam Got Away With Millions Don't trust the green candles they promise you.",

That's true this is decentralization and everyone is free to make such projects and even the most nonsense and useless ones. That's why we can see them keep coming no mater what happens.Whether we're in a bull or bear run, everything comes naturally to this market with such types of projects as this. A few hours from now, the name of the project will be remembered after a year again.",
