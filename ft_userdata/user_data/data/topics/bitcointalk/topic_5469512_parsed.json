We are ideologically opposed to fiat and envision a world where people only use crypto. We want everytransaction in the global economy to go through our platform.

There's no page which give information about website/purchase process, such as fees and minimum confirmation requirement.2. That is really good thank you. We will change the X to a minus sign and QTY to Quantity. We used a server-side session-based cart because that's what I was familiar with. 3. When we go live we plan to use 6 to 8 confirmations and use estimatesmartfee to calculate the fee. We are still researching the best practices. If you have any advice on this it would be greatly appreciated. We also plan to take a percentage on every transaction (maybe 1% to 5%). We will add an informational page explaining this all.",

Of course fiat representation should be included because it is a fairly stable price benchmark to see the true value of goods, and this will make it easier for customers who shop to know the real price, price fluctuations in bitcoin affect and it is quite annoying to calculate the value of an item.",

      "body": "Thank you all for the support and feedback.We have deployed hyprmall version 0.1.1, incorporating the first round of suggestions we have read here.Changes:    - Added currency converter. Select your preferred currency from the navbar dropdown.    - Added basic about page regarding hyprmall and fees    - Various UI fixes        - Improved navbar        - Fixed cart icons        - Dashboard updates        - Added shipping to dashboard        - Improved error handling on all forms    - Updated our session handling code. Removed our Redis dependency. This should increase security.Just to be clear, hyprmall is for both buyers and sellers.1. Buyers deposit their coins into hyprmall. This is a transaction on the blockchain.2. When they purchase an item from a seller, the buyer is debited and the seller is credited on ourinternal accounting system. This is not a transaction on the blockchain and is instant. Hyprmall takes a 1% fee here.3. Sellers can then withdraw the credits they have earned from selling items to an external wallet or exchange.This is a transaction on the blockchain. (Note: Any user can withdraw credits from their own account).We are working our way through all of these great suggestions.Quote from: SFR10 on October 07, 2023, 01:31:56 PMQuote from: hyprmall on October 07, 2023, 12:43:39 PM1.

Currently we are taking 1% of all transactions. There is currently no protection for the merchants.7. There is no protection other than reviews. We will shut down obvious scammers. We will add postal tracking codes and optional escrow to ensure goods are delivered. 8. Theoretically anywhere that can receive mail. It will be at the buyers/sellers discretion when it comes to customs.9. No identity verification.

We plan to add Monero next.We are not sure, hopefully, we can make money from the transaction fees. If we can't run it ourselves we will try and sell it or release it open source. We will try. The way the credit/debit system works is prohibitive to guest accounts. However, perhaps this approach is antiquated.Thanks again.The hyprmall team",
