That's indeed some much-needed and appreciated relief we are getting right now after months of constant extreme fear and red candles.How long we will continue to rally or how sustainable this rally is, is quite debate-able but we should just get a bit happy for the moment now, we don't get such times always in crypto and especially after the years past few months. Also, we are not having any significant planned economic event next month as there is no FOMC to raise rates. So we may have some space left on this rally…",

There is no bear market on the horizon either. This is the 4th drop after the rise fails to go above the resistance level and that makes is the 4th time people call for a bear market where it clearly is a sideways market.",

So we may have some space left on this rally…The market is nearing a gradual recovery for now, there are some coins starting to rise and finding their best, although not so maximal at standard prices, bitcoin is the most eagerly awaited for future recovery, since the correction started taking place after the new ATH achievement in 2021.The most appropriate or profitable now is to make a monthly investment scheme, meaning that we see opportunities in the short term for bitcoin, because the prolonged rally has not been able to provide guarantees, so to maximize it it is necessary to do a monthly scheme, so that the investments made can be utilized in the near future",

Generally, even if the daily candles close at higher levels we still need a long-term signal for it. What's going be happened in the next few months can be very important for the market because most experts leave the bearish season is going to last longer.",

Because no one knows. It's true, this is pretty usual in bear markets. A few recent examples being +33% in April 2018 and +21% in July 2018, as well as +30% in January 2020 before dumping 60%. I'm also not suggesting that price will go lower, as I'm inclined to believe it won't (but for completely different reasons), it's more so that having a reasonable monthly gain of +16% after dropping over 60% within 3 months is kind of normal.",

Of course we wanted to see the price growing in the next couple of months. But if we are going to based on pure speculation like this one, hmm, might be better to not expect something big so that we will not be disappointed at the time. Maybe we have hit the all time lows already, so that is good enough for me. But to say that we are in rally wherein it's obvious there is none, it's better just to see how the market will progress and again, don't anticipate something big as we are still in the bear market.",

I get that people may or may dislike the fact that it didn't reach 10k. Liked is easy to explain because people want it to go up, but dislike is a bit more hidden which is the fact that it would take a while before people could realize they can't buy it that cheap again, hence why they wanted it to be cheaper.This is why I do not see how that would not matter, I believe that it would be going up soon but that doesn't change the fact that even if it goes up, we could always keep on buying even at higher prices, because having more bitcoins could never hurt.",

This isn't 100% but I think this is only 10 percent for us to say that we are now out of the bear market. We already broke 19, 20, and 21k but the price is now staying at 22 and 23k levels.Once we touch 24k then I believe that it will easily continue to 25k but that was only 25 to 30 percent of the \"we are out of the bear market\" meter, you are saying. I think 100 percent can still take a long time to happen.",

But still we are still struggling to just keep our nose above the $20k, and there are huge mental barrier around the $25k-$28k. So as what the title says here, biggest monthly gain? no, not going to happen, we will continue to fight $20k and until we reach $30k, there will be no movement next month or even up to December of this year.",

But first, $25,000, but then again, we almost reach that price though, we go to as high as $24,000, but that growth was not sustainable and now we hear about US, China tensions over Taiwan. So when we thought that we can go high and shows some signs and moving to the next key resistance, the price goes down again.",
