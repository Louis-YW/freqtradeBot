Does anyone know the reason?",

It's a huge risk for sharing free download link like this book without a confirmed permission or being authorized by the author. Once that author officially authorize you for that, then it's good. But if not, you could be in trouble in the future once the author finds out.",

The book is indeed valuable but I think it already loses its value the moment you share it here for free. The price of the book was only 18 dollars anyway and I think that was not heavy compared to the quality and the knowledge that you will be getting on this book. Once you master it, it will now be easy for you to earn money through bitcoin and you can easily recover the money you spend here. Quote from: Cryptornd on July 15, 2022, 07:45:30 AMThis was given to me by famous bitcoin traveler Hitesh ( paco de la ) As a gift. so i made it a re gift here .If the guy was a famous bitcoiner then everything that he gave to you has a sentimental value so you shouldn't gave it away just like that. There must be free bitcoin books out there and that's the one that you should share here and not those who are paid ones because that's kinda illegal.",
