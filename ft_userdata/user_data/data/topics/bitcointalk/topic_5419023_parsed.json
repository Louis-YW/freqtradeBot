At the same time, the payload delivered still has banks from Italy, UK, Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, US, and Australia in its target list.https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/the-attack-of-the-droppersAnd so I urge everyone to report, and if you have installed one of them, it's better to check everything, change your password because you just don't know when this criminals are going to steal from your wallet.",

They need to find a way to stay safe regardless and being security consciousness would help to prevent majority of phishing attempts.People do not value data much and easily allow multiple permissions just to use a game or live streaming app risking their privacy and funds.Quote from: stompix on November 01, 2022, 09:46:40 AMI would advise against holding any sum in BTC you can't afford to lose on your phone, it's more like a lottery, in 99% of the cases you will not get infected or lose your money but when you do, you will lose everything. And 100% of people who use mobile devices as a means of storage hope they would not be the 1% who gets ripped off.I personally keep a little amount for daily transactions on my mobile device, but no more than that. The frequency of transactions I make determine how much I leave in an address and how well I secure it.",

Also going for iOS, it is still important to know much more about malware and how to avoid, although people that do not know much about online attacks can be more favoured by having iOS devices, but we should know that people will still want to go for free apps. Some apps are just free, online wallets apps are supposed to be free, or not free on iOS?Although, Android is not recommended but no cheap easy alternative like Linux on computers. I have used Android for years and nothing happened, if the source of malware are known, they are still easy to avoid. Example is the Google PlayStore that is the den of malware apps. Although, I may still use it for well known apps like while downloading wallets like Trustwallet for testing (that wallet is close source and not recommended) because the fake ones are easy to spot while just having few downloads, but the original one have millions of downloads, but just still best going for downloading apps from the official websites.

With safe practice and having extra layer of protection like 2FA or best with multisig can be helpful on online devices. Experienced people have different approaches about having wallet on online device which can still have good security. But having a single key wallet on online devices without no 2FA on another device, that is dangerous. For single key wallets, cold storage is the best, or getting a reputed hardware wallet.",

At the end of the day as long as you can verify the developer or the apk before installing it then it should be better than just blindly downloading and installing it.
