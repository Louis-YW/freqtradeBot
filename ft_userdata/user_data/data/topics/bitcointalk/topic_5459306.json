  "content": "I would like to take 12 Bitcoin seed words and deterministically derive a PGP private public key pairHow can I do do this? I'd like to have a tool, which I can then use on a Tails OS not connected to the internet.BackgroundI want to use BIP 85 to dervie all my important secrets including wallets and passwords. BIP 85 takes your Bitcoin seed and dervies seeds for child wallets.It is easy to dervie the child wallet seed from the parent wallet seed. However you can't realisticly dervive the parent seed from the child seed.I use the parent seed for my cold storage and the child seed for my mobile wallet.As a result I only have to back up one seed for two wallets.",

I don't need BIP 85 support to go from the child seed to a PGP key pair.Quote from: vv181 on July 10, 2023, 12:45:34 PMDo note that I just search around about your use case and found that repo.

The seed-derived numbers might be 2048 bit long, but the possible space will be only 2^136, so there's a possibility for optimization of the prime factorization algorithm.I think that on practice you'll be relatively safe, because cracking such system would still require knowledge and effort, so if you don't have powerful enemies, your RSA keys probably won't be cracked. But it's better to always practice strong security and never grow overconfident.",

Maybe you could estimate there are X prime numbers lower than the number Y. The Bitcoin seed gives you X. You estimate Y. From Y you search the next prime number, which you can use for RSA.Would this work?",
