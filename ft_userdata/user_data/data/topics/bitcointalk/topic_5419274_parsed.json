We still have the whole 2023, for a long and hard grind and we still might see some altcoin projects not surviving or barely arrived, -95% down or even the most is 99%.And so we will have to wait in 2024, at least that year we will see the catalyst for the whole crypto market to go on a bull season, it's the bitcoin block halving.",

And all of those altcoins that you're holding or looking at its gains or losses, if they didn't moved that much then it means that we're not yet out of the bear. It's simple as that and expect more declines to come because this is the time of uncertainty.",

But I would say that crypto is much volatile and it will hit very hard by the bear market. So if by chance those market are bouncing, maybe crypto is not. And if we are going to look at the historical past, then we might say that we are still in the bear market and this could continue till the first quarter of 2024, or before the Bitcoin block halving. And probably after that activity, the market will slowly bounce and then leading up to the end of the year for a full recovery and bull market.",

We've only been in bear season for a year, which means if history repeats itself, we have over 2 years left for bear season to end. Plus with the current economic crisis, if history doesn't repeat itself, bear season won't end either, and as information released by the Fed yesterday, they will continue to raise interest rates in 2023 until inflation returns to normal (<2%). This means we will have a more intense 2023 than now, brace yourself for bigger storms instead of expecting a bull season.",

Many have asked when the bear market will go away the obvious answer is we never know but the situation is indeed at its toughest unless they hold on until the bulls come. But don't expect it anytime soon.Since the decline from ATH we had to take a heavy blow where the market situation couldn't recover again, this is what we saw the reaction there even the bears still kept quiet and didn't leave, but for me the strong answer is to invest in important coins and wait until bulls come a few years away.",

It is useless at such times to dream of the all-time-highs but to cope with the stress by buying at the lower prices.As far as bitcoin's price is concerned it is still in the downtrend in the 20k-ish USD range. Buy if you can and if you have hope. It can happen that the price drops even more, in which case you should wait if you have already bought a lot.",

And after that, the price could be on another sideways although majority might believed that at least in December we will see some jump. But for me, the max price that we can get is around $22k.Quote from: Mr. Magkaisa on November 03, 2022, 05:44:34 PMAlthough the period of the bear market is not an easy time for us to earn income, instead it requires sufficient skills and knowledge in performing trading tactics accurately, not even 100% but at least 75-80 At least % strategy to get profit here in crypto trading.Or if you don't want to complicate things on your part, why not buy cheap altcoins in the top 10 and just HODL. Of course, if you are a trader, you can mix and match certain strategies that will fit your trading strategy. But for those who are not traders and wanted risk free environment, then simply buying and accumulating is the best thing to do in a market cycle like this.",

How can this mean the bearish market is over?  As long as there is no significant change in Bitcoin price, the bearish season still continues. If we learn the bearish and bullish cycle, this bearish will continue until 2023. We only can hope that the bearish ends after the next BTC halving in 2024.

We've been seeing a lot of stagnant markets recently and it's evidenced by constant back and forth in the same price range for almost all crypto.

Better to prepare a lot of bags in the next few months IMO, because this stagnance might mean something.",

If you look at the price and not realize that it has been the same price for a while now and that’s a good thing, and you could have accumulated so much during this time and that’s a benefit to you, then you do not know how to invest.The best kind of investment is to wait for it to get to a point where you would do fine, and I personally believe that we are doing fine, if that’s not the case then I do not know what to do and that would be hard to figure out.",
