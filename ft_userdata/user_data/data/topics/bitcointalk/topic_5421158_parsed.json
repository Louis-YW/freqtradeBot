Why would anyone will just agree to post their signed message and especially their wallet address here. Can you give more reasons? Well, about having the oldest mined bitcoin here seems like doesn't exist already, not unless its theymos, or other OG here. But i rarely see OG members here so i don't think there still kne here.",
