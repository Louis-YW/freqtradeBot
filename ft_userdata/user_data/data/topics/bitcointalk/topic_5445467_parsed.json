Every new government has a target on where to be channeling resources of the country for their selfish interest that appeared as national interest.There's already a lot of topics like this in here, but from your post is just simply saying that every new government always have the same intention in the position they have. Power to do things for their own benefit but not for the country is the common thing that most corrupted government officials do. We citizen of the country should know better who'd really do well in running things and to lead people in the country so we should vote wisely who done a lot or served for the country for a long time. Not only when the election comes, action arrives which people think they really help people for a long time. If you only know how the election went in my country where you can see some artists, singers and dancer who are part in the government system. The worst scenario is that they've actually won because people knew them from their talents. Which means is not only from the government fault by the citizen itself.QuoteBut government was suppose to watch over it's citizens welfares and development, creates jobs opportunities, improves banking system, open sea ports and airports for importation of foreign goods, increase security strength, eliminates corruption. That's a change we desire.These should be the things that the government should normally do for the growth of country. A lot of projects here got cancelled due to lack of funds from the government. So where did all the funds went? Of course from the pocket of the corrupted government officials. They act like those funds are their income from serving but those funds are the taxes of the people who work hard everyday. Imagine working for a month just to get your income deducted by taxes then those funds got corrupted? Vote wisely for the sake of your future.",

Or the citizens of the government?If big business can make slaves of its workers, and then pays government to help them do it, what kind of a government or country will it really be?Consider all the banking in the US (and around the world) that is failing these days. Banking is a farce as far as doing good for the people. It only serves itself and government who helps it.",

While campaigning, there are so many contestants and that is why they do manifesto so that they can tell the citizens what exactly they have as their plan if being elected, but in some countries, the citizens are not that serious and did not know their rights and as a result of that, they follow the politicians that offer more money during campaign which is the main cause of the bad governance because the politicians will have to recover all what they have spent before they think of working for the citizens.",

However, it is important to have mechanisms in place, such as a council or other forms of accountability, to help prevent corruption and ensure that those in power are held responsible for their actions.",

Due to which the government gives false comfort to the people and takes power of the country and does not fulfill the promises made by the people. I would like to highlight some parts of my own country. The government has been in power for 15 years only by forcefully destroying the rights of the people and giving the most benefits to the people of their own party. So corrupt people exist in all countries, but my goal is that after the end of power, the government should change, then the people will think about the people and raise their hands towards the development of the country. The number of unemployment of the people of the country is increasing overnight which will be a huge hurdle in our country later on.Quote from: JamesBorn on March 19, 2023, 06:52:11 AMBut government was suppose to watch over it's citizens welfares and development, creates jobs opportunities, improves banking system, open sea ports and airports for importation of foreign goods, increase security strength, eliminates corruption.
