  "content": "The forum i propose is a ground where one is free to ask questions, being it a question that can help guide in your growing and posting strength in the forum. I was just curious, ¬†if its possible for a post topic to be droped in two different board that states same actions but it can be related to by other user in this different board. Resons why?¬†¬† I recently drop a thread Economics board but it came to my thoughts that the thread is about the by country in particular so why not drop it there in my local board So i later moved the thread to my local Nigerian board. But am still curious to know if its possible for ¬†a thread to be in two different board which people can relate to them very well.",

Except if its posted on local boards which is also translated to board local language. So your proposal falls under the exception of this rule so it's okay as long it was translated.Well, at least this is my understanding on that specific rule.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0",

If one thread were a translation of the other thread, I don't think that will be an issue. But to do a direct copy and past of one's thread in repetition? What for? Again, if one isn't certain of where to post a thread it's better to ask mods to move it to appropriate board.",

I believe one best way you can convey a message in a post by not duplicating it, is to write the posts from two angles, with two points relating to the board you intend to post in. I.e., create two topics and relate it to different scenarios that fit the board. I have never tried it, but I doubt there's any rule to stop you from trying it.",

Definitely not allowed, unless all Nigerian users can't reach a thread on the global board. What would you like to expect from creating two threads with the same content? In essence, you'll only get identical responses. Also this adds to the negative presumptions from other users.",

Don't be too scared, even your thread will get deleted by the moderators, you wouldn't get banned because this rule isn't crucial like committing plagiarism. If your thread doesn't get deleted, then it's fine.After all just give an update whether it's get deleted or not, so anyone can learn it in the future.",

You can't create a double thread all in the name of you want to pass information to a number of users, that's why we have different boards where you can appropriately post a thread to, but having a duplicate no matter how is what can be regarded as spamming, bugging the forum with unsolicited threads or posts, but instead of doing this, i think there's a way to get over this by making reference and providing a link to it while making a post under a related discussion matter.",

You can add local terms when posting on the Nigerian board and also add links to both posts for awareness.Simply just translating is enough to be not categorized as duplicate thread since it was already modified. Also moving an english topic on a local board from global board without even translating it defeats the purpose of moving it to your local board since some of the user won‚Äôt understand it if they didn‚Äôt know much english language.But in general, posting same topic on local board and global board is not against the rule since your target audience is different.",

Is there as a way to make money by gambling? can be interpreted in a million ways and posted as million threads by different users.",
