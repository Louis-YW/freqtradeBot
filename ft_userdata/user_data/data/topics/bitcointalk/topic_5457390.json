I was looking at using a Linksys EA3500-NP configured as a wireless bridge.Unstable wifi can cause the miner to stop mining but if you can keep it stable and low ping then it won't affect your mining shares.About the Linksys EA3500-NP, it looks like a router but if it supports a wireless bridge then you can connect it through wifi.Why did you choose this router instead of buying wifi extender with an ethernet port?",

Yes, the EA3500-NP will work as a wireless bridge, but I doubt the profitability of the project.",
