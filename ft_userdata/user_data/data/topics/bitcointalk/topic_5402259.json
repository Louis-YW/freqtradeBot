Not a privat key?the notes have a nfc chip that works as a second key for multisig - after the date specified - that key will no longer be needed. so if someone had the user set key they could take the funds even if they did not have the note. if you \"re-keyed\" the user key than you are fine after that date that is how I understand it at least.",

      "body": "Thanks for posting @cygan! I forgot too add here QuoteWhat does claim before mean? Does they expire? Not a privat key?@MoparMiningLLC has this exactly right. Expire means the multisig downgrades from 2-2 (user key on note, encrypted manufacturer key on note) to just the user key. This is important, as if you have not re-keyed the note at this time a previous holder can rush to spend from the script. If you store the cash for a while, you probably want to re-key. (if not loaded originally by someone trusted, e.g. family). If you hold in your (physical) wallet for spending soon, you're probably fine to leave the note as is.",
