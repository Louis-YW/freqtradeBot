  "content": "There is something I would want to understand about people they taught trading is all about just funding their accounts and start the journey the way its. Why do I brought up this case is that, a friend of mine who have been trading on binary using Demo account to trade for about 2 year, reading all forms of technical books and watching lots of videos online from which he had made an increase started building the account from bonuses given to him he would build time 5 of the initial fake funds and he would be happy to start improvement.Reaching sometimes, he thought is now a professional who can control the real account, he went ahead and take a loan of $1.5k converting to our local currency then was about 1m. During the lockdown period he took the loan hoping to pay as we got released from the covid-19 but sorry he couldn't make it to trade out same $1.5k instead ended up emptying his account.So my question is; does those who started trading on binary faces this same issues?And if yes how much have you lost so far?How long do you think to learn to be perfect in trading generally both binary options and spot trading or any other trading?Please share as I almost fall victim of joining him but he lost made me to lost interest.",

It is pure gambling, not trading. Scalping, day and swing trading are the basic types of trading, while arbitrage may be included too among. But binary is not trading but gambling.I have read some people that gambled with binary and earn money, but anyone that wants to trade and not gamble should choose from the basic types of trading.To start trading, learning it? Use the amount of money you can afford to lose. If possible you can even use less amount. That would be better. If you have learnt how to trade, still continue using the amount of money you can afford to lose until you have far more profitable trades.",

      "body": "^ Its still considered as a trading and we do really have that binary options trading but i do consider it as a gambling.It do look like scalping but on a very active manner since this would be talking a minuteor seconds trading which we know that there's no strategy that you could really be able to apply on a short time duration which is something that not suggested for someone to deal off with.On the thing where people do have thoughts on making trades directly is that they do believe that they could make easy money with it but once reality do slap into your face then you would definitely be able to realize on whats the true experience when doing up trades.",

It sometimes gives you a signal when to trade, it was just like there is a bot guiding you on how to trade and you are not afraid to make decisions unlike if you are already dealing with your hard-earned money. Because at this point, many things will change and your emotions will also increase making you unable to decide the right thing which is mostly ended up emptying your wallet. Trading in general is really risky. And there is one reason why most traders have failed even though they have experience and that is emotions. I believe your friend OP struggled to control it.",

Look at the IQ option as a sample you only have two options to choose from if the movement is going to high or low.Unlike in spot trading, you can use the limit order and set it to any price you want. You can also avoid your losses in spot trading by using stop limit order. That is a big disadvantage of the Binary option. I also have experience with binary but I never made any profit with them except on their referral commission.",

There's no perfect in trading, everything is on trial and error, and gain experience because I believed as they say that experience is the best teacher in a good trader.  Copy trading might be worth considering while you're new in this field, but only an amount that you can afford to lose.",

With just simple words about telling that it's from there and they're doing their living from it, it sounds normal for them as if the activity is indeed too easy to be made.",

The basic rule is to only invest/trade what you can afford to lose, failing to understand that simple idea already shows a lot imo. Trading is a trial and error imo, no matter the amount of prior study you do you'd still end up getting hit somewhere down the road, so be prepared to lose a lot.

The demo account is only to learn about the features that exist on the exchange and success on the demo account cannot be a reference that has made a successful trader, because trading with a demo account there is no pressure because when you lose it will not affect anything, but your friends patient enough to be able to use a demo account for 2 years.Binary options like gambling is better to trade right away even with very limited capital like $10 but we can learn how to the pressure and study the market well and spot trading is better for beginners",

The pressure is so much higher on them which makes them make worse decissions. Things are worse when it comes to cryptocurrency markets because of the pump and dump nature of them. All speculations and analysis become worthless when the altcoin market is heavily manipulated.These demo accounts are also acting like double edge swords. People sometimes enter the market at a good time (like the cryptocurrency market during 2017) and make random \"bets\" that happen to be successful. Consequently they gain a false sense of expertise that leads them into making a bigger investment. But by that time the market trend has changed and since these people have no experience they don't know what to do under this new market conditions and lose a lot of money (like the cryptocurrency market during 2018-2019).",

I once told my friend and they were interested but they didn't want to hold on and right now they stopped.
