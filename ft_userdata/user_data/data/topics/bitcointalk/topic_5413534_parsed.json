Its not as if the bank will technically reatricy out of thin air which we dont know the whole story.We cant also be sure that even she has bitcoin the hospital will accept her payment via crypto. But of course there are others way on how to cash out aside from bank. Atleast there are some remittances or any third party in their country for that (I assume).Im not sure whether it should be blame on her too or to bitcoin but maybe her situation is really tight thats wjy she resort to that. She doesnt thinking straight cause she knows that there is no turning back from that and she is just worried on her sister bu its not right to use force like that.",

Be your own bank as crypto enthusiasts say and there is a way how to cash out your bitcoin to fiat without centralized platforms but in a tricky way. Bitcoin does not have a problem, it is on a government centralization.

But using a noncustodial wallet and a decentralized exchange make it not to be possible because you will have the full control of your money. No central authority is involved. I always hate to see people that did not commit crime and have their funds frozen.",

Some people are forced to do this stuff when if only she had bitcoins, she wouldn't have put her life in danger or anyone else. she could just withdraw wherever she wants.Bitcoin can help but only if people knows the underlying meaning of the saying \"Not your keys, not your coins\".If they buy Bitcoin, store it on centralized exchanges, they don't actually own Bitcoin. They don't own key so they don't actually own coins. Exchanges own it if if exchanges reject to approve user withdrawal requests, they can steal your Bitcoin. It's similar to banks.If people use non custodial wallet, they can make any transaction when they want to do that. Miners on the network will confirm their transactions with priority for highest fee rate at top of mempool. Fortunately, nobody can steal Bitcoin in your non custodial wallet or prevent you to make your transaction.",

Might not be related to Bitcoin, but back then I got my Paypal frozen and was given the usual 180 days before I can do anything. Good thing it was just few quarters and I did not bother to contact them anymore since resending my ID and identity did not budge it.This time I have separate wallet for Bitcoin that will be used for purchase and other ones that is entirely for holding.",

And banks has to follow such regulations because if everyone wants to withdraw their money from bank there will be actually no money for everyone to withdraw and the question raised is what actually make sense. Why we need to trust the paper issued by banks to have value and we have to follow lot of procedures to handle our money?But as of sudden bitcoin can't change everything, first of all the payment infrastructure is needed then only we can pay by bitcoins or any other cryptos.",

Since I came to discovered potential Bitcoin, I prefer to put my money on Bitcoin than putting all money to bank because anything can happen to the bank that will make the bank not to work through out the week, which such thing cannot happen to Bitcoin.",

I hope you have the keys to the 80% of your money in crypto, otherwise it is better you use the bank.",

As far as I know, for now, the DEX I have used also pays directly to your Bank account and we are back to the same problem except you know someone that is willing to pay you by hand directly. Yep P2P is the option, don't forget they can convert into gift card too. The point is don't fund most of your money on banks, just send some portion you really want to use, if the banks froze your money then you can try other banks.Honestly Bitcoin created isn't to kill Banks and overtake fiat, but the aim is just to become alternative payment. As long as the government didn't ban Bitcoin usage, it's fine to pay something with Bitcoin if the sellers accept it.",

      "body": "While I generally agree with the op, there are certain nuances to it. Firstly, how and where a person is storing BTC matters. If it's a non-custodial wallet, that's fantastic, and there's indeed no authority or company that can demand anything from you when you want to access your funds. But if it's a centralized service, your funds can also be frozen, access can be restricted, demands can be put forth. Secondly, as long as you're storing your own BTC, it's all good and you're enjoying access to your coins. But there aren't many places in the world where you'd be able to use these coins directly. This woman wanted the money for her sister's cancer treatment, and I bet the clinic doesn't accept Bitcoin. In that case, a person still needs to get fiat, and that's likely to involve banks, centralized crypto exchanges, and/or ATM which might also ask for documents and get a hefty fee.So, unfortunately, keeping the money in Bitcoin for emergencies also have its downsides. Not to mention that the price can just fall by a lot, and suddenly you have way less money for the emergency than you used to have.",
