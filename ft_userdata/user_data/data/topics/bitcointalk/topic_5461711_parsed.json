  "content": "I wants to share one of my stories where some people try to scam my Discord server. At first, i need to give a quick intro about my work. I am a full time community manager in discord and i am working with a project where i am the head moderator. Now lets get to the main story.There were some members who were actively making posts on our discord server about hiring moderators in some kind of NFT-related discord server. At first, i thought it was just a spam message and start ignoring it. After few days one guy messaged my inbox by saying he is very impressed with my work managing discord server so now he wants to hire me into their discord server as a community moderator. For being a professional discord community moderator i show interest and start asking about his project. In the meanwhile, he invite in into a group he created where his so called boss wants to talk with me. After doing some general conversation he said he is interested and wants to take an interview of me before making any job contract. So we start talking through voice call and he asked me some basic moderation related questions. It was just like a professional job interview and there was no way to be vigilant till this points. After the interview, he offered me a handsome amount of money that i can not reject so i accepted his offer. He sent a url and told me i need to fill up this form right now with my details before we can make the contract. That URL looks pretty normal to me so i clicked it and start filling the form.  But when i tried to click submit button it written there is a problem with the submit button so drag the url of the submit button to your browser's bookmark bar to submit the form. When i drag that button i have noticed there is a script written in there. In the meanwhile, i was still connected with that guy in voice call and he was constantly pushing me to do the work fast. I disconnected from that call and delete cookies from my browser. After some investigation, i found out that there was a javascript written in there which will give that scammer access to my browser and my discord account. Furthermore i found out they are a group of people who hack Moderators account into a discord server and post fake airdrop promotion to scam people. Crypto space fast-paced technological innovation to bring simplicity and add more security to human life. So scammers are also finding new ways to scam people. Do not fall for the same kind of trap if you are a moderator in any crypto project. You might lose your server and job as well.",

My brother also had a similar experience where he was asked to submit some country IDs, a resident permit, and a utility bill before he could be accepted to work just as a telegram moderator, but he was wise enough not to submit those documents, and later it was discovered that those guys were just scammers. Who knows what they were going to use those IDs for? Everyone who is just into any online-related work or investment really needs to take their security seriously; otherwise, it can ruin their reputation, depending on what the case is, or cause them to lose their assets.",

The victim was a professional gamer and was not aware of the security risk from crypto-related projects. He was lucky that he uses VMware to run that games on his computer. He later found that wasn't any games instead it was an application that can inject malware into the system and gain access to that system.",

But I'm happy you discovered quickly and didn't fall for it, because one thing scammer do is put their client into pressure, which is a clear sign to always look out for whenever dealing with total strangers online, as whenever you noticed you are been put under pressure, just notice it's likely to be a scam.",

It’s not everyday you see a scammer arranging an interview with someone they wish to hack some might just try to cajole you introducing a mouth dripping amount that’s almost impossible to resist.Well, you should follow the advice of the post above and either create a thread in the scans accusation board or just move this one there.

You might lose your server and job as well.With lots of Discord channels that I am in right now, I've seen this many times already.As a member of the channel, you will just surprised that a moderator or an admin of that channel will just share some information that isn't normal for an admin to do such as sending links, promoting scams blah blah. The last one that I remember was the Discord channel of Apeswap where the hacker posted a link. Same with Pegaxy, and Axie Infinity as well.I guess simply ignoring these type of random DM's is the best solution for it. I mean I understand that OP is a community moderator, and there might be some people who are interested in his/her service, but I don't think that the legit ones will just simply send you a DM out of nowhere and telling to apply for their project. Only scammers are doing that. Scammers right now are becoming more, and more clever as technology is evolving in such a rapid pace. I just hope that we all remain vigilant at all times, and always be careful in clicking the links online.",

He later found that wasn't any games instead it was an application that can inject malware into the system and gain access to that system. That's actually a good precaution method. Running a VM is another way to compartmentalize potential problems. I advise to do the same whenever you wanna dabble into the unknown. I'd say it's also a good idea to create an alt account (that'll only stay on VM) for job interviews and such so you don't place the servers you're managing in your main account in danger. However know it's not 100% safe method as there's an unlikely chance some malware/s could escape to your host OS hence I would treat VMs as your plan B. - backup plan. The plan A is knowing when to stop. In this case, the bit where there's a handsome fee ++ they need you to drag and drop in order to submit the form doesn't make sense hence extremely sus.",

The general rules that we have to remember in Discord, a moderator or admin never DM members directly and these are the most common rules, for example in the NFT world. So, how do you avoid these bandits? Turn off the \"allow direct messages from server members\" feature in the Discord privacy settings menu, then right-click the Discord group logo, then select Privacy Settings and turn off the DM feature. If this feature is turned off, the fraudster joins. the group won't be able to DM you.For example, another example. Suppose we want to install the Metamask wallet extension in a browser, then we open Discord in the same browser. If you click on the DM link, the fraudsters let alone approve the contract.",

It was made to look like a formal employment process with little concern to suspect it was a fraud. But this experience is a lesson that everything on the internet should be treated with suspicion. Every offer is a scam or fraudulent until it is proved otherwise. Having this mindset will help one not to reduce the security standard while using the internet. I am always careful when strangers promise to pay me high sums that is hard to refuse. When I am asked to click on a link to fill a document,  I am also alert.
