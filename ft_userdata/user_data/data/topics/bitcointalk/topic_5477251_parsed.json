I've got whirlpool running, and it started another rescan immediately after I received a new UTXO in Postmix. Come to think of it, I never had this Sparrow problem until I started using whirlpool. Would a rescan be expected behaviour?",

If you go to the \"Addresses\" tab on your post-mix wallet, you should have a huge list of dozens of unused addresses which have already been scanned and are known to be empty.Try going to your post-mix account, go to the \"Settings\" tab, and the click \"Advanced\" down the bottom. Is your wallet birthday set in the past and do you have a reasonable gap limit set? For other wallets the gap limit will be 20; for post-mix it should be several hundred at least, if not more.",

It is essentially a server that allows you to interact with the Blockchain. It sits on top of Bitcoin Core. Electrum is a wallet, like sparrow and they can both be connected to an electrum server. Sparrow can also connect directly to core. Not using an Electrum Server in between.",

Can you explain why that might help?I'm not 100% sure it will help, but it's worth a shot.The gap limit specifies how many unused addresses your wallet should generate and scan. For a post-mix wallet, since you are constantly using new addresses, this number should be very high to give the wallet plenty of unused addresses it can send your free remixes to. If the gap limit was low, then your wallet might need to be frequently add new addresses, which might explain frequent rescans.It seems the default post-mix gap limit on the most recent versions of Sparrow is now 4,000:https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/blob/4feb4a3a79a3bbe69178fbefa38cd530fe963240/src/main/java/com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/net/cormorant/bitcoind/BitcoindClient.java#L47C12-L47C12Code:private static final int POSTMIX_GAP_LIMIT = 4000;",
