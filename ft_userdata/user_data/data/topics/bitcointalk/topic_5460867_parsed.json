We know say before now, people dey always capitalize on tanker accidents to pack fuel despite knowing say na high risk venture - think of it this way: If government did their work (to build good roads) and provide good jobs for citizens half the people wey dey risk their life for things like this no go do am because them go most likely dey their workplace at the time of the accident and the fact say now na fuel scarcity time is enough motivation for greed to pack as much fuel as possible because them for make bank if say them no lose their life.In all, greed of victims and negligence of government.",

This one no be mumu or greediness but this one na poverty because na only poverty go make you go do something wey you know say go take ur life but you go still go ahead with the little chance of survival wey you get. Fuel price dun high and the common man no fit afford fuel again so as dem see free one na so all their sense loss.  People wey survive you know how much dem dun get so, so na just poverty make this one happen to man.If the country been good you think say as tanker fall so people for reason go risk their life when them know say things dey for life to enjoy. Person wey never chop since morning dun see way to make their family chop for the whole week. You think say him go dey reason the risks wey dey involved. Na just opportunity him go dey see and all this na because of poverty. Some people self they fall the tankers on purpose. Sorry for those that lost their life but I just dey thank God say the numbers no too plenty because e get some way the death dey plenty pass like this and hopefully people go begin learn their lessions.",
