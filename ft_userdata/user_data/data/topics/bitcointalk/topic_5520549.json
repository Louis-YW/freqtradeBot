      "body": "I’d say this is great news, especially since we’re talking about a billion-dollar company here. We can check their marketcap. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CBOE/cboe-global-markets/market-capQuoteCboe Global Markets market cap history and chart from 2010 to 2024. Market capitalization (or market value) is the most commonly used method of measuring the size of a publicly traded company and is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the number of shares outstanding. Cboe Global Markets market cap as of November 22, 2024 is $22.33B.So it’s really happening, bit by bit, we’re seeing more good news about institutional investors diving into Bitcoin. This is exactly what pro-Bitcoin regulation can achieve. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if we hear even more big updates before the year ends. Either way, this is a huge win for the Bitcoin market.",
