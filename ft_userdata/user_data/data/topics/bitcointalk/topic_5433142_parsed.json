  "content": "Central banks are based on producing fiat money within controls and according to a corresponding stock of metals such as gold, or a reserve of major currencies such as the US dollar.As for encrypted currencies, they are not subject to any controls of any kind and are produced by individuals (mining). However, some countries that are subject to economic crisis's or international sanctions have exploited these digital currencies and used them in their favor within controls ; The Venezuelan government issued a central digital currency called \"Petro\" and linked its price to the price of a barrel of local oil which means linked it to oil and precious metals. Also, China has also issued the Chinese yuan, which is a digital currency different from the decentralized blockchain.Is it true that cryptocurrencies will weaken the global financial system? That system which is managed by countries with the strongest economies with their currencies that has gained wide acceptance to be traded in financial markets all over the world.This would have an impact on the global economy and the entry of digital currencies would weaken these countries from their control over the economy if other countries start to follow the same approach as the Venezuelan government, as the currency of these dominant countries used in commercial transactions and which has been linked to the prices of gold and precious metals will face Digital currencies whose printing and issuance are not controlled by any official entity.",

      "body": "If we were to compare the total value of all cryptocurrencies, then according to the CMC market cap, it would currently amount to a little more than $800 billion - and for comparison, the US defense budget for last year was about $780 billion. I think that this speaks more than enough about the importance of crypto-currencies on the global economy, and the so-called CDBC should not be mixed in, because apart from the digital aspect, there is nothing different about it from money as it exists today.As for the petro-dollar, I think that project is far from any success, and I doubt that anyone will copy it, but China and its CBDC are a different story because they are forcing it without asking the opinion of their residents. In some further development, that currency could be accepted by some other countries that are politically and economically close to them, but it is more likely that it will still serve them for even greater control over their residents with all the measures they are already implementing.",

However, given that this could reduce the power of the major countries over these economies, it is assumed that a defect will occur in the current system.A poor country suffering from economic pressures cannot issue a paper currency except according to certain conditions and formulas, while it can issue an electronic currency without the need for any intervention, and it is sufficient to have a stock cover to give the currency its value. The large countries that control the global financial markets realize the danger if the Venezuelan experience is generalized.",

It stated that it hedges the portfolio from potential risks the main reason for the rise of cryptocurrencies across various exchange-traded products.It also stated the benefits of the global economy on cryptocurrency since it speeds up transactions, having no intermediaries results in lower fees, less need for a physical structure that gives lower fixed cost due to no need for wages, rent expenses, and utility bills. There is no global barriers since cryptocurrency has no boundaries and it facilitates easy and quick trade for corporations (reason why SBF can easily comingle FTX funds with Alameda)In addition, it also stated that entreprenuers can receive payment in more currency which helps them get financial coverage and liberated financial connection.Â  Since the cryptocurrency network is backed by distributed ledger technology. It is automated and digitized too. Thus, it eliminates the risk of fraud and corruption, the biggest dent in the traditional financial system.[1]Cryptocurrency also enable financial inclusions[1] and blockchain and cryptocurrency can help build greener future.[1][1] https://internationalfinance.com/how-cryptocurrency-reshape-global-economy/",

I see bitcoin's effect isn't in a global scale, but on the individual one, as it's impacting the lives of its adopters singly.

In my opinion, cryptocurrency appears not as a competitor or a technology that disrupts the global financial system but as an alternative technology which will innovate and advance the global financial system. Just imagine if cryptocurrency didn't appear, maybe until now we are still monopolized by old school transaction systems, which are not fast enough, weak, prone to hacking, high fees, etc. With the emergence of cryptocurrency, it will awaken the central bank/banks to be able to improve their system and present a transaction system - which, although not better than cryptocurrency - is still good enough and helpful for customers. We as users with the presence of cryptocurrency are also given alternative options to complete their transactions, and we really need this.",
