  "content": "A terrorist sect in Nigeria called Boko Haram said, they are planning to kidnap some of the key Political leaders in the Country. And if that really happened then Nigeria is a fall state. Now the question arising from different television and radio stations is that, can the terrorist group kidnap the president?https://news-af.feednews.com/news/detail/4acc31e288f3eda1c676c1d36e03288b?client=newsThis terrorist group has kidnapped a lot of the people in the country and killed a lot of people and burned down communities in the Northern part of the country. They are using different ways or approaches to destroy life and properties. They are part of the increase inflation in the country. So what do you think is the best option to eliminate this deadly terrorist group in Africa. This terrorist group are Muslims. So what is your opinion to end terrorist in Africa? As for me any terrorist that has been arrested should be send to  Guantanamo Bay detention camp  in Cuba or  Abu Ghraib prison if the later is still existing the it is preferable.",

This is because the government of that nation have not been able to tackle insecurity even averagely. Everyday we hear news of people being kidnapped and killed and the government is doing nothing about it. Maybe the kidnap of the President would be a wake-up call to the Vice-President to rejig the security architecture of the nation and make it more proactive. For now, the security of Nigeria is in shambles.",

At first I thought the terrorist group was just using that to threaten the president but from the attacked of the special guide to the president, I come to believe that the terrorist group is even more serious than ever. As it is. Everyone in the country sleep with one eye open, mostly at the Northern part of the country and their target are the Christians. Upon seen all these things like this and the NATIONAL GOVERNMENT could not do anything to stop the so called Boko Haram. Something is wrong at somewhere in Nigeria. Nigeria youths should wake up wake. Make sure you go out vote to remove the Muslim Muslim ticket and Atiku from PDP. APC and PDP are the problem we have in the country. Although, not the part but the candidates. Nigeria is a Fall State.Peter Obi is the answer",

In particular, ETA in Spain and IRA in Ireland have never been cracked down or shut down by the governments, rather they gradually watered down their approach and decided to take their causes in a mire political arena with IRA becoming a political party and members of ETA deciding to take political means towards independance. There are also some same examples in some Sounth American countrys. That being said, this is a religious movement first (I could be wrong), so maybe there will have to be a different approach.

It's amusing as to how these guys come up with the notion that they could lunch a kidnap attempt on the president of a country, any country and succeed. I think it's something we should reserve for the movies.Not to mention the inexperienced and not properly coordinated Nigerian Boko Haram that believes in brute force. They've only managed to persist so far because the Nigerian government have allowed them to operate without any trouble. Why? They are serving a purpose for them politicians but I think they would run out of that freedom should they kidnap an on seat president.The fool force of the federal power would be on them, they would be investigated and found out.

You can watch it on youtube to see how they cornered the president and ended his life. They really need to fix their country with everything they got, because when corruption will be eliminated, these so-called terrorists will also cease to exist, the example that is those countries that are successful for example Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.",

Now the question arising from different television and radio stations is, can the terrorist group kidnap the president?OP, I can attest that the said country Nigeria is a failed country. I am a Nigerian and and I can publicly tell you that the Terrorist group also known as Boko Haram can attack and kidnap anybody they want to kidnap irrespective of who you are and the position or office you occupy. Last week the presidential convoy was attacked by the Boko Haram and till date, nothing has been done about it, what about the train attack and kidnapping that was carried out by the same terrorist group has anything been done to release all victims?  the owo church massacre that was carried out by the same terrorist group nothing has been done so I believe a country that can not protect its citizens from harm and unnecessary killings by unknown terrorist groups is a failed country.The Boko Haram can attack and kidnap any politician even the president of Nigeria any day they want because they have every information necessary to do that unless the politician is out of the country or the president is out of the country too because he is always out of the country for medical check-ups.",

Only 0.03 percent gain job and 0.09 percent are self employed while 0.02 percent are desperately seeking for abroad visa to go away from the country due to hardship. Note: This rating is not in total of +200m population, is just a 1 percent of school graduates.Both the old and Young are facing the same problem, the Rich and Poor facing same issues in the country, way of living became so hard and tough, rough. At this point it increases the rate of Kidnapping, Kill for ritual, community vandalization, pipeline vandalization, highway robbery ect in the country. Yet the so called government kept borrowing from other countries like China for self gain, looting of money, borrowing in the name fixing the country and yet nothing to show up, every year by year same borrowing of money and no results, inflation rate very high. Very hard to survive. If you checked in the market, market women are crying everyday by day no one to buy due to high price of food stuffs. Since no buyer they end up coming back home with it and go back the next day, same problems.Summary.Employment is the only key factor to fix Nigerian problems, in a way they raised people from hardship then you reduce rubbery, killing and pipeline vandalization.",

There failure has caused a chain reaction that results in laxity in its citizens. You could imagine these guys in the assembly talking about impeachment just now, after the president have already spent 7years and some weeks out of his 8years in the office.They were busy discussing irrelevancies and now, they've got the insecurity that the people were crying about right in there domain.
