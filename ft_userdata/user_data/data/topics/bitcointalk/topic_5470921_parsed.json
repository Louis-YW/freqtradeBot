I'd love for Matt to make a video on this. It seems to me that governments \"asking\" ISPs to block access to the blockchain is a serious issue worth discussing@Hugo-ew2ko@Hugo-ew2ko1 year ago1. ALL governments would have to do it simultaneously. 2. Even if they did, just switch to a different port.@yileku462@yileku4621 year ago @Hugo-ew2ko  Just the government that is in control of your immediate routers would be able to shut you off from bitcoin.  How long would it take to coordinate the world switching ports on every bitcoin node?  Very long, and the government could have lots of time to block that port.",

I think the point that the government can easily block your access is quite overstressed here. While they can force your ISPs to do it, I doubt it would be faster than people moving to different ports or randomizing it. CMIIW.Anyway, I second the suggestion to move this to development & technical discussion instead of the mining board. You can do it by clicking the move button on the bottom left of your thread.",

Um, don't think so - I don't even use the standard port for some of my bitcoind ... and they work fine.The port is included in the protocol that tells about other nodes.So, as soon as you switch your port, it works fine.",
