I use Hedge Mode when I trade Futures.2023-05-05 - I opened long position on matic, price - 0.7353. The matic was falling for days, I thought it wouldn't fall below 0.6800 but it didn't stop there and the dump was quick, I wasn't seeing any positive signs of pump, so, I opened short position to save myself from losing much and then continued to watch charts in live, I didn't sleep that night. Price kept dumping, it went below 0.6000 USD and quickly went down to 0.5089 but I risked to close my short position at 0.5218. Then price quickly went from 0.5089 to 0.5973 and from my experience, such a pump from such a big loss is usually a positive sign and I was right, price kept growth since 0.5089. I left my long position opened on futures because Matic's price was regularly increasing and then one month later there was a Ripple news that immediately pushed Matic's price up to 0.8916, I just closed my position at 0.8518 and calmed down. Mentally, it's a huge stress for me, I really felt relief.Hedge Mode can sometimes really help you to profit more.",

I don't think you need to do it on MEXC either.When I think that coin is going to fall, I quickly increase leverage and open a short position with exactly the same number of coins. If price falls further, all I'm doing via this is that I'm freezing my loss, I don't lose money anymore even if it continues to go zero because I profit zero if it rises and I profit zero if it falls.I'll try to explain again:- I have $1200 on balance but I open a long position with $1000 , the price of the coin is $1.- Price dumps down to $0.8, now I have $800 ($200 loss) but I have another untouched $200, i.e. $1000 overall, only $200 loss.- Now I think that price isn't going to rise anytime soon and it will continue to fall, so I increase leverage and open short position with 1000 coins (now they worth $800 because the price of each one is $0..- Price falls down to $0.5. Now, I would be in a huge loss if I wasn't using hedge mode but thanks to hedge mode, I still have only lost $200. Now, let's imagine that price is going to rise and I'm going to close my short position at $0.5. When the price of coin reaches $1, I'll have $1300 instead of $1000. Sometimes, charts repeat pump and dump in certain range, you can make money in this moment by playing with long/short positions.",

Mentally, it's a huge stress for me, I really felt relief.Hedge Mode can sometimes really help you to profit more.That was some good decision-making for you, but anything could have gone either way, as well, such as;1. As soon as you open your short position, price starts moving in the opposite direction, gets your position liquidated and then shortly starts dumping once more. This time you have no cover. I have seen this happen quite often when I trade.2. You close your short position thinking the price will pump upwards, and it just continues to plummet.Spot still beats this kind of trading in away that the only risk is if a rug pull was performed and the coin dumped by so many zeros, like what happened to Luna. Apart from that, one could wait until the price rises back up without feeling that pressure of getting liquidated at one point. Patience is needed at timesAs for me If I want to risk, then it better be worth it, I prefer a much more meaningful risk to reward ratio",
