Investing in cryptocurrency can change people's fortunes but not in a short period of time. Invest enough in Bitcoin and hold that investment for a long period of time and you will have hope of getting something good. Investing is only for the future and with the expectation of getting something good in the future, investing in Bitcoin will stop all other activities, but this is not the case. Apart from investing in bitcoins, you should also carry on with your other activities as normal. If you have enough investment and the market goes up as expected then this investment can change your fortune.",

Its never been easy to watch and observe a negative portfolio because you would really be that ending up yourself on selling on loss if you dont have that good emotion control.",

More than 5 lines of text as a single sentence sounds more like a stream of consciousness than coherent thoughts to me.If someone invested a long time ago when the price was, say, below $1k, Bitcoin could be a very simple investment that doesn't require monitoring and discipline. If one has strong enough faith that Bitcoin will reach huge heights in the future, one can simply buy and wait for many years without doing anything else even now.It might make a person poorer if there comes a time when this person really needs the money and is forced to sell BTC during a bear market. Patience and a long-term perspective are good points, but situations vary, and people should account for that.",

To get rich, things out of the box don't hope much from Bitcoin in this current cycle all we can have on the optimistic level in Bitcoin is 4x to 5x from the current market value. Better take more risk because Bitcoin is all about realibilty & stability in the crypto risk investment , Find out hidden gems aka shitcoins for the 100X or 50X jackpot you are expecting with the chances of 0.1%.",

Bitcoin investing is not like a business in general, it is more like a way of saving and setting aside money for long-term investments on the Bitcoin digital Money platform.Bitcoin is fraught with risk and there is no guarantee the investment will be safe and profitable, as this also depends on how patiently you wait for the target to be reached and how strong you are to hold the long term. It is not easy to hold back long-term because the price of Bitcoin is fluctuating and this can affect everyone's psychology and if they are not prepared, then the investment will fall and not reach the desired target.",

Think of a particular goods like diamond that you know that it is very precious and valuable. Imagine you bought the goods at an amount and you know that it price will increase in the next couple of weeks, months or year depending on how long you want to keep it. All you just have to do is to buy the diamond, keep it and just monitor the the current price of diamond in the market. When it reaches a certain price you're comfortable with, you just sell it off and get your profit and it's that simple. Just take the diamond as your Bitcoin and do the analysis again and you will understand the basics of bitcoin investment.",

For example, let take a look at Bitcoin, do you know if only you have bought 1 Bitcoin 6 months ago (i.e May 2023) when it's value was still at $27,700 per BTC, do you now by now with current price at $37,700 per BTC, you probably would have made a whooping extra $10,000 for just mere holding 1 full BTC for 6 months.",
