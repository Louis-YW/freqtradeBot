The volatility keep pushing the price further down maybe we are going to see the $25k area by tomorrow if the speed of drop continues. The prediction for some have come but for many like me I didn't expect it that it will break $30k. This fall is affecting the market heavily and nobody to know when the price will go up.",

If the market recovery doesn't go fast then I think there will be potential for the price to drop to $25K.In the near future I would never have thought that the bitcoin price would touch the 2017 ATH “$20K” even though the current correction is still happening. There is no relentless correction and I think it's time to expect the market to recover and $28K is a low point for a decline. But to be honest, we can never be sure whether this correction will get worse and will happen in a longer timeframe. But what is clear is that we must be prepared with all the consequences if holding is a last resort not to sell our bitcoin at a discount.",

Been watching some prediction of some traders but this one is from a popular personality.  There were others which I refuse to believe which is $12k. They're saying it not helping the narrative that BTC is a hedge for this inflation but I  strongly object that because its actually giving them the opportunity to jump into this market while cheaper.",

It is cheap and we might not see this chances again. Goodluck to everyone though, hopefully we will make the right decision and learn from the 2018 bear market.",
