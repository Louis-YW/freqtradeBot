Sincerely right from Bitcoin history and as I have been hearing about bitcoin even before joining the forum, I had never heard of such increase in the market. Though it's no longer news anymore as each and everyone of us here knows it was the emergent of Donald Trump in the US presidential election, which is strongly giving rise to the Bitcoin market and every other coins follows immediately.I have actually made a topic where I saw how the bitcoin price gonna move, but still I want to know because with the way things are going it seems bitcoin wouldn't maintained it's circlic progression anymore. Who knows the plans of Donald Trump and Elon Musk after he might have finally sworn in as president.Do you think bitcoin will maintain its circle as usual?Will there ever be an uncalled dump in the market?Let's give our give our view towards the market to know what possibilities awaits us.",

For example we are currently in the same rise during the old 4-year cycles marked by the 4-year halving where the [new] supply is cut by half.Part of the recent rise was also the lowering of interest rates in a lot of different countries including USA which first alleviated the recession and secondly let the capital go back to other markets including bitcoin.Quote from: DPHOR on November 24, 2024, 06:46:22 AMWho knows the plans of Donald Trump and Elon Musk after he might have finally sworn in as president.It's the same. As much as these things can be positive contributors to the rise, they can be negative contributors are well. But at the end of the day bitcoin rises in the long run because it has a capped supply and an increasing demand.I don't think it is easy to predict what these guys will do. They have given lots of promises that look good on paper but then they are rich people who think about filling their own pockets not to help Bitcoin. We have to wait and see. For all we know Trump and Musk will create a new centralized shitcoin and try to sell that to people instead of Bitcoin and they may even ban bitcoin Chinese style.Quote from: DPHOR on November 24, 2024, 06:46:22 AMWill there ever be an uncalled dump in the market?There will be many unexpected crashes on the way toward the peak. Just go back and analyze the entire price chart for 2017 and see how many ups and downs bitcoin had going from below $1000 all the way to $20000 ATH.",

Before the approval of ETFs, we’ve seen the market go through extreme volatility time and again, that’s why pump-and-dump schemes thrive.However, the numbers tell the real story. If you look at the graph, you’ll notice that annual volatility percentages have actually been dropping. It’s a sign that the market is maturing, even if the road has been a bit wild so far.https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/prices/annualized-btc-volatility-30d",

Bitcoin enthusiast has existed even before Donald Trump show friendliness to Bitcoin and would still exists If Donald Trump suddenly shows hate towards Bitcoin.I won't want to categorical say that the market is going to always go up just because Trump is in power, as we all know the market is volatile and can swing either ways. It's also imperative to know that this year was the expected year to bring about the bull run, and alot of events lead to where we are now not only the US general election. A quick advice don't be fully lead by media, or politicians in your crypto-currency they both can easily pass wrong information so long as it favours their interests.",

Exchange hacks (Mt. Gox Breach, FTX Collapse).Regulatory aspects ( China's Ban on bitcoin)And lastly corrections were bitcoin have dropped significantly..  after the 2017 bull run bitcoin dropped $3,200, from $20k ATH. I guess we’ve already gone through all the major news that caused those big dumps, and Bitcoin still survived. Now that the market has been strengthened by regulations, we might still see price dips in the future, but nothing as drastic as the massive dumps we’ve seen in the past. Bitcoin has proven its resilience, and the market is maturing as we are seeing now.",

Yes, it's because we have what we call Bitcoin halving. The halving occurs every 210,000 blocks which takes roughly 4 years. So that is written already so it means it will always happen and yeah, as you call, it's going to be cyclical.Quote from: DPHOR on November 24, 2024, 06:46:22 AMWill there ever be an uncalled dump in the market?The dump that you might that you might have been seeing in the seeing is what we call the bear market.

But in a bear market, the price obviously goes down before hard, and in this cycle, the lowest that we've seen the price is $15,500.

You can see this fact in the market price because Bitcoin price is very sustainable after making its new all time high, price will have corrections but a new higher price level will be maintained than a previous cycle and older cycles too. Trading volume becomes bigger after each market cycle too.If it is a simple pump and dump coin, you will not see all these sustainable growth in price and trading volume.",

News in cryptocurrency market is ironic in eyes of people in the market. In bull market, even bad news will be not considered as bad news by the majority. In contrast in bear market, even a positive news can be considered as nothing, not important and sometimes can be understood in a way that used to dump the market.I agree with you that when there are massive positive news in the market for a long time, and there is no bad news, it's time to sell. Another signal to think of exit the market is you suddenly receive many questions about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, this market like how to join, how to earn money in this market from your relatives, friends, and colleagues, it's time to sell.The market top, euphoria phase will be full of newbies and when you see signals of newbies are joining this market, it's time to seriously consider of exit.",

If this increase is tied to Trump’s policies and plans, it could take some time to fully play out since he hasn’t even taken office yet. However, if you want to secure profits, cashing out now wouldn’t be a bad move.For me, though, I’m more focused on how far Bitcoin can rise. Like I said, it’s too early to worry about the bearish side. Let’s ride the hype for now and invest while the trend is still strong.",

Nothing has changed, same pattern are being followed, we will be having our greatest ATH in 2025 before the market begins it's phases of bearish times, even Trump cannot change the process by making all times bullish, as we enjoy the pump, our minds should also be awaiting a dump.  The dump cycle at which you are worried about is primarily the awaited moment another person is waiting to take advantage, Bitcoin can't cope without having a bearish phase.",

It’s abnormal for the price to continuously grow without any correction because it will form a bubble which is not good in general.I think the 90K to 100k price will be the next stable price range right after the correction. I’m positive that dump is imminent in able for the price can continuously grow since it will give way for new investors to enter because only few will be buying at ATH.Trust the process.
