  "content": "A peer to peer(P2P) cryptocurrency exchange known as Localcryptos have announced that they are shutting down operations, citing anticipated downtrend in cryptocurrency market as one of their reasons, they also mentions something about health issues which I personally think is understandable....But shutting down a crypto currency exchange business solely because of a bear market, do you guys think that's ideal?I mean, were they expecting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general to keep going up and up and never down for whatever reason???This and many more questions popping up in my head after reading their Announcement.What do you guys think.?",

There are a very small amount of people who care about privacy and don't want to hand out their data to other people.Why am I bringing this here?Well, we all know Binance had introduced P2P transactions followed by Kucoin and so many other exchanges which allow people to easily buy/sell crypto to fiat without waiting more than a few minutes. It's almost instant, very rarely face any issue.The above P2P system has done a lot of changes in the local crypto to fiat business. I, for example used to trade BTC, USDT and some coins for fiat. Used to buy at lower rate while sell with a little profit. It would still give me a good amount of profit. But when P2P was introduced, it changed drastically. People barely come to me for buying/selling crypto. They have Binance, Kucoin etc exchanges. Only people who was always concerned about their privacy, used to knock me for buying/selling BTC/USDT.Don't you think it has an affect on localcryptos too and so does to all other such exchanges? I think yes.Edit- Thread should be moved in Service Discussion.",

There are a very small amount of people who care about privacy and don't want to hand out their data to other people.This is not the case at all. The biggest selling point of LocalCryptos was that they did not require KYC, and were a true peer to peer exchange. Binance P2P is not peer to peer at all. It calls itself P2P as a marketing gimmick, but you are trading through a centralized third party (Binance), who collect your info, monitor your activities, and spy on your transactions.I've never understood why anyone would ever use Binance P2P. It takes all the disadvantages of a centralized exchange (zero privacy, zero security, zero custody of your coins, constantly being monitored, can have your coins seized at any time, etc.) but with none of the advantages of instant orders or trades.There is an ever growing market for real peer to peer trading, without Binance or Big Brother holding your coins for you and telling you what you can and cannot do. Bisq is the best platform to use.",

LocalBitcoins is simply far ahead in terms of userbase.It's actually one thing to run a business and make profit and quite another to advocate and even fight for decentralization. And it is crystal clear with platforms such as LocalBitcoins and HodlHodl that they prioritize business over peer-to-peer transactions so that when the time comes when they would be forced to choose whether to implement KYC and continue operating or stand strong with their principles and close shop, they wouldn't think twice of abandoning their principles. And if it is true that Localcryptos is closing due to regulatory pressures, it is indeed a good death. That'd be better than having a bad life.",

When the market looks a bit like regulated already, people sees there is no need to hide from the law after all its been accepted openly by many merchants even the Paypal and some credit cards are joining the massive adoption of crypto. Buying thru credit cards was even considered by those people as there are option of this on exchanges.It already felt like the DEX is losing the battle.

Look at the crazy amount of KYC that centralized exchanges now implement. CEXs already censor users and don't let them withdraw their coins to addresses they or their government don't like. The latest thing being pushed is that you have to start KYCing your own wallets to be allowed to deposit or withdraw from CEXs at all. The next step after that will be that governments will implement a set of whitelisted addresses which are the only places CEX users are allowed to send their bitcoins at all. Soon using bitcoin via a CEX will be little different to using fiat via a bank.The demand for real DEXs such as Bisq will only continue to grow over time as CEXs become ever more draconian and ever more like fiat banks.Quote from: PX-Z on October 27, 2022, 08:40:52 PMMany don't expect that it will go worst just like this.

Although I agree it seems incredibly naive of crypto companies to not be prepared for the inevitable bear markets. And a drop to $20k isn't even that bad. Wonder how many companies would have gone under if we had dropped to $3k like we did last time.",
