Every bear market is worst for bitcoin and crypto, and this is not an exception. And if you look at it's past history, you can see that we can recover and bounce back from this crypto winter or whatever others call it.This is just part of the cycle and we can call it normal. Not sure how long you guys have been in the market. But for those who have seen bear market, this is not something that you lose hope. On the contrary, this is the time wherein you accumulate bitcoin because they are very cheap.",

That's all you need to do right now and remember all of the past things that has happened to bitcoin. Those worse years that have been too low when we've witnessed that. Compare today, this is nothing than of those. And if your friend is losing hope, don't be like him. Be a man for yourself since you've known bitcoin, cheer up because it won't last forever that we'll be sitting on this bear.",

Slim chance of this bear continuing upon looking at the monthly chart of BTC/USDT. This dump is just a short hiccup and will just bounce after a week. I speculate the price will go close to $22.000 by Dec or probably even to $24K. But this is just my forecast.Tell your friend he is not alone. The year looks worse because there is an economic crisis and inflation is adding pain to our expenses.",

And I don't even know how to encourage myself to invest more in Bitcoin, is it right for me to go ahead and buy the dip ? First time?Seriously though, the global economies and markets have taken a pretty large hit in a way that's unprecedented in Bitcoin's history, so expect the next few weeks and months to be rough. Yes, that means the dip might keep dipping for a while. No, that doesn't mean that all is lost and Bitcoin is going to zero.It just means that you shouldn't throw in more money than you can afford to lose, otherwise if the price keeps dipping you might see yourself under enough financial and psychological distress that you see yourself forced to sell. If you're doing DCA, just keep doing what you're doing. Otherwise it's anyone's guess. The important part is that it's a decision that you need to be able to handle, both financially and psychologically.",

The weak sells their bitcoin cheap because of panic in the bear market and loose their capital,while the strong buys more bitcoin in the bear market to gain big profit when bitcoin hits the bull market again.

Then for the ones that aren't losing money, are seeing the news, and then the price starts going down due to fear. It's a common cycle that we've seen before. Any exchange that goes, will be replaced. Unfortunately, probably by a equally as bad exchange. Eventually, we'll transition to exchanges without wallets implemented, and only temporary holdings. Hopefully, eventually peer to peer exchanges become the norm, and therefore we avoid a lot of the losses that people are subject too, and therefore won't have these headlines any more. Bitcoin has been tested, unprecedented times now being compounding by the FTX news. It'll probably either hover around this amount or go down a little more. However, I'm quite confident in a recovery, but probably not until sometime in the new year.",

But when they see that Bitcoin once cost $69k, and now it costs $16k, then they start to scream. If Bitcoin goes deeper - buy more. Scared - just pass by. Dont have money - pass by. Since, people are significantly invested into Bitcoin. Bitcoin is new, hasn't really been done to this scale before, and therefore there's always a chance that it fails. It's not a currency like USD or GBP that's basically backed by the government. Bitcoin technically is backed by the belief of the community, and that's pretty much it. Obviously, there's a reason why that belief exists, and I don't think it'll ever completely go. However, you can understand when someone is significantly invested in a new technology, a new idea that when it does dip it causes panic.I can understand that, and I've been around a while. I personally aren't that concerned. This is just natural variation for as far as I'm concerned. We've seen similar in the past, and there's a compounding effect going on right now. While I do think we'll be fine, and will see it increase to levels before, it's still understandable when people do panic. It has taken me years to develop the resilience I have to the price, it definitely doesn't come over night.",

Are you forgetting that you already reached 20,000$ and then dropped to 3200$? but then it went up from to 67000$? that friend of yours doesn't seem to have done any research work before entering this market, look at the international market, see that even facebook and twtter are laying off employees due to the crisis, of course this crisis also affected bitcoin, but this one Current price drop is related to the FTX exchange you can read more about it here: https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-and-binance-s-ongoing-saga-everything-that-s-happened-until-nowbut eventually the price will recover, it's not because it's dropping that it will drop to zero which is what your friend must be thinking, if you want to buy, i suggest you just be aware that the price can go down further and it can take years for it to go back to 67000$, are you ready to hodl for a long time? if your answer is yes then you can buy it, but if you are not ready then don't buy it",
