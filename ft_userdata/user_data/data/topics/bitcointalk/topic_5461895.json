I don't believe you need to send anything, you're free to contribute if you'd like to help:Quote from: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumContributingAny help testing the software, reporting or fixing bugs, reviewing pull requests and recent changes, writing tests, or helping with outstanding issues is very welcome. Implementing new features, or improving/refactoring the codebase, is of course also welcome, but to avoid wasted effort, especially for larger changes, we encourage discussing these on the issue tracker or IRC first.Besides GitHub, most communication about Electrum development happens on IRC, in the #electrum channel on Libera Chat. The easiest way to participate on IRC is with the web client, web.libera.chat.",

Almost all bitcoin wallets that have excellent features are not supporting altcoins.So true. I agree.I also have no intention of recommending any of the wallets I mentioned above and I myself have never used them other than Electrum on desktop and BlueWallet on mobile. Previously I used Trus Wallet to store some coins, but it's probably the worst wallet I've ever used to store some coins.BlueWallet is specifically for macOS and iOS users although it also supports Android. For me bluewallet is very trustworthy.",

I have been using it for years now and hardly use any other wallet. But what makes me regret the most is that it still doesn't have an iOS version even though many years have passed. I still see them actively improving the new desktop versions, but I don't know why they still can't make any version for iOS, even a beta version. OP, I really support your idea. But as everyone said, you should contact them on GitHub rather than here as they are inactive here. I hope to see Electrum on the app store soon.",

However, the impact is that when opening the wallet, it takes longer for the synchronization process.The delayed synching occur when you have just created or imported the wallet.Not happening because it just created or imported a wallet, the synchronization process occurs every time we open the application after completing the passcode, especially when the first time opens the day in question.For example today I have not opened it, when I open it then it will happen. But it just happened once, when the wallet was closed, then when I entered again, the synchronization process was not repeated.Sometimes a circular circle in the Bitcoin icon on the Unstoppable wallet which indicates the synchronization process is running does not require a long time.",
