      "body": "Thanks for the warnings; it might not be helpful for me, but my university mate is into crypto, and he was talking about prop firm today with me, I actually came to meet him often as he is in another section and I am in another, and we both were free so we exchanged information, He said he is spending time in a prop firm, and I was totally unaware of the term so I asked more and he shared all the details, like how he passed the test, etc.Overall, thanks for the review. I don't know if your review is really legit or just a marketing technique, but I will look into it later. But hey, you did not provide the link to that proposition. I think you tried to write it named in brackets (bright funded), right?Can you share your experience with the ones you are using now?",

When it's like that, because I'm not used lightly because I'm not familiar with something, I know first before I enter it or use it so that the money I put in will not be wasted anyway.",

      "body": "Those are the unpopular exchanges, I’m wondering why choose it if you already have the best option in the market? Are you not allowed to use top exchanges? This is actually what I don’t want to experience especially with my trades and that’s why I always choose the best option and choosing the best option means having a peace of mind as well. If you want to trade smoothly, always go for the best.",

Not discovering buy and sell orders, paid UI buys, and slow trading are all indicators of technical or software problems, both of which are due to limited funding, so at any time they may either stop or turn into fraud, or There is an insider attack or any other form that will lead to the loss of your money.",

Why are we looking at new ones with no reputation? You risk your funds just depositing there.",

With the rise of prop firms in crypto, we've seen similar situations, but that doesn't mean there aren't reputable ones out there. Personally, if I were to trade with prop firms, I'd stick to the well-known ones with a proven track record. Unlike the up-and-coming firms that make big promises but often fall short in delivering. Trust is key.",
