Lots of fears, grief, deaths, sicknesses, recession, lack, hunger, products absence, no market, indoors, lots of sex, lockdown and security threat. This terms was the only psycho imagination of people and fears of people. The government also came up with vaccine, test and quarantine. Dudes this wasn't funny even in my country that was political, no way to travel after all and no country is ready to occupy immigrants. It was a fiest stories, often counting and increasing dead victims.But in my country it was hunger that almost take the lives of people because no money and if you have nowhere to buy something. How did you survived the asshole pandemic disease (covid19)?  Where you sore afraid? How you deassociate with people? How did you get something to eat?",

In fact, they were dying only from Covid, no other disease was treated anymore..I think it was pure intimidation of people, a made-up story to fix the economy and reduce the population with a negative suggestion.Today, Covid seems to no longer exist and it never did. It is no longer dangerous.Actually it was collective hypnosis.And it actually worked, the whole planet was in fear.",

Some, due to lack died and in where I come from, it was tagged as the resultant effects of COVID and painfully, numbers which where not there were added just so that funds could be siphoned to their pockets.  Well, according to your topic, you should have shared how you survived the pandemic. But here's mine though:  At least it was foodstuffs that was the major thing in short supply,( as peeps refused to fall sick anymore);we were able to stock the house with canned goods and some dried goods that could last for a long period of time before the whole thing got severe.",

According to your post, a complete mess is visible; you mixed everything that could be mixed. Today there are many other problems, the solution to which is something to think about. Leave everything that was yesterday, take your mistakes into account, and start living today.",

It was a ghost town and you only saw increasing deaths every day and friends got covid.

But, numbers rose and people got sick. I knew we were fighting for our lives then.I had my down times. I worried if we'd ever reach the end. I refused to let this pandemic defeat me. I tried to see the good in every situation. I started reading, binge-watching, and acquiring new skills.It wasn't easy, but I had to keep going. We've survived worse. We've survived plagues, wars, and natural disasters stronger than ever. You know? Again. I'm pleased that this pandemic made me stronger, more motivated, and more hopeful.",

There weren't any massive lockdowns in my country and we didn't have any problems with food and starvation.I guess that many underdeveloped countries with large population had way bigger problems than my country during the pandemic.",

Everything went online including studies  so it was a good time to spend much time with my family. We had all the time.to study play and sleep. The only issue I had was that the government didn't provide for the needy in my country so may people died of starvation and I was not comfortable with that. My family tried their best to reach out to people but we couldn't help everybody because we had limited resources. I also used to the opportunity to learn a new skill.",

But thanks to modern technology, the internet, and any form of entertainment. That's why I've spent my time forgetting that we're facing a crisis during that time. I've spent money through my savings and investments and that didn't make me regret it because it's been used to the best that it can. I was sad also because looking at those people that have got nothing to serve to their tables because of the limited actions and jobs that have been said due to restrictions. I didn't take a test but I believe that I've contracted the virus and as exactly to what the recovery period said, it was 2 weeks until I have become better from that time when I got sick. I was scared to take the test and go to the hospital because most of the experiences that I've read was even if the patient was healthy and just want to take a test to know if they have been infected by the virus, they will no longer come home and be there to the hospital until they become better. Well, most of those stories were scary because they never went back home alive but in a jar.",

How did you get something to eat?Days before the nationwide lockdown happen in our country, we already gathered some goods that is enough for us to eat for at least a month or two. Good thing though that we have a nearby store so that we can just get anything that we need. We also have emergency funds at that time, so we used it to buy the goods, and our source of income never stopped because my work at that time didn't stop fortunately, and I'm still getting monthly income.TBH, I'm not affected by the pandemic at all, or at least the lockdown issue because even before the pandemic started, I'm not going out that much already. We also have enough food at that time, and maybe the fact that we are living in a provincial area made us even safer. On the other hand, I saw online these people who are struggling to find some food and money. Many people begging on the streets asking for help coming from the government. Many people are having a hard time to the point that there are times where they aren't eating, or if they'll eat, it's only once a day.The pandemic that happened a few years really taught us a lesson. Lesson to have some emergency funds in case things like this happen. I can say that I'm lucky that I'm not affected that much at least financially, but emotionally a little bit because it's really hard to see some people struggling at that time, but there's nothing that I can do to help.",

Those who have government job get salary without doing their job but labors and all other workers are in willing to get some cash to complete their life's activities.That time online jobs were very useful because there were strict restrictions to go outside for certain jobs. In our country food items were available at near stores but others activities were stop for long time.

We have 0 cases when the covid-19 announced to the news, they tell us how covid-19 can spread rapidly with just having contact with the person with sickness, especially it can be spread with air that's why it's mandatory to use facemasks. But when 1 person got sick with covid-19 and people thought that as not a threat. Then boom from zero to thousands of cases of covid-19 patients announced. Government has no choice but to close some establishment to avoid gathering of people. People panicked as they lost their job cause them to not have money to feed themselves. They have no choice as they needed to stay at home, they just wait for foods from government This has affected the economic status of our country as many people lost their job which lessen the tax rate, the effect to the people with their mental health, education and pregnancy rate increases.

Good thing that the first time I've heard about the announcement regarding the covid-19 situation, I've supplied a lot of essential goods and had some savings incase my work would cancel. Which they didn't since my work can be implemented online. I'm afraid that's why I felt the panicked from myself as I buy all the goods before lockdown. Connection with people only with the internet, then discord helps since some projects are in discord which they have some health care podcast.",
