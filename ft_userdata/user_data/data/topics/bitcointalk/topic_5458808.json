I thought so.Unlocking bitcoins like this is equivalent to turning on a money printer except instead of printing money, it is printing new coins such as how Dogecoin is working right now (part of the reason why DOGE should not be used as long-term HODL, but that's a different story). This discussion has already been had before more than once here. Why should we give Bitcoin one of the drawbacks of cash?",

Technology makes people learn to be caution in storing Bitcoin that we have and there are positive and negative talking about technology, but some people consider technology to bring someone to reach the desired stage without a third party intermediate.Gold has a tool that is able to detect and gold has a shape that can be sought using a detector. For now what I know is there is no way to find Bitcoin for someone who loses Seed and Personal Key access. Accuracy in storing seeds or personal keys is a decision that must be well guarded and we are one that can secure ownership.",

I think it would be something like a mining or discovery effort where using some currently unavailable technology people could be able to gain access to tools to discover the private key somehow. I like comparing bitcoin to gold and a treasure hunt is the only way I can keep the analogy going. Otherwise they aren't all that similar. If bitcoin is digital gold then there should be a digital recovery system in my opinion. This would take some kind of technological breakthrough plus a consensus on how to handle these sorts of issues.Baja Yaja",

Should it stay this way or should there be a way to \"find\" lost bitcoin other than somehow finding the private key in some sort of treasure hunt?Then there wouldn’t be a definite mining number of bitcoin which is an absolute 21 million because it is like mining back the same coins that have been mined and added to circulation before. If you look at the reward for a block or rather the halving period the price is calculated based on the number of supply and should we re-mined them they add to probably the supply and then affects the value. More so you can’t compare it to Gold since it is a physical commodity. The ability to mine and re-mine gold is what makes it not to be an absolute scarce asset. Also you can’t be sure whether the coin was actually lost for real, probably the owner actually hide some where and others maybe his kins might feel it is lost and then declare it lost so if it is to be re-mined then it goes against the wish of the real owner. So in as much as no body likes it when people lose there coins it should remain like that because a twitch in the protocol might affect lots of things",

There are these people using their computing power to try and generate an already used Bitcoin address that still contains balance, which I think is closest to what people with metal detectors do. It’s about impossible to find an already used address by generating, but it’s what some people try. The better question is how do you define a lost BTC? A Bitcoin that hasn’t moved in a decade? A Bitcoin whose “owner” (which is a person who can” prove their ownership (See how many .dat files have been sold around to naive people who thought they could prove ownership or decrypt it, but mobody was able to do it)?Nobody knows which Bitcoin is truy lost. They may be dormant addresses or their owners just haven’t looked well enough yet in the right spot to find the private key or seed to their coins. Fortunately, you’re literally the only one who has access to your coins. Unfortunately, this means you’ve got to be quite careful about this characteristic of Bitcoin because it means if you lose access, nobody can help you out with it.Like Satoshi said: when you lose BTC, the supply gets scarcer.

Now, when the price is high, people are already acting differently and the probability of losing btc is very low (though not zero). People have learned to appreciate and cherish it.There should not be any plans to BTC-reset again. This is silly. Everything should remain as it is. Otherwise, it will create confusion and chaos in the bitcoin network.It is possible that in the future methods and technologies will be found or invented to restore access to the lost btc. It may turn out that the BTC-detector will be created a little later, because the treasures and gold you are talking about have also lain for more than one hundred years before they could be found.",

As far as I can tell, people believe Bitcoin is digital gold because it can serve as a store of wealth quite well, not because of its technicalities. It is a bit surprising to see new threads talking more or less about the same issue. Is there a new narrative on social media that discuss it? I wonder why though. Most people already know that losing your coins means a dead end most of the time, which is why self-custody is important. Other than breaking the trust people have in the network, I don't see how a new \"recovery\" mode will be accepted by the network.

As for Bitcoin, some coins are at the point of no recovery, but some are lost because people memorized their pass phrases and forgot them or put pieces of paper with crucial information somewhere and then also forgot where that was. Some might remember enough to use specialists that can help brute force the rest, and passphrases can also be found by some people later on. So there is a possibility to recover some coins, at least in theory. Also, let's not forget that there's no good estimate of how much is actually lost rather than presumed lost due to inactivity.",

There is only 21,000,000 maximum bitcoin supply so anything contrary to this I think would be frowned at and would not go down well with the bitcoin community. But instead missing or lost bitcoin would make the  existing bitcoin more valuable and a scarce commodity.Nevertheless, of lately, wallet addresses holding large volume of bitcoin started waking up and these are the wallets assumed to be  holding lost bitcoin but it wasn't as the thought goes. So it would be very difficult to decipher if a wallet holding bitcoin for long without any activity is assumed to be a lost coin unless otherwise if the owner of such wallet comes up publicly to declare that such wallet holding certain volume of bitcoin belongs to them and possibly verification is done that is when it could be said that such bitcoin is a lost one.",
