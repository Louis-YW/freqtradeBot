      "body": "I don't think it is legal to use another person bank account for a business purpose. Your project need a separate or specific account for itself not a third party account to run a business. That is not advisable. If you need someone from Netherlands to do some transaction for you for business purpose, that would have been a different case but using another bank account number for a project is not good. Though I am not on the particular business lane so I am understand what you are talking about. And also if the transaction or the transfer is once then it might be okay but if it is for the full running of the whole project then it is bad most for the project. Go and do all the legal documents to standardize your project instead not using another person bank details.",

      "body": "First and foremost, your location where you are is not stated but you mentioned where you want to do the transaction. However as a business man, you should know that your business is a coperate body and would need it's own separate account for further transaction and documentations as the case maybe. Less I forget you should be able to locate the Netherlands in the local board to ease you some stress getting some one from there that would make it faster for you but come to talk of it, do you not have friends around to help you scale through the process because I think in this kind of situation, many turn to their friends for back up. I would advise you go get your necessary documentation for your project so as to avoid unforseen circumstances in the nearest future as these days many funny things happen. To be on the safe side, go do the needful.",
