The biggest scam company!It's good that you warn the community about this but you have to open a scam accusation to verify your accusation Scam Accusations  for a newly announced casino here in Bitcointalk this is serious and OP if he is the official representative here should address this concern, if he is not then he might as well lock this threadPost all your pieces of evidence like screenshots of the conversation if possible your deposit and balance if you lose $2000 you have to warn others about the risk of playing in this casino but your accusation can be taken seriously if you post all your evidence.",

The biggest scam company!Nice you could identify them immediately and calling the attention of this platform was a good move by you but however, you should have enough evidence backing up your claims as your accusations are very grave to go by so as to be able to convince members here about the activities of this casino as I see they have no much activities here. As an accusation, you could lay a complaint here for them to come clear their name first before anything else would be done so that members here will not fall victim of their scam activities.Here's the link to the scam accusations boardhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0You can go make a complaint there and do well to upload link or photo evidence of your accusations then come here to edit and post the link of the complaints here for the representative to respond to it.",

The biggest scam company!All gambling sites can at any time promote their site in this forum to get traffic, but if you have proof just share it in this thread or following a friend's recommendation create a thread on the fraud accusation board to remind people here not to try to play on this site , because we will never know what is right and what is wrong, but it is better not to accuse without any evidence, but if you have evidence of fraud and fraud, it should be publishedI would be happy to hear anything from you because in this forum we are all open to anyone and the site owner can respond properly to this accusation so as not to get a bad reputation in the forum.",

The biggest scam company!It appears that your main activity on Bitcointalk is to criticize and accuse casinos and this has been consistent in all of your previous posts as i see. While it is understandable to be concerned about potential scams or fraudulent practices by some casinos it more important to back up your claims with evidence and initiate a formal topic for discussion in the right section ( Scam Accusations ) Â rather than simply spamming and spreading rumors in ANN threads. Otherwise you may get a red tag soon as a spamming newbie.Additionally you said it by yourself Â that you suck and clearly lack of skill in sports betting may be the reason for your losses over the past two weeks i donâ€™t see how itâ€™s the casinoâ€™s fault if you keep losing your bets?On a positive note Dexsport seems like an exciting web3 casino concept not that i tried it yet but with a decentralized website and various options for sports betting using different cryptocurrencies i may try it for the coming UCL matches this month. However if Dexsport do not accept bitcoin i think they should o move this ANN thread to the altcoin section",

After performing a simple google search, I found that there are a lot of people accusing this platform of withholding funds and not paying out winnings (on social medias like Twitter and Reddit but even on their own Telegram community channel you will see people complaining about not being able to withdraw their money)... Even the title of this platform is incredibly dishonest by calling itself \"the first decentralized crypto sports betting platform\". It is obviously not decentralized nor the first of anything if the users cannot even hold on to their own funds and winnings can be randomly rejected by a centralized admin.If anyone has proof of scamming, they should definitely post it in the scam accusations subforum! I think there is a high possibility of them being either extremely incompetent and/or dishonest.",

I also donâ€™t deposit in new sites until and unless they do something which will gain my trust, so how did exactly they scam you, and why did you deposit such a big amount in the site without correctly checking the background of the site? The siteâ€™s representative here also seems like not interested anymore, and therefore successfully ignoring all the members posts and questions. So yes for the time being, itâ€™s better to avoid these types of sites.",
