  "content": "Bitcoin can potentially play a role in the economic growth of a country which can make a huge difference in the multifaceted progress of that country. If Bitcoin can be integrated with the way in which the traditional financial system of the country is growing, the global economic system can be radically changed.Here are some recommendations:Enhancing Investment and Economic Diversification: A country can attract investment and increase the scope of employment through innovative activities using the wide range of technologies of Bitcoin and Blockchain, which can greatly contribute to the economic growth of the country. Countries such as El Salvador, for example, have explored Bitcoin alongside traditional financial systems to further strengthen their economies, and their scope continues to grow.Financial inclusion of common people: Bitcoin can contribute to the economic growth of a country by including a large population by opening access to savings and buying and selling beyond the limited services like conventional banking system.Exchange of Remittances: Remittances are very important for the progress of a country. Bitcoin can play a real role in reducing the fees and time of traditional services when citizens of one country send remittances from another country.From an overall perspective, a country can explore Bitcoin with their economy in the light of wide knowledge of the strategies to increase the holding and increase the scope of transactions and access to the exchange, which can contribute to the growth of that country in a big way.Looking forward to your more recommendations.",

Countries such as El Salvador, for example, have explored Bitcoin alongside traditional financial systems to further strengthen their economies, and their scope continues to grow.El-Salvador did break the internet by having to legalize Bitcoin for a legal tender and since then, they havenâ€™t been off the news as, itâ€™s been met with mixed reactions based on market conditions. Even then, it is possible that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency assets could help the economic growth of a nation. This would be in terms of wealth redistribution.Where, you can sell your Bitcoin far and near, get some of those funds from where ever to invest in something locally.Also, by purchasing products from places foreign to you using Bitcoin, your very much involved in import and export of products which is a plus to the economy.Quote from: laijsica on August 20, 2024, 10:42:13 AMFinancial inclusion of common people: Bitcoin can contribute to the economic growth of a country by including a large population by opening access to savings and buying and selling beyond the limited services like conventional banking system.This comes in play in terms of, the opportunity Bitcoin offers where just anyone could buy in and buy in with as low as theyâ€™ve got, using the knowledge theyâ€™ve acquired to grow their portfolio.With citizens being able to make a living through trade, the economy grows.",

      "body": "What role can Bitcoin play in promoting economic development? First, we need to find out what factors help the economy develop. The government must have reasonable economic policies to support people, create more jobs to help people increase their income, stabilize market prices, and fight corruption...in short, it must somehow ensure people's lives have quality. And to do all that requires combining thousands of factors together. Can Bitcoin do those things? Can it create jobs, can it attract investment into the country...? Looking at countries with leading developing economies, does bitcoin play a role in their economies? We should be realistic. El Salvador's strengths are tourism and labor export. In addition, El Salvador's trouble is violence, they are the country with the most gangs in the world. But thanks to Nayib Bukele's strong repression policy, the country gradually stabilized and from there their economy gradually stabilized. Making bitcoin legal tender brought worldwide attention to them, but that is not what made their economy grow, all thanks to Nayib Bukele's economic policies.",

So, it's the same if you have to use your personal data or do KYC to spend BTC or Money.",

      "body": "I agree with the op about the potential use cases of Bitcoin. Attracting foreign investment, creating jobs, allowing more financial opportunities for the unbanked or insufficiently banked, and saving up on international transaction fees are all good points.But when we talk about Bitcoin, it's also important to consider the risks and challenges. One of them is that Bitcoin largely is not accepted directly as payment, so people often need to sell it for local fiat to make use of it. Also, storing it on centralized platforms poses a big risk of losing your funds, whereas storing coins yourself means that if you lose your password, passphrase or whatever, nobody will be able to help. You'll lock yourself out of your wallet. Then there's price volatility, as well as occasional fee spikes.Both upsides and downsides need to be considered to make informed decisions.",

Us, independent traders, will rely more on big country's move/news towards Bitcoin in buying or selling our asset because it will highly affect the global market. The way I look into it is it will be more similar to how we trade Forex.This is just my speculation, but sure for now Bitcoin would play a big role in a country's fund system since not many countries has adapted nor regulate bitcoin, and I believe that the first big country who has succeeded in fully adapting and regulating Bitcoin will be a pioneer which will affecting other countries who are trying to follow its path and might set the rules for Bitcoin regulation globally in the future",

In most countries, governments and authorities don't want financial inclusion for the common people because that would make them weaker over time. They wouldn't want the common people to have financial inclusion and be able to manage their finances on their own because if that happens, their people wouldn't depend on them anymore and that makes them lose control of the people.Remember, the best way to control people is to always keep them dependent on you for at least something because as soon as they become completely independent of each thing, you won't be ruling them anymore and they won't need you.A country that has a government that works only for the people and doesn't have such thoughts might have economic growth using Bitcoin.",

I have seen lots of posts that present Bitcoin as the solution to the economic problems of a country. From your post, we can conclude that Bitcoin can contribute to the growth of the economy because it could diversify the economy which could help the government increase its revenue through taxes. Crypto firms in the country can also contribute to the country by creating employment opportunities. Research by K33 Research showed that even in the crypto-hostile China the crypto industry employed about 190,000 employees as of July 2023. Â If good crypto policies are well implemented, some percentage of the unbanked population can have access to financial services. Bitcoin transaction fees can help reduce the high cost of sending money internationally but this will be when the mempool is not under attack.",

Without the legal framework, no good will be done to the economy as a whole. You can just think from the international remittance perspective. Many countries in Asia, receives multi billions in foreign remittance each year. In order to receive the remittance, the central bank of that country needs to maintain a network and pay a hefty fees to the middleman companies. Bitcoin can eliminate the need to have a middleman. This is just one aspect. There are hundreds others were Bitcoin can help in the economy of a country, if handled in a right way!",

If at all perhaps countries were able to have a first hand in Bitcoin, they would have done this idea.Another thing is that you should know is that countries only give priority to their own currency and any other currency they used as their own reserve, any other thing is a secondary. Government don't like something that doesn't allow them have it their ways and that's what Bitcoin does, it gives freedom and allow everyone enjoy the benefit that comes with it as long as you have the money to buy it.",

Basically because the one who controls Bitcoin is not another person or a third party but the individual who owns Bitcoin.Because the use of Bitcoin can be used as a long-term investment asset because of hedging, it is no wonder that many countries continue to try to adopt Bitcoin in their own way.If El Salvador dares to issue legal regulations to legalize Bitcoin as a legal tender, then when this American state becomes the center of attention of investors, it is not surprising.
