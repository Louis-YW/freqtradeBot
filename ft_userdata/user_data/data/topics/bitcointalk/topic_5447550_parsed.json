Any improvement? Monero miners use this site. I think that you can find a profit calculator on your own.https://xmrig.com/benchmarkThe old problem is that if you buy a processor for mining, then to calculate the payback you need to take into account the cost of not the processor, but the whole computer. And Monero needs a fast memory, because then the hashrate is higher.",

Mining is the only way to obtain crypto while maintaining privacy.Exactly and just to add to the discussion,now Wildrig has support for mining Raptoreum a CPU mineable coin which can really make a difference in the amount of them you get daily if you redirect your 6 GPU rig for example as a 6 GPU rig with 2060 would do 4000 h/s or a rig with 3060 ti would make over 11.000 h/s and the amount of coins you would be getting in a month a two can really make a difference when the devs of the RTM start implementing the programming languages for smart contract which are better than Ethereum which relies on Solidity,in here they want to go with Python or other well known programming languages which can bring a boom to this coin so better stack up.For Monero I think we can already mine it with GPU-s too but I don't know how much coins would you get,definitely not as much as RTM which is in the initial stages yet.Disclaimer:This is just my personal opinion and not forcing anyone to redirect their rigs,I personally did and I am very happy with the results now.",

Cryptocurrencies are still a best effort bleeding edge technology 'in the works'.  Ideal is 1 CPU = 1 Vote as Satoshi stated in the BTC whitepaper. I'll take botnet CPU algorithms where the majority of miners are using gaming rigs (potentially billions of us) over the massive corporatocracy that is the industry of ASIC mining. A more ideal iteration of Proof of Work would be mineable on mobile phones. Once again, the herd power of billions of mobile phone users would trump narrow examples of malware and the few potential super-clustered warehouse of mobile phones some crazy dude setup.",

The trading volume isn't doing great, too.A. There is absolutely every reason to expect privacy coins and regulatory compliance to come together in one sentence. We have lawyers and tech experts in our community that get it. Aside from that, constitutional law is actually a thing regardless of how much lawmakers want to ignore it. Zero-Knowledge proofs are an important way for businesses to factually disclose information while maintaining privacy. B. I've been doing that since I made this thread, plenty of times I've done the calcs: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335535.0  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335535.msg57380705#msg57380705  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335535.msg58109646#msg58109646  And it's not just about all the snapshots in time when EPIC was more profitable to mine. It is also all about the price performance over time. This guy has some great data on that: https://twitter.com/el_mcmurphyThe coin is rising in popularity. BTC took a long time to grow and there are plenty who still won't touch it. EPIC is right on schedule and will surpass all other cryptos.",

And it wasn't the final version. Final version will have very similar hashrates on Ryzen CPUs, a bit worse hashrates on Intel CPUs and at least ~15% worse hashrates on X5 (if they release new firmware)As for Intel CPUs, they will get slower (compared to AMD) on RandomX v2 in terms of absolute hashrate. But efficiency (RandomX instructions/J) will be better for both AMD and Intel CPUs. AMD CPUs will execute ~15% more instructions/J, Intel CPUs - around 5-7% more.The only reason Intel CPUs suck on RandomX is the lack of L3 cache.
