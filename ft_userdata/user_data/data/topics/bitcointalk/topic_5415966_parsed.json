If not gone beyond interactive games like video games and skilled card games, not playing with money makes it very different. But being a gamer makes casino games very easy if such a person want to start gambling on casino sites, but he has to learn the rules of gambling because being an expert in gaming does not mean the person is an expert in gambling. Nobody is an expect if compared to the sites that are providing the gambling services.",

Being a gamer, you understand logic already that you can see in the casinos, so, don't stop yourself if you want to try to gamble, just do it.There's no difference of motivation and mindset from being a gamer and a gambler, all you have to think is the same and that's to become stronger and for you to win, none other than that.",

Most famous games right now are rather puzzle-oriented story games and action, fast-paced games so I don't think they'd have a hard time playing casino games. Heck, they might even bore themselves to death at some point if they don't really enjoy gambling that much. Imo what differentiates a gambler from a gamer is that gaming directly gives you that enjoyment experience through games, while gambling is enjoying the game together with the thrill of winning more money (mostly the latter though tbf).",

You want to keep the person entertained there as much as possible, and also you want the person to come back again, so you get some addiction design thrown in.Similar things that work in game design work in gambling apps, so that's why they might seem like the same thing, or very closely related. The main difference is that at least in gaming you go back to it by trying to have fun(although lately this has changed a bit with companies trying to up-sell everything in games), whereas in gambling you go back to try to win money(or recover what you've already lost).",

A gamer in your description is playing hard in order to make money. And there's not a high risk with it. He just needs to level up and once reaching a certain level, he could just sell his account with a profit. That's for as long as there are buyers. That's not what's gambling in casino is all about. Gambling right from the start means risking your money. There's no guarantee whatsoever that there will be profit in the end. Most likely, there will instead be losses.",

Of course, the difference is that most probably gamers doesn't involved money, there are are also a lot games right now that is being played online and there are bets if I'm not mistaken. So there is an easy transition, just a question whether what will they choose, stick to gaming or just go and play online games and go with big money.",

A gamer plays to win. A gambler plays to win. But a gamer plays with nothing else but his skills and whatever his account or character reached in the game. In casino gambling, a player normally has no control whatsoever as to how the game ends. A gamer could turn down a challenge if the opponent is of a very high level and the match isn't fair. In gambling, the match will always be unfair because the house will always have the advantage or the upper hand. The house is always at an advantageous position to win. That's not the case in gaming.",

Although most people must not be a gamer to have interest in gambling, naturally some persons love gambling where they could do it for fun and also make new friends around. So it's to gaming, most people do go to play station to compete with their fellow gamers to know if they are improving or not at that point the gamblers might used such opportunities to place a bet among the two gamer which they might not know some people over there have already placed a bet upon their gaming.",

It depends on which kind of games you play and enjoy. Let's say you enjoy sport games like Fifa or NBA, there is no character or items progression than you could use to sell in the future and make a profit. Same goes for non main stream shooters. The real value is in big games like Dota, CSGO, etc. with millions of active players. I also think that most of the gamers are not looking for ways to make profits out of gaming and don't want to sell their accounts. If you spend a long time grinding and leveling your account up it becomes personal and in terms of profit it mostly not worth it compared to the hundreds of hours you put into the account. Most games need you to have good reflexes, they are not about evaluating risks like in gambling and have a good stomach to endure big down swings.",

I myself was an MMORPG gamer. I spend like $200 every month just to sustain whatever needs necessary to level up my character. The internet and electricity consumption and expenses is not included of course. After many months I decided to sell my character and you know how much it cost? Just around $500-$600. Most stuff in an online game you sold for money might never be enough to cover your monthly expenses. Expensive stuff usually requires expensive premium items to boost your character. Therefore, I cannot consider gaming as gambling. In gambling your only asset is your money, once it's gone you'll never take them back and make money out if it again. Also, gambling and gaming as it's own level of excitement and enjoyment when you're playing.",
