  "content": "A crypto investor, Crypto Tony, believes that since the market is often controlled by large investors, market conditions can change at any time. A temporary increase in the price of Bitcoin may be a strategy used to increase liquidity in the market. That is why he wanted to know the opinion of his followers on the X twitter platform for the purpose of investors.Tony thinks people are blindly investing because Bitcoin ETFs will be approved, what if it isn't? Some disagreed with his statement, saying they felt the SEC was too late to approve Bitcoin ETFs, and that is why they would approve the ETFs. Crypto Simon, a famous trader who agree with Tony, shares the same view that if ETFs are not approved, there could be a big fall in cryptocurrencies, which he believes everyone should be prepared in advance.Bitcoin reached its highest price in the last 1 year and four months with its price rising above $35000. However, Bitcoin has been quite bullish recently based on a fake news story about ETFs Approval. Despite the rumors, Bitcoin movement still in bullish trend. In this situation, if Bitcoin ETF applications are not approved, will Bitcoin not be bullish? Only 2 months left of this year. We expect a potential halving event for Bitcoin in the coming year of 2024. If the Bitcoin ETF is not approved by this time, could we still see a bullish movement in Bitcoin price Until the Halving event ends?",

Maybe successful ETF application could boost the bullish sentiment and result in a more explosive bull run with higher highs, but even without it the price is projected to grow.",

ETFs has made the bullish momentum come earlier than anticipated. Whether this is a fake out, time will tell.There's no better time for SEC to reject an ETF like this moment since Gary Gensler has proven that he cares not of the citizens funds protection but to act as a barrier to Bitcoin nigh inevitable rise. Even if it turns out fake there would only be a panic sell which would be re bought by dip buyers.I know the rise is a good thing but it has prevented some from accumulating more Bitcoin at a cheaper price towards the next halving. People like me that relies heavily on DCA have barely accumulated sustainable  amount. I personally feel the current news might be due to manipulation.",

      "body": "The ETF hype has been controlling market movements lately. Of course there will be several impacts that will occur if the ETF is accepted or rejected. If the ETF is accepted, this will bring some fresh funds to enter the Bitcoin market which will bring the price up even higher. And if on the contrary the ETF is rejected, there will be panic caused by some investors who are consumed by fake news and have already entered Bitcoin panicking will start coming out. And it might cause a price drop. However, many factors can influence Bitcoin prices, and ETFs are only a small part of them.",

      "body": "There is no question about it...the ongoing bullish trend is largely due to the supposed offing approval of an ETF application by  Blockrock in SEC. After the deadline to question or appeal the court decision favoring Blackrock, there is no other recourse for SEC but to deal with the pending application. The problem is that SEC is under a man who is unpredictable and is a known antagonist of the whole crypto industry...and we don't know if Gary has some hidden weapons under his sleeves that he can use  to eventually delay again or even reject the ETF application. There is another reason for the BTC bullishness and that is the coming halving in 2024 but this is being eclipsed by ETF right now...so in case there will be rejection then we can see BTC to be dumped on the road big time - a big opportunity for us to add more BTC to our portfolio to look at it half-full rather than half-empty.",

But if the ETF is approved, it will be even more beneficial for us because it is also considered a catalyst to help the market grow even stronger. The more catalysts there are, the stronger the market will grow and we will be the beneficiaries. But if it is not approved, there is nothing stopping bitcoin from making a new ATH.The main factor driving the bull season and maturation of bitcoin remains the demand for bitcoin, as long as bitcoin becomes more and more popular, bull season is inevitable.",

I agree about betting on the long term, but I would like to clarify that bull runs do not usually occur right after the halving but months later, and they have a logic, we do not expect a simple repetition of history. The reason is that they reduce supply, i equal or higher demand the price will rise. I think the spot ETF will initially add volatility. A quick rise at first but it may also bring the price down faster, although as the price and market cap rise the price will be more stable.",

However,  the positive impact on the market will be that it will act as a catalyst for the next bull market if it is approved, on the other hand, may cause a slight dump in the market if not approved, but that is gonna be a short term impact on the market because the market will absorb the selling pressure immediately or months later after the Bitcoin halving.  Bitcoin ETF is a way to make Bitcoin more available to those who are interested based on the institutional side of investors who don't have much confidence to invest in core Bitcoin, so they filed for ETFs to invest.ETF or no ETF I'm not relying on the outcome or Banking on it for my investment.",

But after that every etf disproved wasn’t as bad.So even if it’s rejected I think we will still stay above $25K or so. The larger issues is what is going on in the world.

Furthermore, if we want bitcoin to become popular and recognized worldwide, regulations or the like will be inevitable.
