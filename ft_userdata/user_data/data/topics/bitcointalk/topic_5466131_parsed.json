We have so many of such locally played games that are not possibly listed on casinos and that can be because casinos already have their hand full with so many other games that take their attention away from developing such games and implementing them in their casinos.",

Our bodies are not made to ingest such ridiculous amounts of food and people who do it often get serious problems with stomach contractions, since it's a muscle that can stretch, but stretching it too much damages it, just like any other muscle can be overworked and damaged, it's just that you can't fix this without a surgery and you can easily die from it. IMO eating competitions are much more dangerous than MMA and people often come unprepared. They don't know what can happen to them.Also, there's not much professional supervision, no real federation that cares about people playing by the rules. It's not a sport as far as I know.",

While I absolutely love cooking and food as many people do, I would say that this is not worth investing in or researching further due to the problems that the entire concept brings to the table in the first place.The problem that I would see manifest here is that gambling is something that should be done with probability based games and not anything else. Otherwise the entire game could be manipulated so that a fair game would become impossible. Like betting on chess games, even though the opponent could be using chess bots to cheat his or her way to victory.",

I don't think that this is a good idea, since it is too dangerous . What if the contestant choke while doing that? we can watched a live action of a man dying? I will not watch that maybe other people too. Also, most of the foods that i saw they are eating in a competition is fast food I am not saying that I am not eating those food but the thing is consuming a lot of it will not bring them in good shape.",

I have a friend that when we were young,he loves to partake in such competitions and he do always become the winner.There is a viral game called 'flip the bottle challenge ' which had massive audience recently and is still making waves. People get to flip a bottle to win a turn to have a big bite or sip at the food and drinks place in front of them. So many variations were seen on TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook. Infact social media was just all about this game. I think I can classify this food game as a competition, but if it gets turned into an online betting kind of fun app/platform, to me it qualify as a bet site or gambling site too. I don't know about manipulation, but we have seen worse games and bets with more that faithful competitors and organizer with integrity.",

I for once have taken part in a similar game like a food competition but the ultimate prize is always the portion of the hot food you consumed more than your opponen Wewe never bet with money anyways it was just for the fun and nothing else.",
