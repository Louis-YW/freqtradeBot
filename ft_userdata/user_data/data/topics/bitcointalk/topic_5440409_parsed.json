I have participated by writing crypto history books for moderate and smaller projects since 2014.  I want to write something special and informative for the Bitcoin community.  It will help newbies discover what has happened since inception in 2008.  I hope you don't see it as begging.  I seek to include members of the community in the effort (by small donations) to complete the book to the best of my ability. Thank you for replyingBesides, I have devoted countless hours to the Bitcoin and crypto space over 10 years.  I am not seeking to scam anyone x[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

If we're going to be honest, for many, the history of Bitcoin only begins at the end of 2017, when Bitcoin actually entered the mainstream.I can't say for sure, but it seems that I read on the forum a few years ago that someone had a similar idea as the OP, so although I have nothing against people writing books, a good part of the history of Bitcoin is also contained on this forum. In any case, I hope that the book will not promote things that have nothing to do with Bitcoin, as is usually the case nowadays.",

I’m aware of most of them, but others I haven’t heard about. I’m bound to find out more as I progress with the write-up. I’ve structured the book  in such a way that each chapter covers a single year. Each year has 16 pages including 10 major event pages (1 major event per page), 2 pages other events, summary page, price-metrics page, chart page and the initial title page. (I’m typing this quickly on my phone, so please ask questions if uncertain about my intentions)There will be a sufficient number of pages before the yearly chapters to document features of Bitcoin and define key principles. Ultimately, it will become clearer as time goes by how the book interior will evolve. I hope the community supports me as I continue progress (initial research took 3-4 months).I will post progress including page previews on this thread as time goes by. If I don’t post regularly, it means I’m busy writing ✍️ [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",
