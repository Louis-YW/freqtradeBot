  "content": "I purchased gear on Sept 22. It was supposed to be shipped in Oct and a coupon was supposed to be issued for 30% off my next purchase.Dealing with Lisa from bitmain and she simply refuses to acknowledge that I am due the promised 30% coupon.email chain is leading to nowhere.   philipma1957Nov 14, 2022, 10:43 GMT+8Maybe I am not clear enough. The 30% coupon is to be used on a future order. Not the order I paid for but for one in the future. Why would your company say you are giving a 30% off coupon for a future order and then not give it. It makes you lose the next sale. I have been buying from you since 2013. You never failed to issue a promised coupon for a future order. So now you are going to fail to send me a simple 30% off coupon for my future purchase? Seems to be a really poor way to get me to ever buy from you any more.   philipma1957Nov 14, 2022, 10:38 GMT+8Listen to me very carefully you advertised the s19j in September that you would ship it in 1 month and that 30 days after you shipped it you would issue a 30% coupon. this was on your website.I did this purchase. Because your website said you would send a 30% coupon. 30 days after the shipping date.  And now you are denying me the coupon. I have purchased from you many many times. I really do not understand why you are saying you did not have this offer. On your website.I placed the order on sept 21. I attached a screen shot of the order. In every order I ever made that offered a coupon I was always give my coupon. So what is the issue.Attachment(s)Screen Shot 2022-09-21 at 2.44.43 PM.png   Lisa (BITMAIN)Nov 14, 2022, 10:13 GMT+8Dear philipma1957I couldn't open below link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417006.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414433.0 That's not our website. You said,we will give you a coupon, that's from which BITMAIN link?I will check. Best regards,LisaBITMAINTo buy ANTMINERs, please log in to the website: https://www.bitmain.com/ Kindly be ware of phishing scams and always verify the domain name.\"Solved\" means we replied - we may still be working on your issue.   philipma1957Nov 14, 2022, 07:32 GMT+8when you sold the gear in september you promised that buys would get a coupon. I placed the order so you owe me 30% coupon .you advertised that we would get coupons for 30% if we purchased the goods.please read my threadshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417006.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414433.0you screwed up twice here. when I paid and now you act like i don’t get a coupon.Sad are you part.

I am due 30% coupons where are my coupons ?Please let me know when you give me my coupons for 30% off. thank you.The problem is they want a screen shot of the webpage that shows they were offering this 30% off coupon.I never have had issues on coupons they gave me every coupon I ever was entitled to getSo I did not take a  screen shot that shows they were getting a coupon if you got the gear.So I am out a 30% coupon unless some one has a copy of that page around sept 21 2022 that reads it.see below it is about when I got it but it is after they stopped the coupon offer.Quote from: philipma1957 on September 23, 2022, 02:42:06 PMQuote from: stompix on September 23, 2022, 10:58:59 AMGoing down again, not much and can I can see it changing any time but still not the same build-up as last time.QuoteLatest Block:   755338  (8 minutes ago)Current Pace:   97.6626%  (1355 / 1387.43 expected, 32.43 behind)Next Difficulty Change:   between -2.3358% and -2.0899%Pice down, the difficulty might be down, but god!, what new offers for new clients on electricity have been circulating around here..Get this, one of the \"top\" offers is at 110 Euros for 150kwh a month without subsidies, of course, the prices are subsidized till 200k kwh at ~25cents but if you go over it, it's 80 eurocents per kwh. Happy mining, everyone!!!Bitmain has dumped the price to 1900 for the 19Pro and I have some real problems understanding this:What am I missing here?instant ship on the one for edit 3230 3900 but uses 3250 watts and 95ththe one for 1900 is a 30 day wait.but the 1900 one also gives you 30% coupon.I order 1 of them the other day.100th and 2950 watts looks good enough for me.Waiting 30 days gives us time to clean the mine and redesign the cooling.I would love to get all 100th units at 2950 watts. lots of over head the psu should last longer.I would love to get s19xp doing 128th and 2700 watts 21 watts a thMy s17's held up running low and normal not turbo.Hoping the same for my s19's or s19 xp'sI found the link for the item I purchased but the coupon offer is not attached to it.https://shop.bitmain.com/en/product/detail?pid=00020220919144041252Ua2SetxW06D3I know there was a coupon offer with that unit.I will look more.",
