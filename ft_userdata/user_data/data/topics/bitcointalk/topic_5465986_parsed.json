Plus, competing with Binance, a powerhouse in the crypto world, might not be their priority. It seems like they'd rather focus on their main services - creating a secure and user-friendly platform for crypto transactions. They might explore ways to incorporate Base network into their current products or offer incentives to users. While an airdrop would be cool, I don't think Coinbase is going in that direction for now.",

ETH will be our native gas token. Be aware that scammers may send fake Base tokens. Avoid interacting with them.However, it's worth noting that some major L2 chains, e.g. Arbitrum, initially had no intentions of launching a token, but we all witnessed how that turned out.

It seems that Coinbase does not plan to release its token in the Base ecosystem, because the exchange already has many problems with regulators.They talked about it openly, but the situation is changing, and if this is useful, then perhaps they will change their minds and do everything in accordance with the law that should appear. And now the exchange is in first place in the USA, after Binance started having problems and other exchanges left the country.",

I think they'll launch an airdrop those who are early but they just kept denying it considering it will be just another easy farm from those who want to exploit it.

I guess they are working on it but they may take more time to launch their own coin because on numbers Coinbase is one of the biggest exchanges but they are still not in a comparable level with Binance which can be the actual reason for the delay or they don't really want to follow the footprints of other exchanges and working on a different strategy to make a profit and stick with the exchange alone.The actual problem is that Binance is not based in the US whereas coinbase US based company where there is regulations are strict and complex so they don't want to exhaust their resource until there is room for the actual need.",

I have missed feelings about basechain plans and how they quick to rush and announced that they are launching a typical chain without token but we all know that Coinbase alone cannot be a validator and the nodes and they Can't afford to pay the independent nodes and validators in another payment if they really want to keep the blockchain decentralized as possible. That said.There have been increased in lots of activities on their base chain recently, which means people are using the chain and testing it to strain it to some levels. If those values are true, then there is something people knows privately that the rest of the public don't know. It possible that people are giving it shot for potential Airdrop because that's what has been happening over the new blochains that are been launched over some months now, it's possible that a coin will be launch or people who are using the chain are probably speculating one to be later launch in the future.What I think about the chain from beginning is Coinbase want their chain to be clean and free from spam transactions, early testers are known for spammy transactions to get lots of shares when it comes to Airdrop, hence the reason why they say to the public of no coins. A company like Coinbase launching a blockchain will attract lots of attention and I say it's a good strategy to make it clean from the beginning. With time, they will launch their own coin or may be during the next bull run.",

At least, that's what I think the company will do. For what I know, there are a lot of airdrop hunters waiting to \"dump\" the new token for good. If Coinbase decides to launch a native token for the Base network, it might decide to \"skip\" the airdrop altogether. That will preserve the token's value over the long term. Whatever Coinbase decides to do with Base, you can rest assured it won't give up without a good fight.
