      "body": "$675 shipped (so technically $640 plus $35 for signature-required, insured shipping). Don't think I'd go any lower than that.^ this price/offer will be valid for the next 24 hours only, thus, will expire thurs the 23rd at 10 PM EST.After that price will bump back to my original updated amount of $850edit: Still $675!",
