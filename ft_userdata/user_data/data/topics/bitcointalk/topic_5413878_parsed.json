  "content": "Hello. I'm a long time player on bustabit. About 2 years ago I was wrongfully accused of being a problem gambler. I tried explaining to daniel that losing £20-50 at a time isn't problem gambling and that my salary can sustain these losses but he simply doesn't listen. He banned me for this suspicion. Permanent mute and permanent ban from the ability to wager. However, I have continued playing on VPN alts, where he usually finds out it's me after a day or two. This has probably happened 20 times, where he catches me on an alt mute evading and bans me. However, none of these times did he ban me from the ability to withdraw. Funnily enough, the only time he decides to ban me from the ability to withdraw is when I deposit a serious amount. That alone is proof of immoral behaviour. Every £20 deposit account I make he never banned from withdraw but when I deposit £800 he decides to do so. So I look at the TOS and notice there is nowhere that says he's allowed to do such a thing legally for the reasons he had. This is fraud, it's unjust and it's unfair. If I had known he was going to resort to banning withdraws I would have been long gone. But he didn't. Infact, he gave me *NO* upfront warning. Only warning he ever gave me was on email that I was going to be gamebanned. Never withdraw banned. He hasn't emailed me in 2 years, he ignores my emails, my pleads for mercy. What he did was illegal and I want him to see this and I want him to give the ability to withdraw again so I can get out and *NEVER* come back again. Now I know he's able, and willing to do such a thing, I'll never bring my business to his site ever again.@Devans@RHavarIf anyone can bring their attention to this post I'll greatly appreciate it. What he did breaks his own TOS and I want an explanation and the ability to take my money out. I have nothing left. Please",

I never *ever* deposit more than pocket change. The one time I do deposit more, he decides to lock withdraws. I broke none of the TOS in retrospect to the violations that are bannable by locked funds. And EVEN if I did, it says \"temporarily\" It would be ILLEGAL of him to permanently conviscate my funds even if I did break rules which were bannable by disabled withdraws.I already posted there but I'm trying to make as much 'noise' as possible to recieve an answer and ideally the immdiate ability to take my funds out and leave the site for good. The way he did it was immoral too. He waited until I did a big deposit which I can confidently say wasn't a coincidence since 25+ other banned accounts where I did small deposits never got the withdraw lock.",

      "body": "I am not sure what the reason is that they don't want you there anymore and why they would consider you a \"problem gambler\". I assume that means a gambling addict who wagers more than he can afford to lose. But whatever their reasons, you were told to leave and not come back. However, you kept trying to come in by using a VPN and cheating. At least 25 different times. I don't agree with the funds being confiscated, but then again, what will need to happen for you to understand you are not welcome? Being banned and shown the exit door over 20 times obviously isn't enough.",

Yet you still create accounts and do the same for 20 times the same as the admin gave you chance and let you withdraw you withdraw your small winnings. Probably, now they decided to take back of all of those winnings you get from 20 times. And there's nothing you can do about it. You don't need a warning anymore since you did multiple times already.",
