It is primary a derivative exchange and it is the only crypto native exchange as far as I know that you can trade options on Bitcoin with stablecoin outside the US. They have also a few other unique features.I'm also in the process of reviewing this exchange to see if it would be worth opening a account for myself. They seems secure and well-managed but they are not regulated and they exist only since 2018 if I'm not mistaken.",

Never trust anything by \"Volume\" information from exchange, most of exchange have insider bot doing a wash trading to make a fake volume. So they have a good total volume trading to raise their exchange rank.It's really simple to see the trading history is fake or not, you just need to see from history trading. Most of wash trading from the exchange it self, have a same interval trading time, the amount really small, and most of the history always have a small different token.",

Volume can be manipulated, if that exchange seems too good to be true better not to use it.Though it looks good for staying in the market for 4 years now and still have that volume, but to be more safe better to go for the best exchange and if you are going to trade some tokens try to look for the safer exchange where that token is listed to avoid any problem in the future.",

The two are differentI have never used the exchange before but after looking at the reviews on trustpilot and google play, the most common complaints are1. Slow withdrawals that can take more than 24 hours at times2. They have a habit of suspending the markets when the market crashes, even the most recent crash3. App freezes at times during volatile markets. You don't want that to happen when you have an open position.I suggest you read the reviews- https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.delta.exchange- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=exchange.delta&showAllReviews=true",

Bro to be honest I haven’t used the exchange.But upon doing some research, I found some info about the exchange in YouTube, many people have done a video on the exchange.There are two possibilities now, first of all the exchange is legit, so the people using it and making videos by reviewing it, else the exchange has done some paid promotions with the small Youtubers.It would be better if you just go for trusted exchanges like Binance or Kucoin. They are the best and no hassle with the security.Rest is upto you bro.",

As an example, you can write secured cash puts options there. This is not available on the biggest exchanges (Binance, FTX) outside the US afaik.This can hardly be called an advantage of the exchange. This is a very specific type of trading and most will never use these derivatives trading tools. The same dubious advantage as trading with x200 leverage. Yes, there is, but few people are interested in it. The same is true with these options functions.I'm sorry, comparing trading with x200 leverage on future with writing secured cash puts options make not sense. Especially when dealing with Bitcoin.  FYI options trading is harder to understand at the beginning than future. That's the main reason why it is not as popular as future. However, it offers many advantages over future in many situations. Many veteran traders are only trading options. Maybe less in crypto because the market is very young and the offering on options is still very limited.",

It sounds like the late etherdelta and forkdelta but only these two are a decentralized type of exchange while this one we have here is centralized since they ask for a phone number. I don't consider that as a kyc but a kyc to me is when you have been ask by a valid ID cards or passports and also undergone to a live selfie.This exchange can also be related to that defi exchange that you mentioned because both names are also identical to each other but the only way to find out or to be more sure is to visit them and start comparing them with the other site that you know. You can also message the costumer support directly and ask about this matter.",
