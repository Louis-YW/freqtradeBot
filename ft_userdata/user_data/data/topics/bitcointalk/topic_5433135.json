If there's a bug in the software; if not all, most of the users will experience that issue.Only suggest to report a bug once the issue is confirmed, otherwise there'll be lots of false reports that could waste the developers' time.Quote from: gunhell16* Probably, your wallet maybe locked.Bitcoin Core's wallets can be used and generate receiving addresses even when locked.Quote from: gunhell16* There is also a case where your wallet possibly in a \"WATCHING ONLY MODE\"   In this case, you are free to view your transaction records also your balance, but you can't able to    send bitcoin and can't able to create a new address too. Therefore, you need to change it into    \"FULL MODE\", and for you to do this you need to paste your private keys.Watching-only wallet in Bitcoin Core can produce new receiving addresses.Note: It's best for the OP, the forum and for you if you test your hypothesis first before posting them.",

Although button \"Create new receiving address\" is disabled if you create new wallet and choose \"Disable Private Keys\" or \"Make Blank Wallet\" on Bitcoin Core 23.0.I don't know what the argument is about because a blank wallet isn't watching-only until addresses/descriptors are imported... it's blank.",

You can generate new addresses even if your computer isn't connected to the internet. Take note that to see the receiving transaction(s) and spending the fund, you will have to download the full blockchain.",

For generating a new address, you don't have to sync your wallet. Quote from: gunhell16 on January 17, 2023, 12:24:31 PMYou should always use a new address for every transaction you are going to make for security purposes,It's recommended to use new addresses due to privacy reasons. That's not for security purposes.You can give the same address to hundreds of people and be completely safe.",
