I read an article titled Kamala Harris Seeks to Eradicate Bitcoin: Crypto in Danger. In her writing, Kamala explained that the nature of bitcoin as Anonymous, decentralized, and widely used for crime causes a lot of harm. So it seems that if Kamala becomes president, the regulations will be very strict. But maybe this is the case or not. Maybe one day he can change his mind.

I just do hope that all of them is open for changes and they should not look at bitcoin as political tool for them to increase their chance to win.Politicians should look for how useful bitcoin is and not the currency which has been used by criminals since its unfair since fiat also experience the same thing.",

You could therefore expect Bitcoin, under Harris, to plug right along like it has been doing.By the way, a Harris win will not be \"unexpected\": the polls right now are nearly even, and the Harris campaign is only a few days old, and she clearly has very strong momentum.In fact, I've read many pundits say that this will change the race entirely, because it will refocus the race on abortion and Donald Trump's criminality. The only thing Republicans talked about before was Biden's age--they never talked about policies because... Republicans lose when they talk about policies since they are so unpopular. And people forget that the United States has never elected a convicted criminal for president--and one would think it's likely it never will. In anything, it will be Trump to \"unexpectedly win\", not Harris.",

So you don't need to worry too much if the Democratic Party continues to win this election. During Mr. Biden's 4 years in office, although he had harsh and unfriendly policies towards bitcoin, you could still see bitcoin constantly growing, so even if Kamala Harris was elected, nothing serious would happen. Everyone is looking to Trump because he will be the first US president to support bitcoin if elected, people are expecting him to create a strong breakthrough for bitcoin if he keeps his promise. That's what's going on.",

If she comes up with stricter policies, other countries might end up becoming a haven for the Bitcoin business.

It just isn't true.Adding regulations to the market and enforcing financial laws increases the price of Bitcoin because it allows average investors to safely invest.Do you want another FTX fiasco, that dumped the price of Bitcoin by 75%? Vote for Trump. Trump is a criminal who favors criminals and vows to let criminals loose on consumers. This will send Bitcoin buyers heading for the hills.",

Its important for US citizen as cryptocurrency holder or trader, give your vote for candidate want to give space for bitcoin become legal digital payment transaction and previously Donald Trump have announced his self will support bitcoin, he has collected 4 million dollar as donation from cryptocurrency for his election campaign. Excited to see any US government one day later have good viewed about bitcoin by giving space as legal commodity assets until becoming legal payment currency transaction.",

For now, some are feeling optimistic because of her age and roots in California, but we'll certainly need more than that. Alternatively, we might see the crypto position reflected in her VP choice. It's too early to say for sure, but I don't think she has any reason to choose an anti-crypto stance.In any case, I'll reiterate that I hope US citizens make cast their votes based on more strategically important points rather than based on what candidates say about cryptos.",

Since America is the country that has the more influence in crypto, it’ll just move away to another place but crypto will still continue to be regardless.

On the other, it's also expected that Republicans will say these things to show the difference between her and Trump, like it's all black and white only (Trump for bitcoin and Harris against it). I wouldn't trust any politician when it comes to these promises. Both of them are probably going to suck as presidents, but Trump is going to suck less What if she wins... it's quite probable that she will since she's behind only a few % and there will surely be a debate so we'll see what the polls say in a month. Personally I'd never vote for a socialist and if there are rumors that she will be bad for bitcoin, you people should wake up because she's going to bad for money. All socialists are bad for everything: money, economy, taxes, stocks, you name it.",

There's simply no evidence of this.Under Biden:Bitcoin went up by 500%.SBF--a big-time Democrat donor--was put in prison for his crimes, sending a clear message to fraudsters and clearing the way for mainstream investors to buy Bitcoin safely (and unlike with Trump, it won't matter how much you donate to the ruling party).The Bitcoin and Ether ETFs were approved, making it so anybody in the USA can buy into Bitcoin as easily as they can buy any stock.This is not a picture of a president who \"hates Bitcoin\" or is \"out to get Bitcoin\" or wants to \"end Bitcoin\". The Bitcoin market grew and thrived under Biden, and it will under Harris.And meanwhile, Trump promises radical change to the US economy, starting with deporting 5% of the US workforce immediately in the largest deportation operation in history. And the criminalization of millions of abortions in the USA is going to require a new police state bigger than even the old, \"War On Drugs\" police state--and police states tend to... hate things like Bitcoin.The safe bet in the 2024 election in the USA is to stick with what has worked, which is Biden and now Harris, not take a chance on a convicted criminal like Trump.",
