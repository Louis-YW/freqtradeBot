Is it only promotional, as you said?In my opinion, the way to \"support\" Bitcoin is to scale it, running as many nodes and miners as we can. I don't think there is anything else that can be done to support bitcoin. But I am curious to hear your thoughts.Finally, there is El Salvador that uses Bitcoin as a formal currency (not the primary currency but rather the secondary currency).",

Bitcoin is decentralized and doesn’t need any centralized entity to do anything. Once bitcoin has an organization or entity like this then anything that affects that organization will definitely affect bitcoin too. Bitcoin has grown through thick and got this adoption rate today without all this. What bitcoin needs only developers, full node runners and probably the core bitcoiners to use it properly but others any organization will be manipulated by the government.",

Of which these set of people are already giving their support to bitcoin. The only way that I see that we individuals can support bitcoin is by using bitcoin the way that it was designed, which is for decentralization.We should stop using a decentralized coin in a centralized manners. We should promote the decentralized nature of bitcoin by using DEX for our privacy. It wouldn't cost us much.This forum was created to support bitcoin, because of the categories of people mentioned by @EL MOHA are in this forum.",

Bitcoin is naturally decentralized; there is nothing like a third party in bitcoin, which is why it cannot be tempered with, but its means of transacting can be monitored, especially if you use centralized exchanges that are regulated by the SEC and other government agencies.Not your keys, not your coins, should always be remembered and put into consideration to avoid our wealth being controlled by any third party or government, because if you hold your bitcoin in an exchange, you will not have full control over it.",

Bitcoin has rises beyond all hurdles and I think they can stand on their own today without being facilitated by any organization or group. Remember bitcoin is a decentralized currency and by creating such organizations, it can affect the price of bitcoin in the global marketplace. All organizations that have already started accepting bitcoin as a means of payment, we the users that use it as a means of exchange/transaction, the miners and all other communities that are in one way or the other contributing to the development of bitcoin is enough for it. The day a physical organization is created solely to help support bitcoin, then the market will become more speculative by them which is what is avoided by many.",

Centralized exchanges and custodial services all cooperate with the government, but such services do not 'represent' BTC in itself. If people decide to give their data and funds to centralized services or buy BTC etf stocks instead of holding their keys, then it is their choice and it does not reflect the entire network or its users.",

Well,  it will be good if there is a group or organization that supports bitcoin as a currency; they mainly promote bitcoin or the usage of crypto currency, and among the members, they are using crypto currency as their mode of transaction. But if the group or organization has only a small number and can't grow because of where they are, then that group or organization will struggle to maintain their group. So it will be worth it if the place you are in has a majority of people who are open-minded or open to new discoveries and aren't afraid to try anything new. Remember, a group or organization will be called an organization if there are a lot of people who support it and are ready to spread the mission and vision of that group. I'm sure there are many communities that are centered on bitcoin and crypto currency; they are just on the internet.",

If there is one big contribution that has helped with the support and adoption of Bitcoin even years ago, there's no doubt that the gambling industry is the one. With the acceptance of Bitcoin deposits, that have given the long span of Bitcoin adoption and made it as their main currency for their business.
