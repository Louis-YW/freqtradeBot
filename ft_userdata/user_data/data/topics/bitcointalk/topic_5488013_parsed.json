      "body": "Nowadays Bitcoin mining activities have become more efficient and greener compared to several years ago. Many Bitcoin miners have started using renewable energy to support their Bitcoin mining activities, and this provides a good opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining globally. The facts show that energy usage in Bitcoin mining is even lower than banking (https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/research:-bitcoin-consumes-less-than-half-the-energy-of-the-banking -or-gold-industries), so attacking Bitcoin because of its energy use and environmental sustainability issues is just propaganda made up to distort people's views on Bitcoin.",

Because if it did then people would be saying it even the miners that are directly involved in bitcoin mining would be saying about their impact if they've got any. I think we all should start not blaming anything or anyone, we should probably start doing something about how we get those energy, that's the simple solution to what you're trying to protest about, utilizing the renewable energy is probably the best choice here if you want, or you could also go nuclear energy route, that could power a civilization.

Let it remain that way. we understand that bitcoin is decentralized and outside of governments regulations but that's not to say that if the activity of miners goes against the government regulations and is contributing to destroying our ecosystem we should support it. That being said, there are far worse industries whose activity impact our ecosystem negatively compared to Bitcoin and yet the government isn't saying much about it because they are directly or indirectly benefiting from it.Since Bitcoin mining has been discouraged in different parts of the world, the number of miners has not grown as it should have grown and there had been modifications and improvements in the whole energy consumption rate that has made Bitcoin mining environmentally safe foroay users.",

      "body": "Honestly Bitcoin is the best sustainable cryptocurrency.Bitcoin mining is a game of finding the cheapest, most wasted electricity. Naturally that is eventually going to settle on ONLY wasted electricity, because that will be far cheaper than competing with electricity used by society.There just has never really been anything before that has operated in this way. So Bitcoin mining started out just being done on computer on the grid, then it became a big industry and tended to find power generation areas with low use like big hydro electric areas, as well as areas with excess cheap fossil fuels. Then it became really big business and now is starting to operate at power plants, using excess energy and strengthening the power production industry, which is great for society. Still early staged of this transition though.Eventually, when society moves more significantly to renewable resources, Bitcoin is going to be a huge boon to those generation stations by having miners pay to operate on excess power, making renewables even cheaper. As well as building out renewable power plants in stranded locations to secure the bitcoin network with stranded power.Only reason people today think Bitcoin mining isn't environmentally sustainable is because they don't understand how it works, the economics of it, the point of it, the market forces at play in the mining industry, and because society still uses a ton of fossil fuels so anytime bitcoin miners use fossil fuels people (hypocritically) say its bad while they go home and use fossil fuels themselves, and finally because we're still at the stage of the development of the industry where some people are still running mining operations on-grid competing with household power needs, raising power costs for people. Bitcoin mining is kind of in a somewhat ugly middle growing phase. It's direction as a powerful environmentally sustainable good for society is already obvious to those fully versed on the mining industry, but the reality today is that much of the mining is still exhibiting the sort of bad habits that will eventually be eliminated by market forces, like still lots of fossil fuel use and raising energy bills in some places. Any business in the mining industry should be focusing on gearing their operations toward renewables, excess, and stranded energy, as that is the natural direction of the industry due to market forces, and the sooner mining goes to that the less flack Bitcoin mining is going to get from politicians, the media, and the average person who doesn't know better and just repeats what they see in headlines about bitcoin mining.",
