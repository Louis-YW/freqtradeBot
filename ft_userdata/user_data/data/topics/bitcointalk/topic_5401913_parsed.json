Of course, FUD and lack of trust go hand in gloves, that is the same situation with Luna project, after it crashed and all, the team have been trying to get the project back up in all sorts of ways, but i am afraid it is all going to be futile, the community already lost trust in the project and that means many investors are not going to buy it (lack of demand). And a coin/crypto without ample demand is more or less headed for the grave. That is the reason why Bitcoin is the way it is today, a greater portion of the community trust it to be a long term project cause of it has an actual utility, they (the community) know that irrespective of whatever happens (plunge/correction/etc) in the short term, it is always going to rise back up again.",
