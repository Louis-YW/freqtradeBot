Will you quit the gambling for that month and give the allocated money to the poor family or will you prefer to gamble as you can't live without gambling ?In my case yes, but we see quite a few people in this same forum with problems to control their gambling behavior, going over the budget repeatedly. So I doubt that these people would stop gambling to help others.First they will have to solve the problem they have and only when they are well they can move on to help others. The question is a bit of a trap, because responsible gamblers will have no problem doing it, the problem is gamblers with compulsive behaviors.",

Will you quit the gambling for that month and give the allocated money to the poor family or will you prefer to gamble as you can't live without gambling ?The answer would depend on how the other person urgently needed the money. However, I would rather choose to help them but not to the point that I'll be giving the my whole gambling allocation for a whole month. I can try to provide them with some financial assistance which is at least the amount that I can provide without compromising the whole gambling activity for a month. Still, If the family that requires my assistance is somehow who is a relative of mine or even a friend or love ones then the choice would be obvious to halt my gambling activity and help them as much as I can especially if the needed help is urgent such as an emergency.",

So, this type of help is condition based as you will probably help with the winning amount but not willing to sacrifice your current amount allocated for gambling.Anyways, if I found anyone in trouble, especially in my family or neighbors, i will definitely quit gambling for a month and help the needy.",

I wouldn't say that I'm an addict but I would prioritize myself, even if you consider it over helping others. Quote from: Poker Player on September 18, 2022, 04:16:39 AMThe question is a bit of a trap, because responsible gamblers will have no problem doing it, the problem is gamblers with compulsive behaviors. Â It's not so much a trap question rather the answers pretty much force the reasoning in black and white only. If you can't give it, then you're an addict, if you can, then you're not when in reality there can be a few reasons for not helping people. Not wanting to help does not equate to being an addict in gambling imo.",

It depends. I'm not that generous and would help if I know more about the poor person/family and why they are in a bad situation. I wouldn't help people, who are alcoholics, drug addicts, gambling addicts, criminals, etc. because giving money to such people wouldn't help them at all. It would only make their situation worse.The dilemma between gambling and charity isn't an actual dilemma, because most gamblers would simply choose both, I guess.",

An addicted gambler's mind is abnormal. They give highest priority to gambling.Those who have financial support and are not addicted to gambling will definitely be interested in helping those poor people. But there can be some exceptions here. Because there are many addicted gamblers who are emotionally driven and always try to help the poor.",

If he/she thinks that it is worth to help those poor family then so be it, do what you think is the best for you.And then maybe if you still have some money, then continue to gamble. Or there could be individual not willing to help, not because they don't want to, but for them they also have problems and they don't reach to others specially if it involves money.",

In my opinion if you shall help them but you didn't need to give whole of money for them and sometime you need your money. It's not always about gambling but you must have some reserved funds in your wallet. You can use small amounts of money for that thing. In this case anyone has their own personal opinion.",
