It won't be surprising to get a lot of spam in this thread with users leveraging the fact that, there aren't any rule set to limit or offer some moderation to the thread and contest. I'll advice you put rules such as;Unofficial Rules* One trier per account* No alt account participation* Limit participations to ranks (To avoid this looking like some bounty threads)* Users can or are free to edit there posts until 8th August 11 : 59 forum timeThis would go a long way to cut down some abuses that could result in some low level spam by some cunts and low level piece of shit that are constantly looking to earn some quick money on the forum. You can consider a few other rules too.",

But it's not entirely clear to me how to determine if the accounts are connected to each other?It would just act as a deterrent, it does not mean that you'd start looking for connected accounts that have joined your competition, you'd just have to include it as a rule so member's would understand that it isn't allowed. That doesn't mean it will stop some member's from trying to join the competition with alts, but by doing so they have broken the competition rules, and they can be tagged if they are caught.Just take it as every other rule we have out there, it does not mean people won't attempt to break it, but it is there so if they are caught they do not say there was no rule against what they did, so that way you will reduce the number of offenders as people would not want to get into trouble, and those who go on to break the rules might be caught. Don't trouble yourself looking for connected accounts that break rules, there are members here who will do that for you.Quote from: Strongkored on July 26, 2022, 03:22:10 PMbut since there will only be one winner, it seems that concentration on multi or alt accounts is not very important because no one will be able to get the two prizeBut someone that joins the competition with more than one account, with different slogans on all accounts has increased their chances.On the topic, let me go think about a suitable slogan, i will either edit this post with it, or make a new one, cheers!",

So this should be forbidden. But alts will not be concentrated on, but one day, the alts can be connected and linked to be controlled by the same user. Then the result for such as he participate in this type of contest if noticed would likely be red tag. Having the rules at least will make many users to avoid using their alts as different users regarding this.",
