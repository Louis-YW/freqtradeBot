This will lead us to who uses these services, is it a beginner or someone who knows the basics of encryption.If he is a beginner, then Telegram, WhatsApp and many solutions that provide secure private messages compared to such services.If someone knows the basics of encryption, then many open source programs such as PGP can work. I even thought that this site enables you to encrypt a message with a private key.I used to think that it is like those services that pay some bitcoins for the message to be opened, and it is good for those who want to sell digital products such as gift cards for bitcoins, and also this service does not include that because there are no payments in bitcoins.Quote from: joniboini on June 14, 2023, 01:46:52 AMMaybe they will share secret links or screenshot with someone else, things that you don't want other people to know but need to be shared with your partner for your purpose.they can share texts only, so that it calls notes",

It is inevitable to discuss who use them and for what purpose, but seeing that service like this exist and even scammers are trying to make phishing websites, it is safe to assume some people do use them. It is definitely not the best option for security or privacy, so I guess those who use them believe the tradeoff is worth it. Or if they are a beginner, they simply don't want to look for other options since they think this is good enough for them.

Immediately that should be an indicator that it exist. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think that you need to download something from that website before they can access your device from inside out, visiting a website is just cookies right but downloading something is different right? Still scary though these copycat website, they benefit from confusion and they've been doing this for a long time even before bitcoin, and they still get victims. Website names don't havw mistakes, the scammer can't use the real website name so they bank on the fact that someone misspells the legitimate website, the mistake in the name of the fake website isn't a mistake, they try to buy the name that's most likely to be result of misspelling.",

CMIIW.Right, but I believed that there are still some crypto enthusiast that thinks using this kind of self destructive note is safe from the prying eyes of hackers and online criminals.Thanks to the OP for giving us the warning, although this is not the first time that we have heard this kind of attack vector. And I think it is still very effective method for criminals that's why they keep on recycling and creating this kind of websites and even using Google to trap and victimized us.",
