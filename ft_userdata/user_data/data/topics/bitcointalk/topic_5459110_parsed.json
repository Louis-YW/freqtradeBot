And this seems 100% correct. \"* with full asic resistance system (testing the system)\"This is a lie, there is no asic resistance, he is launching same kaspa algo and sets mining pools to solo.Why? Because he will proxy all of your traffic to kaspa pools and try to get kaspa solo blocks off them using your hashrate while proxy rewarding you some worthless coins. If you own KS0 or other asics don't even think of putting them on this as you will be losing 200$+ of kaspa per day.",
