This is a good plan because if really the plan project is achieve. Electricity is one of the major issue in the mining of bitcoin field.https://www.instagram.com/p/CtHFk6BAXCl/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ== you can get more on the above link to support your comments.",

You add water and turn it into steam the steam drives a turbine.You recycle the steam and let the volcano heat it again.In a sense its clean energy.Ie volcanos are dirty but give heat.This adds no extra dirty and lets the heat be used and not be wasted.The volcano would give the same fumes and dirt if you left it alone.So no added dirt and fumes.Plus you make power.",

I believe it is called geothermal energy, taking advantage of the heat produced by volcano since geothermal energy is heat generated withinÂ  the earth.Â  It also includes volcanic activities.Â  It is not a new technology and was around since 1904 when the first geothermal power plant where invented at the Larderello dry steam field in Tuscany, Italy, by Prince Piero Ginori Conti[1]Â  Also Iceland is known to use volcanic activity for their electricity[2].QuoteIceland, a nation famous for its volcanic activity, also gets much of its energy from volcanoes. This geothermal power accounts for 25% of electricity generation in the country and 66% of its overall primary energy useIt is a smart move for El Salvador to develop mining farm using Volcano energy because geothermal energy is known a clean and at the same time renewable source of energy.[1] https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-saver-101-history-timeline-geothermal-energy#1901[2] https://environment.co/geothermal-energy-from-volcanoes/",

The thing that you're referring as \"dustbin energy\" is actually energy generated with the garbage that's thrown as waste. The energy actually comes from the solid part of that waste when it's burned in waste-to-energy plants. When the wastes are burned a stream is produced in boiler which is then used to power a generator based turbine. You can also call the thing as biomass-generated energy and it powers the generators which in turn supply energy. The energy generated from Volcanos is often called Geothermal energy and that comes from the heat of the Earth's crust. This type of energy often works when heat from volcanos is captured with the help of running water which in turn converts into steam, that steam is then used to spin the turbines and the electricity is generated. The Geo-thermal energy is renewable and it could be very helpful source of energy for the miners who have access to it. The type of energy is not for all miners because it's abundant in those areas of the world where volcanos exist. Well, I think El Salvador's Government has taken a very nice step for the Bitcoin miners. However, I believe that the cost of mining won't reduce with such type of energy source because it could cost the government huge sums of money to create such power-plants that could capture the geothermal energy.",

Well, I think El Salvador's Government has taken a very nice step for the Bitcoin miners. However, I believe that the cost of mining won't reduce with such type of energy source because it could cost the government huge sums of money to create such power-plants that could capture the geothermal energy. Â For good efficiency Geothermal power plant requires hot water with a temperature above 100 degrees. This requires drilling the earth for several kilometers. The pumps will consume a lot of electricity, so this is not the easiest way to generate electricity and depends on the location. And the temperature of the water on the surface of the earth in such sources is 30-40 degrees Celsius.",
