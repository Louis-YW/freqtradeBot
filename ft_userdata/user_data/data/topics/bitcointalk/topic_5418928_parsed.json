  "content": "​​Constellation provides speed, security, and \"layer-zero\" consensus in its network (Hypergraph) and transportation protocol (HGTP) without explicitly required fees. Through the creation of state channels with advanced programmable business logic, extension of core consensus module to layer one network specific use cases, you'll have innumerable opportunities to develop peer-to-peer networks. You can also leverage our ecosystem to provide immediate value to users and derive mutual economic benefits.The Hypergraph network is a decentralized protocol made up of multiple independent networks known as state channels built on top of the HyperGraph. Each state channel validates and processes data according to their own internal business logic and custom consensus mechanisms before submitting their state as snapshots to the global L0 network. The global L0 performs final validation and then adds the state channel snapshot to the ledger. The benefit of this approach is a parallel to the reasoning behind why microservice state isolation is used in conventional industry. State should not be managed exclusively by a global linear ledger, but rather updates should be constrained to their exclusive logical service boundaries.They have partnered with the US AirForce, AWS and many more gubernamental contracts.",
