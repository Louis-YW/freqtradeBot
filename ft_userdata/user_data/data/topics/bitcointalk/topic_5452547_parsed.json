The more regulations become strict and shitty the more users will suffer and will end up using DEX. Well, if there is good on their taste.Maybe we will see another big exchange stop operating on this strict regulatory policy of these countries, next is in EU or maybe it already happened.",

I wonder where this stems from exactly: - The need to protect against anything that could threaten a government-based stable-coin or- Protection for stable-coin users because of the fear that they may be innsuficiently backed which could result in massive losses when the card-house collapsesIn any case, I wonder why Binance doesn't just shut-out any stablecoin based trading on their platform instead of a complete withdrawal from Canada.",

I simply wish Binance had made the proper decision by entirely discontinuing operations in Canada, despite the fact that the restrictions only apply to the use of stable coins. It will have a significant impact on the people there using Binance, and I assume Binance has made it easy for them to access and withdraw their assets.",

So I do not think there is anything like that coming up. According to what I check just now on Cointelegraph OKX and Binance are still the only centralized exchanges that have withdrawn from Canada. Also an Ethereum decentralized exchange dYdX. Including a crypto brokerage provider, Paxos. Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-calls-it-quits-in-canada-blames-new-rulesOKX pulled out of the Canadian market in March. It was followed in April by the decentralized exchange dYdX and blockchain fintech Paxos.There are some well known international exchanges that are providing crypto exchange services to Canadians. I scrolled down this link below to check the lists of countries Kucoin is providing crypto exchange services for and Canada is one of them.https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/exchange/kucoin/reviewWell known exchanges in Canada: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/",

It is because Binance is not able to meet the new regulatory policy concerning stable coins.This is bad, as far as I know in Canada Legality or crypto exchanges are generally legal there, even though there are several statutory policies that have been determined by the Canadian government regarding crypto exchanges operating there. Binance is one of the exchanges that is well received by the Canadian community in general.Besides Binance there are several other exchanges operating in Canada that are well received, such as BitBuy, Kraker, KuCoin and others, I wonder whether other exchanges like I mentioned will follow in Binance's footsteps too, due to the regulatory policies carried out by the Canadian government. .....!As I saw in one of the sources, Binance is still looking for the best solution in Canada.QuoteBinance added they did not agree with the new regulations but still hoped to work with Canadian regulators to further develop the regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.Remembering and considering the policies conveyed by CZ against Canadian citizens.QuoteChangpeng Zhao (CZ) is a Canadian citizen. So that Binance's exit from Canada is considered a sentimental thing.",
