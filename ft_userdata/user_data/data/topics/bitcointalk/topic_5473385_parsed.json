  "content": "India is the new leader of the global south .... And a replacement for China ?China has recently started to openly surrender its position. both politically and economically.politics is not the place to discuss, but the economy leaves much to be desired. Although it is partly a consequence of politics )But to the main point - in the \"Global South\" today there is a situation when yesterday's leader, China, can no longer fulfill this role (although it wants to), and no one can take this place except India, due to many reasons.At the same time, India looks much more attractive to the \"Global West\" than China, which has decided to go into a dictatorship inside, and has a rather dubious foreign policy. China has ceased to be a profitable global factory, plus purely political contradictions with the West. It was the outflow of Western investments, and the decline in demand of the Western market for products manufactured in China, that became the catalyst that accelerated the 3 processes:- Import growth- Reduced exports.- And as a consequence, a shrinking trade surplus.At the same time, a very complicated situation is brewing inside China with a chain of bankruptcies of budget-forming companies. Of course, China will hide it, but as they say \"you can't cheat arithmetic, and 2+3 will never be 10\". Another problem is the relocation of Western assembly sites from China. Large regional high-tech companies are also leaving Chinese sites - for example, Samsung.And guess where all this is moving to ? That's right - to INDIA ! Stable, predictable, adopting the Western vector of development, and moving away from contacts with \"dubious countries\". India does not \"beat in hysterics of dedolarization\", does not conduct dubious negotiations, and does not support economic terrorism of some other countries against the world economy. India benefits from stability, long-term mutually beneficial relations with the developed world, a well-deserved place in the world economy and financial system, and realization of its regional ambitions, which China is beginning to lose by failing to implement 2 projects:- \"Yuanization\" of the BRICS countries- An attempt to \"put the same BRICS club members on the needle\" of importing Chinese products.It was a poorly concealed but absolutely understandable attempt to save the economy, but ...What about India? A country with a huge territory and great human potential, developed industry, and long-established ties with the Western world. India has a very good education, and not a small middle class, with good education from western educational institutions. In India, stealing Western technology is not part of the economy as it is in China, for example. In terms of logistics to EU and African countries, India is more conveniently located. Plus in India there is no problem of population aging, which started to give itself in China \"thanks to\" the policy - \"one family - one child\". It is also worth paying attention to the IT market - it is perfectly developed in India and continues to compete with other markets. Plus - wiser, more balanced and liberal business policy is what China is losing and will not contribute to the free development of the economy.So the question is - what do you think about India's potential, opportunities and prospects, in light of the idea of India becoming at least the economical \"Head of the Global South\", and possibly \"one of the poles of the world system\" ?",

But, uh. And China has been on its way to that status for decades. And it's all been sustained by Western investment, direct and indirect. Today China, as it seems to me, is overestimating its current status, and has begun to behave... how can I put it softer, let's say \"arrogant\" and consider itself a necessary part of the world economy, a part for which there is no substitute and will not be. at the same time, I see the main problem of China in its internal \"restructuring\" focused on the usurpation of the economy by the state, which destroys the free, competitive economic model, and will lead to stagnation of private business in the country. And it is India that can take advantage of this, and with the help of Western investors, pull a significant part of what China gave to the world market. But yes, it's going to take more than one year. Probably a period of 5 to 10 years or more.",

I really hope to travel to India soon, to be able to experience and feel the reality of their lives, from the pictures that my friends shared before, some things that I admire are that they have a very impressive history, but the economic issue is not praised much, but it is easy to admit that they are developing very quickly.",
