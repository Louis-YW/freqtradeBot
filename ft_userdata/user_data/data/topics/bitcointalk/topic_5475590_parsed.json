  "content": "In April, a client reached out to me via Telegram for a writing project. Eager to do this job, we agreed on terms, and they committed to paying $4000 for the job. An upfront payment of $2500 was made, setting the stage for what seemed like a promising collaboration.However, the tale took an unexpected turn when, after the initial contact, my client vanished into the digital abyss. Messages went unanswered, and my attempts to reach them proved futile. It was as if they had been swallowed by the virtual void.Fast forward more than seven months later (yesterday), a flicker of hope emerged. A Telegram notification lit up my screen, and to my surprise, it was from the long-lost client. Excitement quickly turned to suspicion as the messages unfolded. The person chatting with me was definitely not the client becase he knew nothing about our deal and rather was fishing for information from me.Red flags waved as I realized that the digital landscape had shifted. The client's display name was the same until 24 hours later when it was changed from Alex Merg to John B. (so obviously fake).  Alarmed and wary, I took a step back to assess the situation. The disappearance of my original client, coupled with the change in name, raised concerns about the legitimacy of the individual on the other end of the screen. It begged the question: Was this the same client, or had their account fallen into the wrong hands? Since this client held a large amount of crypto, could he have lost his phone and more? Was he kidnapped?Beware of the Telegram account @roii99s, as it appears to now be in the hands of a criminal. Whether the original client's phone was lost or a more sinister plot is at play, it serves as a reminder that the digital realm requires constant vigilance. If you have a suggestion on how to report this to law enforcement such as Interpol, do let me know. Every crypto holder should also be careful out there, especially if you're a whale.Update: Another writer is accusing Alex of scam as seen here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454791.msg62339214#msg62339214. Personally, I wouldn't subscribe to that since he hasn't even been active on blockchain since May. Moreso, I only did half of the job with the anticipation that he would pay up before completing it. Further more, he's got more than enough coins to decend to the level of scamming a measly $1,500 or $2,500 from me and steve5946 as the case may be.Who would know a Telegram user with username Jesse Cooper? I don't know how they found out that Alex gave me a job and what link they have. This particular individual actually tried discouraging me from doing the job after receiving payment from Alex.",

In my country, if your mobile number is inactive for some months, the service provider will sell the number to another customer, which could also be a possible means for someone to use and recover the telegram from the old users. Or it could also be that, as a result of what Hugblack mentioned, scammers making use of online mobile number providers for social media verification who have a higher network or pay more can get your own number from you and restrict your access, so that could also be the case. So in the writing job that you were given to conduct, there is no private information given to you that could be used to track down your clients that give you work if you really want to get your work done or refund the money.Quote from: OgNasty on November 26, 2023, 04:40:33 PMCrazy story.

But this is an old story that was then pumped back up by the OP under the pretext of warning others about the potential for fake people controlling his client's telegram account. If the OP is honest and has no other motive - then it would be logical for him to send the bitcoin back to his client's address without shouting to find out where the client is, especially since he knows his client is a large crypto owner.QuoteAlarmed and wary, I took a step back to assess the situation.

Who would dare to trust online and instantly send a decent amount of money and then vanish all of a sudden? Is this some kind of a trap or a joke or whatsoever. But the way I understand it, the first user might have compromised his account and now other person has been using his account and he's trying to put you in a situation where its like nobody happened and he was the same user you have been in a conversation in the previous months.My best advice for you is simply to block that account. If he's really a scammer, then the more that you'll get rid of him and never entertain him again. On the part of the original user you have been in agreement, if he's still alive, I think he's still in the process of trying to access to you so just wait for that time to come.",

If the person doesn’t trust an escrow then you will see for yourself that he is scammer. Another thing again concerning Escrow is never use the one provided by the other party making the payment because most of them turn out to be scammers too working together. As for OP I don’t see kidnap in this case because you can’t just kidnap someone and be using their phone it will be easy to track you down by that if law enforcement agencies who should definitely be looking for the kidnapper get involves",

I’ve been a victim of one in the past, where not only did I get my identity stolen, I also lost all my crypto saved from hot wallets (I was holding around 6000 SLPs that time and this was back when Axie Infinity’s still something for the crypto industry.

Just block the new person and the problem is solved. Whenever the old person resurfaces, they can always reach via your telegram handle. I don't think that money is the issue here, it was a upfront payment to the OP, so obviously he did the job and just waiting for the rest of the money for the completion. However, the person that he talks to Telegram suddenly disappear and then resurface as some time with a new name and that's why he is asking if it is still the original person that he talks that deposit $2,500 or a different one.If it is a different person so when the hell does the original person that contacted him and give him the job and the downpayment?So it's really hard to give advise here, we can all speculate as to what happen to the original person (I assume the OP thinks that hew as kidnapped?). Or it is still the same person, why he went silent after half a year and it seems that he is not concern with his $2,500 or if the job has been finished as agreed and on time?",
