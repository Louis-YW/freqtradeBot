  "content": "Our reply to the alleged old letter from Osama Bin Laden to Americans on why he was fighting and opposing them One of the most interesting parts of the letter is where he claim that *Muslims are the inheritors of Moses and of the \"real Torah\" that has not been changed*, and also claimed that Muslims are followers of Moses, and this Moses followers have been promised the right to \"Palestine\" (the land of Israel) in Torah What he didn't let us know is what makes the Torah used by Israelites/Jews not the real one, or what was changed in the Torah?Did he not know that the real Torah was for the Children of Israel and strangers who become part of Isreal? If you followed the Torah as a stranger or someone from the world, you have actually become part of Isreal and will work to defend her rather than fight her. If GOD allows strangers to fight and conquer Isreal, it's because they have deviated from the way or the real Torah. They have become the hithens rather than true Israelites. So, when you are allowed to fight & defeat her you are actually fighting the hithens not the true Isreal. Now, are true believers supposed to fight the true Isrealites and takeover their lands? Ofcourse not. If Palestine/Muslims are actually following the real Torah, they are supposed to be called Isrealites rather than Muslims - the followers of Koran, but if they are not really following the Torah then they do not qualify to be called Israelites. By the way, the actual Isreal is the Father of 12 tribes/sons of Isreal. Are you part of the 12 tribes? Which tribe are you part of. How do you even know which one you are part of?The tribes of Isreal who follow the real Torah would observe the Holydays, Feasts, Practices like Sabbath(7th day of the week), Passover, Genital circumcision etc. Which do you observe/practice, or rather do you even observe them atall? If you don't, then you do not follow the true Torah, you don't qualify to be call an Israelite and have no right to the land of Israel.There is a New Isreal whose members are now followers of True MESSIAH JESUS CHRIST rather than Moses (and Moses told the old Israelites to obey/follow JESUS). Certain laws/practices of the old in the Torah have been fulfilled or are nolonger necessary for them, like the law for allowed/forbidden animals, animals sacrifice, etc. The True MESSIAH whom certain people follow do not even permit HIS followers to revenge, hate enemies etc,... This and other of HIS teachings are in complete opposite of what you encourage muslims to do. Â Those who do opposite of what JESUS teaches are anti-christs and not HIS followers.

      "body": "^^^ Exactly. God gave good moral laws to the people of Ancient Israel, mostly in Exodus and Deuteronomy in the Bible. The whole Old Testament is full of examples of how Israel was torn down when they disobeyed, and how they were built up when they returned to God and obeyed, again.Right now you can see the US being torn down because the people are disobeying. Even the 'good' people are being torn down, because they won't destroy the evil and force the good to reign in the land.",
