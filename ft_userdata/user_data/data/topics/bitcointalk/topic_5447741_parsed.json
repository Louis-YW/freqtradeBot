This is usually fastest way to get the attention of the teams about any security issues. It's a dangerous route however, as you can be flagged as criminal as well especially when you take a bug bounty without a concent. And for a smaller project even when they get their money back, just a fud and panic can kill a project after this.With larger projects it's nearly impossible to kill them no matter how much you steal. Like in 2016 there was infamous Dao hack where 3,641,694 ETH were stolen (over $50 Million worth of ETH at the time). Eth nearly was killed but they just forked and survived.",

That's why don't put all trust with centralized cross chain bridge because it's vulnerable against hack, just choose a chain with high security and trusted enough. DEFI isn't decentralized, it's misleading. I'm not using DEFI and centralized exchange, but I use decentralized exchange.",

I used to wonder how they can let those mistakes happen, is their security capacity not adapted in this space, also saw some projects spend millions of dollars on mechanical hacks active network inspection finds errors, but then we still see these things. I guess defying the profit opportunities the market offers that makes many developers work is really unprofessional.",

While decentralized exchanges offer more autonomy and transparency, they also lack the security measures and insurance that centralized exchanges provide. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and risk toleranceThis is why there's a big trust issues when it comes to DeFi and many still prefer a centralized platform but both of them still give no guarantee about its safety. Now, what they will do is to address the problem and compensate all the loses. Hackers are working very hard to spot a project that has a weak security, there's no safe space from them but if a project focuses on their security, this can be avoided.",

I'd like to use a few of them if it is necessary but the news that comes out about them could have been discouraging because of the usual hacks that happens to them.It is inevitable that people will trust more centralize exchanges because they think that in terms of safety, they are safer than the DeFi or dexes. But little did they know, they cannot skip also being hot in the eyes of hackers and even the regulators for which we are seeing in most of them.",

I think that perhaps many projects have lacked the care when they still let the contract errors repeat many times. I have heard about a number of different tricks like price manipulation and project exits, but more realistically the recent attacks are targeting a lot of large projects and the amount of money lost is huge. Perhaps a change in product developments is required before users can use it, unfortunately for us, trusting the use of the product does not guarantee the safety of the property.",

Last time Poolz Finance, a DeFi/IDO project got hacked due to exploits from hackers but good thing they got back up from the incident and coming back strong again. DeFi project should invest more on securing their smart contracts and hire some elite security audit company to ensure that their smart contracts has solid security.",
