  "content": "Some people thought bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, some thought it is a scam, but bitcoin is neither a ponzi or a scam, hope some people will lot be foolish until they realize the benefits they can earn from bitcoin holding. This is how I see bitcoin, like natural occurrences, I understand it is not nature but it can be related to seasons, sun and rain. When some people want the sun to shine, some people will want the rain to fall. But regardless of wish, the rain can fall or the sun can shine at any time. But some people wait for the period of sun or rain, they make the right calculations and predictions and they are happy as it happens as they predict, but it can be the other way around sometimes, a time patience is necessary.The price of bitcoin can not continue to increase, it is just like season, the sun and the rain. The bull season is gone for now, the bear season came and still around, the bull season is coming again. As some people are complaining that the price of bitcoin has fallen,  bitcoin is dead reached all time high on Google search. Actually, bitcoin price falled, as some people are complaining, some small investors are happy now that 1 bitcoin they were not able to hold when the price was so high, they can be able to hold it now. Just like on this forum, some people that join signature campaign are happy that they earn more bitcoin, including me, I am among them. Small-time investors achieve the 1 BTC dream as Bitcoin holds $20k rangeQuoteWith BTC recently trading at the $20,000 range for the first time since 2020, small-time investors found a small window of opportunity to achieve their dream of owning at least 1 BTC. On June 20, Cointelegraph reported that the number of Bitcoin wallet addresses containing one BTC or more increased by 13,091 in just 7 days.While the total number of addresses holding 1 BTC saw an immediate reduction in days to come, the crypto community on Reddit continues to welcome new crypto investors that hodled their way into becoming a wholecoiner.As bitcoin can not continue to rise, it can not also continue to fall. As some people sell, some people are planning to buy. What will only happen during the bull time is the price of bitcoin to increase significantly again and reach all-time-high, the bull time may be long, but it is coming. But now and hold.",

But now and hold.\"Ceteris Paribus\" as the case maybe we all know that bear market are as a result of market reactions. At this point, when the market is down, it is advisable to fill your bags or hold while there are some panic sellers out there wanting to sell so as to avoid loss in investment. As a smart investor, it is right time to buy so as to increase your portfolio and make more profits. Subsequently, Bitcoin has displayed it's current state but upon which, it soars high after than same scenario and reaches a new all time high to remedy it's current state. And lastly I would say this, Bitcoin is not a scam neither is it a Ponzi but a store of value otherwise called digital gold.",

This price would not only favour those aiming to be wholecoiners, even large investors would also use this opportunity to buy more at a cheaper rate.The most criticized holders now, would be institutional investors' and nations (like El Salvador) who hold Bitcoin in their reserves.",

The only catch is that the 2nd bear cycle should not touch the lows of the 1st bear cycle and that's it! back in 2017-18, bitcoin has gone back to 3k regime after touching the heights of 22k. currently, bitcoin has reached to 20k after touching another ATH of 69k. So it's a healthy increase in price and such bear cycles are only allowing us to score up more and more bitcoin as per the depth of our pockets. It's an amazing opportunity. If someone fails to understand such opportunity in the market, it's their mistake! Let's not get into discussing such naysayers. Rather focus on scoring up more bitcoins while it is hot!",

      "body": "IMO the comparison of those who want low prices and those who want high prices with those who want rain and those who want sun is limited. While it's true that both categories exist and nothing can go on forever (although there are countries where there's little sunlight and those where there is little rain), the motivation can be very different. I believe that most of those who want the price to be low are those who want an opportunity to invest, and then they of course want the price to grow, so that they can profit from the investment. There can also be bitter anti-Bitcoin people who just want the price to drop and never go up because they don't believe in Bitcoin. As for rain and sun, I don't think the majority of those who want the rain actually want it so that then they can appreciate the sun more. I also don't think anyone wants the rain because of hating sun-lovers while not loving rain themselves.",

We may all have experience the bullish and bearish on the crypto market multiple times for the past few years and we all have seen the pattern whereas we just need to wait for the bullish market to arrive again in the next few months. Some people may not like the current bearish market as they have lost funds and it's harder to invest but there are some who take it as an advantage to invest more.

Investment purpose was not the original intention satoshi had for bitcoins, so if you choose to see it as a means to invest, you have to prepared for whatever situation the market presents. Even now some people are still expecting the market to bear the more before it bulls, with the bear market, the total number of bitcoin holders will increase as many persons have already sold off some bitcoins to new users who intended taking advantage of the bear market, this is why some people want the bear market.",

Bitcoin buyers desperately need those who sell. and bitcoin sellers desperately need those who buy. although there will be so many fud scattered plus the economy has not recovered.
