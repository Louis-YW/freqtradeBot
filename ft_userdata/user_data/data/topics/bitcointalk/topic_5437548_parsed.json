Ron Desantis for President 2024, can I get an Amen? One thing is clear in governance which is you cannot please everybody. Some people will be happy with your policies while other will always criticize them. Donald Trump suffer from such attacks and people felt Biden would be better. But the same people that voted out Trump doesn't want Biden any longer.I think age should be considered when voting for any political office candidate or aspirant. This is because most aged persons are prone to diverse sicknesses that might affect their performance in the office. Dementia is a major sickness that affects the elderly and most of these elderly political leaders suffer from this sickness. Which entails that the most productive part of their time is spent on their medicals and not governance. A major political party in my country is fielding a candidate that cannot make reasonable statements and sleeps like a baby because there is a cabal made up of his family and friends that wants to hijack the government if he is successfully elected as president. I say an Amen to the candidacy of Ron Desantis because he is younger and might be a better President.",

Depends whom your ask, there seems to be people who want Mr.Trump to return to the oval office in 2024 and even if Desantis declared the beginning of his run for the presidency, there is no warranty Trump won't push him out the way, in the same manner he did to Ted Cruz and other Republican competitors back in 2016.I think I remember Biden saying he is indeed running again, but I personally think there is no way his party allows it to happen, specially against a younger more charismatic Republican opponent.",

It could be that 70% of primary voters do not want Trump to be the nominee. If Trump maintains a plurality with his 30% with DeSantis trailing shortly behind and all other candidates taking their share of the vote, Trump cruises towards a primary win.In case it may matter, Trump has already began attacking DeSantis presumptively before he's even announced his candidacy. He's nervous. And uncoincidentally, I've seen the normal DNC/democratic propagandist all elevate Trump and ramp up attacks against DeSantis. The preferred candidate for Biden to run against is clear.",

He's nervous. He may be trying to get Desantis out of the game, so he could certainly get the nomination easier.If he actually  manages to get the nomination, those investigation on his alleged crimes could get halted because the Republican party intervention on the people who is supposed to investigate him.Obviously, if he manages to become president again, then the prosecutors will likely wait until the end of his second term, to take him to court.  I am not sure how difficult it is to prosecute a sitting president in the USA, but I am guessing it wouldn't be easy at all.",
