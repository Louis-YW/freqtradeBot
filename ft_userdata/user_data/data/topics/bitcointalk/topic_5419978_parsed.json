Pretty sure it wont really be a small amount of money.If we do consider out on how risky on being a trader and been prone on huge risks, then no one on their right minds on doing so and if ever there's one then it would really be that too expensive.Lastly, dont tend to make out some blaming or pointing out some fingers because no one pushes you on doing trading specially on futures which are really that very risky.You do expect that government is really that obliged or responsible on giving out insurances for some cashback on what they had lost? (Laughable) No one on their right minds on offering such thing.If you dont like on wasting or losing up so much money then better back off and dont trade.It is for those people who had accepted out their fate about probabilities on losing money.",

Now that you've lost your money there legally, you're going to ask for a refund?Stop doing futures. The exchange didn't pushed to do it and they have that warning that you might be liquidated there on an instant.",

Don't sound like hopless gamblers who think gambling can be a source of guaranteed daily income.We have seen proposals like this on the forum before and it always strikes me how self-serving they are, basically they want to gamble in the markets and somehow not lose any money, which is ridiculous, the moment a trader decides to take a position in the market they are accepting full responsibility for their performance, if they are good they can make money, if they are bad they can lose it, and if someone is not willing to accept this they can refuse to trade, after all it is not like it is mandatory to participate in the markets or something like this.",

Many people cannot trade yet but still force themselves to trade using signals from other people.If the exchange refunded the money lost due to trading, surely no one would lose money from trading. And if you invest that money in the exchange, you will earn in the future, especially if the percentage is high so that the number of coins you get can be more than the capital you use. You should be wiser in using your capital so that if you experience a loss, it will not be as big as other traders.",
