Blame it on the economy and the high inflation hitting the country, but inward, man is greedy and can to any lengths to satisfy that emotion. Also, another factor to be considered is the case of child marriages which are quite normal in the Northern parts of the country. What would you say then is responsible for such occurrence?",

What you should put in writing should be what you know very well and what someone can they search on Google and they get Evelyn report because what you just said is a false information which is very clear in any country marriage is being done an agreement between the two parties but you narrow it down that marriage is been establish because of money that is false information and also a fallacy so I think that you have to redress these",

Marriage is the coming together of a man and a woman to raise a family because they love each other. But from origin marriages have been used to achieve different goals. Some people see it as a means to achieve other goals. Some people want to get married to a wealthy person because they want to live in abundance. While others are getting married because of social status.But from its origin marriage has been used as a political tool to grad or advance one's power and influence. We have heard of Kings or Princes going to take wives from other kingdoms to gain their support or make them their allies. Currently, most politicians see it as a strategy to get more votes from other states during elections. A governor that wants to become a president needs to advance his support base to other states and marriage might be a good political strategy.",
