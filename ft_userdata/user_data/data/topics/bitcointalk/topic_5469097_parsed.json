If you want to really diversify then look to other industries like real estate, precious stones, stocks/bonds.Quote from: RioBlemz on October 03, 2023, 07:34:06 PMCryptocurrency investment is risky so you may need a coach or Mentor and if you cannot afford always read the valuable content posted on BTC and Cryptocurrency in this community as there are many topic that can be useful to your growth and development.No one needs a coach or mentor to get into crypto investment, you just need to know how to do your research.",

If you want to encourage people to hold their Bitcoin, it is necessary you put it explicitly because many people use Cryptocurrency to confuse others into buying shitcoin. If you have been around this space for a while, you will agree with me that a lot of people have suffered various degrees of pain as a result of buying over-hyped shitcoins. It will be totally bad to categorise Bitcoin with those worthless garbages as \"coins\" or \"cryptocurrency\".  A clear distinction is very juch imperative.",

For me who is experienced, I can't expect myself hodling alone without trading, it will even be boring to me.Of course, what I do is plan on the total crypto asset. I often commit just between 20-25% of my crypto assets to trading, while the huge rest are being held securely elsewhere.",

But here may be got his answer. The only priority of this forum members is to guide the new ones from scams and bad strategies which may lose the money that they earn by hard means. As you guys grow you will know better about how to trade and which strategy is best at which time but for now you guys need to use the hilding strategy as it's the simple one buy-in dump and sell in a bull market and trust me this will give more returns from other at this stage.",

The intrinsic value comes from its utility and it depends on founders, developers of that coin as well as supply and demand, adoption of the coin. It is not depended on you as you can not increase the coin value by yourself.What you meant is increasing total number of coin you have by trading, not increasing its value.

Let me first of all say never be in a hurry to multiply or increase your coin. The crypto market is highly volatile and you can lost everything you have.When you're in a hurry to multiply your coins you become an easy target for scammers that promise to double your coins when you deposit into a specific address they provide. Your Bitcoin gets values from hodling so that should be what you should be doing. Diversifying your portfolio can be done by trading other financial market, if you have the knowledge and experience, you can put it to use by trading forex but make your investment in Bitcoin as a long term investment through Hodling. Don't get deceive by what the influencers tell you that trading is the fastest way to make money from Bitcoin, trading puts you at a point that can make you lose money faster. You don't need to trade your Bitcoin to make profit, you make profits from capital gains that you get when you hold until your target is reached and then you sell. When you don't trade, you don't exposed yourself to the volatility of the market and other side effects that trading has to your health like having visual problems.

Investing in cryptocurency can be done from the comfort of your house without any mentor as all the information you'll need to invest in the market is available online. Avoid those paid channels asking you to give them money for them to coach you, they'll just be shilling you token they're been paid to influence so try to learn things on your own and Invest in Bitcoin.",

We need to do some good decision with that to get high chance to recover back or gain something. Other altcoins which has low cap or totally got drop badly is one of perfect example for something that not good to hold since trading them always is best decision to create to make sure that we are bullish for gaining profit and will not get scam if the devs flew away and take the money of their traders.",

Diversifying your investment keeps you safe from unforseen circumstances which likely might occur and if that happens, your investments are protected because you diversified. Investment is a personal decision so if one must invest one must have made up his or her mind on the particular asset(s) they want to buy and another is trading of the assets. As a Crypto enthusiast, although it is not necessary you must be a trader, but it is necessary having knowledge a bit on trading so as to guide you while holding if you resolve to doing that for a long time.
