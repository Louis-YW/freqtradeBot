No, if the price of ETH increases, the increment will be reflected in the dollar value of your 0.001 ETH (from 0.56$ to 1.06$) and not in the amount of ETH you hold.",

E.g ( 0.002 ETH ) or the increment is going to be on the value? E.g 0.001 ETH = 1.06$? The increment will going to be on the Gwei, no the sats (Bitcoin) or the value.In Ethereum network the calculation is using this formula: Total Gas Fee = Gas units (limit) x (Base fee + Tip) [1]. But I'm not really understand how to explain it, usually people will pay the fees based on the wallet calculation (low, medium, fast), not customized.[1] https://bitkan.com/learn/how-to-calculate-eth-gas-fees-3496",

Ethereum's recent Merge is not developed to reduce the transaction fee. The Merge is a process of consensus switch between proof of work into proof of stake. The recent upgrade is widely known for being intended to reduce fees, which is actually a misconception.The issue is also addressed on the Ethereum website itself. You can learn more deeply about what is the upgrade all about and what is the next step that truly designed to reduce fees. Take a look at https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#misconceptions.

And you don't have to imagine what happens when the chain is overload. Just take a look what happened when eth was $4k. Only rich people were able to use it. They were also making ton of money but fees were just too much for anyone who didn't want to spend another $100 just for fees and hope that their transactions went trough. I used so much extra just because i wanted smart contract transactions to go trough.",

This is the exact reason why so many 2nd layer solution are still flourishing until this day, it's because ETH just hardly could solve their high fees.",

There are some wallets that base the fees on the value of the coin but those already have some additional fees embedded to it. So even if the price of ETH goes up or down, fees will remain pegged to satoshis, and it's best to learn how to play with that in order to not get burned by just the fees alone. You also have to take into consideration what time you're sending funds to and from one address. It plays a vital role to not transfer funds during peak hours.",
