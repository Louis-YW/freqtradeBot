Is there someone interested in buy it?If so pm me your offer.As far as I know, in order to be able to make Pi Network token transfers, owner must pass a full KYC for the coins to be transferred from the internal network to the Pi main net. If this condition is met, then there is a problem of determining the price, because in fact, at the moment Pi Network tokens are worthless. I say this as a holder of around 1k Pi tokens.I'm afraid there's no point in selling them now, because if anyone makes an offer at all, it will be pennies. It's better to wait for Pi Network to enter some exchange.But.. considering everything I've written above, I can offer $7 for 7000 worthless (at the moment) Pi Network tokens.",

So making a transaction to buy this coin is more high risk.And as far as I know also that majority of the community here kqnew that pi was one of shitty coins to hold and to buy it.",

Also understand that there are chances that the coin might not be what it preched to be, hence, he should ensure he's not expecting too much from it, he should also look around for local p2p merchants who buys it and sell to them but at a very cheap rate.",

      "body": "Be careful with what you're saying... the price you see 0.24$ or 0.30$ + is irrelevant, because you can't deposit PI to any of the exchanges you see those prices from, therefore currently it's impossible to sell it and once it will be possible the price won't be so high... i would say it will be around 0.0001$ per token if not less.So do your due dilligence before you send any money to anyone selling PI.RegardsQuote from: inanilujimi on October 20, 2023, 06:48:15 AMQuote from: HedgeFx on June 30, 2023, 08:52:50 PMHallo,A friend of mine have 7000 pi network.

Even then no one is allowed to transfer this pi network token if no one is allowed then how can he transfer and sell his pi token? I also have Pi Token but it is worthless that's why I am not telling anyone to buy this Pi Token. But since you have been patient for a long time, please be more patient, I hope to be listed with a good price.",
