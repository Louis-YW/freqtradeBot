  "content": "QuoteThe Super Bowl Season has always been an exciting event and Polygon rides the wave through the minting of 1 million Super Bowl NFTs.But first, here‚Äôs a quick glance of Polygon (MATIC) performance in the last few days:MATIC price is down by 1.43% as of press timePolygon NFTs riding the wave of the Super Bowl hype; now 4th largest in terms of NFT volume at $3.37 millionMATIC price looks bullish for the long termPolygon knows exactly what to do with the Super Bowl hype and uses that to gather momentum.QuoteOver 1 million @Reddit Super Bowl NFTs minted #onPolygonClaim yours before the big game üèàüëáüèΩhttps://t.co/1BPiBUJ92r pic.twitter.com/rbP5NH8mkY‚Äî Polygon (@0xPolygon) February 10, 2023The network‚Äôs massive NFT adoption is working in its favor as it gathers strength and has the potential to jump above and beyond the resistance spotted at $1.6.Polygon Flexes Muscles In The NFT SpaceApart from the fact that Polygon is seen to be growing tremendously, especially in the NFT arena, its upcoming mainnet upgrade as well as the zk-EVM has allowed the network to gain more traction.Ethereum is seen to be leading the pack in both the NFT and DeFi space, but it seems that Polygon is keeping up or even close to outpacing the giant.Currently, Polygon is considered the 4th largest in sales volume in the NFT space with over $3.37 million, registering an increase of as much as 30.72%.The number of transactions also jumped by as much as 73% in the past week with Ethereum dropping 4.34%. MATIC total market cap at $10.6 billion on the daily chartImage link:¬† https://i.ibb.co/4YtmdSz/matic-up.pngMore so, OpenSea‚Äôs daily volume also registered a phenomenal growth as it peaked at $18.7 million. Comparatively, the total of NFTs sold has been low in the past couple of months.OpenSea‚Äôs monthly volume on Polygon has also barreled past $30 million in its first week which is its highest since May of the previous year, a strong indicator that the value of NFTs on the platform has spiked significantly.MATIC Bulls Seen Dominating In The Long TermMATIC price is seen to be gathering more strength ever since its price was resuscitated when it dipped below $0.3 in June of last year.According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC price has nosedived by 2.86% or trading at $1.22 at the time of writing.Incredibly, MATIC is considered to be one of the top gainers in cryptocurrencies despite the crypto bleeding enormously in the past year.MATIC price is dubbed to be predominantly bullish in a long-term perspective with a firm support base spotted above $1 which means that even with a huge price drop, this can still encourage a rebound rising from $1.05 and could surge further surpassing $1.6.Polygon‚Äôs NFT trade volume has witnessed a spike in activity as spotted on February 10, but the total volume for that day is still lower when compared to its monthly high.Overall, MATIC bulls are seen to maintain their winning streak longer than usual. https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polygon-rides-super-bowl-wave/....Super bowl NFTs are doing well?!There are a few NFL athletes who signed a contract to have their NFL salaries paid in bitcoin. Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady was known for doing promotional work for FTX prior to its fall. The NFL is definitely one of the more crypto friendly sporting events worldwide. Yet even though this is a known and documented thing, is anyone surprised NFTs are still showing investment promise?While I'm not a big fan of playing devil's advocate. I would like to see what would happen if Vladimir Putin issued his own line of NFTs as Donald Trump did last year. With the way the world is going, I'm surprised Putin has not already put his own NFTs out there. Could NFTs somehow make a comeback? I had always thought they could use better methods to instill NFTs with intrinsic value. While a baseball card might not have much space to store memory data. NFTs could potentiall store more information digitally. That could be one advantage NFL NFTs have over NFL trading cards and collectibles. There could still be room for innovation and improvement as far as NFTs go.",

The issue I have now is that most of these NFTs will likely be turned to tokens in the future, most of the team is studying what the APE team did and will likely look to implement this strategy, most NFTs are still not liquid and liquidity is very key for any financial products, just as you said we need to see better Tokenomics to align with the interest of the investors so as not to get people burnt again and again",
