  "content": "Hello everyone,I'm posting a specific and more technical topic to ask for advice on the various solutions for switching from the native BTC network to another network (perhaps a Layer 2 of ETH or even another network) and then (eventually, I know that BTC on BTC is always better  ) exchange/sell for another crypto/stable.I should have come to the conclusion that there are these ways:Bridge to DEX and then SWAPDirect Atomic SWAPSWAP on CEX no-KYCSWAP on classic CEX(1) Bridge to DEX and then SWAPLet's start with perhaps the most used and simplest solution even if my doubts remain about the safety of bringing BTC from the native network to another network using Bridges which in the past have been targeted by attacks and major bugs (unless I don't say anything stupid about this last fact).To do this I found these:THORSwapThreshold (tBTC)Avalanche BridgeWhich of the 3 alternatives do you recommend?Are there others?Advantages and disadvantages?THORswap seems very simple and direct and perhaps even the Avalanche bridge but obviously I ask for advice from those who have used them and can therefore say from personal experience the pros and cons of each alternative.Trivial or stupid question:If I bridge BTC on network \"X\" and then exchange BTC for another crypto (and then perhaps exchange again returning to BTC), am I always at risk for a possible hack of the smart contract with which I brought BTC from the native network to \"'X\"?I don't even know if the sentence is conceptually correct but I hope I have conveyed the idea by writing \"trivial or stupid question\" because I am not clear on how bridges and the various smart contracts associated with the mint (or other) of tokens works from a network to the other.(2) Direct Atomic SWAPAnother interesting possibility to overcome some problems of solution (1) and also (4), I suppose.I haven't gone into detail on exactly how this works but maybe can solve the problem of using a Bridge and being at risk of some smart contract hack/exploit or whatever.But I only found this:Komodo Wallet(formerly AtomicDEX)Reliable?Are there other similar alternatives?Do you recommend this solution or something else?(3) SWAP on CEX no-KYCCentralized solution but with the usual doubts about which are the best no-KYC CEXs? the most recommended from a safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness point of view.For example:exch.cxsideshift.aiOthers?Advantages and disadvantages?(4) SWAP on classic CEXI don't think there is much to say on this point. If not raise some alerts in case multiple BTC are swapped I wanted to summarize all the various possible solutions to have a complete picture and help many to make the right choice, which is not always easy if you are not aware of other possible paths that may be preferable. In fact, if there are other solutions that I don't know about, please let us know here Any possible help is always welcomed and can help the entire community.Thanks to everyone <3",

And I haven't tried that either because I think it's really high risk and prone to hackers and I don't want that to happen to me.There are also disadvantages because that is true, especially when it comes to security like in centralized bridges, which usually happens that they only rely on the central authority, to manage the transfer of assets. It usually creates single point failures that become a way for hackers to enter and compromise it. And one example of this is what happened in Axie Infinity year 2022 month of March https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/14/blockchain-bridges-keep-getting-attacked-heres-how-to-prevent-it/",

We send each other the respective coins. I understand I use this as a privilege of knowing certain traders for years.

Betfury has a multiple network support for Bitcoin which I sometimes use to send my Bitcoin to exchange with lesser fee specifically BSC Bitcoin. But doing this will automatically subject your deposit to x1 wagering requirements which is very risky since all of the casino has a house edge which means it’s guaranteed that you will lose part of the funds just to complete the wagering requirements for withdrawal.But this is more convenient for me as a gambler compared to using multiple bridge that charge huge fee and has a lot of risked to lose my money in one wrong transaction.",
