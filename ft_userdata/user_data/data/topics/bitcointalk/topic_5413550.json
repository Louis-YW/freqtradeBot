  "content": "POS (Point of sales) business is a major lucrative business in my region. in my region, Bank ATMs is usually crowded with people trying to cash out or cash in (withdrawal/transfer). this become a challenge to most people who can not undergo the stress of joining a long que or having to wait under the sun, stand for long time or being patient until it's turn to carry out their transactions. in some cases bank is not close to some residential area and people living in the area would have to pay for transportation fee to get to a close by ATM and carry out their transactions, some times you get to the ATM and find out there is no cash (unable to dispense or out of service). Due to this reasons lots of people are now into POS business which is actively saving people Bank/ATM transaction stress. the service offered by a POS business Agent is to save individuals the stress of going to the Bank/ATM to make cash withdrawal or send money to their loved ones, another stress it saves individuals is to help them pay for their cable subscribetions like (DSTV, Startimes) without having to drive down to the network providers office, they can also recharge airtime (VTU) to their desired network.Â  Another thing it does is assist individuals pay for their electric bill, they need not go through the stress of going to the NEPA office before they can pay their bills.Â there are lots of people doing this Same business in my region but I did not find any one with the idea of accepting and exchanging Bitcoin and other crypto for their customers. So I decided to Open this same business with a different idea of accepting Bitcoin, i think am the first person with this move in the POS business.I am happy I now have Two business in different areas that accepts Bitcoin. Thanks to the things I have learned in this forum about Bitcoin payment, I am being practical of things I learned in this forum.Â  I just Opened the business on 1st/September/2022 and on the 2nd/Sep/2022 I was surprised to receive a call from my employee that a customer wants to take #18,000 (Nigeria Naira) and pay in Bitcoin, I did the calculation and added $3 fee for my business charge and sent the details across and the customer sent 0.00155 BTC. I asked my employee to give cash to the customer when she confirms the transaction is processing, so the customer initiated the transaction and receive the cash he needed.It took over 35 minutes before the transaction was finally successful and arrived in my wallet. Due to the delay, I started thinking ðŸ¤” its a scam but I was also convinced that it might be a congestion in the Bitcoin network. Â Apart from a short explanation I have given to my employees on how to receive payment in BTC from customers, I have decided I will organize a special class to teach all my employees things they need to knowÂ  in details About Bitcoin. The fact that I want to teach my employees things about Bitcoin and also accepting and exchanging Bitcoins for customers, do you think it's a risk am taking and should i discontinue the Business?",

You should be aware of how Bitcoin transactions work, and accordingly do not hand over money to the client until the transaction has received at least one confirmation on the network, or that your employees know to check whether the transaction has the RBF (Replace-By-Fee) label, which would mean that it is possible to double spend the same coins.I would also advise my clients before the transaction which fee to use in relation to the current situation with mempool - which you can always see on this site -> https://mempool.space/Quote from: Detritus on September 14, 2022, 12:42:00 PMApart from a short explanation I have given to my employees on how to receive payment in BTC from customers, I have decided I will organize a special class to teach all my employees things they need to knowÂ  in details About Bitcoin.

But it's an open secret that Nigeria is at the top of the bitcoin transaction statistics in Africa even though it's under ban. A risk that doesn't have to be thought about much, right? - Crime risk. You as a physical cash exchange provider are assumed to have a large amount of cash reserves. This is feared to attract criminals to come to your shop.If you think you can handle these 2 risk factors, you can continue your business.",

      "body": "The only legal risk here is that CBN do not tolerate bitcoin p2p transactions. Knowing how the POS business in Nigeria works, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be a profitable venture. The major reason why customers patronize pos shops is for convenience and quick service compared to using ATMs. I believe your staff doesnâ€™t have access to your wallet, only you do. So they have to contact you somehow to confirm the transaction. 35 minutes is a long time to spend trying to withdraw money at a POS centre. You could teach your staff how to use blockchain explorers to check the status of a transaction. Another thing you have to consider is the volatility of bitcoin, pos business is a small scale business, the capital is usually around 300-500$ I donâ€™t think such business is ripe enough to adopt bitcoin yet.",

However, if you do have an account with any platform that has P2P like Binance for instance, though I'm not encouraging you should keep your cryptos in a centralized exchange, but in this case Binance P2P will make things easier for you, in terms of selling your Crypto back to Cash. therefore you need not to add $3 transaction fees to your customers because that is approximately (#2000) Nigeria Naira as at today's exchange rate of #700 -$1 dollar.",

Judging by your explanation, all that was manually done. You generated an address, sent it to your colleague, they then gave it to the customer, the customer paid and waited over half an hour for the transaction to go through. Imagine having 10 people in quick succession who want to pay with BTC, you are going to have to give them each a separate address, check, and keep track of who has paid and how much. Another potential problem is taxes. Are you in the system, do you pay taxes on the turnover you generate?",

Before handing over your FIAT currency to an unknown customer, always ensure that the transaction was successful. Trust is a very serious issue that we must be very cautious about. When you give out money (FIAT) before confirming the transaction, some people can double spend the Bitcoin and you will lose it all because you gave your FIAT out of trust.

Lastly, I am aware that the exchange rate differs as regarding the amount of Bitcoin needed. In other words, the exchange rate is greater for someone wishing to trade $100 worth of bitcoin than it is for someone wishing to swap $40. How would you approach this?",

I believe if people there had internet access and devices such as smartphones they could do these transactions by themselves, saving on fees. Or maybe middlemen services will keep existing to assist older generations making their payments, since they have some difficult or lack of interest for learning how to use technological devices in general.",

So I decided to Open this same business with a different idea of accepting Bitcoin, i think am the first person with this move in the POS business. Being a Nigerian myself and live in area where POS is a popular business among youths, I find it a bit difficult to believe you are the first person accepting bitcoin in a POS business, 98 percent of POS operators in Nigeria are youths, and more than 80 percent of this youths know a thing or two about bitcoin and crypto currencies, 60 percent of this people have bitcoin logo on their POS banner which means they accept bitcoin or will accept it upon request.

Due to the delay, I started thinking ðŸ¤” its a scam but I was also convinced that it might be a congestion in the Bitcoin network.There are different modes of setting the miner fee and I think the customer deliberately set the miner fee low which is why the transaction took that amount of time to confirm, see the images below for a better understanding...My advice is, next time you have a customer who want to send bitcoin to you and receive the cash equivalent, make sure the customer put the MINER FEE setting to priority, and if possible, politely make the customer to wait until the transaction receives atleast, one blockchain confirmation before they can leave.I will personally suggest you type the above in a paper, print it out and paste it all over your POS shop, make it as a rule that customers transacting in bitcoin must set miner fee to priority and after sending bitcoin,. Must wait for 1 blockchain confirmation before they can take cash and leave.This is to avoid or bring to the barest minimum, the chances of encountering a payment reversal where Bitcoin sent end up reversing back to the address it came from.",
