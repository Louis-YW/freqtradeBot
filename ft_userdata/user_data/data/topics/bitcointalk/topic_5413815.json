  "content": "In total, 10 test pieces were produced per OneNattyLitecoin.  Of the test pieces produced, only 7 were made publicly available- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5126055.msg50371172#msg50371172.  In this auction, 2 of the 7 publicly available test pieces are up for auction and 1 publicly unavailable test piece is available as well for 3 total test pieces, all ICG slabbed and graded.  The main distinguisher of the test pieces vs the production release is instead of a serial # on the hologram, DAYBREAK is on the hologram; also, the Rose Gold plate was only available as a test pieces as it did not make the production cut.  I know the pics show timestamp of 14 Sept 2022- delays due to life circumstances, but rest assured and promise that these are mine and in my possession- not escrow opposed and can provide additional pics if requested.END TIME: 5 pm (1700) US ET, Sun 18 September 2022.
