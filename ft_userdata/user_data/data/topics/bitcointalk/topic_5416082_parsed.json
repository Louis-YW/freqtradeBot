Afaik, even the referees get few bucks if they deposit and trade certain amounts. Do read the terms and conditions for this so you know all the prerequisites that should be satisfied. But ofc I do not recommend solely signing up for deposit bonuses.",

Are you afraid that if you receive bonus your account will experience some problem or might be restricted? Exchanges have this kind of promotions to attract more traders and investors, and most probably this kind of promotions wont affect the platform itself, they will surely have budget on this so don’t be afraid to get some bonus, that’s a free money.",

But none that just give you money for opening an account. It would get abused to death similar to why many gambling bitcoin casinos had to remove the faucets. I remember Coinbase actually had a $10 no deposit bonus. Many people made the account back in like 2015 and forgot about it. Then when they went back, they had like $500 because the bonus was in BTC and not USD.",

If you meant with deposit bonuses then it's commonly found with most big exchanges although not all, example  Lbank comes with huge welcome bonus and deposit bonus. If what i presume isn't what you mean then i see no way a trader will get excited to trade without bonuses no matter how small the bonus may be. Bonus is a way of encouragement from exchanges. But if its no deposit bonus you seek i think it might take a good search to find one that has reputation",

But as long as you don't claim the deposit bonus, you won't receive it.On Binance, you will get a bonus offer if you deposit a certain amount, which you can use immediately. Likewise, with other exchanges, it will be up to you. If you want it, you can accept it and claim it and if not, just leave the offer and continue your trading.",

If I'm not mistaken, Binance gives you vouchers in USDT something like that after you deposit a certain amount on them and verified your account, correct me if I'm wrong though. I believe bonuses are the main reason why people want to start trading because of that, it's like an starting extra capital in trading. Like free satoshis in faucets.",
