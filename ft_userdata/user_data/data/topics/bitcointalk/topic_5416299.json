You could still find some older versions just by editing the address. For example, instead of downloading version 23.0 from https://bitcointalk.org/bitcoin-23.0.torrent, just change the '23' into a '22' and you will download the torrent link to version 22.0. Not sure how many versions are stored though. Changing it to 21 won't download v 21.0. The download link is maybe different for that one.You can also find links to old versions that were advertised in the news field using Wayback Machine. Besides that, there are many old discussions that used to link to the early Core versions, but they just don't work anymore. Check out Bitcoin source from November 2008, v0.1, or how can I get a copy of the original source (0.1.0)? for example.",

I didn't rule out the possibility that theymos only stores a few of the most recent Bitcoin Core releases and removes the old ones. That's why I said I don't know how many are stored on the server exactly, and just maybe the links were somewhat different before version 22 got released. If we remember, prior to version 22.0, the older releases were referred to as Bitcoin Core 0.21, 0.20, 0.19, etc.",

What an Irony is this. Which of the history are you talking about because there might two historical perspective in BTC. The creation history and post history . Pre-history is the one that talked about btc before Satoshi create and release it and that history is not true, it is a fantasy. BTC was created in 2008 and launched in 2009, so there is no pre btc but if you are talking of other coins released before BTC then they are. The creation History is the one btc was created in year 2008. Post history. BTC was created in 2008 and launched in 2009 by Satosh Nakamoto. This is the historical perspective of btc.",
