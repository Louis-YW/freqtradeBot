We provide a powerful tool to process multiple orders.​Smart Balance Accounting: The system monitors bot balances, reserving funds for orders.​Load Balancing: The system evenly distributes the load between bots, taking into account their workload and the presence of balance.​High Performance: Our software is capable of processing thousands of transactions in a short time thanks to the system of internal transaction queues for each bot and the use of an unlimited number of proxies.​Control Panel: You have full control over the process thanks to the control panel, where you can track transactions and bot statuses in real time, with the ability to connect notifications in telegrams.​Screen of order processing page: https://i.imgur.com/V9mBwzI.pngPrice: 1200$Write in telegram: nosorog_18",

      "body": "OP what cantsay has said is the truth and that is what you will be expected to do immediately so as to gain the expected audience you desire here otherwise nobody would attend to you. Another thing is for you to be a bit active here to because from the looks, you are a newbie and would cast doubt on your genuine intentions to  do a clean deal without problems. I would also advise that in other to gain the trust of members here, seek the service of an escrow here to guide you through so as to trust you want to deal otherwise nobody would come your way here as you are a newbie.",
