Whether it's through trading or mining, knowing the right timing for investment is crucial. It's essential to avoid impulsive decisions and instead give your investments time to grow steadily and accumulate.When it comes to identifying good investors, there are several key traits to look for. A good investor is someone who possesses a futuristic mindset, plans meticulously, manages finances effectively, mitigates risks wisely, and has a clear vision of their goals. These qualities enable them to see opportunities instead of challenges and work towards a prosperous future.While Bitcoin presents a lucrative investment opportunity, it's important to acknowledge the inherent risks involved. Understanding these risks and learning how to navigate them is crucial for any investor. By staying informed and making informed decisions, we can harness the potential of Bitcoin as an asset and build a successful investment portfolio.",

Having patience also can make one a good investor as investment take time to yield good result. If one is not patient, he ends up investment in the wrong time and making rash decision that can complicate his  investment .As some good strategist has said before now, always learn to diversify portfolio and avoid placing all eggs in one basket. As this is another way to be a good investor. Learn new strategies, follow new trends, always be informed about latest Change in the market and overall, take you time to plan.

As far as I know Bitcoin investors are people who spend money to acquire Bitcoin in aim to make profit from it in the future.  Whether they are good investors or not depends on their action but I do not think you can only be label as Bitcoin investor if you are well-experienced and have good patience.

Quote from: MTNNET on May 14, 2023, 07:33:55 PM* they're risk managersI think this, although it's right but there's more to it like calculating and mitigating the risk that they're taking. Investors knew that investments are all risky, small, or high. But by their experiences, they tend to have the idea of the investment they're taking. Like what we're seeing in most of the big investors of Bitcoin. We see people that have been taking risks and they don't mind it because they've done their research well. They've checked the history and even the historical charts. Many attributes do convinces them that Bitcoin is the actual investment that everyone should take and yes, I'm part of those people that would say the same them over and over again.",

All these qualities op listed here are for just institutional trader or investor and not for individual investor and tradees like you and I. The only thing that really matters for individual investor is the risk aspect of it, because as an individual we must accept the risk before venturing into making investment also planned very carefully not to invest at the wrong time. However, op should have classified it based on individual and institutional traders to able the content be fully expressed and comprehensible by readers.",

Bitcoin investors don't have two hearts or brains but are humans like other investors. You have rightly outlined some of the characteristics of a good business person and I think planning, risk management, and financial management are important. But just like other businesses Bitcoin investment is not immune to risk. It has its level of risk that every investor should be aware of before investing. That is why before investing you should do your research and study the bitcoin sector. It is also important to invest only what you can afford to lose. Don't use loans or other credit facilities to invest except you are sure of the investment profitability.",
