  "content": "I recently came across an intriguing article exploring how NFTs and augmented reality might reshape virtual events and metaverse engagement:https://rwaltz.com/blog/nfts-and-virtual-events:augmented-reality-in-the-digital-landscapeIt really got me thinking about the possibilities for enhancing digital experiences and participation using these technologies. A few ideas that came to mind:- NFT tickets could provide different access levels, privileges, and digital collectibles for attendees- The augmented reality could help create immersive 3D spaces for virtual venue experiences- Hybrid in-person and virtual events become more seamless with NFT ticketing- NFT rewards and collectibles create new incentives and revenue opportunities- Blockchain/NFTs bring transparency and fairness to managing access and perksThe potential to boost engagement, interactivity, and creativity seems immense. Of course, there are still challenges to tackle around equitable access and seamless technology. But I'm excited to see where innovators take things as these tools evolve.What possibilities do you all envision for using NFT ticketing and augmented reality at virtual events?NFT Marketplace Development,How could this tech reshape participation and experiences in your view? I'd love to discuss and explore more concepts together!",

      "body": "If I am not wrong than these ideas which you just shared are already in progress which means to say these are not something new because many platforms are providing these ideas (features) or working on them. How did I know? I worked as a Bounty hunter and worked for so many NFTs and Metaverse platforms and that platform have the same motive. Means to say you are late but there is still room to grow because most of the platform are just spam, or they have not abled to fulfill there promises to provide these features but some has abled to provide these features so. I hope your ideas must bring some useful value to such platform or if you are planning to bring your own.",

Tickets are worthless after the event is over, but NFTs were designed with storing value in mind. That means that you're going to have blokes buying and selling the tickets at different prices like trading, performing rugpulls, etc. and that is not to mention that you will not only need to have a smartphone with you to attend but also you need a web3 wallet on it since mobile operating systems don't come with that sort of thing.",

And sometimes tickets sought-after enough can even be worth decent money if preserved well.Quote from: NotATether on August 15, 2023, 01:07:27 PMbut NFTs were designed with storing value in mind.Not necessarily. NFTs are pretty much just digital tickets that you can move around â€” it's just that people in the crypto space likes to speculate; but not necessarily that people hold it to store value. It's a lot more of a trade.But yea, agree with most.",

Unless they have a big user base before, launching a new feature like this with your only advantage over your competition is not going to cut it. Not to mention most of them launch their own token which is going to be worthless most of the time.",

Not to mention most of them launch their own token which is going to be worthless most of the time.Actually, the talks of making innovation and the new era of technology, etc., etc. are just a cover the main purpose of most such platforms is to attract investors. But now the era of NFTS and Metaverse is ended and the era of AI has started investors are investing in my AI-based platform even though they know these platforms are short-term ones. This means some stay longer than others. But still, many investors who are experts and do know the risk and outcomes mostly took profit when they have the chance but the point is those who are not experts have to bear the loss in such platforms. While the team is always in profit from both ends. And in the end, such platforms are there to rugg pull only. Dear OP, my words are not for you because we can not judge a book by its cover so I hope you grow more with total legitimacy",

      "body": "I do see your enthusiasm for what NFTs and AR can do for a business or event. But they've been there once in a while and I think that their era is about to get done. IIRC, AR projects have been there from 2016-2107 but then didn't flourish and didn't become popular due to the market's bias trend during that time. But who knows if by the next trend of the market that shall be on the bull run if AR will be once popular again. Because it doesn't look good if these developers are going to integrate it with crypto. They're much better if they remain AR without any integration of crypto yet the blockchain technology is still there being applied for its own purpose. It becomes and looks like a joke project if there's a token of their own being made.",
