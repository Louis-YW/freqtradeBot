You selling your house to invest in Bitcoin is one of the dumbest decision you'll ever make in your entire life. I don't know what prompted the idea into your head but you should be aware that Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, and there's a possibility of the price of Bitcoin falling. I'd advice to get a job and put your house on rent and maybe use part of the monthly payment to purchase Bitcoin rather than just throwing everything in gamble. Quotewhat's the future chances of bitcoin and all others coinPlease if you're to ever invest your house money or go for a long term investment, please go for Bitcoin, avoid buying any altcoin, because there's a high probability of the market condition to come back to normal (no matter how long it may take ) but that of altcoin is not guaranteed, and some might even shutdown leading to even more losses.",

If bitcoin can only be profitable without any risk, the opportunity will no longer be for you. I don't understand why so many people have the mindset of selling real assets to invest in bitcoin, sell usable things to invest in something uncertain in the future. Yes, bitcoin can be highly profitable, but it can also disappear at any time, with high returns and high risk.",

Changing your plan to trading or mixture of trading and investment will make you more sensitive to market volatility that will cause you more loss.What if selling a house and lose all or most of that money after a few months or one to two years? Will you suicide?Quote from: Smack That Ace on March 13, 2023, 10:49:12 AMYes, bitcoin can be highly profitable, but it can also disappear at any time, with high returns and high risk.It's very profitable for people who do right with it. Buying, holding and waiting patiently for chance to take good profit. It's profitable for holders and investors, not for traders or gamblers.",

      "body": "Of course, the housing market can crash, depending on where you live, but if you only have one house where you live, I agree with others that it's not a good idea to sell it in order to experiment with Bitcoin investment. If you want to sell a house and buy something smaller to live in, and then invest the rest in Bitcoin, I suppose that's reasonable. If you have another place to live and that's just a house sitting around, AND you can't rent it out, perhaps it's okay as well. But I'd rather use the property to get money from renting it out and put that money into Bitcoin. That way you both invest in BTC and have property on your hands. Bitcoin investment is risky, nobody knows how that will go and how long you'd have to wait to see returns on your investment.",

It was the early stage of bitcoin but right now even if we are optimistic about bitcoin getting twice its ATH I just can‚Äôt advise someone to sell off his house even if there‚Äôs another one. It might be his only source of income. He could just put it out on rent and split the rent from it some for daily expenses and rent other part for bitcoin investments. One thing that still remains is that bitcoin investments are money you can lose. Can the OP be opened to lose the house",

But if you want to invest your money in bitcoin, you better start now because bitcoin has great potential to increase very high in the future. And I don't think you need to sell your house to invest in bitcoin but you can use your income to start investing in bitcoin. And only use the money you can afford to invest in bitcoins and do DCA so you can accumulate your bitcoins over time. And while you wait for the moment of reversal, you can still collect more bitcoins from now on so that when the price of bitcoins starts increasing, you can sell your bitcoin at the peak price.",
