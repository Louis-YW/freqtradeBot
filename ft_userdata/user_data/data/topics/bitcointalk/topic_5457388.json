Be like their two been dey fight for who go post the update first. But moreover, back to the issue on ground, how people wey no get social media accounts go do for this yeye CBN mandatory KYC policy, because I dey sure say there are millions of Nigerians out there wey no dey on any social media, or abi will this new policy now force them to open one? That's one question. The second one be say, how those people wey their social media accounts name no rhyme with their real names, how they go wan do about that one, abi they go accept the name like that, or force them to change the name of their social media accounts. That's the only two questions I have to ask.",

I have not heard anything of such but if na true then e go be the silliest thing I don hear.Social media should not be considered as a material for know your customer. Firstly social media accounts can be banned. Do you notify you bank whenÂ  ever this happens I don't think so. Also I can have numerous social media accounts do I send them all.I think the Nigerian government should invest their time and effort more on more important task an CBN can come of with better strategy than this kindergarten stunt.",
