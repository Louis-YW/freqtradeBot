The founder's twitter account has also presently been set to private.There is a twitter account that calls himself FatMan who has warned everyone against depositing coins in Hodlnaut because it used users' deposits on another protocol. It is assumed their yields came from Anchor the ponzi protocol.https://mobile.twitter.com/fatmanterra/status/1541101947943620609To all users, we regret to inform you that we will be halting withdrawals, token swaps and deposits with immediate effect. We have reached this difficult decision due to recent market conditions. We understand that this is disappointing news and understand its impact on you. We would like to reassure you that this difficult decision was taken for us to focus on stabilising our liquidity and preserving assets, while we work to find the best way to protect our usersâ€™ long-term interests. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused you.We would also like to inform our users that, as a result of the above reasons, we have since informed the MAS of our intention to withdraw our licence application. Hodlnaut is therefore no longer providing regulated digital payment token (DPT) services, ie our token swap feature. For the avoidance of doubt, Hodlnaut will also cease all borrowing and lending services.Read in full https://www.hodlnaut.com/press/hodlnaut-message-to-our-users",
