      "body": "I sometimes truly deal with a lot of anxiety. I think it is because I am constantly in fear of never being able to have enough to pay off financial responsibilities and have some financial freedom before I die. I feel that the only way to control my anxiety is to keep my mind focused on my work.But that even at times can also be quite stressful. I also try to manage my anxiety by reading a book I a been looking forward to. I also noticed that when I go out with my friends, I feel good about myself because I can be myself with my friends without any judgment. My friends support me and really try to understand me and how my anxiety can affect my social behavior by not wanting to talk or even go out. Anxiety can cause doubt but worst of all depression is bad for anyone’s mental health. That is why I am glad my friends are there when I had my anxiety attack to help me relax and breathe. It was good to know that I was not alone and my friends care about my well-being.",

      "body": "In the past, I also felt anxiety like you felt. And finally I was free. I suggest you don't think too much about bad things about the future. The anxiety you experience is actually that you think too much about things, so that even the slightest thing will make you big, right. So, try not to think too much. That's my opinion, I hope you get well soon.",

It’s nothing to be ashamed of, it’s very common. There are a number of things you can try to combat anxiety, both natural & medicinal. Visit your doctor if you want to take anti anxiety pills but you can also try to beat it naturally by meditating, spending quality time with family & friends, doing stuff you enjoy. You can even see a psychologist who might be able to help you with various professional therapy methods.Regardless, you can treat anxiety, even if you can’t totally get rid of it, there are things to help.",

I sometimes have a hard time getting rid of this anxiety. so have you ever felt it? and how do you cure it?You could have anxiety if you try to have access to the Mind and Spirit when they aren't holy. I would advice to purify yourself and be close to the CREATOR. HE will comfort you and give you peace...then you will have no fear while using both the mind and spirit. But if you don't do this you may be better off functioning as human without regular access to the mind and spirit. That will make you function like a robot, in automated manner... existing in ignorance rather than being aware. . It's a dangerous thing for one to be aware of his/her evil and yet continue to be evil. But don't dwell too much in ignorance because the CREATOR does remind people of their evil once in a while and if it does happen HE expects us to be remorseful and ask for mercy. He who shows mercy to others also obtains mercy. Our CREATOR's is so merciful even to the children of sin  All Glory and Adoration be HIS Holy Name",
