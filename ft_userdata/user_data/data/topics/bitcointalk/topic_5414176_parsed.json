Mostly tennis matches lolI used to be a Twitch user but I dropped it and turned to Youtube and Dailymotion because of the lack of useful content it's a good hub for streamers and those who love streams love to be here, this has become one of the channels for streamers because of the interaction between streamers and followers, and on about borrowing money on his followers that too much they are making money from their stream sponsoring they don't have to do that, they will lose their reputation and followers and streamers abuse his followers.QuoteTwitch has turned into a cesspool of gambling addicts and gambling pushers. Do you think it's a responsible content creation & moderation on a platform which is used by teens, kids, and young adults? Twitch should be responsible enough and take a stand and decide if this is what they want on their platform, they should at least limit these streamers or penalized if they abuse their followers.QuoteWill this be the straw that will finally break the Camel's back and will force Twitch to ban gambling streams?I hope it does.If what you've mentioned is an isolated case, they may not ban it, Twitch thrives on gambling streaming and they have gambling streams too on Youtube.",

Do you think it's a responsible content creation & moderation on a platform which is used by teens, kids, and young adults? Will this be the straw that will finally break the Camel's back and will force Twitch to ban gambling streams?I hope it does.It's gonna be tricky though, I try to search for the keyword gambling in their TOS and nothing comes up, https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/But it says:Quotexvii. use the Twitch Services for any illegal purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law or regulation, including without limitation laws governing intellectual property and other proprietary rights, data protection, and privacy.So it seems that there is no clear violation as far as their TOS goes for this gambling streamers. And if the company is making millions if not billions due to the crypto boom, then it might be very hard for them to just shut it down. And for sure if they do that, there could be another streaming services that will pop up and then the cycle continues. Unless they are going to review first those live streams and then stop it right away before it got views.Although this is not the first time that they have to do with something illegal if I'm not mistaken. There was some controversies about the \"skins gambling\" in CS:GO.",

The heads of Twitter doesn't seem to care about the community at all, given the amount of scandals their platform produced from streamers and a lot of negative reviews against the management of the streaming platform. I think a lawsuit will help Twitch to start to listen to their patrons once and for all, but there isn't anything to throw at them, really.",

To encourage them to take a different path in life.I'm curious as to how this works. If children walk down the street and see drug addicts on street corners. Would that encourage them to not be a drug addict? Or does it become socially normalized?If youth on twitch see gamblers have personal problems and disorders related to gambling. Would it make them less likely to gamble? Or would they choose to follow in the footsteps of gambling addicts?Seeing lots of people I know have their lives go downhill after being involved with drugs. Was the best motivation for me staying away from drugs. I don't understand how some try not to learn from the life mistakes of others.",

Two, this issue better be blown to proportions before we see twitch actually taking action. Proportions to the level where they would investigate the streamer legally at that point.

As long as it amasses views, streamers will do anything, with no restrictions. They do not mind if it will have a negative effect on their viewers or whether kids will be following and copying their actions. But I do not think that Twitch will do anything about it unless there are mass reports on this kind of content. Twitch is still a business and if it is earning money from it then it will continue. They will do nothing unless the community forces them to do something about it.",

      "body": "According to what I have read, gambling content particularly slots are permitted to be streamed on twitch. I think they don't have a rule in their terms of service that states an outright ban or suspension for those creators of gambling streaming content. This is why there are a lot of streamers on gambling games that share their content in twitch since it is a platform that caters their interest, and do not really have a strict regulation or limitation of content creations topic. Perhaps twitch will just be alarmed and will make necessary actions the moment they will be called out by many in other platforms. Since they are profiting with what their streamers are doing, there's a big chance that they will just let this kind of cases to slide unless there's an urge for them to make a step to put such things into halt. Personally, I don't really get why streamer like Sliker will still ask to borrow money, most especially from his viewers because he makes a decent income for sure in streaming his content and therefore he shouldn't be soliciting from his followers. This just shows how addicted he is in gambling and how he handles his financial matters which is not really a role model specifically to the younger generations lurking around twitch platform.",

Perhaps it could be something else that demands such expenses, like drugs or pills, or even bills too. Hell, it could be a hustle! Having to borrow consecutively in that order however, is a concern, also, making it seem like the streaming site, 'Twitch' is solely responsible for Slikers pleasurable fondliness, is rather excessive.Twitch should be able to sanction him if these persons/viewers from whom he had borrowed, make complaints that corroborate others.Unlike other well-known streaming apps online today, the owners of Twitch want to make a profit and be on a pedestal. Hence, a sanction is imminent for Sliker if he continues in this manner.",
