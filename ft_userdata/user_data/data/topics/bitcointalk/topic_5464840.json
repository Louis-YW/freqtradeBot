Hal Finney died from ALS (Lou Gehrig disease) on 28 August 2014.Hal Finney was an uncommon cryptographer and computer scientist. He is an inspiration to many because he was one of the few that embraced Bitcoin when Cryptographers were seen as clueless noobs. He contributed a lot to the development of bitcoin and predicted that it would make many millionaires in the future. Even when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, he still spent his last days working on different crypto projects that benefitted the community. He is seen by many as the inventor of bitcoin but nobody has proved that assumption. His body is still been preserved through cryonic freezing because he and his wife Fran believe that that he can be brought back to life in the future. This might look impossible to many people but both couples always believed in the impossible. May his soul rest in peace until he achieves his goal of resurrection.",

Thanks for sharing his post. I read this thread yesterday, then left it as I did not know anything about Hal, but today I came to see it again, and I thought that many members must have shared their opinions about it and I must find something useful, and here it is: your post.I found it useful as it enlightened me about Hal Finey and how optimistic he was about BTC. Besides that, I also learned that if Hal Finey used to talk with Satoshi and he said he might be a Japanese (not exactly in the same words), that's almost what he meant.I mean, that solves a lot of things or confusions for those who think he is dead, as Hal Finey clarifies by himself that he was interested in cryptography before that, and once the BTC was introduced, he became interested.",

As one of the early Bitcoin supporters, he played a such a big role in its foundation. If he were still with us, I am confident he would have continued to advocate for Bitcoin even more passionately, potentially making a positive impact on the cryptocurrency's development.Sadly he passed away and left our bitcoin community. May god rest his soul and I hope bitcoin will get more supporters in the future and I hope it'll get such a bright future.",

We have nothing as proof of their authenticity for those who were interested in appreciating them.Now the the Credits who deserve it are only Bitcoiners as after through this jumping journey they are still on the page to support the Bitcoin system.",

On how life on earth is ephemeral and the only the only true treasure we have on this earth is the lasting memory we have of our efforts and fulfillments on the surface earth.Indeed, it is a major achievement to remember the late Hal Finney, one of the early Bitcoin pioneers who played a critical part in the cryptocurrency's early days, receiving the very first Bitcoin transaction from Sir Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Hal Finney's confidence in the system and trust in Satoshi's vision are absolutely admirable. Unfortunately, he died, but his contributions to the growth and development of Bitcoin will be remembered forever.Adieu Late Hal Finney!",
