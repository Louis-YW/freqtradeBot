ShareX - https://getsharex.comWhen set up well, all you have to do is take a screenshot and a few edits if necessary, once you confirm, the uploading is automatically done to your preferred image hosting site and the image link is automatically copied to the clipboard.",

      "body": "This software along with the ones quoted by JeromeTash are very interesting and useful if you need to take and share screenshots frequently, thank you for sharing them. But if you don't want to install a software, I think imgbb.com is very convenient, because you don't need to save your screenshot as a file before uploading it there. You can just grab it with the Print screen key and simply paste it onto the uploading page there thanks to a basic Ctrl+V command.",

Currently I am downloading it . Quote from: dkbit98 on December 04, 2022, 10:10:46 PM~snip~Thanks for mentioning that Firefox has built-in Screenshots take . But what I have prioritized here is to get the direct Image link of that screenshot or image for adding in this forum.  But it's true that Image Uploader was also a good image hoster.",

I do not know whether the reason was from them, or that the forum was not supporting their links. It is good to see them working.In general, I prefer ShareX, they are open source and have many options, and you can easily do a video or Gif, and many formats are available.",
