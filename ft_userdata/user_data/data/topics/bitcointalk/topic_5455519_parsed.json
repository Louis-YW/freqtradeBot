But once a new post with valuable information is shared it is mostly acknowledged. I am not saying posts that report news of event with links attached. Most at times these topics are either not seeing by merit sources or people that saw it have no smerit to shareAlthough the merit system is quite different probably now than before, if you feel a topic or contribution isn’t appreciated enough then you might as well just submit the links to various threads on the forum, because there merit sources that have threads for this purposes.",

Everyone was a newbie, and they all got the attention and help they deserved from other members. Only those who were here before the merit system was introduced got merit airdropped to them. If merit is not given to anyone who deserves it, everyone in this forum has what they see in someone's post that makes them merit it. Once you have made your post unique and quality, you will get the merit you want to rank up to your next rank.",

I see newbies come on the forum and rank up successfully within a couple of months after putting effort into their posts and there are those that just spam the forum or merit hunt and they never get to rank up.I would agree that we need some more merit sources who would help find more quality posts which would have otherwise gone unnoticed.",

When I stumble upon a post that I find genuinely helpful, I don't bother checking the person's rank. If I have some spare merits to give, I gladly share them. However, I'm not exactly a merit powerhouse, so I don't have an abundance to help someone skyrocket their rank.Now, what you may have observed is that posts from higher-ranked members tend to receive more merits. And that's not surprising, considering that those members often bring valuable insights and wisdom thanks to their knowledge and experience. It's a general trend, but hey, there are always exceptions to the rule. So, it's not set in stone that higher-ranked posts are automatically more valuable, but they do tend to carry that reputation.Anyway, show me one post by a low ranking member that you think didn't get enough credit, and I'll see what I can do.",

Because \"merit\" is what comes naturally, in as much as you providing valuable contents and offering helpful advise during contributions.",

And the newbies you are writing about, how did you know that they are not been assisted to rank up. If you want merit, it is better you boldly come out without hiding your interest. If you have a good posts and you want to rank up, you can ask merit source to review your posts so they can add value to your merit history than just admitting that the newbies or people that are just coming up are not getting help. That is an understatement and you don't have to assume whatbuou have no proper understanding about. Maybe you can start making good posts and see whether you are not going to earn merits.",

I think he need to make sure he upgrade his posts history to receive merits from merit source. Someone cam not be writing posts that are not of quality and he expect to get merit to upgrade to the next rank. Well getting merits can be very slow but that should not be our aim of writing a quality posts. We should always make it as an habit to write well and have a good reputation than writing after merit hunting which can be very painful when we are nit getting what we plan to have. Merit is not only the compliment of a good posters, there are other things a person can earn from being a good writer which is quite better than just writing quality posts to earn merits .",

This indicates that you don't yet understand the workings of the forum or other things you should be aware of, but OP is not an easy task to rank up an account, so I'm not sure if you think the people you see with higher ranks are earning merits quickly. I want you to understand that even if you rank up without having the fundamental knowledge, how can you reply to good posts? As you said, those people you see on higher ranks go through a lot of learning procedures about the forum and cryptocurrency, even though I know most newbies come for merits to get higher ranks to apply for signature campaigns, which is not the case.  Quote from: Mia Chloe on June 06, 2023, 09:14:46 PMI am not imposing anyone to help others rank up but I am saying rank should not be a sole factor to consider when someone deserves a meritNobody will assist you in moving up the ranks as long as your posts are of high quality and deserving of merit. As long as you put in more effort, merit will come to you unexpectedly. However, as long as your posts are deserving of merit, forum users will award them, with the exception of those who reply to them using Smerits. Don't assume that those who are higher up the ranks simply ask for them; they also put in the effort.",

And you're maybe right to a certain extent. It may indeed be much easier for a known legendary, for example, to earn a merit than a newbie.
