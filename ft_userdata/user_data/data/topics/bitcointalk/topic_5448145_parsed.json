As BitMaxz commented already, after you paste in your seed phrase as needed on Electrum wallet, you will need to check BIP39, if you do not check it, you will not be able to go to the next step of importing the seed phrase.Did you generate the seed phrase from BIP 39 wallet? Or you generated it from Electrum wallet?",

Thanks ,Branko Kiric,  kiric.brankodr@yahoo.comBe careful of people who will send you emails asking for your help or send them seeds, they are scammers.Try to present your problem here publicly, as everyone will fear for his reputation if he tries to scam you.If English is not your first language, post in local boards.It seems that you entered one of the words incorrectly, check it correctly and it will work for you.",

There is also a chance you made a typo when copying the seed generated by Electrum.If I understood your post correctly, then this is a new wallet that you've never used, if this is true then just abandon it (in case you mde a mistake when backing up the seed), generate a new one and try again.",

Thanks ,Branko Kiric,  kiric.brankodr@yahoo.comWhat is your problem issue with Electrum wallet? can't you open it with your seed phrase, password or private key? You didn't even show a picture or a screenshot.     Also, if you are going to take it with a screenshot, of course do not include the seed or private here because later on you will be able to include it because then it will be a big problem. Besides, what did you use android or desktop or laptop?",
