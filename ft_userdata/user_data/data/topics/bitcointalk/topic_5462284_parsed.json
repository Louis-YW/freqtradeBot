They claimed they could not ship it.",

And how many ASICs do you want to buy for mining?If this is a small number of asics, then consider the possibility of installing noise boxes. If you cool the liquid with a radiator, then you will also have additional noise.

I was considering using a dcx immersion system. Noiseboxes, with all due respect, I think are more for hobbiest / bedroom miners. Emmersion cooling system is convenient to use where you can use the heat from ASICs. For a few ASICs, I would use noiseboxes. An immersion cooling system requires more control and attention, and off-the-shelf options are very expensive. If you do this system yourself, then there are other risks with overheating or shutdown or leaks in the system.",

I got a guy in Long Island NYhe is building special racks for s19s to dip the gear in liquid tanks.I will pm you contact info.pm sent!",

      "body": "Don't forget, that immersion itself won't eliminate waste heat. It will only make it more efficient to remove the heat from the miners.So you will still need to \"vent\" the heat somewhere (eg. cool down the water). One quite solution is underground pipe system. But you will need a LOT of pipes to transfer that much heat.",

Anyway, their kits seem to have the lowest noise levels, their dry coolers are pretty good, but the overall system is over priced.Foghashing is probably the best in terms of overall value, god products and good prices, they have the 120kw kit which can handle 24 new gen miners, total cost is roughly 17k, FOB china, including the 750L of coolant.",
