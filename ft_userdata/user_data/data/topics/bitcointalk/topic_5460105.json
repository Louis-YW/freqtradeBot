How to identify a good token from here?MEXC isn't that reputable of an exchange so I personally wouldn't trust their judgement in adding these new meme coins or tokens. They are probably just interested with the trading fees or listing fees if there's any so they couldn't care less if it turns out to be a scam.How are you going to filter good from the rest? You can't really tell at the early stages. Most of these tokens will likely pump in the upcoming bitcoin halving but that doesn't necessarily mean they're good. I'd rather wait if they will still be active after the hype phase.",

Being a meme coin is what it is, a meme, but if there is a lot of support for what you could have, you could maybe do something about it by supporting it publicly and letting other people know about it. You can never predict it if it's in a good or bad position, only as it happens. You can read the charts but it would be really unpredictable.",

It's best to invest in something that has a project to back them up and not something created out of thin air that will possibly break once a group of whales tries to manipulate it. Although, if you are so sure you want to buy memecoins then you better get yourself ready for sleepless nights because you will be monitoring them 24/7 just to be sure you won't get rekt. That's the hard part about this type of coins, you cannot just leave them without proper care. They must be checked all the time.",

DOGE is the exception because it is a classic cryptocurrency which already existed a long time before this memecoin trend started, however it's also not a guarantee it will get more relevance in crypto market futurely. There is also the possibility it has already reached its roof.If you want to understand the reasons which can boost a cryptocurrency price, first of all you have to pick a crypto to invest which follows fundamentals.

How to identify a good token from here?Meme coin is bad in general because they are useless and the most volatile crypto assets that you can ever have. Exchange is a business so it’s normal that they will keep listing any token regardless if it’s shitcoin as long as they will gain profit on trading fees due to the demand for this kind of token.Dogecoin is the only good memecoin since its already established and the father of meme coin but I don't recommend investing in any of it because they doesn't have any utility that will boost the price in long term aside from the ponzinomics high APY that flood the total supply.",

      "body": "Memecoin I think, has the most volatile market value. Reason is lack of token utility therefore its mrket price solely depends with demand created by big investors. As we all know, its market price is just increasing few times in a year unless bullrun occur that pulls prices up. But on a daily basis, market value of memetokens are rarely increasing. Memetokens are now only good for swing trades to get some amount from it. However  these tokens are having huge price increase once huge volume is triggered. So i think there's no telling whether you are in good position or not; not all tokens are able to recover once it hits deep, which ofcourse imposes risk if you are aiming for its lowest market price on a timeframe.",

I have seen MEXC exchange add many meme tokens daily. How to identify a good token from here?Nowadays, threads regarding meme coins has been created out of nowhere by these newbies, and some member ranked users as well. I wonder why?Maybe they are trying hard to hype it again? Or they're just curious on meme coins in general.Whatever the reason is, I would suggest to stay away with meme coins in general because investing in meme coins is like throwing your money, and losing it forever. Of course it will be a different scenario if you invested into meme coins like DOGE, and SHIB, but most of the meme coins out there are either a dead coin, a scam coin, or will be an abandoned project in a few months for me. Is there any way to tell if it's good or bad? In general, all meme coins are bad, and the risk is very high compare to the rewards that you can get. How to identify? Just stay away from meme coins FFS. There are better projects out there, and meme coins aren't the only coins out there. Those top market capped coins are better investment than meme coins. Bitcoin is a better investment than meme coins. Ethereum is a better investment than meme coins. I mean why you focus your money in meme coins where you can invest in better projects. Lesser risk, well not that high reward compare to what meme coins can give.",

Meme coins are totally dependent on market hype and huge investments, so you can't simply identify if a meme coin is going to go up or not because they don't have a project, they don't have any team, they don't serve any purpose at all, they are just a coin based on a meme or nowadays, a lot of coins are not even based on memes but they are carbon copies of the already existing coins.So it's totally useless to invest in all the meme coins only with the hope that one might go up and you get a lot of profit because most of them tend to fail and if all of them fail, you will lose a lot of money. So it's better if you just invest that amount in a token or coin that you know will gain value over time.",

How to identify a good token from here?I am going to be direct with you, there is not really much to understand when it comes to meme coins, since meme coins do not really have any kind of function or use case.Now this brings and interesting question, if that is the case then why meme coins exist at all and why some of them reach a high price? And the answer is that those coins simply exist to fulfill the delusions of a significant part of the market participants, they believe that if they invest in those coins then they will have a chance to become rich, and since enough of them have that mistaken belief then they can push the price of some of those coins really high and make the dreams of a few of them to come true.",
