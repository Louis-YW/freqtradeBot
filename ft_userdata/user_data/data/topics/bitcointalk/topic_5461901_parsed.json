Is there a better way?Thx If you win a million dollars and decide to DCA 50k, It will take a lot of weeks before you will be able to DCA enough. And because of how quickly money can go as it comes, it will better for me to just budget what I need money for, then invest what is left in bitcoins and then continue by the DCA strategy to continue to accumulate more. Keeping that amount of money for weeks is dangerous not just because it can get missing, but due to fact that it can be spent on somethings that suddenly come up when you have some money. You do not always need to buy bitcoins by DCA.",

      "body": "Well, if you ask me, I don't think that there is a particular way that is generally accepted as good, or the best way, you just have to do it the way you think fits your style in investing, like myself for example, if I wanted to invest the entire one million dollar in bitcoin, i did first invest like 10 percent of that amount considering the season we are now, that is that we are still in a bear season, so the chances that bitcoin price will still drop is high, so i did invest 10 percent first, and i will use the martingale strategy for the rest of the money.Like anytime Bitcoin removes like $500 to $1000 from its price, i did invest a little bit more than what i invested in the previous time.For example, my first investment out of the entire sum of one million dollar was 10 percent, in my next investment when the price of bitcoin drops more than $500 to $1000 below its previous price, i did invest like maybe 10.1 higher , that is 0.1 percent higher than what I previously invested, and in the next round, i did invest like 10.15 percent , just like that until the whole money is exhausted.Like I said before, there is no generally accepted way that is the best way, you just to find a way that is best for you, or you think will work best for you.",

Keeping that amount of money for weeks is dangerous not just because it can get missing, but due to fact that it can be spent on somethings that suddenly come up when you have some money. You do not always need to buy bitcoins by DCA.Indeed, in your words there is a certain common sense. There were many cases when people who won big sums of money in the lottery spent everything very quickly, lost their previous savings, property, became debtors and simply ended badly. Therefore, if you have a lot of money, there may be temptations for rash spending on unnecessary junk and extra trash. Perhaps the strategy of buying bitcoin immediately with some of that money doesn't sound stupid at all. Of course, if desired, btc can be exchanged back for fiat and spent (of course, with losses during conversion), but spending it will be a little more difficult, because this is already an investment and extra actions during the exchange will slow it down a bit. But you can do it differently (roughly as OP described): draw up an action plan, allocate an amount for investment in btc, buy btc once a week for a certain amount. I don’t think that someone, having become a millionaire, will spend time on daily purchases bitcoin, so 1 time per week or per month is quite acceptable. The amount of 50k also seems quite acceptable to me, although it can be divided by two. Should also take into account the current trend in the cryptomarket: in a bearish market, as it is now, it is better to buy at 50k, because bicoin is cheap, and in a bullish one, it is better to stretch over time and for a smaller amount, like 25k.",

Buying at the \"limit\" price means that it does not guarantee you will be successful buying bitcoins on a regular basis. Better yet, buy at the \"market\" price every Monday.Considering it is a large amount of money, make weekly withdrawals and use multiple hardware wallets or secure with multisig.",

Is there a better way?It all depends on how well you can justify the source of your 50k per week. Binance will undoubtedly ask you for EDD / SoW type documents for such amounts. You also need to take into account your country's tax policy if you plan to resell it one day. If you really want to go through a CEX for these transactions (indeed volumes are likely to be a problem with most P2P solutions), you should first contact them and negotiate some VIP status, so that you have a little more professional and personal support in case of problems.",

What are you going to do if you set a limit, and the price starts to go up? Not buy that week? After all you are doing DCA, aren't you? Order to market or for the best and go for it.

If the origin of the money is clear, in this case from the lottery collected at your bank, there should be no problem. I had thought that maybe a DEX would be better, but for these amounts the bank and the tax authorities in your country are going to keep an eye on you anyway, so I think that in this case CEX would be better.",

Is there a better way?Thx If you feel the price set today is the best to enter or the market price will increase higher why do you have to do a DCA, you can immediately buy Bitcoin at once or half of the amount of money budgeted to buy Bitcoin. The best way according to each user is always different. If you ask me, I prefer to buy when the price is lower than yesterday, the potential price increase will be bigger based on the movement in the market. You can apply the DCA strategy based on price movements on weekends. You can enter the market every Sunday by setting order limits.",

Is there a better way?Thx For retail investors like us, 1 million USD is quite a large amount and investing in bitcoin requires careful consideration and planning as well as knowledge, otherwise it is very easy to lose money. If it were me, I would DCA weekly like you and I would use binance to do it too. Because with large buy and sell orders, centralized exchanges are still safer because of high liquidity. But you shouldn't leave your bitcoins in binance, always transfer them all to your hardware wallet after completing the buy order.",

Because if I ever Igot that amount of million dollars, I would separate 250k$ that I would provide it for bitcoin immediately. And I will use 50k$ in day trading and the profit I will get  it on day trading I will apply DCA for other potential cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin.

Yes, DCA is a good strategy but if I think that the price now is as low as it can be then I'd certainly do everything to buy that.Whilst it's a good to lumpsum it, the problem mostly with exchange is that when you're a buyer and you get that much transactions.
