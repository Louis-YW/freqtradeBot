My question is from people's experience or research which is more profitable,  Bitcoin hosting or joining a Bitcoin mining pool ?I prefer the idea of using a hosting service that electricity cost will be lower and the miner managed by people whom are more experienced.",

      "body": "Hosting and joining a pool are not mutually exclusive. Hosting simply means that you have the miners located elsewhere that is out of your immediate control. Any host should damn well let you point the miners at whatever pool you want to use!Any host that requires you to use a specific pool no doubt receives a kickback for each miner pointed there from the pool operators...",

Even solo miners point their hashrate to solo pools About the hosting question, you can manage your ASICs yourself, or you can buy one / send yours to some hosting companies. You will need to pay for electricity following their rates, and to pay for the service in general.Everything depends of your skills, your average kw/h price, your opportunities to let run h24 noisy asics or not etc... Each situation is different, you are the only one to know the best solution in your own situation",

In any case, this is your equipment that you will use for mining either solo or as part of a pool and you will also manage it, the hosting staff is responsible only for uninterrupted and safe operation, all setup and connection are your worries, if you really mean hosting and not cloud mining.",
