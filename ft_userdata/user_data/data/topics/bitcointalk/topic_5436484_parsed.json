And if it's because of money, everyone must be eager to have it one way or another. But we humans can control ourselves well and it depends on whether we want it or not.",

Also, no matter how many quotes a player has, if he won't foolow into those statements, nothing will really happen. Most of the gambling quotes are accepting the bitter outcome of playing which is something a player cannot really do since everyone has the urge to win. In such instances addiction and negative playing behavior arise. Perhaps the quote \"Only gamble an amount you can afford losing\" wherein there's really no amount to many of us, which could be accepted easily if you lose. Therefore, quotes could only be a guidance but it will still depend on the player to how will he/she make use of it or his personal principles.",

This quote goes along with the quote above that money won is sweeter than money earned, but then how long can we depend on luck to give us a desired constant result, I guess your answer is the same as mine.  We have to learn how to manage risk by limiting our level of positivity and dependence on continuous luck, which is not provable for long-term sake, it is good to be positive and lucky but not forget the technicality involved in winning a game from a casino.",
