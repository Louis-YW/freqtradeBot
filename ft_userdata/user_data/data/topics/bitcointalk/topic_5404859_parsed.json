  "content": "https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_197688.htmQuoteNATO leaders signed off on key decisions, including a fundamental strengthening of NATO’s deterrence and defence, an invitation to Finland and Sweden to join NATO and long-term support to Ukraine.QuoteSo Allies discussed their efforts to mitigate the crisis. And get grain out of Ukraine, by land and on sea.QuoteWe also addressed how Russia and China continue to seek political, economic, and military gain across our southern neighbourhood.Both Moscow and Beijing are using economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region. So today, we discussed how to address this growing challenge. Including with even more support for NATO’s partners in the region.QuoteWe live in a more dangerous world. And we live in a more unpredictable world. And we live in a world where we have actually a hot war going on in Europe, with large scale military operations we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War. Of course, this is imposing suffering on the Ukrainian people. We see that every day and we pay tribute to the courage, to their bravery. We also conveyed that message to President Zelensky when he addressed the Summit.",

Because that's what her selling oil and gas and wheat and loads of other products to other nations was all about. So, it's the US pushing other nations into sanctioning Russia, and then helping Ukraine bring Nazi's into their government to organize a military to fight Russia, and then pushing NATO into the area more and more, that is causing the trouble.",

      "body": "The interesting or maybe even frightening thing was that for the first time NATO brought in 3 additional countries to the summit. Countries that aren't located in the North Atlantic. Is NATO becoming a worldwide treaty now? Reminds me of Israel being invited to the Eurovision each year.I feel like this is going to push China more into the arms of Russia. Fun fact: one might thing that world leaders will have good tailors, but some of them have much too long pants.",

Some of the younger generation that work at Walmart have too long pants, too. Maybe they would make a better government in the US than the one we have now.",

Well done my guy, that probably took a lot of efort. On the geopolitical scale the US is a nuber one culprit, but saying that it's not the bullys fault for beating the crap out of you because you cam close to him is idiotic and stupid. And also, Russia has been full of Nazis for some time now and that's no news for us in Europe, so that narative is dumb. At best it nazis attacking nazis, but that as well is just mental gymnastics.",

At best it nazis attacking nazis, but that as well is just mental gymnastics.No mental gymnastics involved at all. All you have to do is look at what is happening. What do you do when the bully comes to get you? Russia was sitting over in her corner of the world, happily trading many goods and wares with other countries, and then the bully, the US, came for her. And the bully brought his friends, NATO and the Nazi's.The Nazi's in Russia couldn't overthrow Russia from within her, so they moved to Ukraine.The US is supporting them for money purposes... the 46 (more?) Wuhan-style labs they set up in the Ukraine.The US doesn't remember that Russia and the USSR played a big part in putting down the Nazi's in WW2. They still know how to do it. If they didn't, Nazi's would have taken Russia over long ago. Poor US and NATO. Wasting all that money in an effort they will probably lose at.",

Putin does not want the war at the initial stage but it looks like the United States really pulled the legs of the Russian government to begin the war that can not be avoided. NATO needs to think twice and resolve the current war that is going on than allow the Russian soldiers to destroy Ukraine entirely.",
