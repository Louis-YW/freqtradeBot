  "content": "About this time last year a friend of my lost everything in a wallet of his. He woke up and everything was gone. It was stolen, not by a stranger or hacker but by someone close to him, someone who had access to his phone. Someone who was also a trader like him (you have to have a certain level of knowledge about crypto to do what the person did.) Now, my friend took steps to make sure he’s safe from online hackers but not from his people close to him. The operation was carried out at night while he was asleep, by the time he woke up it was too late.I was reading an article related to this yesterday and that led me to remember that incident and all he went through. I won't wish that on my enemy. That is why I've decided to share this.Common tips to keep your phone or laptop secure 1. Avoid giving out personal information    That text message that looks to be from your bank may not be. If you get requests via email or text     for account information from any business, contact the business directly to confirm the request. The     same advice goes for tapping links in unsolicited emails or texts.2. Use a pin, password or pattern to lock your phone    However you choose, make sure people don’t have access to your device. Your passwords should be     private and known only to you.3. Download apps only from trusted stores    If you’re browsing for a new game or something more productive, use places such as Google Play..     Make sure you check ratings and reviews if they are available, and read the app’s privacy policy to     see exactly what phone features it will have access to if you download. 4. Keep your operating system and apps updated    There are typically periodic updates to both of these that not only add new features, but also offer     tightened security.5. Log out of sites after you make a payment    If you bank or shop from your smartphone, log out of those sites once your transactions are     complete. Other tips include not storing your usernames and passwords on your phone and avoiding     transactions while you are on public Wi-Fi.6. Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use    You think of them as ways to connect to something, but thieves can use them to connect to your     device and access files. 7. Protect your investment    Protect your phone in a way that if it gets stolen or missing, nobody can access your personal details     even if they gain access into the phone.     You could place a password to apps you use for transactions and also protect sensitive details like     transaction pins.8. Only use apps you trust:    Only grant trusted apps permission to parts of your phone like location, calendar, contacts, messages.     I downloaded an app on my phone and it asked for permission for my keyboard. I became very     skeptical of the app and decided to delete it to be safe. I can't let any random app have access to     everything I type including my passwords.9. Adhere to the security warnings of your phone or browser:   Sometimes you're about to visit a site and your browser gives you the “site is not secure” warning but    you refuse to listen and still go ahead. That's not safe for you and/or your device.   Never input your personal information or any information at all in a website that uses HTTP (no S). If    possible, avoid any website that is not HTTPS. An HTTP website means it's not secure so any    information you put there can be accessed by a third party.In an article made by Bitdefender, (What is Online Privacy? And Why is it Important?) they had this to say; \"We can look at our personal data as something hackers either directly exploit or use as soon as they get a hold of it. It’s also something they can trade with other cybercriminal organizations. So, personal data is commoditized. It has a price. Your medical data, your financial history, your credit card data, your online shopping preferences have a price.\"Liviu Arsene (Senior E-Threat Analyst, Bitdefender)https://www.verizon.com/articles/8-common-sense-tips-to-keep-your-smartphone-secure/https://www.bitdefender.com/cyberpedia/what-is-online-privacy/",

It is very possible to avoid using centralized platforms 100% if you actually intend to.• Use a non custodian wallet service provider like Electrum or bitcoincore,• For trades, use a P2P, decentralized platform to sell or buy bitcoins and transfer them to your non custodian wallet,• For extra privacy, you can use a mixer or coinjoining service (N.B, coins that have been previously mixed are often rejected by centralized exchanges).P.S, double posting (consecutively) is against forum rules. You should instead edit your new reply into your previous one.",

I do not have public access to my network, and the Wi-Fi is protected by a good password. Maybe you meant using public Wi-Fi? This is very dangerous and not recommended. In addition, it is better not to install wallets on devices that you regularly use. Buying a hardware wallet will save you a lot of headaches.",

From personal experience, I have a laptop that I almost never use but that has actually been set aside for anything to do with my cold wallet. Therefore, I transfer any cryptocurrency I have in a centralized exchange into it at the end of each month after I have recharged the battery and made relevant software updates. I go through this process again at each month's conclusion. It's been working really well for me thus far.",

Applications that are not installed via Google Playstore tend to be more dangerous because there are some that embed malware in them.And quiet further privacy, not everything has to be published and told to friends or even family, we can't trust them completely. but there are times when we should give up our privacy to those we do trust.",
