  "content": "now the name bitcoin has begun to spread a lot in the world, especially on the internet there are so many exchange advertisements that offer buying and selling bitcoins.and as humans we must have a goal to build the economy for the future, because now what I feel is more and more business competition.but my family and I have always instilled that I have to be able to save, in the form of money to the bank.but now my family and I have been added to saving bitcoin as a future asset, and every purchase uses the DCA system, but in saving bitcoin I always set aside money to buy bitcoin, as well as my children who are starting to implement a bitcoin saving system.so i have 2 savings,1: saving money in the bank,     for according to     I save in the bank     also very important.2: bitcoin saving,    I think saving    bitcoins are very important    even though we don't    will know for    future price    bitcoins.but in my bitcoin savings there is not much when compared to the money that is deposited in the bank. so my savings cash is more in savings to the bank than saving bitcoins, because saving bitcoinsof course there is a risk. so the amount of money that is saved to bitcoin is only a small amount.and save my bitcoins for the long term (long term investment).I want to ask if what I did wrong, or right.?and are you also the same as me, implementing a bitcoin saving syste?",

That way, you wouldn't be forced to sell your bitcoin if it's the case that you suddenly need a good amount of your local currency.",

As bad as fiat money appears to be right now, the benefit of having a savings account in a bank is usually that your deposit is guaranteed by your government.Now I'm the first to say that the promises of your government doesn't mean much when shit really hits the fan, but in general, and depending on your country, there's nothing like having some protection from worst case scenario.Especially in the case of Bitcoin where you only can count on yourself.Save what you can to Bitcoin, save what you know you eventually need for expenses in a savings account -- if something happens to you and you didn't prepare well enough, at least that money goes to your family.",

One should have a diversified investment, some in BTC, others in other assets and some in the bank; if you have other assets in mind that aren't crypto or any business idea, you can spend some of the money you have in the bank on them, because inflation is also a problem with money kept in the bank.The most important thing to be sure you are doing it right is for you to tell us how you are storing your BTC, if you are storing it in a custodial or an online wallet, then you are doing it wrong, many centralized exchanges and services are going bankrupt, so your money is better in your self custody, either use a hardware wallet, or set up your Electrum wallet for offline or cold storage for maximum security of your long term BTC investment.",

Maybe the value of your bitcoin savings is not much at this time, but after the bitcoin price can increase to the last ATH, you will see how big the spike you get later.You can continue doing DCA while waiting for the bitcoin price to start a recovery and start a rally. It may seem boring because you buy every week or month but believe me, the results will not lie to you. Don't store your bitcoins on exchanges but prepare a wallet that you specifically store bitcoins.",

As we all know, bitcoin market is volatile though and there is always ups and downs too. However, you already have a backup plan which is the fiat savings and that would be able to cover you and your family when the time for urgent needs arises. Nevertheless, I believe your bitcoin savings is a long term holding as you and your family have agreed so that you can be able to make good benefits from the savings and moreover, I would advise you keep taking advantage of the current market situation now so as to accumulate more of bitcoin in your savings. If you have already plan holding bitcoin fraction by fraction, that's is a good one for you. I wish you and your family a happy bitcoin holding.",

But its also good to have a few percentages of your money into BTC. You can not go wrong with BTC, it's known to be accepted and people know it already and its value go up high in time.",

      "body": "Well, the irony here (assuming you are saving longterm) is that fiat is inflationary (meaning the banks print more than should be printed making it lose value) & it loses value overtime hence not a good Store of Value or it's not a good means to save/store money long-term  unlike Bitcoin which is better for long-term savings as it's deflationary(less & less are printed overtime) making it worth more long-term.I think the risk  is higher with fiat currencies when it comes to longterm saving as your money will most likely be worth less long-term. If for example you invested $100 in your bank savings account when a bag of rice was worth $100, and the bag of rice becomes $150 in two year time while your $100 savings probably only increased slightly by 20% to worth $120, you will need extra $30 to be able to buy the bag of rice... That is a lost for you as your purchasing power has decreased and you can't afford a bag of rice due to the fiat saving becoming worth-less.This is usually not the case saving longterm with Bitcoin as the $100 will likely worth more and possibly afford you 2 bags of rice.",

In this one 70 should be your investments and 30 should be your savings. These would be the savings which will help you survive in the world, it will take care of your daily needs, commute, bills etc. While the major portion should always go into the investments. This will ensure that you are having pretty good amount in the market which may give you good returns in the long terms. However, if there arises any situation where your investments are going down or you are having loses in the market then you won't be much worried about it since you are already ok with those 30 portions and living good life. On the other hand if those 70 goes up highly then it's your lucky day. Choose right path and plan everything prior to going there.",

As bad as fiat money appears to be right now, the benefit of having a savings account in a bank is usually that your deposit is guaranteed by your government.Generally, the case for Western countries, but I'm not sure this is the case for most of the countries in the East. Also, your savings is generally only covered by certain banks, and if you have multiple bank accounts belonging to the same group, you can potentially get caught out. So, that's worth noting if you're relying on that guarantee that the government does. It's these incentives that keep people storing money in the bank, since being your own bank definitely comes with its risk, and a certain level of knowledge to keep it safe. Not everyone, is comfortable with that.",
