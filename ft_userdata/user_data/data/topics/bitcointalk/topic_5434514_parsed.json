Quote from: Fortune.st on January 12, 2023, 09:22:30 PM1. Â  Â  Anonymity: players can enjoy their gaming experience without having to reveal any of their personal information. The current phone number field will be completely eliminated. Does this also mean that gamblers will never be asked to submit their personal informations(documents) for kyc verification?? If passing kyc verification is required in some cases, then please make this categorically clear for gamblers so we know before hand, to avoid problems in the future. Quote 3. Â  Â  No deposit required for the VIPs: players can start playing with real money without having to make a deposit. This one is really interesting, can you please explain further how this is possible, if as a vip on fortune.st, I don't have a dime on my bankroll, how do I start playing without first of all making a deposit? Would be interesting for us to know. Quote 7. Â  Â  Â Safe and secure: players can be sure that their personal and financial information is protected. This is contradictory to your number one feature which states that players can play without having to reveal their personal information.ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€Quote 16. Â  Â No geographical restrictions: players can play from anywhere in the world. How about countries where gambling/online casinos are banned and citizens denied access to the sites, are gamblers from such a region allowed to use VPN to play on fortune.st? Quote 17. Â  Â Cryptocurrency support: players can make transactions using cryptocurrencies. Sorry but I feel this is not to even be included in the new features, as naturally, this is why you can even post on this forum, without support for cryptocurrency, there wouldn't be any need posting about fortune.st on this forum. By the way, I sometimes mistake fortune.st for fortunejack, is this two casinos related in any way?",

If the upgrade to VIP isn't automatic for everyone who registers now, what exact requirements do i have to fill to be in a great position to become a VIP?

I think its worth trying. Other benefits includes Personalized service: Our VIP players will get dedicated account managers or customer service representative to assist with any issues or questions they may have.Invitations to special events: VIPs may be invited to exclusive events such as tournaments, prize draws, and other special promotions.Higher loyalty rewards: VIPs may earn more loyalty points for their wagers, which can be exchanged for bonuses or other rewards.Higher table limits: VIPs may be able to place higher bets on table games than regular players.",
