  "content": "According to https://mempool.space/docs/faq:What does it mean for the mempool to be \"full\"?When a Bitcoin transaction is made, it is stored in a Bitcoin node's mempool before it is confirmed into a block. When the rate of incoming transactions exceeds the rate transactions are confirmed, the mempool grows in size.The default maximum size of a Bitcoin node's mempool is 300MB, so when there are 300MB of transactions in the mempool, we say it's \"full\".It explains how we got there, but doesn't elaborate on what that means for Bitcoin.Right now we are at  354 MB / 300 MB, but if that doesn't have any effect why are we even talking about a limit in the first place?",

Some nodes may set higher limit.The main reason to have a mempool size limit is to protect the network against a denial of service attack.It doesn't mean much for bitcoin when it is full. You might need to rebroadcast your transaction if it is out of the 300mb mempool, but not necessarily. If you are making a new transaction now and mempool is full, just send a higher fee and you will get ahead other transactions.",

Quote from: tranthidung on November 16, 2022, 01:39:54 AMDouble check, it is a little bit less than 135 vMb in mempool according to Johoe's siteYou are all mixing up your numbers here.The 300MB limit is the RAM usage of the deserialized data for all the transactions in the mempool. This is not the same as the space that these transaction will take up in a block (either in terms of virtual bytes or raw bytes). Of course every node has its own mempool, but even identical mempools would result in different RAM usage between nodes due to different hardware, node software, OS, and so on.Although we currently have around 120 vMB of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, when deserialized these transactions are using around 300 MB of memory.Here is a good site to visualize this: https://statoshi.info/d/000000020/memory-pool?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=nowThe green line in the top graph shows the total transaction size, while the white line in the middle graph shows the memory usage of those transactions.",

those ~$3 coffee amounts are weekly wages for the unbankedI'm happy for people to send \"coffee amounts\" if that's what they want to do.  However, if you want access to the most secure blockchain on Earth, that level of security has to be paid for.  That's just supply and demand.  You want something cheaper, you make that compromise by having less security.  I get that you're a lefty socialist type (and I have no problem with that, because I'm one too in the realm of fiat).  I understand all too well the ease with which you could apply that same socialist mindset to Bitcoin, but I assure you it won't work.  Bitcoin is fundamentally neutral.  It will resist gravitating to either hard left or hard right economic theories.  Bitcoin won't give discounted tx fees to those who might face low incomes, poverty or financial difficulty.  I'm sorry if it doesn't work that way.  Either come up with something better or accept it for what it is.Every Bitcoin node on the face of the planet has now been in a position where at any point in the last 7+ years, it could have shifted to running code that would permit greater on-chain throughput.  The vast majority have declined that opportunity.  Until that changes, you aren't getting what you want.  Shoot the messenger again if you like.  Make out like I'm the villain.  I'm only telling you how it is.  If you want the situation to change, the onus is on you to come up with a better proposal.  Nothing you've said in the last 7+ years has resulted in you getting the level of throughput you desire, so I don't know why you keep expecting to get a different outcome by repeating the same things over and over.  It's beyond absurd at this point.Quote from: wrong because franky on November 17, 2022, 12:49:50 AMas for the hardware requirements

quotes without comment for others to make their own conclusions on how important you feel it is for the financially vulnerable to be able to have access to the benefits of security and privacy which running a full node confers:Quote from: franky1 on May 09, 2017, 02:54:45 PMb. not everyone NEEDS to be a full nodec. it would mainly be businesses and enthusiasts that NEED to run full nodesQuote from: franky1 on February 08, 2019, 10:10:42 PMthe way i see it is that not everyone NEEDS to be a full node. so yea people can use lite wallets. the way i see it if you only have balance to only b spending occassionally (once a week) you dont need to monitor every transaction there is all day every day, all you really care about is that your transaction exists. so being a full node is not an essential need.where as businesses that NEED to monitor hundreds/thousands of transactions they are personally involved in have personal reasons to NEED to be a full node.also those few people that have slow internet because they are home users actually bottleneck the propogation. and thus they are not helping the network. so just being a full node for the sake of thinking they are helping, is actually doing the opposite.Quote from: franky1 on December 18, 2018, 09:56:10 PMthose only getting paid once a month and only wanting to use bitcoin just to buy groceries to be delivered next day, can just use spv wallets. not everyone needs to be a full node and monitor ~2000 tx every 10 minutes if they are only personally involved in 1 tx a day/weekif you are a business NEEDING to be monitoring more than just a couple addresses. then you probably for other business purposes have your computers on a 4 year tax deductibles set-up where you replace equipment. and you probably hav a business internet plan. rather than a home user planQuote from: franky1 on May 26, 2015, 01:01:23 PMnot everyone needs to get fully set up with bitcoin. just the ones with large amounts invested.. for

(if nodes dont have the blockchain, they cant share the blockchain. thus there is less of a pool of nodes about to help out new people entering the full node backbone)your narrow mindset thinking $3/coffee is an acceptable fee and an unacceptable spend amount for traders/users to want to move.. is your narrow mind of the elite world of 1st world countries..i personally am born and raised white british and as far back as the family tree goes has been british.. so i am a 1st world country person. but i atleast can see beyond my personal circumstances to actually want bitcoin to be useful for the 3rd world where $3 is a day/weeks wage. where by they should not be told to not use bitcoin and instead told to go use another network. or simply priced out of using bitconi via fees being higher than their days/weeks salarybitcoin was a payment system for the unbanked.. not a reserve system for the corporate elite financial services sector!! acknowledge understand and realise that.....the points at which i said not everyone needs to be a full node.. is different to those that want. this statement of me saying not everyone NEEDS to be a full node is in response to your drivel over the years of you previously saying that you thought my mindset was that everyone should be full noder even if they dont want to use bitcoin daily.. and also your opposite drivel about those that want to use bitcoin should not have to be its actually true if people are only transacting once a month they dont NEED to be online 247 watching for broadcastsbitcoin is not LNlogic and common sense wins.. if you are not going to cdrive a car for a month. there is no need to keep the car engine running for the entire month your not using ithowever people that are true bitcoiners that want to use bitcoin every day should be able to. without being told by altnetters like yourself that they should adopt your altnet instead to avoid fee's which your favoured corporate shill devs have pushed into bitcoin as a premium to advertise other things that lead them on a path towards altnetsbitcoin should have more transaction counts per blocks so that more people can enjoy bitcoin regularly. and i mean bitcoin. where they actually use bitcoin daily. your idea is for people to lock up sats and for months not need to run a full node where by they instead give sats to a hub and a hub gives them inbound balance on some other network to play with for monthswhen you say you want the fair balance of fees of bitcoin.. you are not talking about bitcoin network fee;s.. you are and you keep doing it. talking about fee's associated with moving value you call \"bitcoin\" but on a network that is not the bitcoin network even though you try to assume the LN network is \"bitcoin\"when i talk about bitcoin fee's i actually mean the bitcoin network feesas for your rhetoric about the privilege of a limited blockspace which comes at a premium where people should pay that premium.. again that limit is not one based on science or physics limitation. that implied limit is put there and kept low for the politics(not neutral)whilst you dream about a situation where block miners need $100k($16k*6.25=$100k) a block to cover electric~hardware  costs of mining and a block only has 2000 tx average you love the idea that people should be paying $50 per txhowever.. basic economics is that if bitcoin miners need $100k a block.. then having10k tx = people pay $1020k tx = people pay $5thus having more tx onchain actually helps decrease the fee each person pays without having to get everyone to pay $50 in your \"limited blockspace so pay the premium\" scenario...now ake your altnet appreciation corporate middlemen service mindset shilling back to your altnet because all your chants about why you dont want bitcoin to scale is not about BITCOIN utility. its about convoluted ways to limit and premiumize bitcoin out of common folks reach just so you can con and scam them out of pegged value on another networkoh an as for privacy.. bitcoin does not ask for your name. nor does it ask for you home location nor does it ask for the list of products you want to buy.. bitcoin is good. you are confusing bitcoin with the middle men services which you are so engrained and used to using so much you cant tell the difference between the corporate shilling and services you are involved in. vs the actually utility and protocol of the bitcoin networkyes you are one of the idiots that wants to break blockchains to not be immutable accounting system that proves the creation of coins and also shows that all payments use coins that can prove their creation origin.. you instead your your business/service \"surveilance2 exchanges as a thing to wreck bitcoin. sorry but how about stop using services that share your shopping list and delivery address.. then you can have your privacy",

 I've literally just checked my post history with the forum's search function and it comes up almost exclusively when you are in the damn thread pissing and whining about reference clients and I'm quoting you.  I don't go around proclaiming anything about how many reference clients I think there should or shouldn't be.  Largely because I don't give a toss.  This is all your obsession, not mine.  Stop projecting your bizarre and ludicrous fixations on everyone else, plz.Quote from: franky1 on November 17, 2022, 08:51:51 PMwhile you pretend the data arguments against expanding bitcoin tx count is reasons to say no to it by pretending it wil centralise bitcoin.. you are just ignoring the real reasons of what cause bitcoin centralisations. and that is not letting users have space to transact daily to then actually want to run a node daily.I'm not the one \"not letting\" anyone do anything.  That would be the nodes, like I keep pointing out and you keep ignoring.  Again, when nodes permit more throughput, you will get more throughput.  But the nodes don't want that right now.  Remember, enforcement of will.  Actions, not words.  People are running code that they approve of (and you despise) because that's what they want.  This is a \"you\" problem.  We're happy, you aren't.  All I'm suggesting is that you find a more productive outlet to funnel your impotent frustrations into.",
