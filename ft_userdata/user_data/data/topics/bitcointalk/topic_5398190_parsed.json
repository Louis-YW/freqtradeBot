Short/long squeeze can't avoid especially on Luna.This is my first time seeing a huge market cap altcoins suffer like this in just a short period of time. I am still not buying this for now. But if you want to gamble, you can try it with small stakes.",

I doubt Luna can return to normal. this problem is very big and makes everyone lose faith in this project. although it looks profitable because it makes a quick profit, but I doubt this method will work the second time around. because right now the price of Luna has stopped moving. maybe this is already the lower high for this coin. and after this it will probably start going down without a pump.",

Luna's lowest point today is $0.5 so even when you buy at $5, you still suffer a 90% loss. No trader has a ball to hold a position like that. I was about to take a long position on Luna but then my instinct told me to stop. So I quit. On the other side, there might be those who are extremely lucky to buy Luna for around $0.5. They might x10 their portfolio right now, in the middle of the crisis. In my opinion, it is hard for Luna to get back to normal since it loses more than 99.5% of its ATH. It is like a nightmare to all investors",

So how much you have made from your trade? saying that if the price already reached the bottom and it was doing a small recovery was the most easiest thing and any one can do that as well. The question is how much your profit right now from doing this? People are expecting the price to go down even deeper than the current rate which is around 2 dollars.",

That's a big stupidity, what are they thinking? That BTC won't ever go down again?.",

Luna is very bummed right now, a lot of people talk about it, but I think it's enough at $5 for us to sell, instead of hoping for $10-$20, a lot of new projects are not that strong, meaning they strengthen so fast and then return to normal prices, if you are wrong even one person who dares to take risks, for me the return really depends on what we do, and this is also influenced by the stability of the coin, hopefully the risk you take can really be useful for the future",

Look, a little dump is usual, but when a big coin or token does a huge dump, we should realise that there might be something wrong with this dump. Something happened with Luna because it is the largest coin, but it suddenly has a huge dump, so something is wrong. And exactly the same thing happened. There is a huge wrong and that is their fund. People say they might be using their fund or wastte it. So now they don't have much funds to run their project smoothly and they have also lost people's trust too. So I don't think it might be possible that it will be recovered again. That's my opinion. Thank you.",
