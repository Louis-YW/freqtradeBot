The merge is not a failure, it may take time before we feel the real result of that merge but I’m sure it will happen. Wait for the market to recovers, don’t panic and just keep on buying, cheaper price for ETH is a good opportunity to accumulate.",

Of course, by not being able to mine, the amount of Ethereum will be increasingly scarce, so people think the price of Ethereum will increase. But on the other hand, if Ethereum is currently still being tinkered with by its developers, then there is a high possibility that the same thing will happen in the future. I think Bitcoin is one of the current solutions. But if Bitcoin follows in Ethereum's footsteps, there is a possibility that Bitcoin will no longer be of value to investors.

Ultimately, as staking activity picks up, the issue is expected to stabilize at around 5,000 ETH per day.Ethereum's intrinsic supply burning mechanism is an important factor in generating high returns. Here, the base fee, which is determined in real-time using network congestion as its primary input, is burned while the validator award consists mostly of two variables: the tip fee, which is the fee incurred by the user for prioritizing the processing of a particular transaction, and the block subsidy, which is currently set at 2 ETH per block and is divided equally among all validators. The infographic below details all the factors needed to ensure high returns on Ethereum.",

Ethereum miners are also feeling so bad to find a new token that's worthy to be mined. This time the bearish market has been ruining the hype from ethereum and whole of coins in the market.

I think what you see are only the excitement of the people or the hype. I know that can make the price go up but there is no guarantee that they will sustain that feeling and maybe those people gets discouraged right after the merge was done, that is why they dump their eth.It's normal for every coins to go up in the month of December for some reasons and it has nothing to do with the merge. There is no need for them to sell their eth if they want to try staking. That will only delay their time.

It is because people don't really understand what the merge is. They think it is the same as BTC halving, but it is not. People bought ETH because of the good issue about ETH development, sadly they don't know what exactly the development is. Since the merge is nothing to do with the price, surely there is no significant increase in ETH price. Well, people who bought ETH before the merge, must hold their ETH now. It is decreasing a lot along with the decrease in BTC price.",
