Because they may seize your coins and tell you to verify your account. Also on those KYC exchanges, they may seize your coins at anytime and ask you to provide how you get the coins.Quote from: bitcoin talk on December 19, 2023, 02:38:59 AMWill posts like this be banned too after Jan?Yes.

Using mixer will be expensive because the current regulations is full of KYC, so it's not gonna be easy to stay anonymous.It is super easy to mess it up, by mixing outputs of separate transactions together. For example, I have a UTXO that is freshly mixed. Then I pay something online and I receive the change. If I then mix the change with other UTXOs that haven't been processed by mixers or coinjoins etc, you can definetely make a mistake. So I underline a sentence in your response, because it is important that we do things properly. No tool is safe against human error",

But, keep in mind that since the purpose of using a bitcoin mixer is to protect your privacy, you have to use decentralized exchanges like BISQ instead of centralized ones. If you use centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, they'll ask you for KYC documents and source of funds, that means, your privacy won't be protected and they'll have an eye on you (let's assume this one).We can't predict whether mixers will charge more or not, i.e. whether they'll be expensive or not but it will be very hard to find a good, trustworthy mixer.",

It is only matter of time when some criminals like Lazardus group to mix coins on a mixer and bring problems to that platform. The US. government, DOJ. will seize, sanction it and it will become illegal.QuoteWill posts like this be banned too after Jan?It is allowed if a discussion post has no url link to a mixer website.Follow it in Mixers to be banned.Follow theymos' post history to see his updates about the ban and what he adjust, finalize for January 1 ban against mixers.QuoteWill using mixers be an expensive?Depends on each mixer.

If you use them for illegal purpose then there would issues. You can discuss about mixers, you cannot promote or shill them in the forum.
