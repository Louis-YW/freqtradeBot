  "content": "Honestly, they've printed so much money out of thin air that I've simply lost count. The big surge in money printing at the start of COVID was the fourth round of so called quantitative easing since 2008. I'm not sure if the ongoing money printing up until April of 2022 was just extended QE4 or if that counted as QE5. So I guess we are on the brink of either QE5 or QE6.Anyway, let's take a look at the Fed's balance sheet:2008 - 0.8 trillion dollars.2022 - 9 trillion dollars.8.2 trillion dollars just created out of thin air in 14 years. To put that in to perspective, with population of ~334 million, that's $24,500 of new money for every single person in the US. That's $8.2 trillion driving up inflation, devaluing the dollar, making your savings worth less, making your money buy less, making you poorer.Don't worry, though. They'll reverse all this printing, they say. They started at the end of 2018, and managed to take a measly $0.5 trillion off before they started printing again to astronomical new levels.Don't worry, though. They'll reverse that too. They started a year ago, and have managed to take $0.6 trillion off it this time! But wait, let's zoom in on the last few months of the graph I shared above:$0.3 trillion new money in a week. It took them a year to take off $0.6 trillion, and they've undone half of that progress in a week. Guess it's back to normal proceedings of money printer goes brrrrr! Can't have the banks losing money now, can we! The banks must be protected at all costs. Fuck 99% of the population who are being made poorer and poorer on a daily basis. As long as the banks get endless bailouts!Here's a quote I made almost 3 years ago:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on June 21, 2020, 09:48:13 AMIf it took them 11 years to start reducing their balance sheet following the 2008 crash, how much longer do you think it will take following this crash? Not to mention they probably aren't even finished printing for this crash yet. There will be another crisis, and another, and another, all before they even begin to undo these changes, let alone get their balance sheet back down to \"normal\" levels. The printing will never end. The dollar value will never stop falling. This isn't temporary - this is normal.This is the new normal. Money printer goes brrrrr. Fiat is a scam.Bitcoin fixes this.",

As much as some are surprised that the US government stood behind all deposits in all banks as a guarantee, I wonder if they had any other choice at all? Of course, they could act selectively or not act at all, but that would certainly cause a domino effect and the collapse of dozens of US banks in the first wave, and then the spillover of the crisis to other markets.The situation in the EU is currently stable (at least that's what they say), but the Swiss case is a clear example that even the best in business can mess up. Regardless of all the guarantees, no one should feel safe keeping their money in the bank, but most people simply don't know any better than that. Bitcoin is an alternative, but most authorities will do everything to make it an alternative for a very small number of people.",

Because between last year and now, the population is 334 million (like you mentioned), but I looked back to 2008, and the population was just 304.1 million, which is only an increase of 8.95%. In just 14 years, the printed money has increased by 1,025% while the population has increased by only about 9%.Â Quote from: davis196 on March 21, 2023, 11:45:02 AMMore than 90% of the people in the USA would most likely never buy/adopt Bitcoin.I doubt that, How can you tell?

Therefore, all public talking heads will convince the general public to the last that everything is fine (three days before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, its shares were in the status of recommended for purchase).Another interesting feature of the current banking crisis in the US (unlike Europe and the previous crisis in 2008) is that the management of troubled banks, in principle, did not commit blunders or adventurous machinations.
