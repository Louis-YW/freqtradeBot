Checking it on ethplorer.io and etherscan.io is enough since the price of the token is already registered there.  And if ever, it is better to check the price on exchanges or platform that is trading.  It is way more precise, IMO.",

Also in the settings there are options with decimal additions, as you have already been told here. Now I don’t remember exactly how this is done, but there you can throw off all the settings and history, as well as delete the wallet and download again, that is, there are several options. Just be careful with the settings and check everything before clicking anywhere.",

But never have BNB gas in your wallet, okay. So leave the wallet empty with no gas costs.Usually fake tokens will ask for a BNB fee that is greater than the original price of the token.

If the network is based on Ethereum, he needs to have many ETH balances on his account as the fees. But if the network is based on BSC, maybe the fee is not too high. Maybe you can try to lower the withdrawal amount and see if that is a success or failure.By the way, you can check the price of NGC here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/naga/",
