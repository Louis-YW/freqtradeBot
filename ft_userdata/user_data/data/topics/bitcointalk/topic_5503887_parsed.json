  "content": "Bitcoinâ€™s volatility is extremely lowIt makes sense if Bitcoin price and its volatility become smaller and smaller with later cycles that bind with bigger market cap. The chart from ecoinometrics shocks me that in the first cycle, the volatility of three-month range is narrower than the second and third halvings. It's worth to note that it's three-month range, not one-month range and in the first cycle, there are months with high volatility too.The article emphasizes that each cycle includes past cycles and current one, there are three-month periods with low volatility, lower than other periods.In general, Bitcoin gives too good ROIs with past cycles.Bitcoin price history, ATHs and bottoms.Cryptorank.io has Bitcoin monthly ROI that can help us to see some three-months with low volatility.Your Bitcoin investment must be longer than 3-months, much longer than that!",
