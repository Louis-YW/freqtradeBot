Social media participation, and the crypto market, or blockchain technology, is probably also a big concern for large corporations, but I find it easier when they wait for the legal issue to clear up, and then Another self will be a coverage of this field in life.",

Besides that, I don't think social media platforms like tiktok, facebook and instagram provide any major utility.So what's the worth of a coin whose platform doesn't have any utility.",

The development and adoption of cryptocurrencies on social media platforms could change the dynamics of how we interact, transact, and transact within these networks. If other social networks follow suit and develop their own cryptocurrencies, that could lead to increased competition and innovation in the industry. Each platform's cryptocurrencies can offer unique features and benefits, catering to different user needs and preferences.",

But it will be centralized, as they will have full control about it. I don't think they would want to create a decentralized coin for their app.Just remember, basically anyone can create their own alt, how much more of these social media apps with large followers?It would be easy for them to implement it within their app as they already have followers using it.The FB diem failed because of regulatory issues as well as internal conflict, but I believe FB won't stop thinking of creating their own coin in the future.",

Well, though we can't assume it never works, however, I think there is no point in creating another altcoin as we already have plenty of it, why not use those coins that already existed instead? I think it was better to just focus on a few coins rather than having a lot of it which sustainability is even missing. In fact, FB does and it fails in end, it should be no more attempt to happen next as it fails again. If they will create, we can do nothing but they must think wisely before they wasted their time doing that.",
