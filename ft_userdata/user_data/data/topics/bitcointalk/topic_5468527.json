This involves establishing betting restrictions, offering support to those who think they have a gambling problem, and participating in self-exclusion programmes.Your post is just like a conclusion and does not worth it at all. Just take note that the government do not care. It is you that will go for the option of self exclusion, not the government that will do that for you. And the best way you can help yourself is to discipline yourself.If you go to Africa, Asia, South America and many other countries, you will see that gambling is more regulated in a way that tax are collected to the government, also in other countries, but some countries still regulate gambling more than the way some other countries do.",

For me the best recourse is to really stop dead. Which means its going to be very hard in the beginning, but at least you don't to go to this kind of support or any other programs in my opinion.Really up to the individual to really push himself if his goal is to quit. Of course, you can ask for self-inclusions or get the support from the government like undergoing rehab and stuff like that. The important thing is to regain control of yourself. Get your self a hobby or continue what you are doing before you become a addict and talk to your family.",

The complex relationship between governments and gambling... Ever notice how most governments seem to have a love-hate relationship with gambling? On one hand, they're all about those tax dollars rolling in from casinos and lotteries. But when it comes to helping folks with gambling issues, it's like they're suddenly MIA. I mean, they're not exactly losing sleep over folks with gambling problems. Â It's more about their own financial interests.",

Otherwise, it will just be a cycle of getting back and relapses and so gamblers starting to gamble again as they are just forced into this programmes.",

We all know that governments and several other organisations work to encourage responsible gambling. But what is the point you are trying to prove?There are several helpline available to council the problematic gambling behaviour. Medical help through psychiatrists are also available at free of cost in many countries. But does it really help to reduce the problematic gambling behaviour?",

And the best way you can help yourself is to discipline yourself.Everybody is accountable for the decisions they make in life. It is our responsibility to gamble moderately since we will suffer the consequences alone. But some governments mainly in developed nations really care about the health of their citizens. The UK gambling commission offers free self-seclusion and other services to people suffering from disorder. Some nations are making policies to reduce gambling addiction regardless of the financial implications. The proposed law that will ban the use of credit or debit cards for crypto gambling in Australia will reduce the income revenue of gambling firms. And the government tax revenue will decline with this recent development. Â However the government of that nation is not considering the negative financial implications of this restriction Â because they care about the well-being of citizens.",

The discussion goes like this: gambling is often considered a big problem when, in fact, it's not. In reality, the gambling industry, which makes billions of dollars yearly, contributes to the government in terms of taxes. So, the government cannot be too serious about educating people, especially on the negative side, as it could discourage them from gambling.There's no logic in that; why would they discourage people when they are benefiting from the tax remittance of casinos?Simply putting \"be responsible when gambling\" is enough to remind gamblers to gamble responsibly.",

They do this by placing restrictions on deposits, placing limits and sometimes outright ban of some gambling companies. Unlike the Australian government, there is no restriction or interference whatsoever,Â  even though we have a government agency that supposedly regulates gambling.

People can play game for fun without comiiting money, unlike gambling, you must commit your funds unless you are given free bets.",

So from now on, we must be able to be responsible for the money we use for gambling. Moreover, we have seen the impact that other gamblers receive when they use a lot of money without any self-control. We can experience more losses, which can be very painful to accept. If we don't have responsibility and self-control, we will just be like them, and in the end, gambling addiction will come to us without realizing it. By applying self-control, we have tried to prevent all the bad things that might happen so that we don't need to worry because we can handle them well. We can gamble calmly without any desire to chase a win.A government that can do this will win the hearts of its people because the people can see that there is real action from the government to help overcome the problems that have existed for a long time. Perhaps the people will help with the program so that it can reduce the number of gambling addictions in the country. If it can be carried out more seriously, perhaps the country can really reduce the number of gambling addictions, and perhaps it will also become a model country for other countries with gambling addiction problems. In the future, there may be mutually beneficial cooperation between countries. What a beautiful dream",

I think everyone needs to know the limits of gambling, how much money to use for gambling and the risks of gambling, all of these things are important so that gamblers know their financial condition and are ready to accept the worst consequences (losing the game). If all of this can be accepted with common sense then it is likely that they will be ready to take responsibility for their gambling. We need to be wise in using our money and dividing it for living needs, savings, and for fun (gambling). Looking at the risks of gambling, if we fail to manage our finances then we could go bankrupt and have a lot of debt. That is something bad and no one wants to have a future like that. So when gambling we must understand the responsibility of gambling",
