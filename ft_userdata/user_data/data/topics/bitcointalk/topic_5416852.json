  "content": "Google will accept cryptocurrency payments for cloud services through Coinbase.According to CBNC, Google will begin taking crypto payments from select clients for its cloud services in early 2023, a rumour that sent Coinbase shares up 5% on Tuesday.In reaction to this agreement, Coinbase Commerce will migrate \"data-related apps\" from Amazon Web Services cloud to Google cloud.According to the report, the terms of the agreement have not been disclosed, but Jim Migdal, Vice President of business development at Coinbase, stated that the agreement will be similar to other Coinbase Commerce arrangements in that Armstrong Coinbase will earn a cut for every transaction that goes through the system.Coinbase Commerce now accepts 10 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether's USDT, and Dogecoin.CBNC also stated that it is unclear whether Google would continue to use Coinbase for payment processing due to competition from a recently crypto-integrated PayPal business solution.Source: https://mycryptoparadise.com/google-to-use-coinbase-to-accept-crypto-payments-for-cloud-services/",

I wouldn’t get too excited about this though because it isn’t for all services. It’s only for a select group of people.Obviously this is good news, it won’t do too much for the price though just yet.",
