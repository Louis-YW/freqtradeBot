If I remember correctly, Pi has been in development for more than 5 years and until now it has not been traded on any exchange, not even a junk exchange. It's worse than meme coin because meme has trading volume, and for Pi, it's nothing but the illusion of pi fans. It can't even compare to meme, never compare it to bitcoin, there is no such thing as a free lunch, be careful with Pi or you will regret it.",

Much better to avoid this kind of tactic since you are just making them rich and mining on the app is not really happening, you are just getting an airdrop.",

Do you know how many tokens/coins that have been rumoured to overtake Bitcoin? If I get to collect a dollar each time that claim is made, I would've been in substantial wealth by now. Well, for your information Pi is not a reality (that's putting it mildly, anyway) and it's likely it would end that way after stressing people and giving them false hope. There were others like TBC and BTCs which were rumoured to be the next BTC. They disappeared overnight ðŸ˜†",

If you understand this, you will understand that Pi network will never succeed.IfÂ  by any chance Pi network gets listed in exchanges, the owner will simply sell of their holdings at the first go and leave the market.
