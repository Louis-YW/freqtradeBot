The time where anyone could create a crypto casino and had a chance to compete is over.

Most of the crypto casinos have the same platform design / game offering as stake which means trying to compete with them with bonuses isn't realistic.Now, from my business understanding, in order to go after the dominant players in any industry and create a successful business, you need to do either something that they don't (ex: a unique exciting slot game that no one else has), or acquire customers through a channel that is overlooked by others (ex: Stake flooded Twitch when the other didn't look at it) or go after a dissatisfied customer base ...I've come across multiple posts where the original bitcoin gamblers regretted the fact that none of the crypto casinos are anonymous like they all used to be, almost all of them requiring KYC at some point of the customer journey. I think this is an opportunity to build something :A real decentralised crypto casino platform - 100% anonymous.Same principle as a decentralised exchange like Uniswap, all you need to get started is a non-custodial wallet with funds. No KYC.Being fully decentralised and using exclusively crypto means we're operating within a grey area in the eyes of the law and therefore \"no need\" for a license.I believe that in order to gain trust, using only provably fair games would be a great idea in order to show that it isn’t rigged.It's just an idea so far but I think getting feedback from real players is the first step to validate my assumption !",

That is why centralized gambling sites are the commonest. There are web3 casinos today but still the centralized ones are just the most common.People that have no option but gambling restricted in their country may go for this, and people that like web3 (altcoins). But they should know that it is not decentralized against vulnerabilities and it is a good means someone can reveal his noncustodial seed phrase or private key to the site it is connecting too. Many scammers are using this to scam these days.",

Even with all those \"big\" and well-established gambling platforms around, new ones pop up all the time. Just take a look at this gambling section; in the last year alone, over 900 new topics have been posted. It's true that not all of these announcements about new gambling sites, but a significant portion of them are. Some of these new projects do well, others not so much. And then there are those that appear for a moment and disappear just as swiftly, leaving us wondering what happened.Quote from: itchiba on August 17, 2023, 06:57:53 PMNow, from my business understanding, in order to go after the dominant players in any industry and create a successful business, you need to do either something that they don't (ex: a unique exciting slot game that no one else has), or acquire customers through a channel that is overlooked by others (ex: Stake flooded Twitch when the other didn't look at it) or go after a dissatisfied customer base ...I've come across multiple posts where the original bitcoin gamblers regretted the fact that none of the crypto casinos are anonymous like they all used to be, almost all of them requiring KYC at some point of the customer journey.

However, I'm sure there have been some similar tries already. To dig deeper, though, you'd have to head over to the Altcoins section. Those puppies don't really fit into the Bitcoin gambling realm.",

Aside from that decentralized casino is expensive.  Assuming it works like Uniswap, it only means that every bet a player makes is charged with transaction fee that is non-existent on centralized casino.  So the player have to pay for processing fee(if the bet won), bet, and transaction fee.I also think that it is better to have a centralized casino with higher threshold to trigger KYC requirement.",

I also agree that in this time a new casino should think something differently to gain more users on their site. Like you said that Stake used Twitch marketing to grab most of its customers and other casinos also need to finds something like Twitch which would help them to grow faster. However, I still must say that the traditional way of marketing is also working for most of the casinos and if the marketing is done in a good way then for sure.There are some good casinos which are working on decentralized model, but still I haven't found a casino that offer 100% anonymity to its users. I like your idea of creating a casino like that because most gamblers want to have something like that which would never ask them for KYC details. There are some good decentralized exchanges but so far there aren't any good decentralized casinos. As far as I know that almost all casinos will need to have a license if they are hosting their services in a country. I don't think that any country would allow such casino to exist which has a model that makes it license free. If a casino has to work in a country then that casino has get some license in that country. The license also has its terms a conditions which a casino has to follow. Most of the countries would never care about a casino even it doesn't have a license, but when a casino gets a lot of users then in that case the license is a necessary thing to have. I know a casino that works of provably fair model, and the name of that casino is L0tt0.com. The L0tt0.com offers games that work on the model of provably fair and the developer as well as the owner of the casino is doing his best to make those games work on that model. I would also recommend to go with that model as players will get ultimate satisfaction with such model. I must say that you should get idea first and then start working on them slowly and when you have some good games then you should make your casino live.",

What we also see with Bitcoin is that you need a network of many independent systems that give it an underlying stability, these third parties expect to get paid for using their resources, so there would need to be at a minimum a rake to cover the fees and that has to be finely balanced along with being competitive against current casinos. You're are as likely to launch a decentralized casino software as you are a new casino - either will take a lot of start up capital, or alternatively a long time to build the marketing up for it.",

It usually doesn't last long, and as you've said it operates in a \"grey area\" so it's highly unlikely for it to be trusted early on, it'd probably take years before it builds up a proper reputation. Honestly, KYC isn't bad (imo, don't burn me), the process that casinos ask for KYC is bad, dumb, and slow, and suddenly halts the user, freezing their funds without no rhyme or reason. Ofc if a casino can grow and build itself without KYC then sure, I'd go for it, but if it can't, the least it can do is provide quality service when it actually uses it.",

The time where anyone could create a crypto casino and had a chance to compete is over. There are now very large companies like stake who have a dominant enough position to attract players with their affiliate deals, celebrity endorsements, welcome / retention bonuses and so on .. Most of the crypto casinos have the same platform design / game offering as stake which means trying to compete with them with bonuses isn't realistic.The crypto casino market is a broad market and the chance for you to create a new casino is not over and you don't need to compete with the industry leading casino to dominate the market.  Besides that is not what most crypto gamblers focus on. What they focus on is the fairness of the casino,  good customer support,  fast withdrawal and license but in another situation some gamblers don't get about licenses.  If you can do all this with the inclusion of a good marketing campaign for the long term on this forum,  the casino will also be among the industry leading casinos. If you need help with the marketing campaign contact me and let's talk about it.",

      "body": "Quote from: itchiba on August 17, 2023, 06:57:53 PMI've come across multiple posts where the original bitcoin gamblers regretted the fact that none of the crypto casinos are anonymous like they all used to be, almost all of them requiring KYC at some point of the customer journey. Some didn't like KYC but it's not a problem. People can still play with tiny amounts of money if they are not willing to fulfill KYC requirement. Quote from: itchiba on August 17, 2023, 06:57:53 PMI think this is an opportunity to build something :A real decentralised crypto casino platform - 100% anonymous.Same principle as a decentralised exchange like Uniswap, all you need to get started is a non-custodial wallet with funds. No KYC.There have been so many web3 casino. I can tell you one like moonbet. Quote from: itchiba on August 17, 2023, 06:57:53 PMBeing fully decentralised and using exclusively crypto means we're operating within a grey area in the eyes of the law and therefore \"no need\" for a license.I believe that in order to gain trust, using only provably fair games would be a great idea in order to show that it isn’t rigged.You just need to wait the regulator will come to ruin your business as it can be seized by them due to the money laundering purpose. Did you think you can stay away from the regulator by operated your platform in the gray area? I would prefer to play in the licensed platform. There have been so many casino based on web 3 but people didn't prefer to use it.",

      "body": "Well, I also have had and still have dreams of building and managing a crypto casino some day when I become financially capable enough, and several times, I've thought about a decentralized casino since there are several big and well doing centralized casinos already, and competing with them is too advisable, but then again, with what I have seen around as a gambler, I've come to the conclusion that building a decentralized casino is not feasible at this time, though several gamblers complain about lack of anonymity in gambling this days, but I can tell you all that, gamblers interest in decentralized casinos are currently zero at the moment, this is from my experience on this forum, I've been here for a while and I've seen decentralized casinos, several of them get introduced on this forum, but in a couple of weeks, their Ann will be no where to be found due to lack of patronage/users..So @op, if you are serious about building your own casino, then look away from building a decentralized casino at the moment, doing this will be a great mistake, build a centralized casino and install unique and useful features that will attract customers instead.Just my opinion though.",

      "body": "You're right OP but going into the competition and do something that the popular casinos haven't done before is going to take you miles. Honestly, even if you've got a good idea but if you don't have the funding. You'll still struggle. And from that perspective of going with the projects into decentralization and anonymity. You'll just be flagged down by the government, many projects did that before but to no avail. I say that you've got a good understanding of what's happening and has a good idea based from that.But, you've missed a lot of it that had happened in actuality before and most of them never succeed.",
