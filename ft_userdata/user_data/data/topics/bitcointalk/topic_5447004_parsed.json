  "content": "Do you know any local gambling games in your country that crypto casino doesn’t offer until now?In our country, We have a lot of local gambling games that being offered by our local online casino but I still didn’t see in any crypto casino available here. I made the list below on our local gambling games that I want to be added by crypto casino.Color gameQuote from:  http://tamaraw8.blogspot.com/2014/09/tamaroid-color-game-pinoy-peryahan.htmlIt is a \"Gamble/Parlor\" Game  Seen in the Philippines mostly during \"Fiesta\" and Christmas Seasons on late 80's and 90's, as of now Some Towns and local Barangays in Provinces are still allowing this type of game (together with BINGO Games, \"ROLETA\", etc. ) only during Fiesta and NO MINORs are allowed to bet.The mechanics is simple, You just need to choose a Color to bet among six (6) Colors, and you or the operator must pull  a String or manually pull-up a lever to release the Multi-colored wooden Blocks/Dices. The Color on  the top of the (3) \"rolled\" wooden blocks/Dices are the winning colors.Tong-itsQuote from:  https://www.coololdgames.com/card-games/rummy/tong-its/Tong-its is played using the standard Anglo-American pattern 52-card deck. Unlike many Rummy variations, Tong-its does not make use of the Jokers sometimes available.Tong-its is exclusively a three-player game, something which makes it unique among the Rummy-family. The odd number of Players, as well as the inability to add or subtract Players from the game, makes for an interesting deal as well. This short tutorial will explain the basic concepts of the game.Pusoy Way & Pusoy DosThis game is like poker in terms of card combination hierarchy it just vary on the way cards being played. You can read full mechanics on this blog https://www.pinoygame.net/news/detail/18/Pusoy-Pinoy-How-to-play.htmlLucky 9A card game that same mechanics with Baccarat. It just played like Blackjack which player can have multiple seat and has the capability to hit or stand. This gives the freedom for players to play for there own decision unlike Baccarat that you are just choosing side.You can share your own game below. Just make sure that it’s a GAMBLING GAME. Post the brief mechanics and add reference for the full description of the game.",

It's more complicated rather than using a provider, with provider they just can easily pay and set up to their site.Also, they not really need a big marketing for the game. Why ? because If we using \"Evo\" provider all of user evo are already familiar and could be playing in the site.",

I recently play some of this game such as color game and tong-its on bingo plus casino when I browse recently on Gcash games. It’s just amazing how this game turn into real gambling by online platform while I just play this on tongits go app that doesn’t use real money. I’m surprised on this new game added on Bingo plus and I will not aware of this Bingo plus if this casino doesn’t add on gcash apps.Quote from: ryzaadit on March 31, 2023, 01:43:23 PMThe reason are simple.Most of online-casino it's using a provider, so they no need to make the game or provided the game by them self.

This game is a local game from India and it’s just added last year https://www.evolution.com/news/evolution-launches-super-andar-bahar-indian-classic-with-added-massive-multipliers/. This gives me an idea that game provider is starting to add local games if there’s a demand on it. The game I mention above is very popular in our country that being played in daily basis.It will be nice discussing potential local games that will be newly added by game provider to introduce globally.",

This type of game is indeed well known by local gamblers but not for international gamblers, that is, those who often use online casinos, both fiat and crypto.And if there is interest from the developers in trying to apply the local gambling game to online, fiat and crypto casinos, they will launch the local gambling game and add it to the list of casino games. And for the time being, you can still visit the local casino to play the gambling game but I don't know if they accept crypto or only fiat for betting.",

Of course, international casinos would prioritize well-known games over local or traditional gambling games because famous games could easily attract players.",

Your list is indeed true but to categorize it; these gambling games are simply street based gambling games. These are basically gambling games which are more accessible with convenience to players wherein a deck of card can generate mutiple betting games. But to add, spider betting game and other animal betting games.Others are coin toss and other probability gambling games. There's more for sure including betting agreements on a particular concern such as number of this and that. This simply implies that gambling industry is far from what most of us know. There are many betting games which could generate profit. Any thing wherein contrary would be the bottomline as long as the contrary sides are okay with the long end growth and we just cannot so something about it.",

Well, different strokes for different folks, but that's just bird-on-bird action. Pun is fully loaded! Look, I ain't judging. Everyone's got their peculiar brand of fun, no matter how bizarre or off-the-wall it appears. Heck, perhaps there's a clandestine rooster-rumble society lurking beneath the surface! As for sack hopping, I grasp your amusement. It's like a time machine back to kiddie days, goofin' around with pals. Picture this: a casino packed with grown-ups bouncing in sacks? Comedy gold!",

All this games are gonna get really wierd if they're introduced In a digital screen.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

In any case the reason why these games, much I like to see them coz hey, I love me some chinese poker too every now and then, is the fact that these games only appear to a certain group of people and do not cater towards everyone. When you create a game in a casino setting, you have to be able to cater to a wider range of people that transcends against age, race, and location. These games are so ingrained in the Philippine psyche and society they pretty much owned these games too and would incite some reaction, good or not, if they were to see it being played in the casino.",
