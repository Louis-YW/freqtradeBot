The market itself is unpredictable; even TAs are just for guidance only and won't mean certainty with the market price behavior.Quote from: Zilon on January 06, 2023, 09:46:57 PMThe worst state of any investor is to be at long term loss. It comes with so much anxiety, anger, Fuddity, pressure, spoiled plans and many more ill happenings. Since you've engaged to long term invest, that should be normal because that is the 'gamble' to long term holding. If this is the case, I think (if I'm wrong please correct me) investor id at fault if he would suffer from lomg term loss. In the first place, not because it is long term, you won't take precautionary actions to either cut or endure the loss. You still need to measure if there are possibilities of recovery or not; whether to move from one to another token.",

Assuming bitcoin was at $50000 and you bought $250 worth of it. When it decreased to $30000, you bought $250 of it. When it got to $20000, you bought another $250. When it got to $16500 and stayed for long, you bought $250 of it. The average buying when you will start making profit would be $23300 while the price you bought in average would further decrease to favour you as you buy more at lower price.Do not just buy bitcoin at once, have a plan like averaging.",

Because if the money that are you investing are just for investing itself then why would you sell at a lost? So yeah, just invest some errand money or just extra in your pocket and look for the long term returns.",

Some investors see red candles as selling opportunity when what they should be doing is observing as you said to see if the market will give them a very good discount with price drop of the market. As an investor your target should be that when it's about time you exit the market, you can do so comfortably without caring about the state of the market (don't care if it's a green or red candle) because you are in profit no matter the situation of the market, that should be your goals as an investor and not investing short term.",

They don't know that there will be a decline in the price of bitcoin and most of them start investing in bitcoin when the price reaches a peak. And when the bitcoin price slowly decreased, they panicked because they never imagined that the bitcoin price would fall and even experience a drastic decline.But if they know that investing has risks, they will try to minimize the level of risk by adjusting the amount of money to invest. This will save them from losing a lot, and they can also buy more bitcoins when the price is low. And the red candle is nothing to be afraid of but is where our opportunity to buy more bitcoins is.",
