Sybil resistance is achived by Turing test that is being done simultaneous for whole network once each epoch.Very uniqe project with super low marketcap (~~1 M $). So it can even go 1000x. But DYOR. Its much more possible it will go to 0 but risk/reward is worth the try. At least its worth the research.",

Don't forget to do your homework before investing.",

I think the there are other projects that potentially to did 30x just like MVX and that's having same idea like GMX. these days there are so many problems happened with cex. The decentralized futures trade will become a good solution. Invested at $1 and it goes to the $4, MVX potentially to go to the same like GMX which was traded around $30. The market cap is so small at this moment. Do your own research",
