In fact, they are not the only ones that are doing this, I believe most centralized exchanges can actually do this and not only they can freeze your account but the entire accounts of the users currently at the exchanges and they are powerless to even withdraw their cryptocurrencies if ever that's gonna happen. I experienced this kind of freeze back when Okex had some problems regarding some small things that caused their entire exchange to be unable to withdraw.",

So if this stable coin of Paypal is made, you don't expect it to be decentralized. In the past, Tether could even freeze your funds if you've done something wrong and it's reported to them, that your USDTs are likely to be frozen by them.(https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-tether-freezes-over-65m-in-assets-transferred-from-multichain) Your account alone there also can be subjected to freezing if they find you did something wrong too.",

Remember \"Not your keys, not your coins.\" Let's not forget that, please. Whatever coins we hold, let's look for a wallet that supports it first because that's the only security we can have from all these scams that are happening left and right. Without that, we are prone to anything. The worst case scenario that I am imagining is your asset suddenly gone in Paypal or any exchange and they can still prove that you don't really have anything in their wallet. That will be fucked up because we cannot fight a battle against big companies like that.",

I don't get it. Most likely that's mostly because it's easier legally for them instead of other cryptos, and they probably save mountains of money in just transaction fees compared to banks. This is a good thing but this was never going to be a fully permissionless token, otherwise they could have just used other crypto assets.",

They are a completely centralized payment processor and aren't much different than a bank, can you expect a bank to create a cryptocurrency of its own and don't make it centralized and have no control over the funds of their users? That is not going to happen, and PayPal is no different, they can't create a cryptocurrency and let their users own it without them being able to do anything about the holdings of their users.Those who were planning to use their cryptocurrency thinking that they would have complete privacy and safety when using it should recheck the facts and possibly change their decisions while they still can, but I believe those who use their services won't really care about this since it's nothing different than how they operate with fiat.",

Im seeing the blocking feature is a common feature that being implemented by mostly of stable token providers to minize the impact once something bad like hacked case was happening. It's all not bad. There will always be positive and negative sides. That depends on which side you take it as your consideration before using that stable token. This kind of feature is really helpful when it comes to the hacked case, like helping to freeze the money stolen by scammer or hackers. If you were seeing it as an unacceptable thing and you shall stick to the DAI stable token. Im still trusting the centralized stable token caused by the block feature can also be considered as security from the stable token itself. This feature is helping a lot in the various case like blocking millions till hundred millions stable token stolen by exchange site when it's hacked by hacker. I take it really positive feature even though mostly of decentralized supporters hated it. Paypal was even more stricter when you are using their platform.  Blocking and limiting people's account has become their everyday task.",
