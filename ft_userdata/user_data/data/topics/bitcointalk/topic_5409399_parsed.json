  "content": "Hello everyone,I wanted to replace my original fans on my S19 Pro 110T and unfortunately what I ordered are not compatible with Braiins OS+.They work in manual at 100%, but in automatic does not work, no return to the PMW level. As a result, the mining does not start and the register indicates no fans connected.Do you have any models to recommend that work perfectly with Braiins OS+ in automatic ?ThanksMickael",

      "body": "Use the same model that you use before or you can replace it with this model: QFR1212GHE Delta this one is the compatible one. Or you can try to check the wires it has 4 wires Black, Red, Yellow and Blue.Legends:black = groundred = + 12Vyellow = PWN or Signal Speedblue = PWMCheck the Blue wire since you said there is no return signal in PWM if this one doesn't have a connection the fan will always run at full speed so focus on that part the wire may not be connected or resoldered properly try to resolder or replace the blue wire and make sure it is connected in the right position to the control board when replugging.",

      "body": "Some fans are not detected but work fine and even accept pwm throttling, in that case all you need to do is enable immersion mode and restart bosminer. As suggested, factory fan models are recommended as those are what the team tests against. Some after market fans exhibit strange behavior, like not being detected or spin to full when told to do 1%.",

It will run automatically at full speed without fan check which is already mention above.",

(With Temperature control Auto or Manual).This is actually just setting the minimum number of required fans to hash to 0, and was simply a cosmetic UI change. Older versions of the firmware had the actual 0 in the miner UI. Regardless, it does the exact same thing.",
