They have won more titles than any other team in this league. They too have a good defensive record and I think in soccer defense plays an important role. What you wrote is correct Galatasaray won by 8 points, that according to me is a good margin. They would have to play in the qualification round of the Championship league and as per analysis I feel they would qualify.",

Beşiktaş will play with the same squad in the next season. However, Enner Valencia, who scored 32 goals in Fenerbahçe last season, left the team. In addition, the press is talking about the possibility of Arda Güler being transferred to another team. Of course, Fenerbahçe will have the same championship chance as Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, but they will have many shortcomings. They don't even have a coach yet. Jesus left the team. It is not clear which tactic the team will play next season. I think Fenerbahçe will start the season with a disadvantage.",

Galatasaray also seems like they will lose their striker, Mauro Icardi whose loan status will end this month, and maybe he will return to PSG because at this time I've not found any new information about that man.",

Due to the earthquake, football remained in the background for a long time in our country and it was not very enjoyable. On top of that, the decisions taken by the federation lowered the motivation of many people.I hope we have a more enjoyable year next season. I hope it will be a high quality football season.It is always good to have a high number of Anatolian teams in the league. I wish success to the Çaykur Rizespor and Samsunspor included in our league, they will add color to the league",

Fenerbahce should have gone to the new season with a change of chairman and revision but this is a situation that will not happen. Unsuccessful people love their seats in Turkey. The fact that Fenerbahce could not be a champion for a long time seems to have upset the balance of the team. Therefore they do not stop making different wrong decisions every year. I believe that Galatarasay will start the new season stronger with the reinforcements they will make to their squad and they will get the Champions League ticket.",

This man was born on March 17, 1986. He will turn 38 before the end of next season. When his contract with Fenerbahçe expires, he will be 39 years old... and yes, they have hope in this man. If he gets injured, his football life will almost end. Is this guy transferable? Yes, could be beneficial. But not for that much money and as a savior. But the president is trying to show him off as the transfer of the year. The man is a striker who played in the CL final. I don't see it as good or bad. But he is obviously a winner, they got a star striker even though old. Fenerbahce's biggest shortcoming in recent years is definitely the lack of winner mentality players.",

I think this year will be just another year Turkish teams will be suffering under current financial situation. They may be able to build mediocre squads. Teams like Trabzonspor which was very unsuccessful will definitely have issues. Some things are good tho. League is enjoyable to watch in my opinion.",

We will probably transfer another striker to replace Icardi. But we will protect the player squad to a great extent. Goalkeeper Muslera is getting old now. We need to transfer a good goalkeeper who can wait behind him. On defense, Nelsson and Abdulkerim are a good duo. Nelsson is under the watchful eye of European teams. If he is not sold in the summer transfer window, we will not have any problems in defense next season. Mertens, Torreira and Kerem in the midfield are enough for the Turkish league. I hope Zaniolo will fit in well or we will make a good striker transfer just like we did with Icardi. As a Galatasaray fan, my candidate for the championship in the new season is Galatasaray.",

When it comes to this topic I can also say that there is a huge difference between these two presidents. Because Ali Koç won his first title in his career here which has been just taken in the Turkish Cup. But in Aziz Yıldırım's time Fenerbahçe won 11 titles in total and 6 of them were Super League titles. This is a really impressive success compared to these days.Besides I have read on a Turkish news source that Aziz Yıldırım is ready to be a candidate if there is nobody else.",

Last season is over already and the new season is yet to kick off. So I think Fenerbahce can still learn from last season and make next season a memorable one for the club's fans",

Due to the great disaster in our country in the last weeks of the season, the league stopped and we tried to heal the wounds as a whole country, and the decisions taken by the federation were not quite right. It is very important for Galatasaray to make a few important transfers this season, as a result, it is necessary to take a few names to the team after the championship. If a middle ground is found for Icardi, he proved a more than enough striker last season, if he can stay in the team, I'm sure we will see better this season.
