Of course if you have the knowledge in trading you could lessen that risk by studying and attaining some knowledge. That 100$ could get 1000$ if you are consisted into trading, cause in gambling we might say that if you are skilled and experienced you could also increase the chances of winning, but personally I think that gambling is really based on luck, whatever call you decided even if you think it twice it unlike in trading, where having a right call would get you profits.",

But users who are investing in BTC eventually will know how to trade since buying and selling is where an investor will make a profit. For them to play in the casino, it's all on them. Obviously, some of us only learn to gamble when we arrive at the forum and see there are links to casinos on every page of the forum.",

Did you ask about something like that what should you choose  between   gambling or Bitcoin ?If the question is actually like this,  then I will say  there is something wrong on your question. Because trading and gambling are not the same thing. But trading can be also a kind of gambling when one person  jump into trading without any knowledge,  like as fundamental knowledge,  technical knowledge. And gambling should never be a source of  earning,  it should be used for only entertainment purpose,  otherwise it can take you to the street. So the decision is yours,  what should for what need you to take.",

But remember one thing there is no end to know there is no age to learn. It's great to hear every time you've earned $10 with $100 of Bitcoin. But whenever you lose an 11 dollar bet, it hurts me a lot. I blame you why you went to gambling platform because you have no patience. Here I want to say not only gambling platform but trading platform is not suitable for you because patience does not work in you. No matter what you do in life, patience is essential. But I want you to leave the gambling platform. If you have experience in trading then you can earn from trading platform with small trades. You can definitely succeed in this. But always remember that under no circumstances can you be greedy. Whenever greed is at work in you, you will fail in any field.",

Gambling will depend less on your skill and luck needs to be helpful in gambling. Suppose you bet on a football match or a cricket match and according to your prediction you bet on the team which is strong in the ledger but on the day of the match it turns out that the favorite team made a big mistake and the underdog team won. Then you lose your money by gambling so I think it is better not to get involved in gambling in the beginning. First you should spend time in trading and investing, earn some money from trading and investing then you can gamble with that money.",

And you suggested not to become addicted to anything, but at the same time, you said to make more trades in BTC than gambling to make profits like for Shine Future. I am not trying to fill this post with words using your own words <-- for those who will start to criticize me please check my Profile first. I can not agree more with you, because, BTC trading is totally based on analysis and it is not that by doing the analysis you are going to make 100% profit. Because the BTC market is so volatile and full of surprises. So, be active and educated for a bright future. And yes avoid gambling at all costs because there is no analysis in that. Gamblers will not agree with me but I am ok with that.",

I mean really! can you stop yourself? No, it will be hard for you to stop yourself once you start to do things that society finds immoral and the people around you, about which you used to say what others will say. If those people will give you permission to do that immoral work.Then you will not hesitate to do so, because you know that, they are the ones who will talk bad about me but if they are giving me the chance then why would they talk bad about me, and why would I care? The best practice is to avoid gambling at all costs because once a person starts to gamble even for fun purposes then once he makes huge profits then he will not stop himself to in a casino or a place where he can gamble. Besides, a person should really not get addicted to anything either, whether it's alcohol, gambling, trading in BTC, etc.",

You claimed that you made $10 from trading bitcoins and lost $11 through gambling, proving clearly that trading bitcoins is better than gambling. However, if you learn how to do all of them, you will profit from both of them if you are not greedy. You should pick the one you like because both are profitable and you can lose money from both because you are aware that they all have risks.",

Crypto trading is the best for those of us who are well familiar with Bitcoin. It doesn't matter if gambling is good or bad, but a major percentage of people have been losing to gambling. In trading, there is a good chance to make money if you can learn. Though any investment in crypto is risky too, you aren't going to lose everything. Like the Bitcoin price drop, you will still hold whatever you have. A value drop doesn't mean you lost your holding. The value would recover anytime for Bitcoin.

It's not logical to book profit at 10% by taking huge risks. Gambling is fun and can be addictive, but it requires luck and a bit of trickery. But if you are good at it, you can make more money by investing in bitcoin. Both are risky, but I will prefer bitcoin over gambling because I don't need to rely on luck to get my money back. I know it will be back eventually if I can manage to hold on for a few years.",

In your case, it was pretty clear that gambling never gives you good results but instead losses while trading seems to play well. You know what suits you and trading seems to be chosen and cutting your gambling addiction for this won't give you a better life but disaster. But, as you mention about \"impatience\", I'm afraid this would create a problem in your trading career because I will tell you OP that this is very important in trading.",

Bitcoin trading is not the same as gambling, trading is a skill that’s developed with time and expertise. Any dummy can try his luck gambling and still make some winnings if Lady Luck smiles on him. Gambling is a risky venture and should not be considered as a means of livelihood. The odds are not in favour when you gamble in most casinos, the game is programmed to ensure the house always wins.
