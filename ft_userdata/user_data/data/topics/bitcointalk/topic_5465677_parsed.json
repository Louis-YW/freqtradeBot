But apart from these 3 bets and a couple of Dice games, I didn't do anything illegal.Like NotATether have said, from the message in the email screenshot you posted, Stake thinks you are multi-accounting, Multi-accounting simply means operating multiple account on the same casino, this is something a lot of casinos take very seriously and what ever be the reason for this, i do not know exactly. But now, I think the big question is, how or what exactly did you do that made the multi accounts system flag your account, something I think that could possibly cause such an issue is if you are using a free VPN to access your account, if you did this, then be rest assure this is what triggered the system to flag your account as free VPN often makes use of IP address that is also assigned to several other people, that is a shared IP address..Now, the deed is already done, there is nothing you can do now other than to try as much as possible to pass the KYC verification which they already requested, passing the KYC is not so hard if you already have the requested documents.Goodluck with this mate.",

And, if I may propose a possibility why they require you to submit SoW, it most likely because you deposited at 9.32 P.M. and immediately withdraw one hour later at 10.33 P.M. after one bet, it might trigger their AML/ATF policy.  A document of SoW can probably be annoying, but as everything is done in honest and good intention, I am sure this problem can be solved quickly.",
