If his only choice is to bet on these gambling games, due to recovering to his illness, I would probably choose partnering with him. I personally hate getting and giving loans to others. If I partner with him, I would probably learn his techniques along the way and the each bet he will be made will be a mutual decision. One rule I will deploy before partnering with him is each bet he place needs a justification or explanation why he place that bet on a team or horse. I need to be convince to support him for me to know that he is not doing blind bets because of being pressured of getting back to his own feet.",

No matter how good your friend may be when it comes to horse racing, at the end of the day, the results are not absolute. In fact, the chances of a person winning a definite outcome cannot apply to gambling due to its very nature surrounded by tons of risks and factors.If I were in your shoes, I will probably borrow him money but at a relatively low amount and I would consider such as \"money given\" or donation; just for the purpose of friendship and good karma.",

If I have such a friend, I will give him half of the money because he's my friend and I will only give him the little I can risk also. Moreover, we can never tell what might happen next if he wins or loses, and you know, given such a loan, you don't need to give out that kind of loan with interest, because if the person loses the money, in horse racing games, you don't know if he can pay back or not. Besides, as a gambler, you don't need to be greedy because surely a day might come when you will lose all your money by gambling, and you might also look for someone who can lend you some money and if the person idn't give you, you might feel bad mostly when you know the person have the money but refused to give, the shocking part is that the game played accurately the way you predicted it, but no money to stake it.Besides I don't advice using borrowed money to gamble.",

Gambling cannot be the primary income source of a person. He must have another income source. It could be his business or his job or other things. If he need help to develop those things, I would help him. If you lend him money and he lose again, he won't will be down further and you might regretting lending him. Instead, give him some good advice about his other income sources. He should build those first before he gamble again. Most of the time gamblers lose because they want to recover their loss.",

We are grateful if it can make our money increase, but at other times it can also make our money decrease a lot and even make us go into debt, ultimately endangering our finances, it is better not to borrow to gamble and also give loans to people who want to gamble because both are at risk of losing.",

I know this is an off topic matter already but this kind of situation makes healthcare insurance shows how valuable insurance is for hard situations like this.Yeah, helping him financially is the best thing to do but don’t loan him since he will be pressured to gamble just to pay interest and we all know what’s the implication in case he didn’t succeed.

We gave him the money but he failed the job and just waste our money on job hunting, now he is suicidal because he failed to find job and repaid us which we are not asking to pay us quickly.",
