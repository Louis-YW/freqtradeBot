However, by consistently contributing valuable content and engaging with the community, you can eventually earn merit and increase your status on the forum.My Personal Opinion: ChatGPT gave a very good advice on how you can earn merit on this forum. I have got 1200 merit in 1256 posts which is roughly 0.95 merit per post and I will mention things which worked for me out of the above list.- Participating in the Discussions: I took a huge leap in merits when I started talking to legendary and veteran members on WO thread. It helped me share my opinion and understand their thought process on various topics. Best section of this forum I would say.- Share your expertise: Not everyone here is fan of TA however people who followed my TA in Speculation board did gave me merit on daily basis as I was providing some value and new information in terms of Technical Analysis on regular basis. When I predicted Bitcoin to reach $20k in February, not everyone was convinced but with time and market situation, it worked in my favor. Call it luck or a good drawing (as they say).I hope you find this helpful, most of the points may be discussed earlier (that's how this AI know all this) so don't mind it. This post is meant for beginners and newbies to level up their game.",

I still think you will be fine even the AI bot gave you plagiarized advice because you mentioned how and where you got it.I kinda read that as being about 3-6 distinct people that post here (some bullet points subtly change tone). It's fine for an AI bot for now but still shows its flaws.It's also way too long! Did you ask it for 10 points? 2 of the bullet points sound like they're repeating themselves quite a bit (but some users do that anyway). There's a lot of training data on that and likely a lot of threads but if chatgpt uses some sort of neural network and doesn't have access to the Internet then it's quite impressive (if it has a copy of its training data then it's a lot less impressive though imo).",

Hit the search bar you will see many. The number two link gives the full details on the OP.The major thing I learned from the op is the horizontal lines. So [/hr]Is the code for the horizontal line. Thanks for the thread. Everyone can make mistake. Together we can clean the forum",

I usually like to sit back and watch when trends like this start shaking the internet. AFAIK some reputable sites like stack overflow banned the use of ChatGPT on their platform. Stack overflow is known to be the hub where programmers discuss and find solutions to coding problems, apparently the admins deem it fit to ban the use of ChatGPT to answer coding questions. Bitcointalk is more lenient with the use of AI as long as they don’t break the rules. I’m counting on bounty hunters and account farmers to abuse this AI to build accounts.",
