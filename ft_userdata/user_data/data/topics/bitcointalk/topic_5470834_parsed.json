As a result of this, they don't have any way to take over what they can't access. Even without a hardware wallet, self-custodial mobile and window wallets alone can't be taken control of without the owner giving access to the wallet. Even if they succeed in arresting bitcoin owners, if they in any way identify any of its citizens who own it, they can't still forcefully take control over the wallet unless there is some advanced technology that they plan to use in doing that, and I still don't see any possibility in that.",

But bitcoins stored on wallet cannot be seized or the account frozen, the only possible way is to trace the person and force the person to submit their wallet seed phrase or private keys. Apart from this two the decentralized nature of bitcoin can never allow any third party to have access to your wallet without the seed or keys. So the only way is through tracing you and you can also minimize the risk of been Traced by using an HD wallet that generates new addresses for every new transaction. And you need to make sure to use the new address to receive new transactions, as such you can’t have all transactions linked to you. The other way is the use of bitcoin mixers. This two create almost total anonymity that can be a bit hard for the government to trace you",

      "body": "This question of yours can be answered in a yes and no response.YES being the fact that the government can take over bitcoin assets through centralized third party exchange if such case emanates. Since you have your bitcoin with the exchange, it does not belong to you because you have no access to the seed or key phrase holding the asset. So you can not in any way say you own it and if the government decides to act funny, all the assets with that exchange is gone as long as there is a tag attached to the exchange or your account with them.  NO being the fact that in this situation you have control over your bitcoin asset and no one knows who owns the wallet address and no one can trace to see where or see the end of it all to know between the parties that did the transaction to act by taking over the asset. You own your keys and you have your asset under your watch so how does the government know who owns the wallet when there is no link to trace and know the owner of such wallet.In all, there is possibility that your question is very much accurate because third parties are porous and are the arm of government in crypto so the government through them can do whatever they want since they have access to kyc of every account holder with them.",

Without the private keys of your wallet you cant access your Bitcoins without seeking permission form a third party that might eventually deny you your request. But if you have full possession of your keys the only mean someone could take them form you is by physically ripping you off of it, as long as you have not done any mistake top save it digitally or share it to someone (a friend, family or someone who you claim to love.)When you store your Bitcoin in a wallet you are in full control of, there is no way the government can intimated you or there is no law written that stand that you have to open your phone or laptop and share you keys to the government. That is trespassing personal property.

In this situation, we should read those news, which are not biased and are neutral. And, the topic you started, must be out of curiosity about how Israel seizes the cryptocurrency, please keep in mind that, they seize the cryptocurrency of some wallet or some platform. They just can't seize the assets of a person. And they are not the only ones to seize the assets, back in time, when bankruptcies and scams occurred, the US and many other countries also seized many funds. Examples are the silk road etc. Quote from: Queentoshi on October 18, 2023, 07:15:10 PMThe government has struggled hard to make sure that bitcoin does not develop and grow, they have made several policies and even created their own CBDC as a competition all to suffocate bitcoins growth.

We are talking about BTC blockchain, which is secure from any single entity's control. And They might have thought to seize the funds but they can only do that, by going home to home, person to person, and checking each and everyone, for their seed phrases and searching out the whole house, etc. etc. whatever method they will use, but a person can, of course, trick them and save the seed phrases, even by remembering them. I hope you are getting my point. And a government cannot just seize the assets of there locals. I didn't heard of any event like this.",

They have the power to do that if they're in the government to just confiscate and take away people's phrases and seeds in a forced manner. And they're also aware that many won't obey that rule because someone can remain lowkey and low profile that it seems that he's an idiot and doesn't understand a thing or two about Bitcoin. That's why it's unlikely that they can seize all people's Bitcoin if they ever get to have an order to seize all people's Bitcoin. I guess that these topics are popping up due to the war and all of the news that has come out. But remember folks, you can play dead and know nothing about Bitcoin if someone asks you and this is the importance of remaining anonymous don't talk a lot in public that you know that much about cryptocurrencies. Yes, we're advocates and educate people about Bitcoin but we should do it in a proper venue because who knows if someone is watching out like the FEDs and has got plans like these topics that have been brought up.",

If you don't make crimes, don't get arrested, your coins will be always yours, no seizure.Governments can not buy all coins in circulating supply if not all bitcoiners sell their coins to governments.

Do you think that this can happen? Do you think that everyone will really sell their Bitcoin to the government? Technically speaking, yes they can sell it to the government, but realistically speaking, no it is almost impossible knowing that not all Bitcoin holders are willing to sell their Bitcoin especially with the government. This kind of scenario are kind of impossible to happen - unless people around the world will really sell, but what are the chances of it to happen? 0%.The government can't acquire something that they didn't create at first place, and that is Bitcoins, so it's impossible. I can't imagine these authorities interviewing every single person around the world asking if they are holding Bitcoins, and if they are, they will sell it to them.  Kind of funny TBH.",

I was just wondering something like that. As others mentioned, it is clear that it is technically impossible to access all the (remaining) Bitcoins. But another question has to do with the affordability (even if the price didn't go nuts like you mentioned with the 1M example).I thought that the market cap was closer to gold's, but I've just checked it and it is 26 times smaller. It is much closer to silver's (only 2.5 times smaller: wait for the bull run). With a capitalisation of 500B, more or less Israel's GDP, it would be expensive, but still affordable, for the main economic powers (it would be, for example, 1.5 times the amount allocated to the EU's Next Generation program). But I don't think that it would be politically justifiable, in any case.",
