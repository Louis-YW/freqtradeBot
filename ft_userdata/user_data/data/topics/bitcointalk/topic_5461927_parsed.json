  "content": "The way fuel take dey cost for this our country just tire me well well, but I say make I update us on how to use cooking gas for our Generators, motors and motorcycle some of us never see am physically but some of us done see am maybe some persons dey use am already but as I never see this kind of thread here I say make I update my fellow Nigerians, the price of cooking gas dey somehow good but that one no be the main issue, the main thing here be say  COOKING GAS AND FUEL WHICH OF THEM THEY LAST PASS? So nah why I come with this update, if I buy 4.5kg of gass e go carry me from night till the morning for 3 day and some hours, so e go good if you check am out, no matter say I get solar sometimes way rain dey fall through out the day e no dey charge so I still dey buy cooking gas way I go use for my generator. (source).This one nah for people way dey use generatorThis cooking gas way we dey use for our Generators dey help us spend lesser, imagine say you buy ten (10) litters of fuel five thousand nine hundred and fifty naira (N5950) and the fuel no carry you till day break how you go feel? For my own side E go dey very very bad bro so na why our fellow Nigerians way sabi mechanical things bring this good idea come board so that our expenses go reduce small.This one nah for people way they use car for transportationAs for you way dey run transportation business how you go feel when you buy five (5) liters of fuel for your transport business then you never get the fuel money and the fuel way you buy con finish just like that? As for me e no go dey good, so nah why you go try this idea way our engineers carry come I know say e go dey some how but if we try am e go help us well well even some of us way no get motor e go help us because transportation go reduce small.This one nah for people way get motorcycleAs for motorcycle e fit no dey good sha but make we just try one of these thing e go help us reduce expenses.",

I never convert my own generator into gas, but I sabi wey don convert am already, and according to them gas dey economical pass petrol by far, and as we can see gas price dey drop now for some places now gas na around #500 and I hear say d rate at which gas dey burn dey low pass petrol own. Wetin come even make me believe them be say plenty people don dey convert their generator to gas and if e no dey last, then people for no dey rush am like that.Quote from: rachael9385 on August 03, 2023, 09:18:40 AMSo nah why I come with this update, if I buy 4.5kg of gass e go carry me from night till the morning for 3 day and some hours, so e go good if you check am out,E dey very okay be that now, I no sabi d kin generator wey u dey use and I no sabi d kin load wey u dey use ur generator carry, but if we wan on generator overnight now, na only God d amount wey d person go dey spend daily on petrol most especially if na big generator d person dey use, but from ur analysis now, then gas better pass petrol.Quote from: rachael9385 on August 03, 2023, 09:18:40 AMThis one nah for people way they use car for transportationI fit use dis car own also even as I know say e dey kind of risk pass that generator own but I no fit even try bike own. If the gas dey inside car i see say e go dey shake, if sun too much and d gas wey dey d cylinder don too shake anything fit happen now, but I no fit every try bike own and I no fit climb any bike wey use am, bike wey dey easily fall, if d gas don too shake and maybe accident happen d gas fit explode immediately now, na double accident be that ooo.

      "body": "I have seen this and from the reviews of many Nigerians I think this conversation have a positive result and considering the earlier fear that the conversion from fuel to gas usage may cause engine problem but to this extent there have not been any report of an increase in engine break down due to the conversion and knowing that, both fuel and gas could run on the same engine concurrently is what make this development more interesting. I have a friend who already converted his generator from fuel to gas and the capurator run I both fuel and gas and he prefer using gas to power the generators he says it burns slowly compared to fuel and also the gas price is relatively low and since using gas against PMS gives him 3 hours extra power in a 6kg gas compared to 6 litters of fuel time usage. So in all senses this new invention pay more than the fuel we were used to considering the recent increase in the price of fuel in Nigeria due to the fuel subsidy removal. But the challenges with this new converter is it availability like in my region there is no single conversion centre for those who want to install this equipment in their automobile they will have to travel to neighbouring States and the demand is high so you need to book ahead of time. And also recently the price of the generator mono caprator has skyrocketed due to higher demands, so the unavailability of this tool may force its price to increase and that could be a big drawback to many who may be considering this new invention.",

I will not advice bitcoiners to embark on this new strategy people are using to sustain their lives, because if they can carry out their personal research to know, the high risk involved in this system of using gas for generator, motorcycle and motors they will avoid it in the society. The first day I saw this new system online of using gas to replace fuel in generator, motorcycle and motors, made me to feel bad for what will happen to some people who will embark on it just because of high price of fuel in our nation Nigeria. Yes, using gas to on your generator can reduce the cost of your spending in the area of fuel but it can cause a damage that you will never recover from and likewise motorcycle and motors too, please let us not join them to use all those things to replace the function of fuel.",
