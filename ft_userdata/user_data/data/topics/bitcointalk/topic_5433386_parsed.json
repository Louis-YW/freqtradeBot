If for storing try also to have a hard wallet, but for trading purposes you can also try to download the apps of exchanges where you can get TRX easily, Binance mobile app for example. With regards to losing your tokens, I guess this will depend on the security of the wallet you are choosing, that’s why Trust wallet is a good option for this.",

What have you personally used that you can say works well?There are tons of non-custodial wallets specifically for mobile phones that you can use and support Tron & USDT ​​there. Here's the list:1. TronLink | 2. imToken | 3. iToken | 4. Trust Wallet | 5. Cobo Wallet | 6. BitPie | 7. Math | 8. Token Pocket | 9. Klever | 10. Vision | 11. Exodus |12. Atomic | 13. BitKeep | 14. Guarda | 15. Moonstake | 16. Assure | 17. Coin Wallet | 18. NOW Wallet | 19. Arctic | 20. Trustee | 21.

As far as I'm using Trust Wallet, I haven't had any issues and it's running well.",

To use for altcoins, I think trust wallet is the wallet to go for because it's easy to use and so far safe without problems. Regarding the problems you are mentioning, I think it's the user's fault, not the wallet's. There are many wallets for us to select, but many wallets have difficult-to-use interfaces and cumbersome operations, so users can easily get confused, leading to wrong sending and losing money...As a newbie, don't try to use too many wallets but just use Trustwallet, I really find it very easy to use for newbies.",

I am using it on the other hand you can use atomic wallet but Trust wallet is by far the most popular and useful wallet for mobile device. Since trust wallet is a non-custodial wallet, it has a security phrase, so keeping your funds here is completely under your control. So in my opinion you can choose trust wallet for mobile device to keep your USDT",
