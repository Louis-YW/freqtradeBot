Both Michael Saylor and every other Bitcoin whale will do same.",

But if we're talking about the company or state's funds, then there are probably financial managers handling that and making deals with some other companies. In case of El Salvador, they have Chivo wallet, and it would make sense if the state's crypto funds are stored there (maybe the president's personal funds as well). And as Lucius pointed out, Grayscale uses a Coinbase service, which goes in line with my assumption that things like that would happen via centralized storage. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll ever have reasonable knowledge about it because it's big money we're talking about, and it makes sense that the whales will do their best to hide as much info about how they store the coins as possible.",

But would you then not have the same problem except that you went from storing the seed phrase words to storing the private keys to the seed phrase words? I guess you can divide up the keys and keep on adding multisig layers for extra security but it would never be 100% secure. Just more distributed. Also what I meant by \"decentralized version\" but was too lazy to explain.However now wouldn't the problem be that the more layers you add, the greater the chance becomes that you could lose access to the wallet by losing access to a signature? So thats a problem I think most corporations/whales would rather avoid. The scary thought would be someone withholding a key to blackmail or sabotage a business from within, with their own funds.No matter how I think about it, there's a huge flaw in security.",
