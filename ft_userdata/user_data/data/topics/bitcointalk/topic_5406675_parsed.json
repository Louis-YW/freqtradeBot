  "content": "I came across martianswap.io on BSC. Sounds like a new innovative project. They have a Twitter post with details and the link to the swap, and that's about it. I've checked out the contracts on BSC scan, and it looks very interesting.MartianSwap takes a 0.5% BNB fee on every swap. Half the BNB fee is auto swapped for MARS token, and the Mars is either burned or liquified. There are two functions publicly callable by any user. The other half of the fee is INSTANTLY transferred to Mars holders that bid for 'slot' positions. There are 100 slots, and users can bid and bid, and the lowest bidder always gets bumped out. Looking through the contract there is a function that will pick one of the 100 slot holders at random to receive the fee of the swap.. no matter how large or small the amount of the swap.Every swap takes a bnb fee that is then used to buy Mars? sounds like sound pumpanomics, and pumpanomics that doesn't even involve the use of the token, but the swap.So what's the incentive to use the swap?Mars also pays out an equal amount of MARS to the BNB value of your swap. The initial supply is only 100k Mars, which grows with the emissions from the swap, but emissions lower over time as the supply grows, similar to bitcoin. So the supply is dependent on the volume. 1000 BNB volume in a day, means 1000 new MARS tokens minted that day.. If I understand correctly..But again, as the supply reaches certain thresholds, 1000BNB volume will mint lower amounts of MARS.We'll see where it goes, all contracts are verified. Dev funds are verifiably locked in the slot contract for 36 weeks. Holding a slot in the slot contract is how you earn fees from the platform, so even after 36 weeks, dev might not be incentivized to sell.Liquidity is low because the liquidity is meant to come from the swaps on the platform.. so I was only able to scoop up a few hundred tokens with a few dollars of value. The protocol looks like it has potential though.",
