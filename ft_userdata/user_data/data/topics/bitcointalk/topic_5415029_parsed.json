It's a huge challenge for many other Indian companies as well. I imagine they must have shitty working conditions. I don't intend to resign because I'm happy with my job. People want to quit if they feel they are underpaid, or feel exploited doing too many hours and things like that.Although this started with COVID because people were paid to stay at home, but in the end, people are going to have to eat and to earn their food they will have to work. I don't see that this is going to be so massive and sustained over time.In the end there will have to be a balance where all the people who want to will not be able to resign, or employers will be forced to offer better working conditions.",

Of course, the employees will adapt to. A middle ground will have to be set.Some will go back to the office, maybe for bigger salaries.Some will find a middle ground, like 2-3 days in the office and the rest from home.Some may stay at home, but unless they're exceptionally qualified, they will have to find different employer.So the situation is far from \"black and white\" and I expect that in many (most?) cases a middle ground will be found.",

If you don't pay thousands of qualified teachers in order to reduce inflation who will teach/guide the producers to produce enough?It is OK to blame inflation on those who are not working but somehow are given things made by producers to consume.

With less spending by people and with less growth in demand, the inflation may come within controllable range. Its been claimed that the life expectancy for americans declined significantly in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Some sources claim life expectancy for americans diminished as much as 5 years in 12 months.Economic recession. Global pandemics. All would appear to contribute towards elevated homelessness, crime, violence, homicide, suicide and overdose rates. Which would take a severe toll on life expectancy and population growth.If you're searching for decreased demand. It could happen. At the expense of human life. Japan has arguably enjoyed success with its negative population growth. Perhaps that will become our model for the future. A case study where we may not have much input as to which trends materialize. Many of the trends we face could have grown too large to be stopped now. Even if a collective and comprehensive effort was made to reverse those trends.But even decreased demand won't necessarily curb rising inflation. The only thing that can stop inflation is people dong more to be informed and knowledgeable on the topic on an individual level. Many of our worst policies were enthusiastically supported by the majority. There were people willing to battle to their last breath to support things that directly led to inflation. How do get these people to stop supporting the wrong things? They must invest more effort into being more knowledgeable and making better choices. That's what is needed the most if these issues are ever to be fixed.",

We are coming off of a year where many people were forced to stay in their jobs because of the pandemic. I think there is a lot of pent-up frustration that is going to be released in the form of resignations over the next few months.The second factor is that there has been a lot of discussion lately about work-life balance. I think people are starting to realize that they don't need to sacrifice their personal lives for their careers. They are willing to take a pay cut or take a demotion in order to have a better work-life balance.The third factor is that inflation is starting to pick up in India. This is making people more hesitant to spend money, which could lead to less demand and slower economic growth.I think all of these factors are going to lead to a lot of resignations in the next few months. I think it is going to be a challenge for Indian companies to handle all of the resignations, and they are going to need to be prepared for a slower economic growth.",

Offer the employees to work fewer hours and get a bit less money (if it's absolutely impossible to keep the original salary in a way that 4-work-day week experiments in developed countries do). Then people are much less likely to resign, some money will be saved from paying them less (which perhaps can be used to hire more employees part-time if it's needed), and people will become more satisfied.",

Higher skilled persons will tend to have more options, but the options are still not likely to be unlimited, but if being out of the work place (and out of the grueling routine of daily reporting to work), there may have been opportunties presented that had not previously been realized or understood prior to getting sent home.Â  Some members of the work-force will be in a better position to follow through with their threat to quit, and some of them will make mistakes if they have not figured out their situation in order to perhaps assure that they will be able to get better work and/or better pay for their skill levels and job-related experiences.Quote from: Cling18 on September 30, 2022, 04:37:08 PMCountries and companies that won't value their skilled employees are like throwing gems.
