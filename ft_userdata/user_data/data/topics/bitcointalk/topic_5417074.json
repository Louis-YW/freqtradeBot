Every person, business, state, and system can communicate with each other. And there is a war going on in the blockchain world. One blockchain is screaming “I am the fastest” and another “I am the cheapest” while the end user just needs to benefit from the service, and this blockchain war is preventing the technology from moving forward and taking over the world.Our solutionDevelop a modular infrastructure for cross-chain interaction.Establish a plug-in-based communication \"bus\" that could provide an end-to-end security \"dialogue\" between blockchains and protocols - a kind of \"messenger\" for blockchains. Any developer can supply a self-made connector for any system or platform into this communication “bus\".How does it worksYAR consists of Layer 2 protocol and Layer 1 blockchain, which work together to provide the developer with a single, standardized data input/output point to any supported systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON, BSC, Solana, etc.).YAR blockchain ensures the uninterrupted operation of published smart contracts and the interaction of data within the blockchain.YAR protocol acts as a firewall that ensures the interaction of transport and communication smart contracts published in YARchain with platforms and systems supported by YAR protocol.Such a bundle allows the developer to create smart contracts by connecting any blockchain to them and work with coins, tokens, smart contracts, and any other data as if it were all indirect access.YAR features- EVM-based - deploy your ETH, BSC etc smart contracts with no changes; - Proof-Of-Stake - Dominant consensus for saving the world;- Decentralization - Unlimited number of nodes-validators;- High speed - New block every 5 seconds or 15Mb of size;- Smart contracts - Create & deploy smart contracts with Solidity;- Scalable - Add your platform to the YARprotocol for a win-win united growing;- Interoperable - Develop smart contracts with multi-value & data support with otherblockchains in the YAR chain;- Sovereign - Propose changes and vote on blockchain upgrades with thegovernance module;- Open Source - Work together to build the free and open source YAR developercommunity.What will you build- Decentralized exchanges (DEX) with multi-chain support, in no way inferior to centralized counterparts (CEX);- CRM and ERP platforms;- Marketplaces and supply-chain platforms;- Scoring platforms;- DeFi and crowdfunding platforms, etc.That is, one decision turns former enemies into kind, friendly neighbours.YAR TokenomicsYAR produced 1’000’000’000 BSC-based tokens.

Of course, the YAR chain - is a fully featured EVM-based blockchain.YAR protocol is a docker for two-ways connectors which provide end-to-end security state of assets, contracts, etc.YAR connectors are supported by two-way state binding, where the transaction state and contract state are synchronized along with the token asset binding to the network. The transaction state includes the asset payload, associated data (such as a memo or payment ID), transaction ID, and sender and recipient addresses. Contract state means that YAR supports changing the state of the contract and related events. It can be used in DAOs, scoring systems, and dynamic NFT.Block scanning logic is supported, and unique for each connected chain. Only the state of transactions concerning network storage is synchronized.But I'm sure you are right about the technical white paper needed.Tank you.",

So, any DAO, DeFi, DEX, NFT marketplace etc, can be deploy into YAR chain in first seconds after launch.BTW, currently we have a few cool collaboration with real businesses.",
