If yes, you can create a service announcement thread here  and interested project will come to you if you meet up with their requirements.

However, I have seen newbies conducting bounties in the forum even if I can not tell how it use to end up. My point is that, it might be very difficult for a beginner but they have to start from somewhere. You can not just build trust from nowhere. Even the reputable managers here started at some point like this but they prove themselves to be reliable and trusted. So, I think Op too can do it if he means business.",

Yes it is true that campaign management can be started from any rank account but for campaign management you need to have enough experience like ability to check post quality of users and also know marketing strategy to know how to offer your services to a client.Once you have these skills, you can open your service thread on service boards and start your campaign management journey. But getting projects is very difficult and for this you need to follow the right marketing strategy, bring different thinking and reach the right place with your service offering.",

How are they actually doing the job?I assume very few / no managers asked this question (how to become a manager) with a topic are now providing their service as a manager. I wanted to tell you that to become a manager need a lot of experience, need to know how the forum works, and how the bounty/signature campaign works. What are the things done by a campaign Manager. To achieve this knowledge and experience you have to know the forum well. You have to spend a good amount of time here. Need to join in the Bounty and signature campaign to understand the Manager's tasks well. Once you enroll in some bounties/signature campaigns you can understand it easily. Let's talk about how the campaigns come to the Campaign manager. Most of them come from their Ann thread and direct contacts with the project team( but in this case, experience and portfolio play an important role).On the other hand, you are talking about the campaign managers who don't have their service ann thread even they are newbies/brand new accounts. Yes, you are right, the newbie is also now a campaign manager but I am pretty sure they are running campaigns with alternative accounts who have experiences but previously lost their reputation. Long story short-> spend time here, achieve experience and gain knowledge so you can easily understand how to become a campaign manager. Best of luck.",

Having said that, level up on your rank first so you will be qualified to apply for a position in a campaign.However, to answer your question, be knowledgeable on crypto and the forum itself so you can be an ideal campaign manager. And develop your skills on managing your team because in order for a campaign to last working, the manager should know how to value and appreciate the works of every member and he should serve as a model to his team.",

If you wanna be a campaign manager here, you should probably learn more about this place first.  Can't expect folks to trust you to run things if you don't even know that much about the community yet.Understanding the people and the culture should be your priority number one.  If you don't devote enough effort there you'll just end up stumbling when it comes time to put that knowledge into practice.  Rushing never got anyone too far.  Slow down, put your head down, focus on learning for now.  The rest will follow in time.  Just gotta be patient and do the work first.",
