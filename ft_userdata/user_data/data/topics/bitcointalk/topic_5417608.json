  "content": "QuoteDespite the European Union rejecting a proposal banning crypto mining earlier this year, more regulations could soon be implemented to mitigate the environmental impacts of crypto mining.Bitcoin has seen a 41% increase in energy consumption Year-on-Year (YoY) despite dramatic improvements in energy efficiency and a more diverse and sustainable energy mix — but there are concerns the rise could see regulators clamp down on mining. The data comes from a Q3 2022 report by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) which represents 51 of the world's largest Bitcoin mining companies.The report found Bitcoin mining to consume 0.16% of global energy production, slightly less than the energy consumed by computer games according to the BMC — and an amount it considered to be “an inconsequential amount of global energy.”Bitcoin mining also emitted 0.10% of the world’s carbon emissions which the BMC deemed to be “negligible.”(Source: Cointelegraph)What do you think about BTC this year and what will happen in cryptocurrency at the year-end?",

Although there's no data about energy use Year on Year of banking system, but I believe it's increase too.I think this should be mentioned on any articles because even though Bitcoin do consume more energy, but it's using renewable energy and the energy used is more efficient in the next eight years later.",

It is an 3% YoY increase from Q3 2021 to Q3 2022.It's true that the energy crisis globally can cause short term stricter regulation on Bitcoin mining when governments try to resolve the temporary shortages of energy resources.",

      "body": "I echo the comment from Apocollapse. That's what the truth is! Even if the energy consumption is increasing, the proportion of sustainable and green energy is also increasing. So that's a net positive for environment. However, my only fear is the overly concerned EU parliament and the environmentalists with political power. They will anyways try to raise concerns at the highest level possible to satisfy their own agenda. EU parliament has already initiated proceedings to ban any \"proof of work\" cryptocurrency and I believe there was some movement to this news in the last week. This is concerning, because it will create a huge problem for the sustainability of bitcoin network, even though it will be temporary.",

The biggest country with the biggest hashrate was China and their mining ban didn't really change the hashrate or cause any troubles!Besides, with the energy crisis that Europe is facing and the super high price of electricity I don't see any kind of mining happening in Europe in near future even if they don't ban it.P.S. The rest regarding the energy consumption is the repetition of the same old FUDs.",

But the bitcoin mining sector is one of the pacesetters in the quest to promote an environmentally friendly society. In recent times we have seen many miners switch to green power sources more than any other sector.   If computer games that offer just entertainment are consuming more power than a decentralized and transparent financial system like bitcoin, why all this media backlash? The news of bitcoiners contribution to a clean and green environment gets less publicity while any negative news is given wide coverage.Many smear campaigns against bitcoin are failing because people are becoming more enlightened about the benefits that bitcoin offers as well as the hypocrisy of most policymakers which is why adoption is increasing. I don't expect this report to have any negative effect on bitcoin. If mining is stopped in any country, miners would move to more friendly countries.",

We don't need europe to support bitcoin mining or we dont care if India bans mining to the last ASIC available and cease them all!For that matter we only need one big mining farm running somewhere on an private island or may be some nigerian goverment supporting bitcoin. STILL, bitcoin/crypto space gonna live forever. All those freak shows regarding energy, this and that gonna stay forever. Nobody cared when industries grew over couple of 100 years, no one cared when trucks and cars started roaring, so why care of bitcoin mining machine which is still efficient as compared to all those stuff mentioned above.",

There have also been some ignominy from The Guardian after they wrote that article saying trapping gas flaring for Bitcoin Mining doesn't help the environment. Which is a shame hearing that from them because they are not even funded by any venture capitalist unlike the other outlets.The general idea of this article and more are debunked on https://bitcoincleanup.com",

So don't be fooled by these fake claims to spread FUD and stay positive.",

LOL, that's absurd and it seems that they just spin this numbers to fit their narrative. And for sure those anti bitcoin mining proponents will used this article to point out the negative things that bitcoin can bring. Anyway, we know that this is not true and there are even worst industries that contributed more in the energy consumption as compare to bitcoin.",

With energy shortages, seems they have something to blame. Emissions from crypto mining aren't anything that would have an impact on climate change, so the angle the EU is trying to take here isn't anything based on reality. Energy consumption through crypto mining isn't anything worthy of discussion either, it makes up significantly less than a fraction of percentage point. This is purely political.",

What they care about is any way they could cover that gap. For example if there is mass blackouts they are not going to allow a miner continue mining using hydroelectricity! They are going to want to use that small amount to cover a little bit of that electricity supply shortage.",
