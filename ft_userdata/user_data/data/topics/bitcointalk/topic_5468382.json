  "content": "I would like to witness this recommendation by their court become a precedent that would open the doors for bitcoin to be traded, mined and used openly in China. I was very bullish on the return of bitcoin in Shanghai before, however, the communist party of China might be a difficult challenge. They do not have an uncle Gary who we laugh on and make jokes. The communist party will kill people or imprison them in rural educational centers similar to Alibaba founder Jack Ma if they do not listen to the mysterious elders of the party.Chinese man bidding in bitcoin auctionA recent Shanghai People’s Court announcement in China acknowledged Bitcoin as a unique digital currency despite the country’s official ban on cryptocurrencies.In the article, the Shanghai court recognized Bitcoin as a distinctive digital currency, setting it apart from virtual counterparts like Q coins. It cited Bitcoin’s rarity, global acceptance, and inherent monetary qualities. This stands in contrast to China’s conventional classification of cryptocurrencies as speculative investments.Regulatory bodies in China have prohibited cryptocurrency trading and mining. However, the court expressed the view that Bitcoin’s attributes make it challenging to ignore in legal contexts. When disputes arise regarding theft or ownership, the article suggests that Bitcoin can be considered personal property, acquired through purchase, mining, or inheritance.This announcement builds upon a previous decision by a Shanghai court in May 2022 that also acknowledged Bitcoin’s legitimacy. At that time, a legal expert argued that China’s laws could indeed protect cryptocurrency holders despite the trading ban.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/bitcoin-recognized-as-a-digital-currency-in-shanghai",

I may not be aware of the details and the intention of the court and government in identifying Bitcoin as a unique currency, however, it is generally a beautiful idea that can thrive when fully brought to live and implemented.Lending from their idea of demystifying Bitcoin above any other virtual or digital currency boils down to how the currency has consistently maintained it's relevance and dignity over the years through its open source technology and decentralization. Like the article mentioned at a point, owning Bitcoin is a personal decision and how you intend to use it is still left to the owner.The value of the digital currency goes up and down by the time, as it's reflective of the market trends and investment bloom over the time. Nonetheless, it's fluctuations in value is reasonably okay and could be easily monitored and predicted. This is adrift of other currencies which are closed to a centralized system and the volatility of the market is almost-always horrendous.What gives me joy about this news is that if China is able to adopt Bitcoin as a means of transaction as investment currency, that will further strengthen the power of the currency across the globe taking into consideration, the influence and population of the country, China.",

Secondly, these judgments are merely for academic exercise, nothing will come out of them. The Chinese judiciary are not independent,  in fact they are just rubber stamp to the communist party.

Bitcoin will get a big push if China changes its negative perception and policies. And the acceptance of Bitcoin by China will make other countries also become friendly to the currency.",

Despite the fact that China previously cracked down on bitcoin, the situation is different now. As a result, the Shanghai government court may be relaxing its stance.Furthermore, it is obvious from Shanghai's actions that it may gradually improve the acceptance percentage of their Bitcoin community in their country. Aside from that, it demonstrates that cryptocurrency will become more broadly recognized and will have a significant positive impact on the economy.",

So even if this recognition is rejected, it is certain that there will be other proposals in the future. Bitcoin has been growing without China for years, this news is not big news for bitcoin. But it is also interesting to know that the demand for bitcoin has become so great that there is no way to stop it anymore. Like it or not, I believe the Chinese government must accept the fact that it cannot stop bitcoin.",

Does that mean Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ban would be removed? I doubt it will happen soon, as large amount of members from CCP are still against it. Does the court verdict influence the decision making of a authoritarian government? Again, I doubt it, I feel unless Xi Jinping says yes the ban would not be removed. Already he has done incredible injustice to the Bitcoin community in the past, this judgement seem very dubious. Unless, he agrees nothing positive would happen after the announcement of Bitcoin recognised as a digital currency by their local court.",

Hmm, something is not adding up right here from the Chinese government.It's been common that in a bear market, we see Chinese negativity about bitcoin, but it turns positive before the bull run. I think China is also one of the biggest holders of bitcoin as a country, after the USA. They are just full of drama about bitcoin, which I mostly ignore. However bitcoin market become more mature now while big player are trying to accumulate before blackrock like giant get their approval for bitcoin ETF.",

I think they will definitely open the trades for crypto one more time because they had a horrifying end when they last time shut down every operation related to the mining of bitcoin. They had the biggest infra for the mining and they were getting paid enough in return for the electricity plants. I think they definitely have made a mistake. Now if someone is going argue that they shut it down because it was polluting the china then let us not forget how big their manufacturing plants are that pollute it. The only reason they shut it down was heroic decision from the dicatrtos of china who always want to do something opposite to what world is doing. There was and there is no logic behind this. Now they will reopen when they realise how much they are losing in the process.",

Sure, they may have seen and realized that bitcoin is a real currency with economy, commerce, and a circulation to boot, but that doesn't automatically mean that they'd accept it or allow it to proliferate within their country. Although if this means that they are taking a step towards regulating and adopting bitcoin within China, I think that's good and would mean well for bitcoin which nowadays is primarily centered towards third-world countries and the USA. Having a little diversity within the bitcoin populace will mean great as it strengthens bitcoin's hold of its community. allowing for a better traction in times when other countries may not feel so accepting of bitcoin.",

And this isn't the first time that a Chinese court acknowledges Bitcoin in one way or another. But nothing has changed as regards Bitcoin policy. The courts, after all, don't craft state policies. Bitcoin remains illegal in the red state.This is just a guide as to how courts treat cases which involve Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There was a legal dilemma before as far as ownership of cryptocurrencies are concerned. I remember there was a case in which the court ruled that the stolen cryptocurrencies are not to be seized and returned to the owner because they weren't under the protection provided for by the laws on properties. This recent recognition makes it clear that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are properties that are acquired and owned. So, such recognition is merely for the purpose of proper court disposal of cases involving cryptocurrencies.",
