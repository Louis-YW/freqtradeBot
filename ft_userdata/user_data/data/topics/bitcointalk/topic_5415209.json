The maximum withdrawal per day is currently $2,500 and $7,500 per week. Your withdrawal will be paid out within 7 business days of the withdrawal request. Also, make sure you have wagered funds before requesting a withdrawal, as this is in line with anti-money laundering policies.You will need to provide a photo I.D. and proof of residence when requesting your cashout, so make sure you have these on hand to speed up the process.",

It seems that they have revamped their casino and edited the TOS especially on the KYC part since most post on their old thread mentioned KYC is a bit confusing. I think they should just edit their old thread about their new update.",

Just have a few questions about withdrawal and the KYC since this is the usual situation where the site requires KYC before you withdraw. Is this a KYC free for a certain amount only?",
