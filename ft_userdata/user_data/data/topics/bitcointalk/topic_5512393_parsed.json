The reality is that , the government will keep fighting bitcoin with all market strategy and strick regulations. Reasons why they will keep fighting is not about the prosperity of the people majorly but about power and authority to control people. This is why they prefer the centralized system in order to keep the people poor so that they can run to their feet for daily bread, seek shelter and wait for other provision. We all know that through Bitcoin, every one will be there own boss. No control or submission to any authority over your own belonging or money, the life threatening taxes will be done away with.

No control or submission to any authority over your own belonging or money, the life threatening taxes will be done away with.   Bitcoin can't make everyone in the world rich; it can only make a few individuals out of the total world population rich and not the entire world. It's not enough to pull out such; beside, it's merely to be used to carry out seemless transactions and not a poverty eradication program.QuoteBut as of now, no matter how popular Bitcoin becomes, it will keep facing the wrath of the angry government who need to keep people poor.  I still disagree with this not because I think the Government are not fighting bitcoin but because you said they want to continue keeping the people poor.QuoteMore also, before bitcoin will become used by everyone across the world as means of payment, most users hear must have grown white Bear, Bitcoin is here to serve as an alternative means of payment. Even if all governments approve its use, not everyone will love to make use of it; some prefer to remain old-fashioned.",

It's not about keeping people poor but it's about maintaining their power and that's what the government is all about, to have central power and Bitcoin doesn't allow that. But in some other areas, the government can still get themselves involved through the gateways of where people are using Bitcoin. Whether it's with the transactions, the trades/exchanges, and other means of it. That's what we're seeing, they're banning, increasing the taxes, or anything that they are in control to discourage people from having and using it. But, even with that, we're all eager to continue this. It's no longer about the future of Bitcoin but it's about the value of Bitcoin holds and the governments are taking a long time before the realize this. They should get the hint from the financial institutions that have applied for an spot etf for it and have bulks of reserved of BTC on their stash.",

It is safe to say we are getting better, we don't need hateful, anti-government posts making the situation between government and bitcoin worse.You criticize governments for trying to regulate and manage bitcoin, so do you think it would be good if governments let people use bitcoin freely and cause the economy to collapse soon? Or will criminals become more daring and aggressive because there are no laws to stop them? The price of too much freedom is sometimes not as beautiful as we think.Also, do you think the people of El Salvador are free and not controlled by their government? Is their government stupid enough to accept bitcoin as legal tender just to have their citizens turn against them?",

The reality is that , the government will keep fighting bitcoin with all market strategy and strick regulations. It's about other nations and it's hard to find consensus among hundreds of countries globally. Issues in other countries belong to these national citizens, not problems of El Salvador citizens.We have to firstly look at how El Salvador citizens feel about Bitcoin Legal Tender in their homeland.From normal citizens, as Bitcoin users who want to pay their purchases with bitcoin, to business, merchants, stores there that have to accept bitcoins as payment method from their customers.According to discussions I read, people there especially businesses are not happy because they are forced to accept bitcoin, while they don't consider themselves as Bitcoin holders, investors. And receiving bitcoin causes some unwanted losses for their business treasuries.El Salvador’s Experiment with Bitcoin as Legal TenderQuoteAlthough the law requires all firms to accept bitcoin, in reality only 20 percent do so. Roughly 5 percent of all sales have been paid in bitcoin through Chivo Wallet, and just as most households using Chivo prefer to keep their money in cash rather than in bitcoin, 88 percent of firms convert their bitcoin into dollars.— Laurent BelsieAre cryptocurrencies currencies? Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador.QuoteAmong firms, only 20% accept bitcoin. Enterprises which accept bitcoin are very large and only 11.4% of firms report positive sales in bitcoin.7 On average, only 4.9% of all sales are paid in bitcoin, 88% of businesses transform money from sales in bitcoin into dollars, and 71% of them subsequently withdraw it in cash.",

Bitcoin decentralization is a problem for governments because it gives it's holders freedom and privacy so they'll keep coming up with regulations to interfere with the decentralization. In my country cryptocurrency is not banned but the government is not crypto friendly, our banks are forbidden to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions and top exchanges are disabled for our fiat p2p transactions. Despite all the restrictions by governments Bitcoin adoption is still increasing worldwide because it has proven to be a store of value.
