I do not believe that the longer I play a single slot, it will give me higher chance to hit big multiplier.

(Variance and RTP of each slot also determine the way that you are supposed to play on the different slots) Even though there is no single strategy works to maximize profit in slot game because it is pure luck based game but I like to play high-extreme volatility slots because my main purpose in playing slot is to get huge multiplier.",

When you think that you're not getting any luck with the current slot that you play with, you just jump off with the other to test your luck, and so on and so forth. I guess there are slots players that are also jumping from one casino to the other casino if they're also not getting the luck that they're expecting because there's the belief that luck might be on the other casino.",

I really believe that gambling should be play quickly because of the house edge and human error. The more I play means the more I will lose because of increasing possible mistake by human error such as patience.There was a time that I’m playing slot and manage to spin more than 200 without getting anything and lose half of my bank roll. I got impatient and bet it all on my next spin which ended bust. After that, I never play slot slowly and I only play slot nowadays very seldom.",

This is me, expect the word hitting big I would include the term until I feel enough or exhausted the money.To be honest when I play slots I don't record the wins and loss but I will keep an eye on the history, if I see only the reds in the session then I postpone the bet as well.Slot is more fun which keep us on the edge while rolling that is the best part we as a common gambler has to experience not the RTP or returns.",

Also, I get into some slots with too high expectations, I tend to rise bets and I end up losing a lot more than I wanted cause I had a \"feeling\". So targets are important in both directions, and when I stick with that I last long and I even collect some profit, but when I get too relaxed (which happens sometimes) in most cases it's a bad decision that leads to losing a lot of money!",

To know when to stop I simply use my intuition. After hiting a decent prize or a decent sequence of rewards, an alert lights in my conscience indicating it's time to stop because I've already made a lot of progress and profit compared to the initial bankroll. Once this happens it's time to leave because luck is tricky and can change suddenly on the next roll.",
