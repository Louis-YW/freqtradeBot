  "content": "CZ’s interview today seemed as though it was an admission of guilt that Binance does not have customer funds available to meet the needs of their customers. Just another FTX situation, but Binance had more liquidity to try and stay afloat. Tokens are now coming out and saying that Binance made them put up 200K BNB tokens they couldn’t withdraw in order to obtain a listing. Suddenly the cat is out of the bag. Binance is naked and BNB is worthless as a stand-alone token. This may just be my opinion, what do you think?I’ll be surprised if Binance isn’t below $100 in 90 days… My takeaway from this… The more BTC people withdraw from exchanges, the higher the price of BTC will go.",

He already has first hand experience on the collapse of Terra Luna and then FTX, he should have better knowledge on how not let his Binance or BNB fall apart.I'd say that this is more of a FUD, not defending CZ here, but the worst part is that there are traders and investors who says that the price could go as low as $12k. I don't think that will be the case here and CZ will survived this FUD.",

      "body": "I also believe that binance will not go bankrupt easily, not because they are too big to fail but because what they have done and proven in the market over the years is enough to show that they really have a reputation in the market.  In my opinion, recent Fuds are just revenge of those who failed, and they are looking to sabotage binance and nothing more.About BNB falling, I would take that as an opportunity rather than a sign of the demise of the CZ empire. BNB is one of the coins with a relatively modest drop compared to other altcoins on the market, so I am still expecting it to fall even more with the negative news about binance this time.",

So, the platform will remain strong as per my openion.Binance assets is consolidated on there own tokens same with FTX. BNB fall means they will less liquidity that will sustain in there exchange. Binance has a lot of investors and project listing contract in BNB tokens. They can go bankrupt if people will dump BNB and withdraw all asset on Binance at the same time since they will have no liquidity available to sustain the exchange orderbooks.This is same with FTX issue if you are not aware or blind on CZ charisma. The only difference was the attack might came from the US government as retaliation to what he did on FTX. Also banks might get involved too since they are the number 1 company that will get benefits when Binance fall.",

It is still possible to correct a mistake as long as it wasn't intentional.Please learn about those case first before compare it with binance. Mt.gox which they \"claimed\" got hacked, FTX, which using their customer's money, and Luna, which crashed because of they deppeged with UST and as the result for recovery they choose to minted LUNA coin with total crazy speed and amount and resulted the price dropped so much.QuoteYou are too brave because instead of worrying and panicking once BNB coin dips hard, you will actually buy loads of it.

I never invested on LUNA before so idk about that coin, (doesn't affected with my investment). This all only FUD, let see when BNB reached $1000 later",

Binance has a good reputation for how many years now and it goes even higher in the past years , though there are rough time recently but we can see the recovery and it stabled now .so Nope Zero for binance? bankruptcy ? this is impossible to happen.",

What are you basing this on? If people withdraw their btc it would just remove liquidity, and if they managed to crash exchanges by withdrawing their assets, btc would obviously go down with the trust on the markets. And yes, while one bitcoin = one bitcoin meme would apply but that doesn't help if we don't want to get back to bitcoin stone ages.And with a place like binance going down we would lose ton of institutional investors with it. And let's face it, we need institutions if we want to be taken seriously. If not, it's back to 2010 for us.",

All centralized platforms are the same as you have rightly said, even though Binance has claimed to be the biggest cryptocurrency exchange globally when it comes to the issue of liquidation no exchange is bigger than that to be able to survive when there is a massive request for liquidation from investors, BNB seems to have a very solid foundation that could sustain its value on the exchange since BNB is the native coin and the utility coin for paying fees on the binance network.All those attributes can not stop binance from going bankruptcy if their witnessed massive attacks from the government or an institution as a clamp down and retaliation attack on Binance.",
