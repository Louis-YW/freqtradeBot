The prominent cryptocurrency lending company was also vocal about its plans to go public.Last March, BlockFi landed a $350 million Series D funding round that boosted its valuation to $3 billion. The acquisition deal is expected to be inked by the end of this week, the report says. Details: https://u.today/ftx-is-buying-fallen-unicorn-blockfi-for-mere-pennies-report",

      "body": "Thats a huge blow to blockfi when this deal materialize. Imagine a $3billion worth company now at a sudden fall off $25million price. Probably FTX seeking the moment to expand by aggresively taking advantage of the market downfall. He wouldnt buy it if he knew that there is no hope on crypto. But this is a good move also for blockfi to save some dollars. By FTX, ptobably they can support it as they are a good business exchange platform that still has a good revenue on trading fees.",

      "body": "It will be a trend when superb whales will play their gamers, kill whales and make such buying on fallen companies like FTX bought BlockFi.It creates panic in short term, during bearish months but it is good for the market in general because it helps to eliminate weak platforms, over leveraging platforms and bad risk-managed ones. It is better for cryptocurrency in long term.FTX is like a liquidator in cryptocurrency industry as I read from news and media. The approach of FTX and RBF are different than CZ and Binance. CZ does not like the idea to rescue bad and fallen projects. He want to let it be, survive or die, it depends on those projects and Binance does not want to release any rescue effort.At least now, it is what Binance and CZ said but they can flip their words later. In the end of business deal, profit is all the things.",

      "body": "That's shit. SBF is doing so well about what step that must be taken. A healthy company like FTX with active revenue can even acquisition more and more dead defi like blockfi. If this will be happening and im sure that if so many platforms will be acquired by the centralized exchange site. Lenders must have learned from what already done by the centralized exchange site, and so far cex is always trying to acquisition more and more dead platforms in the crypto. I just curious how much money owned by cex",

Let's see if it would end up being the case or there are some other information that is undisclosed and has contributed to this development. If we buy coins with a 95% discount on the bear market, then large capital makes similar purchases, buying projects for only 5% of the cost. In both cases, one goal is pursued, making a profit on the bull market. It remains obvious that FTX has more accurate information about the prospects for the revival of BlockFi, otherwise this transaction would not have taken place.",

I have to admit though that i am still pretty doubtful if this deal will really happen. I mean i understand that the bear market has hit a lot of projects in terms of price and valuation but the numbers that are stated here just seem to far off in my opinion.I hardly doubt that BlockFi is now worth only 1/120th of it's value that i had a year ago. This can not be explained by the current bear market or by other normal market movements. I know that Defi-projects took a hard hit after the events of Terra Luna but to lose more than 99% of the value just seems to much.",

Nothing new in the crypto from the big project to be dumped to the bottom and become a garbage project or even bankrupt. that's why crypto is a very high risk investment and place to put your money in but really profitable enough if you can manage it very well. The world is not fine right now. There are so many problems appeared even some countries going to collapse.",

Sam is a very smart guy, this is not a rescue but a takeover. He certainly saw the potential of blockFi, this acquisition will help FTX grow stronger and will be a direct competitor to Binance and coinbase.$25 million is too low a price compared to BlockFi's $4.8 billion valuation in its most recent funding round. IMO, this is a very difficult deal to make at such a low price.",
