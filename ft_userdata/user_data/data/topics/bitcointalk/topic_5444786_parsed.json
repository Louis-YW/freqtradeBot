While reading their 1993 Manifesto, they made lots of promises about maintaining privacy and use of electronic money, which today bitcoin is the electronic money, but its privacy doesn't seem 100 percent guaranteed. Though, in their term they defined privacy as an information the whole world is not meant to know, yet in the world of crypto today almost every huge transaction, bitcoin worth billion, fly around in news blogs and people can detect who sent the money. Like the US government transaction. Aside the centralized firms and KYC, how come bitcoin address are traced, guessed correctly and detected easily who is behind it? What do you think the cypherpunk are doing to keep the privacy of electronic money like bitcoin safe and secure? or are they a different group with different goal?Between their manifesto said lot of useful things that every bitcoiner would want to read. https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html",

What do you think the cypherpunk are doing to keep the privacy of electronic money like bitcoin safe and secure? or are they a different group with different goal?Bitcoin addresses are not easily traced if you know what you are doing.you can use mixers to ensure your privacy.you can use one address per transaction,  so you will have multiple addresses which are not attached to your history .If you are careless about technical aspects of bitcoin and your privacy, you are traceable QuoteBetween their manifesto said lot of useful things that every bitcoiner would want to read. https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.htmlThis \"old\" text from 1993 is still very actual, more than Ever I would say.Those are the best parts I would say:Quote Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. QuoteSince we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. ..... I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself. QuotePrivacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy",

Many of the principles they advocated in their 1993 manifesto continue to be relevant today, and many of them continue to work to develop technologies and protocols that can ensure privacy and security in digital life.There are several techniques that cryptocurrency developers are implementing to improve the privacy of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  For example, \"mixing\" technology allows transactions to be mixed up, making it more difficult to follow the flow of funds.",
