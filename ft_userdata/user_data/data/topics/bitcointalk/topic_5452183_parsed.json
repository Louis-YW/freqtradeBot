However, I have reservations about the way the OP has been writing their messages, as they seem quite sloppy. I also hope that the OP will include links to all the platforms, particularly Twitter, in this thread. Additionally, I would appreciate it if the OP could provide important updates regarding the project in a timely manner.",
