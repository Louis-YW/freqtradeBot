  "content": "Leaked emails: Crypto exchange Coinbase is ‚Äòtemporarily closing‚Äô its US affiliate-marketing programQuote‚ÄúWe regret to inform you that Coinbase will be temporarily closing its affiliate program in the United States with an effective date of Tuesday, July 19th,‚Äù the email said. ‚ÄúThis is not an easy decision, nor was it taken lightly, but due to crypto market conditions and the outlook for the rest of 2022, Coinbase is unable to continue to support incentive traffic on its platform.‚ÄùA long enough rest plan, could this mean another sign of significant decrease in business revenue, active users, or something? Considering this exchange is based in the US which has more potential to get lots of local business partners and new users than any other country as far as their KYC rules are that strict.Let's see waht will happen on July, 19th.QuoteThe change comes at a time when Coinbase is grappling with a crypto crash.On June 14, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced in a blog post that the company was laying off 18% of its workforce, or about 1,100 employees. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Coinbase is now the 14th largest crypto exchange in the world, up from the fourth position a year ago.Prior to this recent affiliate news, Coinbase reduced commission rates for some influencers in June. One creator who was earning $40 per sign up in early 2022 said they saw that amount drop by more than 90% to $2 per sign up.Things are though all over!",

How reliable is the data on their trading volume compared to other exchanges? Especially at CMC or other ranking websites you can often find exchanges with unbelievably high volumes in the top places - whether these volumes are all real I dare to doubt.But of course, that doesn't hide the fact that Coinbase is having massive problems in the current bearish market environment. The Coinbase stock price has also fallen sharply during the past months. Since the IPO in April 2021, we are down more than -81%. Yikes...Source: Google Coinbase Stock overview",

Oh, fewer youtube videos of guys posing with scared, laughing, shouting faces and stupid graphs, making 30 minutes videos of nothing just to cram more adverts and telling you 100 times to like hit subscribe, and use their ref links to support the channel in my recommendation feed?What could be better?¬† Besides, from Coinbase's point of view, why pay those guys 40$ when right now, I doubt even newbies who have barely heard of cryptos know about Coinbase already, one google search does more than 1000 \"influencers\".The clear example is this article itself, which is a rewrite of the original at https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-temporarily-shutting-down-us-affiliate-marketing-program-for-influencers-2022-7but...QuoteCoinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.vs:QuoteIn response to request for comment about the affiliate marketing program, a Coinbase spokesperson wrote in an email:\"As shared in our Q1 Shareholder Letter, the majority of our marketing spend is oriented towards performance marketing. Affiliate marketing is one of many supplemental levers we employ to reach target audiences, and the temporary pause of the program is in no way indicative of a liquidity problem. As a publicly traded company, our strong balance sheet is transparent to the public. We look forward to working with many of our incredible partners and web3 creators in the future.\"So do we need latestfinance.news¬† at all?",

All information about Binance should be taken with a pinch of salt on CMC. Also, in my opinion, far too little is done against wash/fake trading on many exchanges when reporting volumes. Some exchanges with only a few users have gigantic trading volumes that can hardly ever be real.",

As a matter of fact, not only was the company forced to lay off some 1,100 of its workers, it also revoked job agreements.",
