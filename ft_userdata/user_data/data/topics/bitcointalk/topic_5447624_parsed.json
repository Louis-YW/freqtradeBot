Just follow your decision.The second thing is that you should not use high leverage. This is what makes many traders to continue to lose. I have used high leverage before and the result is panic of liquidation and losses. Be patient, do not see trading as a job, but see it as something you can do without if talking about your financial life.Always know that it is better to make a single trade within few time and gain than to make multiple trades and lose. Use the amount of money that you can afford to lose is also very important.Like I said before, do not alter the strategy you are using because of emotion.",

Develop a trading plan with specific goals, entry and exit points, and risk management strategies based on sound analysis, and follow it strictly. A stop-loss order can help limit losses by automatically closing out a trade at a certain price level. Taking a break when feeling stressed and overwhelmed can help clear your mind before making decisions. It's also helpful to manage your emotions by practicing mindfulness techniques like breathing exercises or meditation. Remember that emotions are normal, but keeping them in check is crucial for successful trading.",

      "body": "The best way for everyone may be different in controlling emotions when trading.but based on my personal experience, the best way so that we can better control our emotions in trading activities is by making careful preparations before starting the trading activity itself and before deciding which coin to enter as our trading target. careful preparation means you have made a thorough analysis (technically and fundamentally). You have also analyzed the trends in the market by carrying out sentimental analysis (you can help by using several indicators made specifically for sentimental analysis of the market as a whole ex. Feer & Greed indicators). after doing the analysis then you prepare your trading plan. such as determining at which point you will start entering, and at which point you will exit. and what is the ratio of losses that you are prepared to bear. after that run according to plan. while keeping track of news and anything related to the coin you are currently entering. because technical analysis can be inaccurate if it is influenced by news that affects market sentiment.in conclusion. you have to know where you stand. you enter the trade with careful preparation and planning. and you stick to the plan that has been made. but this is only for short and medium term trading.for the long term I think we just have to know the fundamentals of a coin properly. and we go in and keep it cool. don't look too often at chart movements in small time frames if you are in a position as a long-term investor. because it can affect your psychology. and you become easily panicked and lose control of your emotions. if it's long term. then look at the chart display in the 4-hour timeframe, daily, weekly and monthly.this is just my experience. and everyone has different experiences and discoveries. so please do your own analysis. and one more thing, namely a strong mentality in trading will form stronger the longer you trade. because after a few years we will start to get used to all kinds of habits that occur in the market. and we become more sensitive to determine when to enter and when to leave.",

Develop a Trading Plan: Creating a trading plan and sticking to it can help you stay disciplined and reduce emotional decision-making. Your trading plan should include entry and exit strategies, risk management guidelines, and a clear understanding of your investment goals.Set Realistic Expectations: Setting realistic expectations can help you avoid frustration and anxiety, which can lead to emotional decision-making. Accepting that losses are a part of the trading process can help you focus on long-term goals instead of short-term gains.Use Stop Losses: Stop losses can help you limit losses and reduce the emotional impact of losing trades. Setting stop losses at the right level can help you avoid the temptation to hold onto losing positions, which can lead to greater losses.Take Breaks: Taking breaks can help you clear your mind and reduce stress. It's important to take regular breaks and avoid trading when you're feeling overwhelmed or emotional.Practice Mindfulness: Practicing mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or visualization can help you stay focused and calm while trading. These techniques can also help you stay present in the moment and avoid getting caught up in past losses or future gains.as emotions are a natural part of the trading process, and it's impossible to eliminate them entirely. However, by implementing these strategies, I am assuming you can learn to manage your emotions and make better trading decisions. Thank you for my trading mates given this idea previously.stop using AI to write a post for you.",

The important point is to regularly examine your mistakes and decide how you can improve your plan because, without it, you will regularly get disappointed.Experience is a factor, but I don't believe it's the only thing that can be used to overcome emotion in trading. Another thing to keep in check is greed. Some people become so greedy that they want to make a whole lot of profit in one trade by increasing their leverage. Some want to archive a three-day profit in one day, increasing the risk of losing their asset. In a normal state, they can gradually trade with low leverage and accumulate little profit on a daily basis, but if greed comes into play, they incur more risk that will cause loss. So a trader should not also get too greedy because when they become greedy and incur losses, they may want to recover them out of emotion and end up with more losses.just as Oshosondy has stated. I believe a trader can be led by greed  towards increasing their leaverage.QuoteThe second thing is that you should not use high leverage. This is what makes many traders to continue to lose.

When you drive the car for the first time, you are nervous, and you may even fail to make it work because of the tension, but when you get used to driving the car, you will be able to operate it without the slightest effort.Therefore, trading and continuing with it is what makes your feelings distant, or at least reduces their impact. Either reading a book, listening to advice, or trying modeling and other methods will only increase your fear of losing. This fear makes your feelings control you in trading.To take away what I said:Start now, and do not think about reading a book or watching a video that talks about the impact of feelings.Do not invest more than you can lose.Keep learning and investing, whatever your losses.",

So, the answer to your question is your experience. The more you get experience in trading, you become easier to control emotions.However, experience a lot of time in trading won't automatically make you have good control over emotions.
