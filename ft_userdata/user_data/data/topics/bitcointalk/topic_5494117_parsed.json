Your logic is flawed on so many levels. First off, natural selection has nothing to do with the stock or cryptocurrency markets. It applies to biological evolution, not financial markets.

Second, Bitcoin is not a \"closed system\", anyone can get in and out of \"the system\" whenever they want.

How can those who bought bitcoin be winners? What did they win? If you are talking about the markets, the only way to win is to sell the asset at a higher price than the price you bought it for. But according to your definition, those who sell are losers, so you contradict yourself.Quote from: virtual_enthusiasm on April 24, 2024, 09:26:24 PMNatural selection removes losers from the systemNot always. There are countless studies that have confirmed that in the evolution of species, the best features do not always win.Quote from: virtual_enthusiasm on April 24, 2024, 09:26:24 PMIf bitcoin is a closed system it uses natural selection, and then it will have more winners than losers, so the price will go up foreverBitcoin market is not a closed system. It interacts with traditional finance and other cryptocurrencies, new bitcoins are constantly mined, and people can enter and exit the market with fiat currency. This continuous flow makes Bitcoin an open system, not a closed one. But maybe you are confusing the concept of a closed system for a zero-sum aspect within Bitcoin market. Those are completely different things.By the way, learn how to quote correctly.",

Op literally doesn't know anything about how Bitcoin works and what it is. Bitcoin has never been a closed system and before any changes are made, it needs the approval of the community or developers before they are implemented. It's an open system where everyone can participate. If you are referring to its total supply of 21million then I'll agree with you because that's actually a closed supply. but not it's whole system being closed.Quote from: virtual_enthusiasm on April 24, 2024, 09:26:24 PMDo you agree with me that those who sell bitcoin are losers, and those who buy and keep bitcoin are winners? No I don't. As an investor, you chose how and what you get to do with your coins. I don't see how selling some coins makes anyone a looser because that's how Bitcoin is circulated through networking. People have to sell for others to buy and invest as well. I guess you need to understand basic economics abit mate. When new coins are mined, miners supplies them into the market by selling. Do we now call them losers? You should learn to quote properly. Read this thread [TIPS] to avoid pyramid quotes (for Newbies)",

'Natural selection' means that nature has the ability to make choices.Scientists can't easily come up with ways to imitate nature.

The basics of the encryption used was developed in WW2. Yet it wasn't until 1990 that PGP was developed... and 2009 until Bitcoin was launched.The point is, 'natural selection' is a moronic term that only indicates that nature is way smarter than science. It doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin. Or does somebody think that if Russia detonates a nuke, causing a EMP wave that destroys Bitcoin and banking because the grid went down... does somebody think that that is natural selection, because both of those systems didn't survive?",
