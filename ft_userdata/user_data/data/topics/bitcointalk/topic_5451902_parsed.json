  "content": "The transaction fee on Bitcoin is increasing day by day. It cost now 14$ for a low-priority transaction to 17$ for high priority transaction. I was planning to make a deposit today on my casino account until I notice the high fee on my electrum sent tab. The fee is almost 5% of my total bankroll that I was supposed to deposit. I decided to rest for now since I will be down immediately by 5% for a transaction that I don't know when will gonna be confirmed.Is anyone still playing today with this high fee? I think those gamblers that leave funds in the casino are very happy that they didn't need to experience this fee drama.",

For a transaction of 12mBtc finally paid 0.02385mBtc as fee. For the same transaction one month back on the same day I've paid 0.00565mBtc. This shows there is almost 5x raise in the transaction fee. Initially I tried with similar fee(0.00565mBTC) and slowly kept increasing and transaction got confirmed only after 0.02385mBtc fee.",

If I wanted to, I could easily deposit USDT on the Binance chain and continue with my bets, but for now, I'm on pause while I figure out something else.And the same is true for withdrawals; I saw a thread today about a user claiming that his withdrawal had not yet been received after having requested it for a couple of hours. Now that the cost is so high, it's best to deposit and withdraw using stable currency, but if you're willing to wait a day or more before placing your wager, you can stick using bitcoin.",

Also conversely, withdrawing bitcoins will take longer if the casino does not change the withdrawal rates to adjust the priority fee level, so in certain cases gamblers will start accusing the casino of being guilty of ignorance of network conditions.",

I think those gamblers that leave funds in the casino are very happy that they didn't need to experience this fee drama.The fees are quite high at the moment, but so is the Bitcoin price. 1 BTC is around 28k USD again which a 70% increase in 2023 alone. Comparing to what the price was last year and where we likely bought our coins the fee is not that high. I am still gambling on crypto casinos, but prefer to not deposit money with Bitcoins anymore. Since the bear market 1.5 years ago I try to avoid spending any Bitcoins because the price is too low. For me the best way is to deposit money with fiat currency and then withdraw any winnings in Bitcoin. Like that I can grow my crypto portfolio over time and don't need to buy coins on an exchange. To a certain extent I would also leave some funds at the casino, as long as its below 200 USD I would not withdraw the money instantly, only for bigger wins I would take the high fee to save some of my winnings. The risk of leaving all the money at the casinos is that we gamble more and with higher bet sizes to eventually lose all our previous winnings again. Better to pay a small fee and save some money long term.",

I haven't checked what the transaction fees are for today but I guess if the transaction fees increase sharply, we can use other coins to deposit into our account.By using other coins, I think it can make it easier for us to avoid the current high transaction fees. And if I had to use another coin, I guess TRX, BNB or USDT based on TRX would be an option. Or we can also use Doge as the coin choice.The last time I deposited, my BTC was through a personal wallet to an exchange site where I had to pay >$3. Usually, I only pay under $1 or $2. And that's still within normal limits, in my opinion.",

      "body": "Changing it to another coin besides Bitcoin is the best option right now, especially if we really feel like want to gamble and also the casino where we play gives lots of options in deposits, so that's not an obstacle at all to keep playing. Ethereum is lower in transaction fees nowadays than Bitcoin but still not much fun for the little gambler perhaps dogecoin is an alternative and also XRP if it is available in the casino we play at. What might be a concern for us as players is that when the casino increases the withdrawal fee it will reduce our profits because even though there are gamblers who still have funds at the casino, if the casino implements this because transaction costs don't improve, the player's profits can decrease due to increased fees, but hopefully the casinos don't implement this and the transaction density on the Bitcoin network isn't as dense as it is now.",

I think those gamblers that leave funds in the casino are very happy that they didn't need to experience this fee drama.For this reason, there are many choices provided by casinos and one of them gives gamblers the desire to continue to be able to play at a low cost. I think we just need to really take other, much more affordable options. The current fee has become a ubiquitous complaint both at casinos and at centralized exchanges such as Binance which temporarily suspended BTC withdrawals. As a bit of a gambler, I don't care about this, as other networks stay within reach. What's more, to be honest, I have never used Bitcoin for gambling. As for gamblers who already have a balance at the casino in the form of BTC, then like it or not, if you really want to withdraw it, you have to be able to maximize your winnings or wait while taking other deposit options.",

I think those gamblers that leave funds in the casino are very happy that they didn't need to experience this fee drama.I could imagine this will be highly damaging for Bitcoin and has identified a substantial weakness in cryptocurrency designed this way in general. The only way that crypto can compete with fiat currency is if transaction fees stay somewhat low and competitive with fiat payment processors, people might be willing to spend 5% to have this decentralized option but not 15-20% over. It's a shame that the pointless NFT's are yet again ruining the day and wasting peoples money, even those cannot be sustainable at these prices. I wonder if the network will be able to improve or they will stop filling up the blockchain with this garbage, maybe the developers need to step in with a solution to discourage it.",

I can gamble just fine as long as I don't want to deposit or withdraw I think. I heard even Binance stopped bitcoin withdrawals and that's quite alarming. If the devs don't fix this soon then bitcoin may even lose its #1 seat to some other coin. Fuck NFT's. They should just scrap it away. I don't know who came up with the ordinals idea but he ruined bitcoin with that move. Just remove it and bitcoin will be the king again.",
