  "content": "Upon entering the crypto market in 2017, I dismissed BTC due to criticisms about its technological limitations. Its transaction speed, capped at 3-7 tps, was deemed insufficient to support the needs of a global user base. The rise of DeFi in 2020 further solidified my belief in altcoins as the future, leading me to believe BTC would eventually become obsolete. I diversified my portfolio with various altcoins, realizing modest gains upon selling them early in 2022.2024 was a year of BTC dominance, with a bitseason fueled by corporate accumulation. The anticipated altcoin season failed to materialize. However, my disciplined DCA into Bitcoin throughout 2023 paid off when I realized a 100% profit at its peak of 100K USD in December 2024. This experience has significantly impacted my investment psychology. Securing profits from BTC has instilled a sense of security and reduced the anxiety associated with short-term altcoin volatility. I can now maintain my long-term holdings in both BTC and altcoins with greater composure, confident in my ability to weather market fluctuations and capitalize on the ongoing uptrend.The crypto market's subdued performance in 2024 has left many altcoin investors feeling disillusioned. The anticipated DeFi-GameFi summer failed to materialize, and with top coins like ETH and XRP languishing below their ATH, the prospect of a broader altcoin season seems increasingly remote. This has led to a wave of skepticism, with investors questioning the long-term value of altcoins and regretting missed opportunities in BTC.While BTC's dominance within the crypto market may fluctuate and its performance isn't guaranteed, it undeniably plays a crucial role in maintaining investor composure and facilitating sound decision-making, particularly during volatile periods. Disregarding BTC entirely could prove detrimental for long-term investors. Recognizing this, I've strategically allocated 50% of my capital towards a DCA strategy for BTC, anticipating the crypto winter of 2026-2027. This approach mirrors my successful investment strategy during the previous crypto cycle, and I am confident in its potential to yield substantial returns again.I would like to know your opinion on this issue:Do you have BTC in your account?Have you ever doubted the value and future of BTC?Will you continue to invest in BTC in the next season?",

I would like to know your opinion on this issue:Do you have BTC in your account?Have you ever doubted the value and future of BTC?Will you continue to invest in BTC in the next season?Yes, you are absolutely right, as disregarding Bitcoin entirely will actually prove detrimental for long-term investors, as a digital currency that have always been known to have positive impact in a long run, despite it's fluctuating market nature. Because one thing investors fall to understand is that just as altcoins has a high volatile nature to produce profit within a short timeframe, so do they also stand the chance of risking their money of losing it all still within that same short timeframe, and as such, Bitcoin remains the Bitcoin for a steady and gradual long term profit over your desired investment. So on the contrary as regards to the question you just asked, I will say that I actually do own some Bitcoin in my wallet, and I have never for once doubted it's existence, even during a bear market. And it will remain my number one asset for long term investment.",

We own the keys that allow to sign a transaction Of course most of us have always doubted about the value of bitcoin. People have seen dramatic change in value during these years. It's really hard nowadays \"understand\" the real value since FIAT has less and loss of power purchase.Personally I don't like the term \"investing\" in bitcoin. If you will save FIAT are you investing in FIAT?",

Bitcoin has less volatility than altcoins and in survival strength, it is stronger than altcoins. I can understand your implication but fact is altcoin investors will convert their capital back to altcoins when storm disappears.Those people don't have any strong belief in Bitcoin and don't want to hold bitcoin for a long time as they basically love or addict altcoins.",

      "body": "Alternative cryptocurrencies have previously served two functions. First, they served as experimental labs for testing software, financial and social technologies that could later be potentially implemented into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Second, they served to increase the number of Bitcoin coins in a given investorâ€™s hands (through trading). However, Bitcoin is more valuable than alternative cryptocurrencies because Bitcoin is primary and alternative cryptocurrencies are secondary. With the creation of spot ETFs and other financial instruments that have closely linked Bitcoin to the world of fiat money, alternative cryptocurrencies have (arguably) lost their former relevance. After all, spot ETFs are direct competitors to traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. The advent of ETFs has changed the rules of the game in the crypto industry in many ways.In my opinion, buying Bitcoin is a smart strategy.",

Still, you'll need to understand the market and be lucky enough to know which coin will provide you with that, and even if you make that, you must have lost so much on other memes to the extent that if you calculated how much you've lost, the profit you made would not look like much. Memes are a place where the rich have a bigger chance of winning because they have a lot of money to buy a coin they want and hope they get profit from like 4 or 5.I don't think there's a difference between that and gambling.",

No two ways about it. You buy a coin and hope it gives you enough profit. If it doesn't, you just keep believing you'll get that coin that will take you out of poverty. There's no difference between that and gambling. I don't mind if people invest in memes, but I would very much appreciate it if they treated it like they treat gambling. There is always that feeling that if you don't buy the next coin you're seeing you could miss out and funny enough when you can buy that coin and sell it before it pumps. Maybe there is a technical analysis when it comes to meems but most people I've seen that are into memes are just gambling. With bitcoin, you just have to be patient enough if you're not a trader.",
