Do you guys believe we can request such a feature from some wallet providers, and do you think they may consider it?Such a feature is possible, but completely meaningless. Allow me to explain.Your wallet contains your private keys, derived from your seed phrase. If your seed phrase or your private keys are leaked, they usually aren't leaked because someone else opened your wallet file, but because your seed phrase was stored insecurely, or there was some malware on your computer that accessed your private keys when you unlocked your wallet, or you imported your seed phrase/private keys in to another less secure wallet or an outright malicious wallet, or you entered your seed phrase/private keys on to a website, and so on. In these cases, any feature which shows the last time you opened your wallet would be completely meaningless and provide only a false sense of security. It would only show the times you had accessed your wallet (which you obviously know about), and would not be able to tell you that your seed phrase/private keys had leaked via other methods.If you leaked your seed phrase via malware and I had access to it, for example, I could import it to a copy of Electrum on my computer and open your wallet. I could then do anything I wanted, from simply waiting for you to deposit more, to sweeping all your funds at any time. The whole time I have access to your wallet, your local copy of Electrum will happily show you that no one else is logging in to your local copy of Electrum, and it is completely impossible for it to know anything about my copy of Electrum which is also accessing your wallet.",

You have already been told that if this is possible, all it will give you is a sense of false security, so why don't you ask more about the things that can give you real security of your funds. You cannot know if your seed phrase or private keys has been used to import your wallet into another device, and Electrum or any other wallet cannot help you with that, whoever has the seed phrase and can prove ownership of the funds through the keys is considered the 'owner' of the funds.Forget about whatever will give you a false sense of security and buy a hardware wallet or run your Electrum wallet on an air-gapped device, you should also make backups of your seed phrase in more than one secure location. To add more security, you should add a passphrase and have a backup of it in a different location from your seed phrase, or use a multi-sig set up if you know how to do it.",

But it would be great if Electrum could detect how many devices are connected to the same wallet. It seems that you do not have a good understanding of how the Electrum wallet, or cryptocurrencies in general, work.Think of your Electrum wallet as the front door of your house, and you have installed a fancy, state-of-the-art electronic lock or alarm system to secure it. Now, if a burglar manages to get into your house through the back door or an open window, would you really blame the electronic lock on the front door? It is kind of the same with cryptocurrencies – the wallet provides security for what it is responsible for, but there are other factors that can come into play when it comes to overall security.The first thing you need to understand is that your funds are not actually in your Electrum wallet but on the blockchain. The blockchain is public and accessible to everyone, but the only way to access your coins is with a private key. The Electrum wallet provides you access to manage your coins because it keeps the private keys saved and secured on your device. However, the Electrum wallet has no way of knowing if someone else has access to the same private keys and whether your wallet has already been compromised. For example, you wrote down the backup seed phrase on paper when creating the wallet, right? How will your Electrum wallet know if you intentionally or unintentionally exposed the seed to third parties?",

If Electrum cannot detect how many devices are connected to this wallet and when this account was accessed last, then I have nothing to say.You are fundamentally misunderstanding how bitcoin works.Electrum does not \"connect\" to a wallet. Indeed, there are no wallets to connect to at all (outside of centralized exchanges in which someone else is holding your coins for you, but even then you are simply connecting to this third party and not to some wallet on the blockchain). Your wallet is simply a collection of your private keys. Your private keys are used to unlock certain addresses and allow you to move the bitcoin on those addresses. The bitcoin itself is not in your wallet - it is on the blockchain. All you have on your computer is a collection of private keys.Now, if I've managed to access your seed phrase, then I can regenerate those exact same private keys and have them on my computer. How could your computer possibly know if my computer, or if any other computer in the entire world, also holds those same private keys? Think of it like this: You've created an encrypted file which is storing some sensitive data. You set up an alert on your computer to notify you every time that file is decrypted, so you know if anyone else is opening it. However, I plant some malware on your computer which copies this file and sends it to me. I can now decrypt it and open it on my computer, read all the contents, and your alert system would be none the wiser.Quote from: Shishir99 on July 29, 2023, 05:36:38 PMSuppose my wallet is already compromised for whatever reason, but it does not have a balance. The hacker will wait until a new deposit comes up.Correct. The solution to this is to have good security in the first place, usually by using a hardware wallet or an airgapped device. If you are ever concerned your wallets might be compromised, then set up new secure wallets and transfer all your funds.Quote from: Shishir99 on July 29, 2023, 05:36:38 PMIf I can check that my wallet was logged in from another device or, say, from a different IP, I simply won't deposit to this wallet, and I will be able to escape the hacker.As explained, this is not possible because there is no wallet to log in to in the first place.

So, assuming you do not fully trust your current device (PC, smartphone, etc.) and want to take a step further to secure your wallet, it is best to follow hosseinimr93's suggestion and create your new wallet on an air-gapped device.Probably the simplest method is to download a copy of Tails portable OS from the official source, prepare a freshly formatted USB drive, and create a bootable version on it. Turn off your computer, disconnect it from the Internet, and start the Tails OS from the USB drive. Electrum wallet comes already pre-installed and you can proceed with creating your new wallet. Write the backup seed phrase on a piece of paper that you will keep in a safe place and copy the xPub key to a USB that you will later use on your live device (PC or mobile) to create a watch-only wallet. This way, you can be pretty sure that your new wallet won't be compromised, as long as the backup seed is safe and protected from access by anyone but you. This type of wallet is good for long-term hodl, assuming you are not ready to invest in buying a hardware wallet.",
