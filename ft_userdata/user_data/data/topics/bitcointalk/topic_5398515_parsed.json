Sure, it will most probably stifle adoption, but one of the main points of bitcoin is to not give a crap about regulations.",

      "body": "I mean, Know Your Customer (KYC) is increasing whether we use cryptocurrencies or not. That's the reality of it all. There's definitely ways of avoiding KYC though, most peer to peer exchanges don't require KYC. The reason the government are pushing for KYC is because they require the company themselves not you as the customer to know who they are dealing with, and whether their funds could have been used for malicious reasons. Cryptocurrencies can depending on their features complicate that detection. Although, I don't believe Bitcoin is one, it's the more privacy oriented cryptocurrencies which aren't traceable are the ones with pretty problematic features for companies, and the government. Any exchange whatever the currency will require KYC. This is likely to keep increasing in the following years, and while that definitely is a cause of concern, using Bitcoin or not isn't really going to stop it. These companies require it to operate under government laws. Although, like I said peer to peer exchanges seem to be the go to for people looking to buy Bitcoin, and that could be an alternative. Obviously, check your laws on peer to peer to avoid any issues.",

We don't live in a vacuum just because we are dealing with cryptocurrency...a sad reality that all of us got to deal with in manners we can. We can only hope that restrictive KYC will not be the way into the future and that the government will also be listening to the industry as a partner and a big source of tax revenues they badly need.",

Of course not, but at the same time I knew it was a matter of time.Actually, they just want to put regulations on bitcoin in order to implement its technology in the current monetary system. It is hard to integrate centralization and decentralization without forcing people to follow some rules. That is what the government do, try to govern everything It is your choice to choose a KYC exchange or not. If you know the risk of losing private information, why do you still choose KYC or CEX?",

Currently, crypto users in several countries are required to pay their taxes. Regulations regarding income tax from work in crypto are very intense. Special regulations came into effect. Like it or not, we also have to comply with government regulations, KYC is only a small part of the regulations made. Major exchanges enforce KYC to know their users and this is also a target for the central government.",

The people who actually hold the power in this situation are governments and central bank staff, who are meant to be looking out for the best interests of all their citizens - not just a few who might follow crypto. If a government is being proactive then they need to know all the money moving into and out of a country, if for no other reason than to identify threats, so KYC will only get more common in future.",

Most of the investments certainly require KYC and at the same time one must understand that if a coin becomes popular they would ofcourse implement the same rules that have been implemented on bitcoins as a whole and you would be on a new forum discussing the same thing. The fact is in some cases it's inevitable but it's not hard to not provide your identity! Until and unless you are doing something super illegal which you are afraid might come in the lime light you shouldn't think much about it. Other than that using hardware wallets, paper wallet, using things like : samourai are still your best bets. No investment is going to show that much growth potential and that's a fact.",

At first everyone was on the resistant, and others says the same too, crypto will die. But it is already 2022 and we are still standing. So that argument is flawed already.Definitely you have total control of your wealth, regardless if you hedge it to crypto or not. It's totally up to you, if you want to exit because of heavy crypto regulation then so be it.",

They're not going to stay with that free tier(no KYC) forever as the government might push them to require kyc to all of their customers, old and new.That's the same as Binance, they've got that free tier for a long time and when they've taken the attention of the regulators, they have to implement kyc to all of their customers.",
