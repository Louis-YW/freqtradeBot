Besides, web wallets aren't recommended for storing your coins anyway. As for Binance, it's an exchange, not a wallet. Are you actually looking for an exchange that accepts BTCP deposits? As far as I know, there are only two such exchanges:BitxOnexhttps://www.bitxonex.com/market/btcpusdtandXeggeXhttps://xeggex.com/market/BTCP_USDT",

Why are you still stuck with that project? It's pretty much dead according to some members, so I doubt if the developer or developers would be working on making the coin is accepted by many more wallet service. If you look at their GitHub, all activity was there 2 months ago and that was probably when the so-called coin was launched. After that, nothing at all. If the owners can abandon the coin, then why not you?
