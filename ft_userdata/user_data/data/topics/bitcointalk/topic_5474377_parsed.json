  "content": "Dear users and friends,We are writing to inform you of the status of Betnomi and our commitment to fully refunding all user balances.In June, we faced significant internal challenges related to the company's long-term financial outlook and ownership structure. To address these issues, we temporarily suspended operations and initiated a restructuring process with a focus on long-term profitability. During this time, it became clear that continuing to work with the existing owners was no longer viable, and we terminated the partnership.Unfortunately, following this decision, certain individuals engaged in backroom deals to extract Betnomi's intellectual property and resources for the purpose of launching a new casino independently. These actions resulted in significant damage to Betnomi and its users. Critical system resources were restricted, and the database became inaccessible, preventing users from withdrawing their balances.We have since learned that our database was compromised and potentially sold to another casino platform that falsely claimed Betnomi had rebranded. We are pursuing legal action against this entity.Fortunately, we have successfully retrieved a backup of our database and are working with regulators to develop a plan for fully refunding all users. This plan will be announced in the coming days.Due to several legal actions that are pending against those who stole our intellectual property and those who wrongfully gained access to our systems and falsely claimed to be associated with us. The outcome and duration of these cases are uncertain. Therefore, we have decided to permanently cease operations and stop using the Betnomi brand in our best interests.Over the past two years, we have developed our own casino software, risk management engine, and other valuable intellectual property worth millions of dollars. We intend to leverage this expertise to rebuild a stronger brand in the future.We will provide an update on our reimbursement plan and schedule as soon as possible.Thank you for your understanding.Quote from: betnomi on November 21, 2023, 06:11:49 PMBetnomi Refund Plan As announced a few days ago, it is our primary duty and responsibility to ensure that every user on our platform receives a complete refund. We are now progressing to the next phase of our refund process by opening a 30-day window. During this period, any user with a balance on our platform can initiate a withdrawal request.Please be aware that after this 30-day withdrawal window, we will not be processing any further withdrawal requests.Our objective is to facilitate a swift and seamless withdrawal process. Although we anticipate some users may attempt to submit fraudulent withdrawal requests, we assure you that we will meticulously verify all information before processing any requests. We strongly advise against wasting time on submitting fictitious claims.Refund requests from users whose accounts have been closed or suspended due to fraudulent activities before the cessation of operations will not be processed. We have already identified and flagged such accounts.Apart from these cases, we are ready to accept and process refund requests. Kindly send an email to refund@betnomi.com with the following details:Code:1. First name, Last name (if you are KYC verified)2. Username (request will be ignored if the username does not exist)3. Email address (request will be ignored if the email does not match)4. Refund Amount (approximate balance is acceptable)5. Wallet address (we will process only in the cryptocurrency you have)Our aim is to responsibly refund our users and ensure a secure process.Thank you all for your cooperation.",

Something a right thing that must done and this is really a good news into those Betnomi users out there. Is the amount will really be fully 100% refunded or would really be just getting a partial?@Betnomi, just like on what similar question above, do you have plans on making some comeback into this market? Why you havent made out that immediateannouncement about on what happened? This would really might be taking a long legal procedure knowing that there are really those entities involved specially on stole something. Good news that you have getting it back.Now the best thing is to gradually resolved problems and build up again the trust and confidence once everything been solved or sort out.",

      "body": "It's genuinely a good news for many players who couldn't withdraw their funds after the casino closed suddenly and without notice. I was playing in the casino days before it stopped and fortunately, I didn't leave any funds there. However I can imagine how challenging and stressing it is for players who left big sums of money and thought they will never recover them.On the other hand, I must say that Betnomi team and casino will never regain trust and its reputation. The significant mistake made was not informing anyone before this disappearance, leaving us in the dark for months until now. Personally, I wouldn't trust you again even after players are refunded.",

This doesn't happen all the time, as some casinos could just quit their old name, forget their responsibility to refund, and just start a new one. But this action is quite commendable, trying to redeem yourself by keeping your casino's name. If you pass all this, you'll gain back your reputation, so good luck, and hopefully, everything will go well as plan.",

It may not be easy and quick but you just do the right thing to clear your reputation and retain it back.",

The imbroglio going on with the casino is not a new thing though but I think the  team failed to see it and get themselves prepared for it and it took the unawares to the point of costing them their names and reputation. I pray they resolve quickly and the court case not extend too much longer so they can make reimbursement to account holders of the casino and start a new process of restructuring as they have promised.",

But also make sure you will not ask more conditions before legitimate users can withdraw their funds since it might dismay them.Also guys since there's a refund plan for Betnomi users just be careful to those email claiming that they would refund you and ask some payment or try to ask your wallet information especially your private key since this is total scam. This happen for so many platform especially if they release a statement regarding on refund process that's why you should be aware of upcoming attempts of people who want to take advantage of situation.And always look for news on legitimate Betnomi representative and don't go anywhere else.",

But we commend what's let of the original owner and then come back here to address all the issues and trying to cleanup everything because they don't have no intentions to scam our community. So we will wait for your further updates and hopefully for those who still have money on this platform, regardless of how big or small it is, should be refunded. And in the beginning, they have established their reputation here as they have a good campaign. But with the issues, I guess it will take a hit. But hopefully, if you have settled everything, the red tag will be removed and you might get your name here.",

So hopefully there's no same issue will happen after the refund process done.Now its up to the old Betnomi gambler if they can still able to gamble since what they go thru is not so easy especially for those person who have huge balance left since imagine the emotional stress bought up by getting scam then for sure they would doubt to spend a lot of money on their new platform again. But not its up for them to prove how good their intention to launch a new platform since if gamblers could able to see some great changes especially to the management who manage it for sure there trust will slowly go back and participate on anything what OP or his team can offer.",
