  "content": "OverviewE-commerce software that operates in multisig mode. What we have:* zpub key of the vendor selling through our software* bech32 address public key of the buyer* descriptor wallet we run with bitcoin coreScenario1. Generate a new address in our descriptor wallet - order_01_address, and get its public key: order_01_pubkey2. Generate new public key from the vendor's zpub. Get its public key: vendor_pubkey3. Use the pub key provided by the buyer - buyer_pubkey4. Now we have three public keys and we create a 2-of-3 multisig address from them - order_01_ms:1st. order_01_pubkey2nd. vendor_pubkey3rd. buyer_pubkey5. Fund the multisig address.6. Create a partially-signed PSBT transaction to distribute the coins from the multisig address to the parties - us to take the commission, and the vendor OR the buyer OR both depending on the success of the order resolution. The transaction must be signed by the wallet (remember it was our wallet that generated order_01_address and order_01_pubkey, so it must be able to sign (that's what we assume).Step 6 is where we are stuck.ProblemWe cannot find the right way to generate a PSBT that is already signed by the descriptor wallet that bitcoin core manages.Whatever we try, we end up with a PSBT that is not signed.How should it be done? What bitcoin core command to run, what input data to supply to it?Other infoBitcoin Core Version: 24.0.1Calling through RPC",
