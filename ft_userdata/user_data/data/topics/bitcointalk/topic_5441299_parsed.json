I have noticed several times when a person was winning more than the usual in poker, i usually approach that person after he left the table what was his secret for those wins, i was literally surprised because 7 of 10 people whom i have asked answered they play gambling trying not to win but to have fun after a long tiring week of work or business. Does anyone of you thought that playing for fun helps you think better and win with less effort especially in poker than having the mindset of trying to win? Because when you are trying your hard to win, it will make you overthink and that your mental state will get stressed out. I think this will work for both land base and online casinos.",

Play for fun can be different too, some people can say they are playing for fun and also fun to spend high amount of money on gambling, that is a false sense of fun, it is not fun but addiction or irresponsible gambling.Be it playing for fun or playing for anything, what is most important is to never go beyond your gambling budget, which means you have control over it.",

On the other hand, if you want to play to win every games, you will get tensed up with every loss. That will result in more mistakes also and thus you will loose more. Moreover, you will not be able to enjoy the game as well which should be the primary aim to visit these gambling sites. You should be there to have fun. If you make some profit there, consider it as a bonus.",

It's all about suggestions, so even if you gamble with the aim of having fun, it doesn't guarantee that you will get a profit. I believe the person you are asking does not represent the context of winning but rather controlling gambling which encourages one not to be addicted. With the aim of having fun, winning or losing will make you freer, there is no pressure and you don't demand anything because from the start you are prepared for the risk of losing.",

Whatever results they get, that's what they will bring home and maybe after leaving the casino, they will forget what they experienced at the gambling table. That's how we should treat gambling so that if we lose, it doesn't become a burden for us, especially if our goal is just to have fun and spend time hanging out with friends while playing gambling.It will work for both land and online casinos and depends on how we react to it because if we only want to find victory from gambling, it will be difficult to get. After all, we might experience big losses. We should enjoy our time to gamble and not chase victory. After all, who knows, we might even win a few dollars.",

But since it is my hard-earned money I am wagering, I need to have some sense of winning. Gambling is both entertainment and serious business for me.Usually, I visit a brick-and-mortar casino with friends. We drink, we eat, we catch up, and we play games. This is the fun part of it. We just soak ourselves up in the environment, the ambience, the laughter, etc. A similar thing goes for when I visit online casinos. I may play a slot theme that resembles a movie I've seen in the past or something I feel remotely connected to. I try to enjoy the graphics, the sound, and many more. I have been fortunate to have some winnings and encounter losses as well. All in all, I do my best to gamble responsibly, which is always the best way to have fun.",

I think this will work for both land base and online casinos. As far as I know, the game of poker is one of the most ideal gambling bets that many gamblers enjoy doing, whether on the online website or in a land casino, Poker is also a place of entertainment, because poker can train bettors themselves in setting strategies to determine loses and wins.Winning and losing at the poker table is largely determined by the players themselves, I often see poker bettors who often win, these people look very relaxed, they don't show mentality and stress to opponents, this can make it easy for your opponent to read expressions or in other words you can read facial expressions, if your opponent understands psychology, for this reason we often see people who are relaxed at their table who often win.different from what we do at the online poker table, you really have to understand the dealer / opponent card, facial expressions are not needed, strategy and expertise are the main thing.",

This is bullshit and probably they just want you to back off since no one in the right mind that will share their secret on winning on a competitive game like poker. Imagine these will share you their secret and you play against them. They will surely loss because you already knew their secret on winning. In poker game. Probability and psychology is the best weapon to consistently win since you are playing against players. Playing just for fun doesn’t affect the outcome of any game even slot games.",

Hmmm maybe it could really helps, they just have that mindset that they are playing not to win all the rounds but to enjoy the every moment of it. Not all people can have that mindset because most of us and even me it is always in my mind that I need to win of course but they were this people that maybe they are too veteran in casinos they have already the money and all they just want to be entertained and luckily they are winning because if their positive energy towards the game.",

While it's always a good idea to get tips from people who are successful at a certain activity and you might pick up an original angle, poker is a skill based game at the end of the day. You can get an edge over your opponent by knowing some basics like hand odds, expected value, positioning, how to read your opponent and much more. It's not some random magic and there is plenty of sources for education on this game, without asking random gamblers who might not have much time for you. It's nothing about \"trying hard\" to win, a solid poker player will know that streaks of bad luck and variance will effect them, but they stay consistent to win in the longer term.",

I agree, there's no pressure if you're playing for fun, I have a lot of experience feeling pressured to win and eventually losing and having fun and winning, it applies to every game of chance and sometimes even in our situation in life if you are stressed you cannot think clearly and will commit a lot of errors and mistakes.Solutions to problems and chances to win will come when you least expect them and they will come to your mind when there is no block to thinking of the solution, like pressure.",

I have to admit that I sometimes gamble with a little worry in mind because I could lose my money. Whenever I do this, I'm more likely to lose. But whenever I don't think twice, betting without a slight doubt, or whenever I'm not bothered by the possibility of losing money, I normally win.This is of course nothing logical.
