Well the crypto-currency market is very volatile and not easy to predict.Also I think the most acceptable best time to buy or invest in crypto-currency is when the price is low. I think just before the bull run comes in probably this year it’s wise to bag some bitcoin.",

That's what I seem to get from that and it doenst make a lot of sense. That would mean, getting in the market when the most profit that could have been made has already been made. The market at the moment though bearish, has been showing some bullish candles and that's good news after the time it took to dip and stay really low.Should your friend had bought $2000 worth of bitcoin a month back, he should be on profit by now and not $400 as you claim. The bitcoin price now is at $26.8k and that's some good news.",

We're not victims but investors and then before we invest, we should be aware and inform ourselves that the market is highly volatile and anything can happen in split seconds just like what's happening now as it's close and attempting to go through $27k. Every time is a good time to invest if we like to stay in the market for the long term. And the risk remains to be there after we invest so, bear with what you're taking and it won't change whether you invest small or a lot. As with that scene you've given about having $2k worth of bitcoin and then becoming $400 in value, that's certainly a lot of drops but you should do the calculation. It's a ten times drop for bitcoin and I think that's unlikely to happen despite being volatile but yeah, possible.",

I can't blame you are a weak investor and many times weak investors are the ones crying over spilled milk, you keep blaming the market and the FUDS but this has been going on for many years already, check the price history, people's lack of trust in the process are those who do not look at the past charts and listen to FUDS.This is a Cryptocurrency market where volatility is very high which is why it's important to invest what you can afford to lose and not blame the market when you are losing, when you invest you have to be prepared for whatever circumstances.For me this is still the best time to invest.",

Hold on, but if you must buy now be wise to use spare income.There is no convenient time to buy or stop buying Bitcoin especially if you have a plan to buy and hold consistently for some years. The price of Bitcoin is not predictable which means there is no convenient time to buy. Most people that have been waiting for Bitcoin to fall to the price they want to buy may end up not buying because the price might not fall to the level they expected. The best time to buy Bitcoin is when you have the funds to buy because if you keep observing the market you might end up not buying. Bitcoin is such a dynamic currency that what affected it's price negatively this year, could lead to an increase in it's worth the next year. I think Bitcoin is gradually maturing to take it's place as one of the influential currencies of the world.",

While it's true that the cryptocurrency market can be volatile and unpredictable, it's important to not let fear dictate investment decisions.Rather than waiting for a \"strong signal\" before investing again, it might be more beneficial to do some research and analysis to make informed investment decisions. As for your friend's situation, it's unfortunate that they have experienced losses, but it's important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. and btw, investing always comes with a level of risk. You should already know that.",

Ever heard early birds catch the worm easily?  That means being first improves the chance of success.[1].  It is a proverb which emphasizes the importance of starting something early to maximize potential income.[1]  So I believe if anyone plans to invest in Bitcoin, the right moment is now especially when the market is still in the bear market sentiment.  It is much better to invest during the bear market or idle moment than when the price is spiking.  This way we are able to secure our profit much earlier.  Of course, we always need to study the market and think rationally.  Once we confirmed that it is ok to invest then invest right away and don't waste time waiting for another dip.  There are lots of cases where many investors failed to invest at a much lower price because they keep on waiting for the price to crash.Quote from: Greggry on March 17, 2023, 07:10:33 PMHold on, but if you must buy now be wise to use spare income.It is always advised that we should invest the money that we can afford to lose.[1] https://blogs.missouristate.edu/international/2020/09/29/learn-english-idioms-the-early-bird-gets-the-worm-meaning/#:~:text=Definition,to%20maximize%20the%20potential%20outcome.",

It is very unlikely unless his friend sold bitcoin at some points. It is either OP just quoted any figure he wished or he was told a non existing story or his friend exergeratted the story of what happened. Meanwhile how did OP know that Bitcoin is not rising any soon even when bitcoin crossed $26k few hours ago. With bitcoin anything is possible and achievable.",

Your advise is pretty good and as an investor we need to hold and keep holding even though the market is bear. We don't need to be in a haste to sell our tokens or coin because since the market is still going to go bullish. I am very certain that the market is going to go up very soon so we need be as patient as a dog. Bitcoin is not a risky business what we need to do is to know how we make investment rather the investing without making research about the market. The market is bear now and is going to go bullish soon.",

If a friend of yours invests $2000 and has $400 left in his wallet, that's still not a loss when your friend hasn't sold it. The price of bitcoin is fluctuating and it is decreasing in value, hold and wait for the price to rise again. If it still crashes then it is the best opportunity to add assets so that it will accumulate the initial capital and the more bitcoins you have.

Bitcoin all-time-high was $69000The lowest price recently was $15500Bitcoin at $27450If your friend invested at all-time-high, his $2000 would be $434.78 when bitcoin got to $15500Bitcoin is $27450 as I was about to post this, $2000 investment would be around $800 now. But last year was a year not for investment, many people knew already that it would be a bad year. But you can start to DCA, see bitcoin price to be low for now, all-time-high is still possible in the next two years.It was not a good decision to invest last year, but it is still a wise decision to invest this year.",
