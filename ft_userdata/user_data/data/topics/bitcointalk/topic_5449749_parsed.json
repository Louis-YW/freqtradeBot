  "content": "Hi everyone, Betcoin has permanently suspended my account and withholding all of my winnings from me. I am not sure what steps to take or who to talk to in order to get this resolved. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here's the jist of my story:I've wagered with Betcoin for a couple of months now. I got fully limited so I could only wager about $1 a few days ago so I went to withdraw my funds (approx .213 btc), I initially only deposited .03 btc 2+ months ago. After waiting a few days with no word on my withdrawal I reached out to chat help, they had me open a support ticket which I did and then followed the verification link to verify my account with my drivers license and selfie. A few hours passed and then all of a sudden I was no longer able to access my account or the site. I reached out via email and got this in response, see email below. I have no idea how I would know the result of a bet and I emailed them back telling them I would be 100% cooperative as I know I have not done anything illegal or tried to place bets somehow knowing the result. I asked them to provide me with those bets/games they are referring too. This seems incredibly unethical to withhold all of my winnings and to only offer my deposit back as a \"courtesy\" when I know and can truly say on my sons life I did nothing wrong here.\"Hello, your account was permanently suspended, pertaining to our termsof service regarding late betting.The investigation is ongoing, but we have been able to determine thatthis is not an isolated incident, as the following bets were placedafter the result was known:3042789641 3042790440 3042790941 3042791280As a 1-time courtesy, we will return your deposit.

Pro Tip: Be super nice. It gets you farther than you think even if you are pissed off... I mean, I guess the fact you can at least get your deposit back is something but I hear your frustration, it's one reason I gave up gambling many many years ago after primedice was shut off to usa IP's... I guess i'd wait and see what they reply with and let us know. Patience is a virtue, especially amongst bitcoiners.",

Provide them your Bitcoin address, and get you deposit as soon as possible. I'm not sure that if that's their fault or you have done something that was really against their rules. The best thing for you is that they're at least agreeing to return your deposit.My friend if you still continue the dispute and the third party also confirms that you were wrong then you might not get your initial deposit. I think their evidence might be confirmed because their style of writing shows that they are confident about their statement. If you have done something that's against their rules but still they are willing to give you the deposit then I don't think they're scamming you.I would also recommend you to be careful with gambling sites, only few of them are 100% clean, and I also suggest you to get as much information about a gambling site as possible before depositing your money for gambling purposes.",

If they've told you that you can take your deposit, then I guess that's the best option and just really have to accept that your winnings can't be taken anymore.If the activity or style of bets you've made is against to their terms and conditions, they know what their terms are and they're giving you two options. The option 1 which is also suggested by other members here to give your btc address and take back your deposit is an easy thing and everything else is done with you and betcoin.

      "body": "Hello BitcoinTalk community,Just a quick note here on this case. Our odds provider originally mentioned to us that this player placed 4 bets after the result was known. At this time the player's account was suspended for a full investigation. During this period, we discovered that the large majority of winning bets were placed live, with high odds, within seconds prior to payout. We worked closely with our odds provider and discovered that indeed, these bets were placed immediately after the action occurred, which was immediately prior to the odds being taken down. Late betting is a violation of our (and all sportsbook's) terms of service. Had it just been the 4 bets on the 1 game, it could have been a coincidence. However, this occurred over a 2 month period, over a multitude of matches, all in the same situation. We have offered the player the 1-time opportunity to resettle his bets at a rate of 1:1 and return the deposit. The other option he has, is to contact a third party mediator. If he does this, we have warned him, that we will show the clear evidence and he will likely receive nothing. But that is his choice to make. We have never lost a mediation, because we have never suspended an account without knowing we had enough evidence to prove it. Assuming he is guilty, this is clearly not the first time he has done this. He has definitely perfected the strategy. What he didn't realize is that Betcoin spends more resources on security than anything else (unfortunately). For years, we have been working closely with nearly every other reputable book in our category to stop the fraud, which causes us to waste money on security that could be used on improvements and promos. We are really good at this, and encourage the players who have been abusing our books for years to find a new profession. No one wants to deal with this. On the other hand, if he is not guilty, then we will not have enough evidence to show the mediator proof of his abuse. Spoiler alert: we do and we will.

Thank youI am sick of these sportsbooks making false claims to against customers who win money sportsbetting off their site. I see this happen way too often with the curacao/crypto sportsbooks.Betcoin will not show any proof of these false claims, they wont OP log in to his account to show his evidence of placing a fair wager. If he takes it to arbitration, how do we know that betcoin is altering their evidence using photoshop or anything? I bet that if betcoin shows his the wagers that were \"known results\" that OP could show you evidence that they werent and could show the same wager placed on other sportsbooks.What about the same wager types he has placed but lost? did that occur on his account?Show us the betslips betcoin, show us some proof.",

A goal, a foul, a penalty, a timeout and many other reasons. So what is the definition? is it just betting when a result is known? I am genuinely curious.",
