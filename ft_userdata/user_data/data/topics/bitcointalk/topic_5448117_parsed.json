If i had to take an educated guess, then i would say this is just one out of the 100 of new shit-coins that gets created each and every day and that will be dead again in a few days after it has been launched. Then the \"team\" behind this token (which is probably just 1 dude). Takes 5 minutes to think of another stupid name and creates the next shitcoin. That's how the shit-coin business works.I think those project are all stupid and in general harmful for the whole crypto space, but that is just my opinion.",

This kind of token is the very definition of pump and dump coin because they were only created to join the hype and will disappear soon when they get lots of victims to invest in their shitcoins just like the squid game token.",

Starshit inu and \"insert color\" inu here that seemingly just milking these Inu meme coins out.This is like what I expected to many of the altcoins in the market currently even those non-meme coins. Well what more can we expect anyway.",

Anyway, I'm not a hater of shitcoins since they do tend to give good profits if you know what you are doing. It's just that it would be quite sad if newbies get to see this post and makes wrong judgements just because of your post (although it would partly be their fault anyway).But then again, maybe you're really just asking a question honestly. If so, then I suggest you get your hands off of shitcoins first or start up altcoins and focus more on stable coins instead to get a better feel about this industry without suffering much losses if you ever make wrong judgements. But if you really want to, then keep your investments at a minimum amount that is small enough to not make you regret investing even if you suffer losses. Good luck OP.",
