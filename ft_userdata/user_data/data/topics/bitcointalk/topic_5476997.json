  "content": "Hey guys!I was so elated to receive a call from the SSG (Secretary to the State Government) of Niger State almost a week ago after we've all waited anxiously for a response from the state government following the letter we submitted two months ago about \"Introducing The Bitcoin Technology Into Our Secondary Schools Curriculum as a Trade Subject\".Although I have traveled out of town and could not make it there physically, I sent my team members to represent me at the meeting with the SSG.The SSG received my delegates at his office on Tuesday, 5th to give them a brief of the discussions they have with the governor and their resolution.See Image HereProminent in all the discussions they had was the aspect where the SSG mentioned to them that although they are ambitious about the new evolution inbuilt in the digital world, the fintech and the digital currency, they are still xraying the advancement aspect and are desirous of the very positive results the state is interested in especially as it resonates with their agenda.He then issued the letter dated December , 4th to to my delegates as an official reply to our demand on the adoption of bitcoin technology and request that we remain patient while the government employ the necessary human resources to acqualize this ambitious dream.My delegates were very happy about this development while I requested that they scan the letter and send to me. Below is a reciept of the scanned copy of the official response from the SSG.Page 1Page 2I am most gracious right now to update the forum on this new development and hope to continue to push this project until there is light at the end of the tunnel.Thank you to the members of this forum that have kept on following up on my earlier thread for updates, I am glad that I have a response for you now.",

Despite the difficulties placed by the central government in Nigeria, or I do not know if thanks to them, I see many people in the forum very active with initiatives to normalize and popularize the Bitcoin. Receiving such recognition in the state of Niger is not a minor issue.A question for those who do not know the area: I imagine that Niger state, part of Nigeria, is completely different from Niger country? I guess if they share name is because of the river.",

For that member who was on a routine checking of a bus was held by police and then asked forced by police to send them $1000 dollars when they saw crypto apps on his phone. That's really scary but I think this step will take you all from the dark cave which you are talking about.I hope this will work out for you all and crypto will be legalized in your place. I am happy for you, keep it up dear. Things will change for crypto adopters.",

However in my opinion this will be a big responsibility because the government also wants control that can provide positive feedback. Hopefully your struggle can produce the expected results.  This action is certainly considered  brave because we usually avoid government matters  when it comes to bitcoin. You know for yourself our ownership does not want to be kissed and taxed. HahaI would be very happy if  there is any new news that you can share here the government there is definitely considering many things because this will involve the freedom sector.",

Therefore, I did not think that they would be open to discussing issues such as blockchain or teaching Bitcoin to children. Will this decision include the entire country or a group? Specific schools or how will it be included in the educational curricula? Because including such things in our educational curricula takes an average of 5 years and 3 years before it is approved, as the curriculum is amended every 5 years.",

Yes, I wish we had more people on the forum capable of contacting politicians to promote measures to raise awareness of bitcoin. It is only one step from there to favouring other types of measures, such as favourable measures for commercial trade in cryptocurrencies.",

But I still wonder how the governor would do this since it would amount to a conflict of interest between the state government and CBN. As we all know, the CBN has banned all banks and financial institutions from associating with crypto dealing or anyone dealing with it. Perhaps this new CBN government would do the right thing this time.And if the Niger state's plan is well done, then it would be a very great relief for Nigerians to do everything crypto openly with banks and others. Although they are doing it shortly after the heat of the latest ban, still, when a state government is involved, it would be a further development for everyone.",

I mean that the policy should not too strict for crypto enthusiast to actually 'enjoying' their crypto, and not too loose for common people to fall into crypto scam.

I followed your previous topic where you talked about your visit to your state governor concerning a proposal to integrate bitcoin in the secondary school curriculum. I'm a little bit curious, based on the position of Nigerian government on cryptocurrency, news like shouldn't be just a closed door meeting with handshakes. I'd would expect it to be captured by the media but so far there's no such news on the internet. Perhaps, we'll get to know more later.",

We value your efforts and hope that this development will lead to more advancements in bitcoin around the nation, not just in Niger State. In order to evaluate public opinion, it would be wonderful to see a headline about this plan that details how the Niger state government is approaching it. If the Niger State government approves bitcoin even if it isn't yet officially allowed in the nation, won't it cause problems or confusion? Does this imply that Niger State residents will be the only ones able to freely adopt Bitcoin?",

The Nigerian government hasn’t made any official statement about the legality of the use of Bitcoin in the country but their recent actions show that there is no reason to worry about a ban. In 2021, the central bank of Nigeria instructed financial institutions to freeze accounts connected to crypto transactions. Despite the restrictions, p2p in Nigeria hit all time high that year. Nigerians are free spirited, it will be extremely difficult for the government to come after Bitcoin holders. “In May 28, 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari signs the 2023 finance bill into law. The law introduces a 10 percent taxation of gains on the disposal of digital assets including cryptocurrency.”https://www.thecable.ng/timeline-from-ban-to-taxation-fgs-journey-to-cryptocurrency-acceptance/amp",
