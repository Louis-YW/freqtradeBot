I heard some similar stories on Twitter and from one of my friends. Some of them solved the problem after a while, as the wallet is bad at estimating the fees, or broadcasting the transaction becomes more difficult, and others imported them seeds in other wallets.So, either you wait and try again, or you import your seeds in another wallet (the best solution).",

Inadviced him to import his seed phrase on elect and he said it worked. Same complained by another friend just if recent too.Quote from: Husires on May 12, 2023, 05:40:19 AMSo, either you wait and try again, or you import your seeds in another wallet (the best solution).There is no point in trying again. If it is bitcoin wallet, Trustwallet is one of the worst bitcoin wallets that I can mention. It is close source, you can not pump fee, you can not use CPFP directly supported on the wallet, no multisig, no connection of hardware wallet support, only one address is giving. There are still many flaws that I can mention.",

You will fix it by importing your seed into a more reliable wallet and send the entire balance to a new wallet created by a proper Bitcoin client. Bitcoin doesn't lack good software wallets, both for desktop and mobile devices. So there is no reason to even begin using Trust Wallet or considering to use it with bitcoin after this incident. I can understand why it's a choice for altcoin users where there might not be better options.1. Import your seed into a different client.2. Create a brand-new wallet and make seed backups.3. Sweep everything from your old Trust Wallet.4. Uninstall Trust Wallet and/or don't use it for bitcoin anymore.",

      "body": "All the suggestions above are good, but they are not a solution to the problem, it is rethinking the use of better alternatives instead of the Trust wallet.The wallet is closed source, so the support team is the only one who can explain to you the cause of the problem and how to solve it. you must trust that they must be good enough to close any bug, and in my opinion it is a risk that I do not advise anyone to take it.According to troubleshooting answer If the amount of an UTXO is smaller than the partial fee needed to send it, that UTXO cannot be sent (with current fee level).QuoteIf the amount of an UTXO is smaller than the partial fee needed to send it, that UTXO cannot be sent (with current fee level). If all UTXOs are dust, nothing can be sent from the account.For example, a Bitcoin address may contain 3 UTXOs, of the amounts: 0.0090, 0.0003, and 0.0004, for a combined balance of 0.0097. Assuming a current byte fee rate of 50 satoshis/byte, and number of bytes for one extra UTXO as 110, the extra fee for an additional UTXO is 0,0005500 (50x110 sats). This is higher than the last two UTXOs, so those are not possible to send. Only the 0.0090 UTXO can be sent â€“ in full or partially.Source https://community.trustwallet.com/t/unable-to-send-due-to-dust-error/1188and the solutions they proposeQuoteWhat can I do?Do not send very small transactions with a high fee. Since the network will attempt to create a UTXO from a small transaction, the transaction will fail.Send what is possible using Max Amount, with default fee setting. This will leave the small UTXOs, but send out the non-dust ones.If nothing more can be sent with default fee setting (only dust UTXOs exist), try sending with lowered fee. You can adjust the fee 6.6k from the transaction confirmation screen. Warning: with low fee a transaction will take longer, sometimes even multiple days!Useless solutions indicate extreme laziness.",
