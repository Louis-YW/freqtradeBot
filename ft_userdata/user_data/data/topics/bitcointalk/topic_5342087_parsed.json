This announcement was left for the end of the 2021 Bitcoin Conference with the participation of Jack Mallers.Among the most impressive that helped me understand why bitcoin will be the currency that will lead the country of El Salvador is this.Quote\"Over 70% of the active population of El Salvador doesn't have a bank account. They're not in the financial system.\" -Jack Mallershttps://twitter.com/TheBitcoinConf/status/1401279373223866369?s=19At the conference the president of El Salvador makes the announcement.QuotePresident of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele: \"Next week I will send to congress a bill that will make #bitcoin a legal tender.\" https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1401279550538108933?s=19",

If most of its citizens will use crypto, this will be a very good example to follow and their neighboring countries may also follow if they show successful implementation, in terms of crypto payment and other related businesses. Couple of years from now, and we will see what is the effect of bitcoin or crypto on their economic system.",

It is one thing to legally declare Bitcoin as an alternative currency or mode of payment in the entire country, it is another to declare it as a legal tender. It is almost unbelievable reading about a country declaring Bitcoin as a legal tender. We will see in the following days and weeks the bill's content and whether or not it will receive approval in El Salvador's congress.",

Having legal tender means that anyone MUST accept it as a form of payment, it can be used for paying TAXES, it can be used for paying salary, and generally speaking it's something accepted by government and regulated by some laws.It's something very good , but let's wait for official decision made by parliament.

If they successfully pass the law I guess there will be miners going to this country. It wouldn't be BTC that might just be adopted to the country.  I hope they make it so the rest of South America will also follow steps to freedom.",
