      "body": "That's the current demand. But as we all know, demand goes up and down all the time. So there might be days when demand is much higher than the number of new Bitcoins released. There are also times when the demand is much lower. This is basically the reason why there is high and fall of the prices as well. It's basically the result of supply and demand. This is also the reason why halving is a big deal. The demand may rise and fall, but since adoption rate is still very low and is fast growing, it is generally rising. Now compare this with the new supply that does not rise and fall, but only falls lower and lower, we can safely predict that the price will keep on rising in longer time frames. That's why hodlers are winners.",

Now 100 customer show up and want to buy a bottle of water.What is the situation now: The customer start bidding for each bottle of water and the highest bidder gets 1 bottle and so on until all 10 bottles are sold. Supply meets demand at a certain price pointIf you start to argue that you want for example a new car and like to pay only 5 USD per car, then of course there is a mismach between YOUR desired price point and the available supply of cars for sale at a market price.",

      "body": "You forgot to take into account the existing coins that are being traded in the market on the daily. That 900 being minted daily is on top of the circulating supply, too, so there's no undersupply or overflowing demand happening as the circulating supply kind of fills in those demands. It also goes up and down every single time, and you can't expect a bear market to keep a consistent demand similarly to that of a bull run. Now if demand somehow overshoots and most bitcoins in circulation already belong to a lot of hands, you know what's next. However in the mean time that's not happening, as there are still loads of bitcoin available for grabs in exchanges and people are still not having that extreme FOMO that occurs during bull runs.",

If not, price would increase to a new equilibrium.Well, I would qualify that this is at a specific price. In the last year the trend has been that supply has not matched demand by very little, so the price trend has been increasing. If there is demand for 900 bitcoins a day at a price of around $50k and only 850 are sold the way for those left not buying to prompt those holding bitcoin to sell is to raise the bid price.",

There are ways we can speculate about demand and then the intrinsic value of bitcoin and I've always said that there is more demand than the supply (hence the intrinsic value is higher than this) but it is speculation, inaccurate and is definitely not 10x higher! A smaller ratio is reasonable and it could even be suppressed by market manipulation (explaining why price isn't rising at that time despite higher demand) but higher ratio like 10x is impossible because price would shoot up to reach equilibrium. After all supply and demand have to be in equilibrium or close to it, otherwise price moves in a direction to reach it.",

It explains Bitcoin growth in adoption, price and value since 2009.Developers, scammers can use Bitcoin source code, fork an altcoin, change the total supply to 10M or 5M but its shit coin will not have price like x2 or x4 of Bitcoin price.How many Bitcoin forks are there?",

The higher we go the more difficult it’ll be to maintain that momentum. Exactly it is just a simple demand and supply chain. Since the last quarter of last year when the hype around bitcoin ETF started the demand level was higher and that’s why you could see that we have been in uptrend since and only got a heavy correction when GBTC started sell and also Microstrategy too. But right after that when the news of other ETF approved entities started buying we saw the price increasing and up till now in that zone. So when you see the buy side (price increase) is higher than the sell side then we can say the demand is higher than the supply but we can’t just simply quantify it base on percentage. The best thing we can have is the buying volume at that time which is also not accurate. I will have to disagree with you that supply will overshadow demand yes it would after a long bullish period but overall the demand will increase more because of the massive adoption coming into bitcoin",

He's saying that 9,000 BTC is bought per day by two major Bitcoin ETF companies. I'm not sure where he's getting that information, but even assuming it's correct, it's still not right to compare it directly to the amount of new BTC being mined every day because there's plenty of BTC in circulating supply, plenty of BTC sellers, and also because we don't know how long this accumulation phase by ETFs will last. And then, comparing 900 BTC per day with 9,000 BTC accumulation, he somehow jumps to 20x price increase conclusion. That's unsubstantiated.",

This is cased by only slightly higher demand as opposed to supply. Or sometimes the two are even equal.",
