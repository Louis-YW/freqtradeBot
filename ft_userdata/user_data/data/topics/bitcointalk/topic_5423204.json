I think getting merit is pretty much easier compared to few years before since there's many active merit sources and the users are more active to share their sMerit. If you think it's hard, it mean you're a shitposter since shitpost wouldn't ever get merited.There's few users in this forum want to review anyone post if they're make a good post:1. [Merit] Share your best posts/threads with Fillippone to be merit assessed2. [self-moderated] Report unmerited good posts to Merit Source",

Once you know already the things needed to gain knowledge, experience and skills here in the community you can now share those and get merit as a reward. Its a good advice to new newbie era to learn more and enjoy here in the community after that the merit follows.",

Every now and then you can see people celebrating their rank up over here and this goes to show that people are actually receiving merits for their contributions on the forum. We also have some different occasional competition getting organized on the forum that can get you some merits like this; ðŸŽƒ[ANN] Bitcointalk Bitcoin Pumpkin Carving Contest ðŸŽƒ etc. Get involved in the forum fully and you'll be appreciated and not only caring about spamming the forum to get some payout weekly. We also have some forum members that are willingly reviewing participate post history like @Pharmacist so there's basically no excuse of not receiving merits for your quality contributions to the forum unless you aren't putting some effort into your writing as @pooya87 had pointed out. Change your ways and you'll get merited, newbies not getting merited is just a myth as they're one of the most merited users on the forum.",

The forum was created for the purpose of engaging in meaningful communication and dialogue for the purpose of attaining knowledge. We should stick to that purpose. I personally think threads like this would further discourage the minds of newbies and make them pessimistic towards the forum and the merit system. There are higher ranked members that are more than willing to help beginners and newbies with whatever information they may need. And Iâ€™m sure it would be clear if a newbie or a beginner is enthusiastic about learning a thing or two. Seek ye first knowledge and enlightenment on the forum and every other thing(including merits) will be added unto you",

Let's say that this is the first question, and I will answer you very simply - most of your posts are in a board that is very specific and which is unfortunately flooded with spam posts - you will not find many who are merit sources and are active in that board, and even fewer who will look for good posts in megathreads.Furthermore, the number of merits you see in user profiles are not those that they can share, but what they have received - there is something called sMerits and it is not visible in user profiles, although it can be calculated from the number of received/sent merits.",

It is more difficult in my opinion to find a suitable direction, a section where you can reveal your potential, where your discussion will be useful or interesting.
