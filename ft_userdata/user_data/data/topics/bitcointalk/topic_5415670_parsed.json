Since it's a hot issue, sure that there will be investigators about it but if it's a real thing. Then, congrats to the winners.",

Some people don't prefer complex combinations and focus on the basics and surprisingly, they all won the same day. The PCSO held a press conference regarding the result since lots of people are getting more suspicious about it. They even released the location of 433 winners but most people are still not fully convinced.",

I think it went well for them ... it is still a quite considerable sum even if it is not a life-changing sum ... This event it reminds me of a similar fact that happened in Italy some years ago. Many players have guessed the \"13\" at the \"Totocalcio\" (the best you can get). But the results were so simple to guess that the final prize pool was divided into so many winners who ... practically won 30 euro each!Imagine that a retired friend of mine had guessed that coupon.

But this time its very unusual. But i also don't think the game is rigged or someone has leaked the winning combination as the draw game is in live. Let's just say these people are just lucky enough, and we should also be happy for them so they can enjoy their winning amount.",
