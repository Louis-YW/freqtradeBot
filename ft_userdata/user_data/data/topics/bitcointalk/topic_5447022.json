  "content": "Some bitcoin users few days back created awareness on different tall buildings located in Frankfurt, even on the deutche bank building they projected a bitcoin logo on the bank building as a sign that it'll one day be a building used to transact bitcoin instead of fiat. The initiative attracted people who donated to help them execute the publicity work on bitcoin. A twitter user Bitman shared the beautiful pictures on his page. Indeed I love seeing such an amazing effort towards the promotion of bitcoin in cities like Frankfurt. Bitcoiners around Frankfurt traveled about hundred kilometers to join the campaign, its awesome to see a united bitcoin community in Frankfurt. Even some US users thought about doing such things in their states. Lol.   A comment in German I translated to English read; in this Tower are offices of Federal BanksIf you want to do this in your city check his page out. https://twitter.com/Bitman_bob",

I mean you cannot just advertise something on someone else's property unless you rented it or at least got their consent.It looks cool to be honest as it's giving me that batman vibe but I still wouldn't support the idea if it was done without permission of owners.",

Because I believe no one will dare pull this off if the government is against Bitcoin. By the way, this is pretty impressive, I will love to see this happen in another part of the world soon, do not try this in the US at this moment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ though.",

Itâ€™s a bonus if it even gets a limited amount of people to start buying bitcoin. Things like this may seem small but it could be a kick up the ass that some people need to do as the projection states, â€˜study Bitcoinâ€™",

It becomes more sensitve if projected images are about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency that are not accepted in all people and locations.Normally people think those projections as arts but if it is about Bitcoin, some people would think about scam and might havd unfriendly reactions.",

The creator is already anonymously becoming famous, and every crypto believer loves the idea.",

I agree that the creators of this advertisement are creative and deserve some accolade. But advertising bitcoin on the building of a bank that is against cryptocurrency looks confrontational. Although most of these anti-bitcoin forces engage in some dirty and unlawful attacks on bitcoin but bitcoiners are law-abiding and hence will not support unlawful activities. It's good publicity if it is done with permission, however, these folks have increased bitcoin awareness. I am expecting to hear the response of the relevant authorities in Frankfurt.",

This is probably one of the first cases when projections are made on buildings by enthusiasts, which means that most likely there is no legislative basis for such actions (I am not a lawyer and I can be wrong).If before that there were no similar precedents, then it is unlikely that law enforcement agencies will bring these people to justice.In general, it all looks like a challenge to the traditional banking system.How long could BTC-projection be seen on each building?",

We just need to keep on sharing it both on social media and traditional media as well. Thats the thing that makes this a lot better, I feel like we are going to end up with a lot more people overtime, obviously every year new younger generation who is more likely to invest grow up, and every year unfortunately we lose our elderly, which means overtime there will be plenty more people who will be using bitcoin and investing into it.",
