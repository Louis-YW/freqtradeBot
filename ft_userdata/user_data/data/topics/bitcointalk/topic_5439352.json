  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk users!First thing first. If you are an affiliate and still have BitDice listed on your website, remove them immediately!!!I have been working with BitDice since December 2021, and everything has been fine with them for a whole year. I tested their casino, posted a review on my website, and started bringing new players to them. My earnings were paid out without any problems until October 2022. I did not receive payment for October and wrote about this problem to the manager (BitDice_Mike on Skype). He said the payment would be sent soon, but the next month I didn't receive anything, and a month later as well. Then he said that he left BitdiceI've written to other skype accounts Bitcointalk users related to BitDice and nothing.This month my affiliate account has been blocked, and a few days after, the hole affiliate website went down.They haven't paid 0.08457188 BTC and 79.88$ to me. But I believe some other partners lost much much more. And its very strange that I don't see any related topics here.BUT....Their casino is still live and accepts new registrations and deposits.If you are a BitDice player or are considering starting to play there, please be careful. Such a case with partners is a very bad sign, and in my experience, this is what casinos that are about to close do. Please let us know in the comments if you have experienced any problems with BitDice recently.",

Please let us know in the comments if you have experienced any problems with BitDice recently.I will show you the latest review from a BitDice user on January 2, 2023, on Trustpilot,As for me, I have not tried this casino before, and I did not see many topics about it in this forum, and it is good that you were cool to warn people. What I saw is that the BitDice rating on the review sites is very poor, and they have a lot of negative reviews for users who could not receive their money after they tried to communicate with customers service and did not get a response from them, in addition to that there are many users whose accounts were banned/deactivated without prior notice after they won from 2,000 dollars to 10,000 dollars, and after they made the withdrawal and waited for many weeks.After the affiliate website went down and blocked the users' affiliate accounts to confiscate their profits and after they did not post updates on Twitter about their casino, this is undoubtedly a red flag for us as players to stay away from this scam casino.[1] https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bitdice.me",

I am seeing some complains against them in askgambler and most of the unresolved issues are from last December.Â  You can see it here : https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casinos/bitdice-casino-review/complaintsAccording to the above list, seems they were very active to solve any complaint. But now there not. Even they scammed their parter who is working with them for more than year. A big red signal. Player should avoid them. QuoteBitBice doesn't pay to affiliatesShould be bitdice",

Now it's the turn of their affiliate partners.. we can conclude how this is going to end!Everyone should stay away from them and their customers should withdraw their money if they still can, at least until they resolve all these pending issues.",
