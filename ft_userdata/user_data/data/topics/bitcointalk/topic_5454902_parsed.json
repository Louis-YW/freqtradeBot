There’s a saying the ‘Jack of all trade is sometimes master of none’. Concerning cryptocurrencies he should stick to bitcoin only because just like there’s the hype now around BRC-20 there will be  new tokens trying to better off bitcoin in future. This are mostly scammers way of luring people into their Alticoins by promising to go beyond what bitcoin is for. Your should be aware that there are more than 1,000 altcoins currently and none has come close to bitcoin. So he shouldn’t bother about them.",

He should put the Ordinals and BRC20 issues aside for the time being since he is still learning about Bitcoin as a whole.He shouldn't have been troubled by all of this if he knew enough about bitcoin, as the trend of ordinals and BRC20 disrupting transactions is no longer an issue. This suggests that anything other than Bitcoin is not consistent because it will eventually disappear.",

What advice do you have to give to my friend who is trying to juggle getting grounded in the basics and keeping up with these latest update on Bitcoin?I would advise your friend that BRC-20 is not an update of Bitcoin, in fact it has nothing to do about Bitcoin. The latest upgrade of Bitcoin as far as I remember is taproot that introduces some new features of Bitcoin such as Schnorr signatures, Taproot script and Taproot privacy.  Although taproot enable the integration of Bitcoin ordinals, BRC 20 token as I stated is not a part of Bitcoin network.If he felt like he can't catch up with the update then he should double the time he allocate in learning about BTC, probably this time his leaning strategy will catch up.",

It's okay if he's taking it slowly, there's no need to rush, and there's no competition that he needs to get ahead of time. Remember that. Because that's probably what he's thinking on his mind and it's not really a requirement as long as he's invested in it. Just keep on doing what he's started of dedicating his time in learning.",

To somebody who is already exposing himself to Bitcoin, he can't avoid stumbling upon latest updates and controversies surrounding Bitcoin, but he can't put his entire focus on them yet. Surely, there will be lessons learned and knowledge gained in reading what's new in Bitcoin, but the basics are probably worth learning first. The issue on Ordinals, for example, won't be interesting to somebody who doesn't have the background. That Chipmixer is seized by international authorities, for example, might be puzzling to somebody who doesn't even understand why such a service is important.",

The only person who can be successful in this market is those who keep an eye on the things around them but do not panic because of them. If he is learning about Bitcoin then that is great and he should not worry about Bitcoin because it is a crypto currency that will never be lost.Everyone is aware of the importance of Bitcoin and no one should have any doubts about the potential of Bitcoin.",

The most important thing is that they understand the basics and how to properly handle their security when storing their bitcoins and when making a transaction.New updates sometime required attention such as how ordinals affects transaction fees, but you can do this over a couple of articles and inquiries here, without getting too technical about it.",

One of the things here is you don't really need to always keep up there will always be new things in the crypto world, if you don't get on that new hype you could always get on the need one don't you do not need to always get in since that can cause you a lot of lose.",

What advice do you have to give to my friend who is trying to juggle getting grounded in the basics and keeping up with these latest update on Bitcoin?This might be off-topic but please bear with me since I kinda relate somehow to the topic. Back when I was learning software development, I was also getting overwhelmed by lots of stuffs to learn. I am pretty sure that web development was just like HTML, CSS and then Javascript until I read about the other frameworks like what the fuck are these. That led me to being overwhelmed on this whole journey in my own career. Turns out that I don't need to learn all those stuffs anyway. As for your friend, you don't need to learn everything. There's just way too much to absorb in learning Bitcoin. Surely not everyone here knows BRC-20 and not everyone here knows how to mine Bitcoin (count me in as price of rigs here in my country is insane).If your friend only knows how to be a hodler, that's perfectly fine. If s/he wants to learn more stuffs related to Bitcoin just take it one step at a time. It does not have to be one day journey.Quote from: Poker Player on June 03, 2023, 08:12:00 AMSimply that he should not become obsessed with it, that he should learn little by little.
