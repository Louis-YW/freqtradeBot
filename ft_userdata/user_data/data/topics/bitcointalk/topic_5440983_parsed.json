Or Are they stored on blocks?-Also, Could someone help me explain better what transaction processor is and what part of the transaction the transaction processors actually create?",

So.. I am not sure what you mean.",

I would recommend against such custodial solutions and self-host something like BTCPayServer.In regular (self-custodial / non-custodial) wallets, you yourself create the whole transaction. Nobody else creates any part of the transaction except your own wallet. It constructs all the fields like described on Learnmeabitcoin.com and signs it. Then it is broadcast to the network.",

The wallet software builds the transaction and provides the neccessary digital signatures, then it sends copies of the transaction to all connected peers.Service providers store bitcoin on behalf of their customers. They run their own wallet software and create transactions using that wallet software when their customers ask them to.  They can also monitor the blockchain and the network communications to notify their customers when they receive new transactions on behalf of their customers.",

This site is very helpful for beginners it explains and breaks everything down easily. Transaction IDs are not stored in the blockchain but bitcoin core rather.I appreciate your efforts all, i will not hesitate to ask when i feel the need.",
