  "content": "I was suprised when I saw Bitcoin falling so fast from yesterday's price point till now. June 12th the price was holding around at 29k, i assumed it will go up or go down a little bit. Some what similar to June 6th and then May 30th. It has been been hovering around the range of 28k to 30k for quiet some time now. Suddenly it went below 25k on a single day and that becomes a trigger for someone like me who saw Bitcoin usd value at around 3k to 4k between 2018 to 2019 in the month of April. In reality that was the golden time to grab 1 Bitcoin. This situation isn't alarming for me but, i did some checks within the forum and found out that, this situation might have arised because of the LUNA issue or it might have been because of the global inflation situation. What do you guys think can be the issue? Let's have a discussion here! HINGLISH REPLY ACCEPTED",

HINGLISH REPLY ACCEPTEDOne of the biggest reason for this huge dump is LUNA owner Do Kwon and the second might be the global inflation which is forcing non institutional traders to take out their money from the crypto marke and last the war in Europe. I hope the market recovers before this year ends.",

      "body": "Yes, you both are correct but there was another news of celsius network not allowing withdrawal of Bitcoin. That was another reason why the value of Bitcoin fell as small investors panicked and sold most of their Bitcoin held somewhere else.The problem to date is that   none of those who had or have invested after the ATH believe in Bitcoin. If they had then they wouldn't have sold their holdings.",

Do not know how long this bear market willl continues but you are correct that this is a market cycle. I did expect the market to correct but not so much of correction. Bitcoin still hovering around 20k to 22k. If I remember 20k was once a new high in 2017 and 20k is now the new low in 2022. Overall the market should look good for institutional investors if they are planning to accumulate more Bitcoin.",

Overall the market should look good for institutional investors if they are planning to accumulate more Bitcoin. $20k was once a \"too costly to buy a bitcoin\" range and now it's \"too cheap to buy a bitcoin\" range.I consider the recent dump as a series of negative influence in 2022 because of all the negative things occurred this year.The Russia-Ukraine war was the starting point triggering the dump and then there were many things contributing to the dump.The latest dump made bitcoin fall from the $29k price to currently at $21k price which was mainly due to the high inflation the increased interest rates.But as we know, sooner or later the dust will settle and once positive sentiments hit the market bitcoin will go bullish than ever.",

I think Market will stay around this region for somewhile, it will try to give hints as if we will break the region downwards and this will fool retail players and they will create short positions and ultimately these positions will be liquidated by big bull pump upwards or second scenario could be we might go straight down from here create a sort of long wick hammer and then go back up. I really doubt that bull action will immediately start after this.",

I really doubt that bull action will immediately start after this. Talking about manipulation it can happen the other way around too. For instance there might be a temporary long green candle.People might think it's time to go bullish hence creating long positions and then the dump will occur liquidating the long positions.It keeps happening which is why I hate to trade sometimes. I believe swing trading and long term trading is the best thing to do in these cases.",
