Honestly, at first I really liked the games from the Pragnatic Play provider. But now I feel that pragmatic is very bad, bad and bad. I can't remember the last time I got a multiplier up to 500x or 1000x. The current pragmatic is not the previous pragmatic, in my opinion pragmatic has become very bad lately and I am starting to avoid PP games. Although difficult, I decided that for now the worst provider is pragmatic",

If it is so, all providers can be the worst because we will have our bad luck time when we do not get nice hit after so many spins. When the luck comes, the providers that we have labelled as worst can be good because we get nice hits frequently?  I would prefer to say good or bad for slots game based on its UI, music theme, features, speed, etc. In this case I will say Betsoft as the worst because the game is slow, although there is quick spin mode but it does not speed up the game much. The features are also less compared to other providers such as game replay, buy bonus, etc.",

But maybe Hacksaw and Wazdan are slot game providers that have slot games where it is difficult to get big wins even by buying the Bonus feature. I have experienced loss several times, both through normal bonus rounds and paying bonus rounds. But maybe that's because I don't have the luck to get big wins.",

That's why I don't trust streamers anymore, they always have to be the lucky ones on life streams and people think it's fair, well I don't. It's not hard to accept the fact that Slots games is all about luck, you can lose a lot of money if care is no taken, that's why you need to risk only what you can afford to lose in any gambling games, not just Slots games only.",

I can't say how many bets/bonus buys I have on ELK and all other slots, and I never experienced max win! And yes, I saw people winning max payouts on Hacksaw & NoLimit... but for me, these two are a disaster. That Mental took a lot of money from me and never gave me anything, loss after loss.",

So let's find the worst provider ever!  It seems you're frustrated with certain online slot casino providers finding it difficult to trigger bonus rounds and expressing disappointment with low payouts. Just like other members saying, I also had a different experience with that slot provider . I had a great multiplier experience with Hacksaw Gaming when I was playing on Roobet. I can't forget it as it was my highest multiplier (x600) playing with the Hand of Anubis game by Hacksaw Gaming with a $1 per spin bet.I'm not sure if you know the ELK Studio slot provider. For me it was the worst slot provider because I haven't experienced a big multiplier with that provider.",

      "body": "I won't say it is the worst because there's a chance I just haven't received any good wins from them yet. Pragmatic it is. I am actually on the brink of hating it forever and not ever playing their slot games anymore but some of their games are so cool that it's difficult to let go. But that's just my opinion, maybe some players got lucky with the said slot provider. Hacksaw on the other hand gave me a good hit but not like an amount that I will be happy about unlike with other providers that I tried like NoLimit. Anyway, I think this question is case to case basis. Some may have won a good multi-win in a slot provider that we hate while some will curse them forever and promise to not play any game on that provider. I like sticking with slots that have enhanced RTP for now. Like Gates of Heaven (Pragmatic) in Stake Exclusives.",

But the trick is using small money that won't get you rekt for a long term play until you luck gets unlocked. The best thing you can ever do to yourself as a gambler is the tolerance of using little amount of money everytime, if you win it's all good and if you lose it's still going to be fine, it costs you little to nothing, which is way way better than trying to aim for the big wins using significant amount of money.",

In my experience Wazdan gives more frequent small wins, but you also have to play longer before you hit it. I have personally hit more 400x plus wins on Wazdan, than any other slot from all the other Slot providers.  I also opt to play Wazdan games when there are a Slot challenge, because it is easier to hit the bigger multipliers if you turbo spin.",
