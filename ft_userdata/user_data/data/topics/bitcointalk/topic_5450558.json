      "body": "In that case you should update the Nvidia drivers to up-to-dated version first before doing anything else. With the latest drivers the problem will will solved. The latest driver version for your GPU is Driver Version: 531.68, you should download and install it through Nvidia's website.If the problem exists even after updating to the latest gpu driver. In that case you should  try to run the following command: Code:pip uninstall pyopencl Because sometimes the problem is mainly caused due to pyopencl installation and that's why uninstalling it might solve the issue. Once the uninstallation is complete you should now run this command:Code:pip install pyopenclOnce the pyopencl is reinstalled, you should try to run it and it might run without any issues. If after following the above steps btcrecover still wasn't able to use GPU acceleration then you should try to run the btcrecover with administrative privileges. In that case you should run the command line as administrator by left clicking on it and selecting run as administrator. That will most probably solve the issue.",
