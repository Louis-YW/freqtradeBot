  "content": "Payment gateway for Ecommerce.Do you have your own shop, sell goods or services? Receive payment in cryptocurrency without intermediaries! We differentiate ourselves from other processors by developing infrastructure and providing an interface for decentralized payments. Unlike competitors, we do not receive your funds to our accounts/wallets. You receive funds directly from the P2P buyer.How it works1. You indicate your wallet address and connect your project to our service.2. Your buyer goes to the payment form and transfers money to YOUR wallet (This could be Electrum, Exodus, Metamask, etc.).3. Our service tracks the payment and notifies you of success.What is unique?We do not have access to your wallet.All funds are under your control.We do not have KYC or verifications.There is no need to wait for the withdrawal of money, as with other payment services.Flexible API for creating your own solution.Ready-made plugins for Ecommerce.Commission - 1% of the amount of each transaction. (Individual % for large projects)How to pay commission?Top up your account balance on our service.The commission is debited from the balance of our service automatically.​More details again:When purchasing on your website, the money goes directly to your wallet that you connected. Those. Your wallet will be indicated in the user's invoice.This could be Electrum, Exodus, Metamask, etc. . As a service, we do not have access and cannot limit or block your payments in any way. We only provide the opportunity to use our software.Cost of services: 1% of the amount of each transaction, which you pay separately, replenishing the balance of your account (also with cryptocurrency).All transactions between your customer and you (your store) occur in a P2P (peer-to-peer) format. You pay a fee by topping up your balance on our platform. For example, if you want to use our service, you transfer $50 to your account balance. These funds are already on our account, and we simply deduct the fee from transactions against this balance. You don't need to pay the fee through the blockchain every time; it's already on our account. Let's say your transaction volume amounts to $1000; we deduct $10 from your balance, leaving you with $40. This is just a record in our database, nothing more. Your balance can even go negative if you forget to top it up in time and then settle the debt later. If you want to stop using our service, you can request a withdrawal of the remaining balance to your wallet. The essence of the service is that we can't influence your P2P transactions between you and your customer. Is it clearer now?1. Non-custodial (We do not store keys, and you receive money to your wallet that you connect)2. To register, you only need to provide an email and password.3. No KYC4.

But if Binance files or colapses what will happen to BNB, more so due to BNB Beacon Chain being the blockchain component that is responsible for the governance of the BNB Chain and manages staking and voting on the BNB Chain.",

Other than that, i liked the website and keep it up the hard work.  You guys are talking about chapter 11 and i don't think Bankruptcy of Binance will effect the functionality of website because if they bankrupted then its there problem because as this (BCON) said they didn't have the keys and no control over user's assets then how can the bankruptcy of Binance or BNB will effect this platform's? Like in the way you are saying (Willyap). i do agreed with OP here on this issue that if the users will get to use more blockchain then this platform will attract more users otherwise they are limited to only few. Most of the customers or merchants prefer, USDT (TRC20 or in any blockchain) and BTC, BNB, ETH (many don't prefer) etc.",

Furthermore, the ability to support many blockchains is a significant benefit.Advisably, you should work on your user interface to be more responsive and simple. Also reduce the display of pop-ups on the web pages, makes it look too busy and boring. Technology today is all about simplicity and straightforwardness. Good luck!",

If the network is crowded/overloaded, will the user still pay with Bitcoin? Or will they choose BNB with lower fees? As a service, we cannot base our decisions on network congestion and blockchain fees as they are volatile. When you connect to our API, you can decide whether you will pay the fee yourself or add 1% to the cost of the product for the user to cover it.2. Currently, we only work with two blockchains, BTC and BNB. The address format for these blockchains is different, and you need to specify a wallet address separately for each. Have your own wallet for BTC and a separate one for BNB. Moreover, this is done so that if you ever want to receive funds on different SEEDs, you can. 3. We cannot convert anything since no money goes to our accounts, and we cannot even indirectly influence the payment. Your buyer will have the address of your wallet indicated in the BCON invoice. That is, if you are paid in BTC, BTC will go to the corresponding wallet. If paid in BNB, BNB will be received in the corresponding BNB wallet. How you handle these funds, whether you convert them to stablecoins or another cryptocurrency, is entirely up to you. You are your own bank.4. Refunding the user. What prevents you from refunding the user in the same way as in traditional payments? I do not know how your specific operations will be recorded on your website, but you should have an order number and an invoice number that has been settled. You can also record the blockchain transaction number in your database to precisely track the specific payment. If you do not have this data and do not want to modify your database to store it, at least keep the invoice data, order number, date, and amount. As for other data, such as transaction IDs and wallet addresses, you can track them in the BCON dashboard. We also provide CSV and Excel exports, and you can integrate this data into your database later or simply perform analytics. I hope I explained it clearly. In the near future, I will try to create a diagram illustrating how our service works, which may make it clearer to you.",

There are no other fees besides the 1%. Furthermore, you can use the wallet connected to us as you wish, for manual payments, for example. We will not charge you a fee for payments that were not made through our API. For instance, if you received 5 payments through your website (via our plugin) and then manually processed an additional 10 payments, you will only be charged a fee for the 5 processed through our plugin.",
