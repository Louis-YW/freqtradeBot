They always ask for a follow, like and retweet and in return they will give away some crypto coins. Strangely the tweets always look the same but are from different users. Hundreds of people are posting their walkers and think this is legit. When I look back at the tweets a few days later I never see any winners posted, or there are no users claiming to have won. To me it seems like an quick and easy way to try abf increase your followers on twitter. Weren't all the Elon Musk fan boys already on twitter before he bought the company? I think there is just less supervision now for the scammers and they are less afraid to get banned.",

Surely, crypto interest started to rise over the past year and early this year, but I highly doubt interest will follow an upward path since June or so. Interest follows price and the bear market we are in doesn't seem too flashy to attract those unfamiliar with this world.Quote from: Mauser on November 29, 2022, 02:20:31 PMI noticed that more crypto words are trending on twitter over the last few weeks.

But interest in the topic has declined since the crypto price crash in June, and the study noted cryptocurrencies may not be an area of growth in the future.So it's seasonal I guess? I expect crypto topics to increase again in the next halving due to the resurgence of so-called trading gurus and crypto ponzi schemes. Campaigns such as airdrops and social media bounties would most likely add to those numbers.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, we don’t have a publicly available report to us to back Reuter’s private session sneak-peak at the data.  One would normally need to see just how the growth is being measured and compared (absolute, relative, etc.), over what timeframe (weeks, months, quarters, years, etc.), aggregates data for how long, and how the categorization is derived. Alongside a vast categorization such as crypto, it would also be nice to get some inner specifics such as subcategorization by specific coin/token, content sentiment, and content origin (i.e. corporate vs non-corporate) and language. This may all be in the internal Twitter report, but besides a heading (from Reuters), there’s nothing else to go by here.My guess is that it’s a multiple year timeframe, judging by some of the mentioned dates in Reuters article (which, by the way, is a month old – october 26 – and is missing out all the late fun).Note: I thought it might have come from this 2022 report, but the content is really 2020/2021 based.",

However, Twitter is a hub for most crypto influencers though. Quote from: AbuBhakar on November 29, 2022, 04:34:46 PMIs there a statistic that show what topic in crypto is the most discussed besides FTX crash and other scam. Because this is bad if crypto is only became trending due to the recent collapses happening on crypto space.I don't think there's a stats for this because Twitter provides trend news based on user selected interests.",

Maybe the OP is thinking that people will send to this forum to learn more about crypto.But in any case, if there will be popularity in terms of crypto discussion, that would be great for this market, as the demand may further increase.",

This means there is a big community behind it that made it this big, and that community has members who own twitter accounts, many of them, twitter and telegram are main 2 places where people chat about crypto.This results with twitter having trend topics regarding crypto at all times and it will keep on growing even more when the bull run comes.
