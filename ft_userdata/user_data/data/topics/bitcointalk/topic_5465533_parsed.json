Even if you make copies on several devices, you still risk data loss because electronic devices are sensitive to various external factors such as heat, moisture, electromagnetic radiation, electric shocks, virus-infected devices, and more. I think that a piece of paper, or even better, a metal plate, is a safer solution.You do not have to encrypt the seed phrase because you can simply create a BIP39 passphrase.

This is another advantage of a BIP39 passphrase: you can have two (or more) wallets with the same seed phrase. One can serve as a decoy (with a small amount of coins), and the other, kept secret, can be your main hodl wallet. So, if someone gets their hands on your seed phrase, all they will be able to access is your decoy wallet with a small amount of coins. Your main stash in the secret wallet remains safe.What is a BIP39 Passphrase?https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-bip39-passphrase",

But what if you forget your hiding spot? It would be a single point of failure.USB flash devices can fail (happened to me), so don't rely on only one backup device!You wrote your mnemonic recovery words on a computer that was likely online and with unknown security status. This should be avoided and you may consider your mnemonic recovery words as not safe anymore. (Depends on what daily internet \"shit\" you do on that computer.) Mnemonic recovery words of wallets should only treated on offline and non-digital devices like paper or metal backup.You could use Veracrypt or Bitlocker or something similar and reliable. But again, don't do that with your mnemonic recovery words on a digital device that will go online any time later. Boot a live Linux that solely runs in RAM or TAILS, both have to stay offline, if you play with private keys and/or mnemonic recovery words, so that after shutdown none of your secret keys and words are retained on the used computer.",

Nevertheless, If OP insists on digital backup I would advocate for industrial grade SSD card (in micro or micro format) instead of ordinary USB flash drive. Those cards have an incredible life span, are less damageable  and  much easier to hide (or carry in the course of relocation)  than  bulk drives (even of 2.5\" size).",

I understand you and I think that you are also right, and disks are also different from one another, there are some with even longer lifespan.

No matter how you later have to face the problem of losing access to this file due to a USB flash drive malfunction or the inability to decrypt data due to lost password. Besides, how are you going to store the password from an encrypted USB flash drive so that your relatives don't peep? Create another one? Don't forget to make duplicates of your USB flash drive, and also think about writing the seed phrase not on a piece of paper, as you did, on another storage medium that has better safety characteristics (protection from water, fire, acids, etc. ). For example, a stainless steel plate.",
