If your team members have posted what you think is good, and what you consider merit worthy by your own standards, thus why hesitate to merit them. Tbh, there's no need to feel uneasy about that, the only thing you shouldn't do with merits is to sell them, or merit your alt accounts.",

If you merit their posts in other topics of the forum (unrelated to the project you're working on then it's fine) - even if you have a slight bias towards team members (as long as you're distributing your merits enough to other users too).",

How would you look at it?If it's a merit worthy post, then it is deserving of merits regardless of the personal relationship with the account.There may be a light argument on how you could have a biased view when checking out such posts, but drawing the line for where personal interest meets objective judgement would be a thin one.I dare say a lot of users here have developed fondness for certain profiles and look out for their post to merit. This is purely based on the quality of their posts and not for any alterior motive.Quote from: Casino Critique on August 17, 2022, 12:08:10 PMHow would you judge it if you are in the same situation? I would like to have some discussion and based on that I will take a note if I should or should not.I will not refrain from meriting such profiles, but I would put in an extra effort to be objective when deciding which of such posts are merit worthy.",

The person you are sending the merits doesn't matter, what matters is the quality of the post, in as much as it is not your alt.2. If one person keeps making quality post, continue to send the merits to the one person.3. Instead of you sending 1 merit to 50 non quality posts, it is better to send 50merits to 1 deserving post.And many more I cannot remember now.",

And for this project or business, it's the exposure and the number of investors that count, how much money they can bag because they created a Ann thread in this community and not for the merits.",

You might get challenged, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're in the wrong. There has been a certain standard set by the community, and as long as the posts are somewhat conforming to that standard I don't see too much of a issue. It only becomes an issue if you're doing it for other reasons, rather than the quality of their posts. The thing is, merit has become almost absolutely associated with earning opportunities due to signature campaigns, so users tend to become suspicious due to the fact you're looking to exploit merit, and therefore enrol alternate accounts on signature campaigns. If that isn't the case or you aren't looking to exploit it in another way, like I said you shouldn't have too many major problems.",

I've seen them post merit a lot, but as a business account they're bound to have limited interaction on many topics other than just focusing on their own business.
