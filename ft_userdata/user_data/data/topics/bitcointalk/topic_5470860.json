  "content": "I have been mining with anout 50 30 series cards for the past year and a half, and got my first kaspa asics a couple months ago.  I just recently got an itch to solo mine btc (I understand the risks and actually had great sucess solo mining ethereum finding 7 blocks in about 3 months)So i have a s19k pro arriving tomorrow and want to set it solo and forget it power here is only .08 per kwh so power is rather cheap1.  Is there a site where i can view what pools have produced the solo blocks?2.  What should i set difficulty at for s19k pro or am i better off not setting difficulty?3.  Where is ckpool servers? I am located on west coast usa4.  Where can I check pool latency/ping?Thank you all so much!!",

      "body": "You are looking for a pool website that just solved a solo block to encourage your mining journey? I don't know how this will help because just because a solo mine was solved on a pool doesn't mean you will be lucky on the same pool, do not worry yourself, just find a popular bitcoin mining pool and connect your asic miner, since you have a long term goal you will be fine. I suggest you leave things at default settings and let the asic do its thing, you claimed you as ready to do this for long, how long are we talking about? Visit CKpool itself and pretend as if you want to connect your miner, you will be given different server location, USA and others should be present there. Every miners always want to be sure that they are on the fastest server I get it, you can use this to do your thing. https://stratu.ms/latency-check",

      "body": "To answer your questions:1. The most common solo pools which I would recommend are kano.is and the solopool from CK. Here are some statistics about the blocks found for CK's solo pool: https://btc.com/stats/pool/Solo%20CK2. With your S19k you should reach around 130 TH/s - I would recommend using the default port which is '3333'3. Only thing that I found about the location of the server is this post. Hosted in Vint Hill, Virginia US4. Easiest way on windows would be with cmd. Open cmd and type this prompt:Code:ping solo.ckpool.org -p 3333 You should get an output with ur latency. Keep in mind that you should use this command from the location of ur miner. Not sure right now if you are hosting it @ home.",

      "body": "Like I mentioned before easiest way to check our latency to a specific server would be to use the cmd on Windows or terminal on Mac/Linux.This value is certainly more accurate than check-host.net which u were using. I tried it aswell and it used a different geolocation.The command is the same on all systems:Code:ping server-address## In your case for viabtc: ping btc.viabtc.io",
