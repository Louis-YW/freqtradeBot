Which wallet are you using?Safepal If you are using a SafePal wallet, I don't know how secure the wallet is. But that's not the case here.You can just check the transaction history like I said above. If you click on Bitcoin and check the recently received transaction, you will see the last address you received Bitcoin from and the amount.Or you can copy your own address and search through Blockchain Explorer to see the full details because most wallets don't show full transaction histories.",

How do I do that? Click on the transactions history to show you how much the sender spent and how much fee was deducted from the sender then include both fees and yours fees to get exact amount that was sent to you, I think this is a simple task, no matter the address you are using you scan it through. Sometimes you may pay higher fees than the sender this now moved down to what Bitmover was asking about which wallet you are using.",

I think he actually wants to use the coins he got from the last address, not send them back to where they came from.@yat97, I don't know about the Safepal wallet specifically, but you should look to see if you have a coin control feature, as bitmover said. Some wallets support this, such as Electrum or Bitcoin Core. If your wallet does not support this function, I think your only alternative is to import your private keys into another wallet. Be careful with this and never share your private key with anyone or enter it into online websites or unverified software.",

It’s pointless to use a hardware wallet if the seed doesn’t remain locked in it. Once you inserted the seed in a computer, your security has been significantly lowered.",
