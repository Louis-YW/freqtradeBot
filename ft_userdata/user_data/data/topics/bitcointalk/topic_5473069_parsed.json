Ideally forums or pages that are not full of scammers and spam bots! Well such discussions go on a lot here in the forum,  and all that you need to do to lay your hands on them is a simple search,  and if you discovered that what you are looking is not yet discussed here,  you may have to create thread like this to ask your questions and members will gladly help you with whatever information you need,  because here we have more altcoin investors and traders that will easily without stress offer you a guide through. But also most of the cryptocurrency exchanges like binance have such features where other binance users offers that trading and general investment analysis,  you may fine them helpful for this purpose.",

Is there a particular section of this site where TA and PA is discussed, or is it just on th alt section and btc section?Yes, you can discuss TA/PA in speculation sections, Bitcoin Speculation and Altcoin Speculation.Regarding other places to discuss crypto TA, it's mostly on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. Start with following some crypto Twitter accounts who likes to share TA, over time you may stumble upon some high quality group/chats in Telegram or Discord.",

Ideally forums or pages that are not full of scammers and spam bots! There are sections here where trading discussions and analysis thrive. I also think Reddit is a good place to check. Personally though, I'd recommend more \"doing\" rather than just imply talking abt it everytime. If you still consider yourself to be inexperienced, then you can try your hands on demo trading on platforms like Bitget. It's a great way to indulge yourself while also learning the att of discipline. With experience like that and the knowledge you'll gain frm talking to more experienced folk here, I'm sure your growth will be much faster.",

Ideally forums or pages that are not full of scammers and spam bots! As a way of recommendation I will suggest you check out Trading View for your charting and price action as they have good and accurate market charts for currencies and cryptocurrency. Discord and GitHub has got good channels where you find genuine traders give out quality discussion and educational materials that will help you a long way, although there are others two but the as are few amongst may which I can recommend.",

Ideally forums or pages that are not full of scammers and spam bots! Op you can get what you are looking for here in the this forum, you just have to make some searches and you'll get there. Beside I don't think this forum allow any spam bot except you are referring to some persons who engage in the act, but that shouldn't be a problem if you follow the forum rules and not share any personal details. This forum is filled with divers kind of people with different knowledge and approach to a single problem, so you'll find very useful opinion from forum members if you ask the right question in the right board.",
