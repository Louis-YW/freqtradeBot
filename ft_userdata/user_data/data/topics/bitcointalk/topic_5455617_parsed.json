Same as the mens football, here also we were able to see very little countries from the Asian continent. Hope this changes in the upcoming world Cups as different sports were started to get importance against the audience getting stagnant towards particular games.Placing bets on these matches will be surely interesting, because quite often we can see the underdog winning the match. This needs to be promoted well and given importance as the mens football. Only then we'll be able to get more good players as well as motivate women to start their football career.",

I wonder whether has anything to do with the FIFA or the culture behind this sport itself. Anyways, Ill try to keep an eye on the developments of this tournament. Go Argentina.",

There are countries that I'm convinced will go far; England has a wonderful squad, and I believe they can perform even better than our expectations; it's vital to give credit to those who deserve it, and the Englishwomen are up for it. According to the evaluations, England has a decent chance of reaching the final, as opposed to other squads that appear to be struggling. Nonetheless, we should not overlook any country in the World Cup because it is a high-level competition in which we demand the best from all participants.",

In women's football, Argentina is not one of the top teams. I checked the odds for this event, and it looks like USA, England and Spain are the most favored ones. https://www.forbes.com/betting/soccer/womens-world-cup-2023/USA: +225England: +300Spain: +600Germany: +700France: +900I checked the schedule and was surprised to see teams like Haiti, Philippines and Vietnam. The women's edition seems to be much more diverse, when compared to the men's edition. They provided only 3 slots to CONMEBOL, and that was my only complaint. BTW, FIFA hasn't increased the number of participants for the women's world cup. Even for the 2027 event, the number of participants stand at 32 (for the men's event it has been increased to 48).",

I will give it a try this time when I am less busy to see they can catch up my attention on the games. To know the country that will win their games,I guess one can get a little knowledge from the odds.My country is playing and for that reason,if I don't watch any of the matches,I will create out time to watch my country's match. I think Brazil or USA might be the winner in this year women world cup because I expect that these countries are strong and are more favorite to win the cup.",

But then women's football is an entirely different domain. In the last 10-15 years, I might have watched a maximum of 2-3 women's matches.

Since Brazil is most football playing country, I believe they gonna win.Well, I think that now top players is quite well known. I think many heard about Ballon D'or winner Alexia Putellas, one of best US player Alex Morgan or Allisha Lehmann (mainly because of her Instagram.I followed Champions league a bit and teams were playing in full huge stadiums like Camp Nou, Emirates or Stamford Bridge, not some training grounds like in past. Women football done big steps forward in recent years. Last week Champions league final was played and Barcelona won it by making comeback from 0:2 to 3:2 against Wolfsburg. But still, there was some moments and goals that you can see only in women football.Quote from: Sithara007 on June 09, 2023, 02:25:55 AMBTW, FIFA hasn't increased the number of participants for the women's world cup. Even for the 2027 event, the number of participants stand at 32 (for the men's event it has been increased to 48). In 2019 World Cup 24 teams played, now we have 32, what is too much IMO. So far it's way too early to talk about 48 teams, there isn't so many teams in world now who can play good level football. And I also don't like decision to increase number of teams in men World Cup.",

Back in the 1990s, we used to have such one-sided matches in men's football as well. But now the gap between the top teams and the tier-2 teams have narrowed down. Same will happen with the women's game, but it is going to take some time and a lot of investment from the FIFA. I agree that we will not witness an equivalent of Morocco reaching the semi-finals within the next decade in women's football.

Contrary to what happens in men's football, where good players emerge with almost no investment, in women's football a strong investment is needed to attract people to this sport. Perhaps African countries will be in the worst position in this field, both for cultural and economic reasons.But things are looking up, and in 10-20 years, it will be an equally popular sport.",
