  "content": "A month ago, namely on 20/09/2024, an event occurred that can be entered into the Guinness Book of Records.From 5 bitcoin addresses, one person transferred 250 BTC (50 from each address).To date, this has been the longest holding of accounts on blockchain addresses on the Bitcoin network.These were 5 accounts:Created 29/01/2009 – 1C4rE41Kox3jZbdJT9yatyh4H2fMxP8qmDCreated 30/01/2009 – 18E5d2wQdAfutcXgziHZR71izLRyjSzGSXCreated 31/01/2009 – 13J8FkimCLQ2EnP1xRm7yHhpaZQa9H4p8ECreated 31/01/2009 – 1MBBJBFEaYKHFZAeV7hQ7DWdu3aZktjzFHCreated 02/02/2009 – 1CGT3Ywaa2upJfWtUtbXonDPNTfZPWqzmALet me remind you:03/01/2009 – Satoshi Nakamoto generated the first Bitcoin block (received 50 BTC).10/01/2009 – The second to generate a block was the late Hal Finney (received 50 BTC).12/01/2009 – First transaction, Satoshi transferred 10 BTC to Hal Finney.Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney were the first to start mining Bitcoin, so there is a very high probability that these accounts were created by Satoshi Nakamoto himself.It is surprising that few people pay attention to this outstanding event.For people who do not know how the public blockchain works, I will remind you how easy it is to verify this information. For example, I will show only one address.Transactions from addresseshttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/BTC/1C4rE41Kox3jZbdJT9yatyh4H2fMxP8qmDhttps://i.ibb.co/hKY3qMF/1.pngThe date of creation of the addresshttps://i.ibb.co/CJbKQjY/2.pngStorage time: 15 years and 8 monthsTransactions to addresseshttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qqhvkehsyr2rlrdvq4udtp8tfj75k6kcnd9n7lqblockchain.com Transactionshttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/8bee6dbdbc09253ffbe51e35a910ef39428fc2ca05aa39ce0f1adaebbf8f2cfemempool.space Transactionshttps://mempool.space/tx/8bee6dbdbc09253ffbe51e35a910ef39428fc2ca05aa39ce0f1adaebbf8f2cfeWhat is known about Bitcoin in the Guinness Book of Records?ChatGPT responds:Bitcoin has entered the Guinness World Records in several categories. It was recognized as the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, developed as a solution for financial transactions without the need for intermediaries. This project, started in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, followed earlier unsuccessful attempts to create digital currencies.Bitcoin also holds the title of the most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization reaching $816.69 billion in March 2022. Notably, the Guinness World Records mentions events like the first commercial Bitcoin transaction in 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC — now celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.Additionally, the record book acknowledges El Salvador as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.",
