  "content": "Nutildah's Bounty Cleanup & Alt Detection ServiceA clean, fair and efficient way to elevate your campaign standardsWho is this service for?Bounty and signature campaign managers only.What is this service?While the terms for several bounty & signature campaigns contain a clause that states alt accounts are not allowed to participate and/or cheaters will be disqualified w/o payment, account farms controlled by a single person (or a handful of people) continue to run rampant on the forum. Bounty managers may not have time to double-check that every participant is playing by the rules. This can have the following negative consequences:Needless overpayment of tokens/BTC/ETH/etc.Low quality promotional activity by participants.Dissatisfaction of client could lead to reduced payment or discontinuation of campaign.Extra work for bounty/campaign manager.Using time-tested, peer-approved methods that result in a high rate of accuracy, my service roots out rulebreakers, cheaters & low-performance members of your campaign, raising the quality of campaign results while lowering costs, saving both you and your client valuable time & money.How will you go about doing this?While the needs of bounty/signature campaign managers vary, the primary service involves identifying alt account farms, cheaters & banned users through a number of established methods that are both transparent and sensible. These include account association via shared social media IDs, shared crypto addresses & in some cases, shared crypto deposit addresses. Offending accounts are then red tagged and thus rendered ineligible for campaign participation.Some of the tools used for this purpose include ninjastic.space, bpip, loyce.club, and block explorers like bscscan, etherscan, blockchain.com, etc. I currently have 907 campaign member addresses tagged with forum account names in bscscan, which makes it easier to quickly identify alts and account farms:Because of the need for transparency to ensure fairness, all results will be posted in a separate, non-moderated Reputation thread where accounts tagged as bounty cheaters / ban evaders / etc. can appeal the findings, and other members of the community can express their concerns/views. All campaign members subject to analysis will be treated in a fair and consistent manner.How much does it cost?As of now, there are two different options being offered which have different fee rates:1) Bounty campaign investigation: I receive 50% of the payment that would have gone to campaign participants (up to the point of the investigation) that are found to be breaking campaign rules, whether it be in BSC tokens, ETH tokens, TRX tokens, etc. This option is reserved for bounties that are at least halfway concluded.2) Signature campaign investigation: I will analyze your campaign, subsections of the campaign, or individual accounts at a rate of $25 per hour, payable in BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, TRX, USDT, or any major (top 20) cryptocurrency. Smaller campaigns may only take 1-3 hours while larger campaigns may take 8 or more hours. The minimum payment for any investigation is $25.Qualifications:4-years experience in detecting alt accounts220+ negative feedbacks left for bounty & sig campaign cheatersI'm consistently in the top 10-15% of most DT-included users (when selected for DT1)Submitted over 2000 reports to moderators (>93% good, ~5.3% unhandled, <1% bad)Relevant Threads:Nutildah's bounty cheaters & ban evaders threadLong-time sig campaign farm ID'd via single wallet transactionAI Spam Report Reference ThreadIf you have any questions about how this service will work not covered in this post, feel free to ask below! If this sounds like something that may be of interest to you, please feel free to send me a PM so we can discuss terms & scope of operation. I'm not sure this has ever been tried before but I strongly believe this service could be of mutual benefit to both managers and their clients, resulting in significant savings for campaigns of all types & sizes.(this thread is self-moderated: posts by spammers & trolls will be deleted)",

So if its an 8-week bounty and 4 weeks have gone by, it would be 50% x 4 weeks of earnings; granted tokens aren't being distributed until the end of the campaign.Quote from: Little Mouse on December 06, 2023, 03:21:37 PMb. It is possible that with the evidence, you may find someone is alt of another user while some other community member may not be convinced. What will be the solution here?The evidence will be presented in such a way that a majority of forum members looking at it would come to the same conclusion. If reasonable objections are voiced, I will remove the user's negative tag. I have done this in the past in my Bounty Cheaters & Ban Evaders thread. Sometimes with bounty hunters, someone is legitimately buying tokens from several individual, non-connected campaign members. Other times its clear one person is collecting tokens into one address from several different accounts. This issue doesn't occur on the sig campaign/BTC side of things.Quote from: Igebotz on December 06, 2023, 03:34:52 PMYou're good at what you do but many people are already doing this for free.

If it is a trash bounty campaign, of course, the manager is not even expected to pay for checking the participants. I assume that the OP won't even accept payment in some trash token. Simply, you cannot fix a bad project, no matter how much effort and money you invest in a marketing campaign.On the other side, if it is a campaign or a legal project, and if it is run by a manager who cares about a good result from the campaign he runs, I believe that he will willingly pay for the analysis of the work of bounty hunters.",

Why not just run the bounty campaign yourself then, as you're doing most of the heavy lifting.Let me give you my personal opinion. Managing bounty campaigns and checking alts/bounty cheaters are two different jobs, and both are difficult. Campaign managers are required to have organizational skills, manage the running of the campaign, communicate with clients, arrange payments, validate eligible posts, and so on. Some campaign managers may not have time to double-check their participants, or there are some things they missed. So this service makes a lot of sense to me. This does not mean that this service will be 100% able to clear the bounty. But this is like installing additional safeguards to control the quality of the bounty according to the campaign manager's standards.",
