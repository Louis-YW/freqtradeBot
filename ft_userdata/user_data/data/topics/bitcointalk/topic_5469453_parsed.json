But learning how to use trading to make profit can take months or a year or more, although learning the strategies can not take more than weeks but learning how to control emotions can take months. I learn trading myself and it took me some days, but I lost money to trading very well. I learn more and more and now better than before and it takes me more than a year. One thing I know about trading is to never use the amount of money that you can not afford to lose to trade.",

      "body": "The duration is dependent on how you were able to learn, there is absolutely no time frame set aside for trading. The nine month’s ultimatum given to you by the tutor is just is set out time for student because he is running it like a school or local hand trade and in cases like this they do not consider maybe you got a grasp of it, they just want to teach you and move to the next student. You can be able to grasp it within that or you would not. The best thing is the fundamental and Technical analysis that your teacher taught you should just be practice and as you get used to trading only then you can grow because experience is the best teacher. But make sure you follow Oshosondy advice, trade with any amount you can afford to lose",

Some persons understand faster than some persons, while some persons need to be taught for two to three times before they can understand. The basic knowledge of trading, which is the fundamental and technical analysis can be learnt within a short period of time, but the practical, which is trading can take a long period of time because as you continue trading, you will continue learning different strategy that you think will work out for you. When you try such strategy and it didn't work out, you come up with another strategy and so on, until you get a good one that favors you. This is why trading is a continuous exercise and has no specific time frame to learn it all.",

Learning never ends, because trading is broad and can not be covered within the range of months or even years. We learn and grow in the space, having the potential abilities to grow our accounts to standardized form, gaining experience is also necessary when trading the market because it's an open place were alot of activities is triggered. I would advised you to fully understand the market, the important basis of trading, and always trade what you can afford to lose, that's the simple fact about the system. There's basis about the market we need to know about. Trading is risky and we ought to know what we basically need inother to be able to place trades.",

It is not as easy as beginners imagine when they want to start trading - even 9 months is not necessarily enough to equip themselves with analytical knowledge and understand the market as a whole.Having a mentor to learn trading with is great - but I hope they actually teach you analysis, not easy ways to make profits. If you master analysis - then you will be able to develop your own talent in trading. Many successful traders understand good analysis and also have good trading psychology - so if someone is only taught the basics of trading then I'm not sure they can trade well.",

The patience to stay with your trading simulation environment until you know you are ready so that you do not blow your account. Also the patience to stick to a strategy without jumping from one strategy to another. Quotedid it take you weeks, months or years? Do you think that trading can be learnt well in a short time like three weeks for a quick trader?Months and years is the appropriate time to learn about trading. Trading cannot be learned in weeks until it is a professional trader who is transitioning from forex trading to crypto trading.  QuoteCan soprofessional a proffesional trader just go straight to the point pointing out what is needed to make a successful trader to a newbie to learn quickly? Quickly you say? Nope, why rush when you know it is something that would make you a lot of money. Any trader who rushes you wants to get your money and run away. Learning takes time and hours. It is not something that can be rushed through.",

Actually, trading is a long term process and every one takes a long time before they learn how to gamble the thing that is needed to workout over time is how to get patience and learn that you cannot learn trading in just days or weeks. Even I and my uncle still learning this until now and we sometimes has a problem with that and sometimes it makes me frustrated because I get some mistakes in my SL.",

Can someone who is a proffesional trader just go straight to the point pointing out what is needed to make a successful trader to a newbie to learn quickly? Personally, I believed that trading is a continuous learning as every trade you make will teach you a lesson. In my opinion, how long you have been trading isn't enough to measure all the things you've learn about trading, as there are traders who have been into trading but does not make an efficient trading. The way I see it, the best way to measure your learnings about trading is how much experience you have acquired on your trading journey. I think this also depends on the person, because some can learn and adapt to trading with just a few months, but others took them years before fully learning. For me, technical analysis and the basics of trading can be learned in just a few months, but learning patience and discipline would take you a lifetime.",

It's because trading doesn't totally depend on your strategy but on your emotions.They say it's difficult because it's stressful and once you're stressed, it affects your way of trading.

The part that takes an excessively long amount of time is to practice and get mastery of not just the technical skills you'll learn but also skills like risk management and emotional strength (as well intelligence).You can learn the basics/get trading foundations in a few days or a couple of weeks but the real hurdle comes with the application and mastery that will take the most times which could span months or even years depending on how you experience and handle those situations.",

In weeks, you can learn some basic from that experience but it won't make you a good trader. Mostly everyone had learned trading for years. The successful ones. But if you're just there to learn then a week or a couple of months will be enough but that doesn't make you a winner unlike the successful ones who dedicated years for their trades.Quote from: Stepstowealth on October 06, 2023, 06:09:35 PMDo you think that trading can be learnt well in a short time like three weeks for a quick trader?

You can learn basics pretty fast, but there are more things to learn then most people have time to learn. It's like asking, how long does it take to learn coding. Depends how good of a coder you want to be and what you will be coding. As there are ton of different indicators that you can study, different kind of trading styles and ways to get fundamental insights. But no amount of technical analysist skills can ensure that you'll even make a living of it. And most likely there always be lucky small cap traders who make 10000 times with one lucky bets on what you will make in years. So don't imagine it being profitable. To be profitable trader you'll need more than skills. You need luck and funds to play with. And a safe enough system that you won't instantly lose everything.",

In any area, even without dedicating yourself professionally, the greatest theoretical preparation is always required and over time, or at the same time practical, and today with how easy it is to start trading, the phrase \"anyone can trade\"... always comes to mind... \"but not everyone can pay your bills.\"So, in conjunction with what was mentioned before, get a bankroll, you must know how to manage it and start based on what you know, and evolve, it is something that you have to explore for yourself.by the way, the term professional is very used lightly when it comes to \"trading\" crypto, and anyone who has an account verified on any exchange or simply because they have been trading for years, thinks they are professionals, well, if can you to pay your bills, responsibilities with the income generated by that activity, So,you are one.In any case, what is important about trading is understanding that you can go many months without seeing profits, hence If you are going to dedicate yourself full time, trading should be the income plan \"C\" and not the main one.Although if you dedicate yourself to futures it is another story, there are many things you can do, and that in itself is a key, you have to know what type of trade you want to do.So, learning can take you a couple of days, it is not necessary 9 months, but mastering it will take you a lifetime.It is important to clarify, I am not a professional trader. I regret that my advice does not have that certification, but I do have something called experience",
