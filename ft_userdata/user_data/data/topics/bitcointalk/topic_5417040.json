The Bitcoin forum and website are different:Bitcointalk.org is the forum,Bitcoin.org is the website for the coin/network: Bitcoin; and additionally,Bitcoincore.org is the website for the reference client: Bitcoin Core.satoshi is inactive so he can't maintain the forum nor bitcoin.org.If you're looking for the current owner of bitcointalk.org, look for the \"admin\" position.

Yes Satoshi was the founder of bitcoin and since then he has remained anonymous and also have been offline hence the above listed people from #3 were the people who kept the site moving and being active as well. I strongly believe his disappearance was the reason for bitcoin to live till date so I don't really question about him not being active.All your questions have been answered and yet if you still feel not yet satisfied you can as well make use of google maybe some lighter note might be seen over there.",

Thanks Hey, you've been here for long enough -- Enough to know these things that you ask. I mean, from your post history, you made links viable, which is not something a NEWBIE does. I'm not scrutinizing... that'll be rude.The name of this site is bitcointalk.org NOT bitcoin.org; the are two different sites with different domain.Yes, Satoshi created this site, as well as the functions init. They haven't been active lately and the site can't run itself (maintenance wise), so the domains were designated to two different Peeps: Theymos and CobrÃ£ respectively. I sure hope that information to quench your curiosity, otherwise, follow those links above.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

Thanks Good question Orpichukwu actually this question comes to everyone's mind and I have seen many experts forget the main point when discussing such questions.Remember rule #1 Bitcoin is an open source software running on a peer-to-peer network. That's it, there's no such thing called an \"official bitcoin website\", \"official bitcoin forum\" or \"official social media account\". Any website or forum or social media account is owned by someone and that someone is not satoshi. Let it be bitcoin.org or bitcointalk.org no one is representing bitcoin officially (unless something is agreed by the community / developers).Bitcoin source code is available on github and for your reference bitcoincore.org domain is only for the distribution of latest releases (executables) of bitcoin source code (bitcoin core).So in short referring to your post bitcoin.org yes it belongs to Cobra, cobra is someone related to bitcoin since the time of Satoshi and same goes to theymos but they donâ€™t own or represent \"Bitcoin\".One more thing, do you know the so-called official but not so official twitter handle of bitcoin \"@Bitcoin\" with 5.5million followers was once promoting bitcoin cash (BCH)? But later at some stage presumably was \"sold\" Â to someone who favors Bitcoin. Whoever he is, people speculate is someone who has been involved in bitcoin since 2009, but he/she/they must be making good money through this handle alone.Well some say this twitter handle is now in control of \"Trace Mayer\", someone who hosted the first bitcoin conference in 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgpDuH17T0YTo conclude bitcoin doesn't need an owner or something like \"official\", it is run by people and owned by people like you and me, rest anything else websites, forums, social medias not officially related to bitcoin at all.",

Theymos and Cobra reached an agreement to split bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org completely and release their half control of the others' domain.This is the answer that you are looking for. I think you didn't know already who's the admin of this forum now. As of now, the one who take care of this forum is theymos (The Administrator of this forum) and you can consider theymos as one of the owner of Bitcointalk in my own opinion since theymos is an admin as I have said. You guess it right that satoshi is the creator of Bitcoin. I am not sure if you know the complete name of the founder which is Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto is not the real name of the founder if that's what you are thinking. If you did some research then you'll see that Satoshi Nakamoto is the name that is used by a pseudonymous person or a group of person who created or developed Bitcoin and also the author of Bitcoin white paper.",
