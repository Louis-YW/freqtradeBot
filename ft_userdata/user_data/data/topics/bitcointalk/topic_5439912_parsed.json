So now watin be the advantage of this new redesign naira note.",

      "body": "If I am not mistaken, I just think all these happened all of a sudden just to hold some people standstill at the detriment of the masses. As you can see for yourself, the election is fast approaching, there would be a massive withdrawal of money and in circulation. So the strategy was to change the naira note so that those that have already stashed it up will definitely return it back to the bank and face efcc or hide it and loose virtually all of it which is currently in play. I just have one feeling that this they have down is just to checkmate the activities of just one person to making sure they are frustrated and their funds all wasted.",
