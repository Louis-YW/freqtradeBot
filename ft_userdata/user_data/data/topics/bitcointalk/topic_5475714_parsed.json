  "content": "About four weeks ago, I consolidated four UTXOs at a very low fee rate. As of today, it hadn't been confirmed, so I then tried to consolidate the unconfirmed but spendable consolidated UTXO with three new UTXOs with a high fee rate thinking that everything would get confirmed together. Now, when I look at the unconfirmed parent, the TXID cannot be found in the mempool, but I see that the fee I paid for the second consolidation is in the mempool. Also, when I hover over the unconfirmed parent, it shows a fee rate of 0.00 sats/vB despite me paying the higher fee on the second consolidation. Anyone know what I should do? I am using Sparrow Wallet.",

      "body": "If you can’t find the first transaction with low fee then it means that the transaction has definitely been dropped from the pool and should be in wallet available for the new transaction. So when you broadcast the second transaction it should be without the existing parent transaction but a fresh transaction and the second isn’t a child transaction. Just check your wallet and you will see the first transaction not longer unconfirmed again but just the usual spendable transaction. Which should be spendable with the other UTXOs.It is worth mentioning that this isn’t the right time to consolidate as fees are still high Quote from: Hatchy on November 27, 2023, 09:49:25 PMYou can start by dropping the tx idThat could affect his privacy, so except there is no other way it is not necessary to drop TXID just all the time",

The first transaction was still in the mempool/unconfirmed, so I just did an RBF on the first Parent at a high fee rate. I see the new RBF transaction in the mempool, expected to confirm within 40 minutes. I'll circle back if that worked!",

Copy your tx id and paste on their accelerator. They are able to accelerate 100 transactions in an hour so you might want to check if there is still a slot or you can wait till the next 1 hour if your transaction is still unconfirmed.",

If the inputs are all pay-to-taproot addresses and the outputs is segwit version 0 or pay-to-taproot address, the size would be around 472 to 484 bytes.",

I just have checked. There's only one free tx accelerator I guess; viabtc. I haven't seen any more free tx accelerator.",
