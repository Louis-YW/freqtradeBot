Keep your money under your sole control and ownership.Especially during these chaotic moments in history, I think people should be urgently advised to withdraw their funds from centralized exchanges. A number of accounts have recently been locked following Israel's response to the attacks of Hamas. I'm not saying they aren't justified, but no implementation is perfect. Anybody's wallet could be locked together with other suspicious accounts. It's not as if you'd be given a day in court when that happens. Your funds will likely be seized immediately.",

Assuming we know how they got access to those wallets and perhaps what the owner did or did not do correctly that made his wallet compromised, then we can learn from that to remain protected. If Hamas goes this direction, I'm afraid his enemies will increase, and I'm sure he does not need that at the moment.",

The article doesn't explain how they stole it. It's just a claim and is still under investigation.I think this could be useful for people who live around or in areas close to conflict areas to maintain and protect wallets for storing assets such as bitcoin so that they are not physically destroyed and lost due to the conflict that occurs.We never know what will happen if wallets containing assets such as bitcoin are not properly secured.",

When people censor a whole picture to reach their target to attack something, someone or some entities, it is no longer facts.North Korea has Lazardus to help them hack many cryptocurrency projects, bridges to bring money back to their dictatorship nation and serve their government.

Like I just said, crypto wallet users are the ones giving hackers the power over them, people are greedy, people are slack, and that's how they get their wallets compromised, keep your private keys and recovery seeds offline. Avoid any only storages they gets easily hacked by hackers, anything that uses email login with a password is not a safe place for your recovery seed. Also avoid free things, when it's too good to be true then it means you are the price, if you have to claim free tokens make sure you have a separate wallet for this, I also believe that a hardware wallet is the safest as it requires the hardware wallet to make transaction anyway, they don't cost a fortune.",

With the cases of exchange hacks and scams and even some where the exchange extort or embezzle the funds of their customers for their own greedy activities I think it's best to always save your crypto-currency funds yourself. But it's not all about saving your funds yourself because if done wrongly you have still meet say faith like those who got caught up in exchange financial issues.Have you own wallet, use a very secured password, additional security with 2FA but still this may not be enough to protect you, using a cold storage wallet helps limit you to the dangers from be online.

He had already lost half a million dollar to the cyber wings of Hamas. ~SnipAlthough there have been no incidents of Hamas stealing crypto from Indian businessmen. Basically, it has become an obligation, that we as crypto investors must always take good care of the crypto assets we own. Apart from that, Hamas only targets countries that are pro-Israel. So I'm not too worried, because as far as I know the country where I live is more pro-Palestinian. But apart from all that, this incident happened quite a long time ago. So most likely, Hamas has stopped carrying out crypto theft operations. Because currently Hamas can be said to be in a state of chaos because of yesterday's events. So the possibility of Hamas committing crypto theft in my opinion is very small.But even so, caution and vigilance must continue to be applied. Because apart from Hamas, there are definitely other individuals or individuals who will always try to hack and steal the assets of crypto investors.Therefore, we must know how to avoid hacking or stealing crypto. And actually the method is quite simple, namely by choosing a non-custodial wallet as a place to store crypto assets. Because by using a non-custodial wallet we will have more freedom in managing the crypto assets we own, and there are no third parties like in Custodian wallets. So it is very likely that crypto assets will be much safer and more controlled.",
