Any help?Did you considered the transaction fee ? For example, if you own 0.1 BTC, you cannot send 0.1 BTC to another address, you have to deduct the transaction fee of your balance.As the others said, please give us more information, which wallet you used, and about the transaction, thus it will be more easy to help you.",

Another thing that can cause is if there's something wrong with the wallet and for this reason, it will be nice if the OP provides an answer to the question previous ask by the above users.",

Any help?The wallet isn't specified but I know one wallet which is notorious of giving that specific error, Blockchain's online wallet.Sadly, those who experienced that error had to contact their customer support or import their recovery phrase to a wallet that supports BIP39 seed.Please consider reading this sticky topic before asking for support: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1741772.0",

If it is not a fake or scam wallet, you can import the wallet seed phrase on Electrum to see your balance to know if truly you still have the coins or not.Assuming that it is the Electrum wallet, which is known to make this kind of error message among other wallets, the error can also happen if the SPV servers haven't finished sending transaction data to the Electrum client, in which case the UTXO set (and thereby the balance) may wildly higher or lower than the actual balance of the addresses of the blockchain.Quote from: LoyceV on June 14, 2023, 05:55:01 PMQuote from: Charles-Tim on June 14, 2023, 04:42:47 PMWhich wallet is that?

The scammer either talks them through setting up a watch only wallet, or sends them a pre-created watch only wallet so the user thinks they own the funds inside.If a user understands the difference between making a regular wallet and a watch only wallet, then they wouldn't fall for the scam in the first place.",

Any help?insufficient funds is a problem that was reported so much by Blockchain.com users that I found this screenshot from this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5259913.0If this is your problem, then you have enough reason to switch to a good open source wallet like Electrum.With a quick Google search, I found that two or three wallets can give the same error, but I think you are using Blockchain.com.Quote from: LoyceV on June 14, 2023, 05:55:01 PMQuote from: Charles-Tim on June 14, 2023, 04:42:47 PMWhich wallet is that?
