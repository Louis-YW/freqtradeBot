Meaning if more miner participants are joining they can find and solve more blocks that will help to speed up confirmation process.

That would only be possible if there was no difficulty adjustment in place. More miners into the network would mean that the hast rate goes up to the roof and after every 2016 blocks, the network difficulty gets automatically adjusted to keep the average transaction time well within the approximate 10-minute interval.",

This was what I thought before and believing that increasing the number of miners will help the network congestion until there's such a user corrected me with my wrong perception. The reason is, those miners are only responsible for processing and confirming transactions, but the speed and efficiency of the network.Because the network matter such as the size of the blocks, the difficulty level of mining, and the overall network bandwidth and increasing the number of miners can potentially help to distribute the workload and increase the processing power of the network but not the speed of transaction.Â  Besides, there is the worst result if there are too many miners,Â  it will increase the competition among miners for block rewards and potentially lead to a greater centralization of the network.However, I tend to agree that removing BRC20 tokens would be given help Bitcoin congestion.",

It just doesn't have certain functionality that would allow creation of tokens.QuoteBitcoin will never offer the transactions per second to support these type of transactions.It is not about TPS or capacity. In other words even if bitcoin could handle 1 GB blocks and a billion transactions per second, these types of spam would still not be tolerated.To put simply it is all about usage. Bitcoin was created to handle transferring money not as a cloud storage.QuoteThe change to allow BRC-20 in Taproot needs to be rolled back.To be clear there is no such thing as \"BRC-20\" in Bitcoin or Taproot. It is not part of the protocol. It is fake centralized term the scammers are using to give their attack some sort of legitimacy in the eyes of the naive.QuoteThis is a dangerous, fatal flaw to the network that could be used to bring an end to Bitcoin.I don't think this can \"end\" bitcoin but it is definitely damaging it real hard and must be prevented.QuoteWhat are your thoughts? Should BRC-20 be removed? What is the best way to do this?Again BRC-20 does not exist anywhere in the protocol to be removed. There is a vulnerability in bitcoin consensus rules that is being exploited by malicious attackers and that must be patched.At this point the best solution is a soft fork to mend the flaw.",
