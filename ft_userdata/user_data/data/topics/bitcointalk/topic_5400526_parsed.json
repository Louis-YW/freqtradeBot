Yes you can earn more if you hit specific number when you roll your lucky number, but it's only little chance you will get higher than the 0-9885 number.Those play to earn games aren't really to earn since you need to have capital to invest on their games/projects/items in order to earn. There's nothing different like you invest on shitcoin, moreover you need an effort and time to play.",

Even miners are doing hard work to get their coins.What would you say to someone who asks you if there are any learn-and-earn programs for Paypal and cash? You would tell them there are none, because they don't exist.Some advice for people reading this thread - to keep your head up in the finance ocean, whether if its your bank account or crypto wallet, requires that you labor for your money. Even creating a scalable business is your laboring for money.This is why I strongly disapprove of all learn-to-earn crypto programs. They give you just a paltry sum insufficient even for 3rd world countries to live on.",

      "body": "Try Cointiply. You can earn small amounts of coins on this site by doing different activities, which are converted to satoshis when you ask for a withdrawal. Most common and rentable method is to earn with surveys and I say that because you get paid even if the survey isn't disponible for your region. Just by trying to open the survey you already receive a reward (of course the reward is much better if the survey is disponible).From all micro earnings sites this is the top one in the world right now. They also pay interest to users who have balances above 30,000 coins, although I think it's not a good idea, since the balance is in \"coins\" and not BTC, what means the more valuable bitcoin gets, less satoshis you will acquire when exchanging coins into btc.But the site is great and launches many promotional codes on their twitter very often distributing extra rewards.",

Why do Coinbase want to entice you to sign up for their site with such \"Learn and earn\" promotions? Because before you can access these promotions, you must first hand over all your personal details and scans of your documents. And then at a minimum they have your name, address, email, phone number, bank details, and the fact that you are interested in crypto. That information can be endlessly monetized by selling to third party advertisers, marketing agencies, governments, and more. Data brokers will buy that information and link it to your social media profiles and other online presence and again resell that to anyone who is interested. If you actually withdraw any coins you earn with them, then now they know some of your addresses as well, and their in-house blockchain analysis company will start working on linking as many different addresses to you as possible. Every extra data point they can gather makes their profile on you more valuable to third parties, and so they can make more profit from endlessly reselling your information.If you think having your data splashed around dozens of companies and accessible by thousands of individuals to use in any way they like is worth it for a few bucks of some shitcoin, then go ahead. Otherwise, you'll get a better return for your time (without the complete loss of privacy) by working a job and then using the money you earn to buy some bitcoin.",

Of course it's not so good like years ago, because currently offers are really scarce, less profitable, not simplified and even confusing. But about 6 or 7 years ago it was possible to earn 0,40$ daily (0,001BTC), just by doing one faucet run, ignoring the low paying ones which can be claimed more frequently and using only faucets which paid every 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours (consequently the rewards were better). The whole process didn't take more than an hour. Moreover, sometimes faucets with big rewards were launched and lasted for few days, until the manager concluded rewards should be calibrated. So it was like a profitable beta test for users during the initial stage of the faucet.Now the best part: those 0,40$ daily held until the last ATH, would represent a daily income of 69$ only by using faucets!",

The linked site has the full instructions and all of the answers to the quizzes.The Binance quiz rewards are always gone instantly.
