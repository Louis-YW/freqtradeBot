There's no point to keep your cryptocurrency at an exchange unless you're a full time trader. Even traders keep their investment in cold wallets and anyone who knows about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would prefer a cold wallet over an exchange's wallet.",

      "body": "Yes, cold wallets are much more safer than storing them in exchanges, if you can imagine what I'm describing to you then you'd understand, picture cold wallets as something like safe in your house, you can store anything in that safe and only a handful can open it without forcing the safe to get to the inside and exchange wallets are like those informal lending that's organized by a group of your acquaintance in your work, they may say that it's safe but there's really nothing that's stopping them from running away with the money or risk the money being stolen because of a thief. So based on how I've described it, it basically means that your cold wallets might be the best thing for storing your bitcoins, just don't forget about how to access them or you'd end up like that dude that's suing the landfill because he can't find the laptop that contains a lot of bitcoin but I digress.Always remember these saying: \"Not your keys, not your coins.\"",

So if I had a large sum of bitcoin, I'd put it in a cold wallet safely secured somewhere that no one would know. However I'd still leave some coins in a wallet located on my phone for emergency purposes as they are more convenient.",

There is no pro in storing coins in a online exchange, it is a blunder.Aside from the coins that are on active orders, do not keep coins on exchanges because you do not hold their private keys and those coins can go into KYC-lockout/exchange hack and limbo and so on.While coins on your own wallet are always ready to be accessed. Hence for storage, a wallet is always the best option.",

The bank can go bankrupt or freeze your assets at any time without prior notice to you while it is your money.Similarly, using a cold wallet gives you full control over your assets, you are like your own bank, you will be responsible for the safety of your assets. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges are even riskier than banks. They can be attacked by hackers, go bankrupt, freeze your assets without notice or compensation to you.

Keeping large amounts in an exchange is risky because you can lose your funds if the exchange is ceased, go bankrupt, or suffer a hack. The funds you keep on centralized exchanges are not your own because you can lose them at any time. But people have come up with several reasons why they use it which include the ability to recover passwords and the ease of exchanging or trading. It is advisable to keep only small funds in exchangesDecentralized cold wallets are suitable for keeping large funds because they are more dependable. You also have total control of your funds which makes it recommendable for long-term hodling. But if you lose your password or seed phrase you might lose your money.",

We've seen exchange hacks and other incidents on which it causes up for someone to lose up money and on the moment that you've been on suchcondition then recovery would really be that so hard. This is why you should really be careful on where you would really be storing your coins with.Always consider out on having that kind of securing your coins rather than on being that too confident with the current set up you do have. We wont know on when unfortunate conditions do happen and this is why we should really be that careful.",

There are hardware wallets that are airgapped, or electrum airgapped cold storage wallets are good.The exchange themselves in which people are keeping their funds in, are using cold storage wallet to keep their SAFU to prevent it from hackers. Only traders should keep their coins in which they are using to trade in an exchange, apart from them nobody should think that an exchange is safe to keep funds. Exchanges are vulnerable to attack and they are in charge of your keys which means that your coins is not yet yours until you have withdrawn it from the exchange.",

However, there are several factors that will warrant one to choose which option, such as;1. If you are a trader, and needs funds/coin for your daily trade, then keeping them in your exchange wallet is far better, as it saves you the stress of transferring funds too and fro using high fees.2. If you are just an ordinary investor who wishes to just buy coin and hold for very long period of time, then storing it on a cold wallets is far better, as it grants you the full control over it.",

Yes you might feel like because you see the amount of funds displayed on your exchange account, you literally own the funds in that account but the truth is that you as an exchange users, creating an account with them is like giving them your funds to keep and do what ever they want with it. For large amounts of funds, make sure to store them in cold storages. The risk of losing funds using cold storage is very low compared to another form of storage. As long as you keep your keys safe. People who store their funds on exchanges account are mostly short term traders who performs daily transactions. But as a normal holder, short term or long term, you should avoid keeping funds in exchanges.",

If you store assets on an exchange, then the assets are not yours, but theirs. How is that possible? Because the address obtained from the exchange to receive and send is not controlled by us.
