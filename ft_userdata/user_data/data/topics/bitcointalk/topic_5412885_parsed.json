So it's only natural that the circulation of money into the crypto market now and in the next few months will decrease (or not at all)",

      "body": "Regarding this there is a related fact. The reference index against which the variable interest payment on mortgages is usually applied in EU countries, Euribor, has exceeded 2% today. As has been the case throughout the year, it has been on an upward trend, so new mortgages will be more expensive and people who already have a mortgage, if they have it at variable interest, they will pay more when it is reviewed (usually every 6 or 12 months).This is another reason to think that there will be less money circulating and less money in people's pockets.",

The bank is taking very seriously not just the inflation but what the FED is doing and what the US is doing in respect to the Euro (basically eating it alive). The commitment as you say seems strong, like a signal to the market that they care more about macroeconomics than about the situation of people in Europe.",

It happened in my country as well. I was paying an interest rate of 7.5% on my mortgage and last week it has been increased to 8.3%. Both my EMI and loan tenure got increased. I will now have to look into my finances more closely to reduce the extra expenditure. I doubt at this scenario, investment will flow into bitcoin. Rather people can take out their money from bitcoin and invest in banking assets as the interest rate has been increased. That's usually what happens!",

Many of these countries are heavily in debt and rely on refinancing their loans each year. With higher interest rates the monthly interest payment is going to increase and will leave less money for other things in the budget. Nonetheless reacted the ECB way too slow, we have been dealing with high inflation rates for the whole year almost. During winter economicst predict a double digit inflation rate and for next year they forecast 6%. The interest rate increase by the ECB will have no big impact to reduce inflation. The ECB is clearly more concerned about countries as a whole and not about the average person who is trying to save some money each month. The problem remains that we don't get any interest on our cash compared to the high inflation rate, the only solution is to invest.",

Which could bode well for crypto alts and tokens which are better positioned to cope with inflation.I think the general rule of thumb says as long as inflation continues to rise at a high pace, banks will be forced to follow.",

So it does not seem that large amounts of money are going to go into BTC soon.Unfortunately cheap and easy money is the easiest way for all of these central bankers to stay popular, so they're happy to ignore any potential problems for as long as possible - even when they could have been more proactive about handling it years ago. Now we're seeing this kneejerk, but frankly necessary, reaction to increase rates at unprecedented levels because inflation has gotten so carried away. If they had slowly and incrementally increased it as the world came out of recession, or even 5 years ago after the last financial crisis was a distant memory, then it would be possible to take a much more balanced approach. Hard to call these bankers responsible, but they're also under a lot of pressure all the time from short term politicians.",

Quote from: Hydrogen on September 10, 2022, 01:38:50 PMI think the general rule of thumb says as long as inflation continues to rise at a high pace, banks will be forced to follow.Until now, Central Banks did not want to raise rates because their economies are very addicted to liquidity. Withdrawing liquidity we know that it leads to crises. I helps to fight inflation because less money available means less demand, but less demand also leads to job losses, etc. One problem I see is that this inflation is not so much about high demand as it is about rising energy prices, so attacking demand without attacking energy prices cannot give a good result, only partially good if that's the case. I think they are going to raise rates but when they start to see serious problems on the demand side and inflation has calmed down a little, they will stop raising them immediately, otherwise they will take the opportunity to lower them again, albeit timidly.",

If you think the energy prices are expensive, that only means you are poor and can't afford to pay the price. There are infinite amount of energy in the world. You just have to collect it either via digging or installing solar panels... whichever is cheap.Sure, the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war also affects the prices but Russia is not the only seller in the market. You can always buy energy from somewhere else. I don't think that war affects the prices that much. It is the hugely expanded monetary supply which caused the price rises.",
