If people use Lightning Network, it won't be convenient to use for them, and transaction won't be transparent because they are not registered on a blockchain, if they use a platform it could be more convenient than making LN transactions and faster than doing on-chain ones, but it wouldn't be transparent neither private at all because the platform would know all the transactions, and would be very unlikely to share them publicly. If people use the blockchain, it wouldn't be fast at all, and it would be very hard to pay anything in a brick and mortar store.The problem of inflation would be addressed only if Bitcoin's price did not fall.",

First, I don't think any country would want to make only Bitcoin the official currency. Even if they wanted to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, they would make it an alternative currency and put in place regulations to ensure that the government does not get cheated.Mind you, Bitcoin is not the solution to the economic and political problems governments are facing. In fact, without being biased, there are even very high tendencies that corruption might increase further because corrupt people and criminals would have a stress-free opportunity to carry out questionable transactions with little to no chance of the transactions being traced. Even if they could be traced, the chances are still very slim.Bitcoin alone cannot put an end to inflation in a country. In fact, prices of goods and services would become very disorganized. Satoshi thought about this, which is why he said Bitcoin should be an alternative currency.",

I am not even sure what you mean by fastest transaction medium, but it's not.2. It's not a token, it's a coin. Tokens (layer 2) are build on top of coins (layer 1).3. Bitcoin doesn't work as a currency of a country, because it's borderless in core. So it would make as much sense to use gold coins. Fiat money isn't tied to gold for a good reason, as you can't control gold either unless you steal it from your citizens like USA did.4. Inflation is ok and normal unless it turns to hyper inflation. No one is asking you to invest in money and it doesn't make much sense that money wouldn't be inflationary at all. It's just a tool for trading.5. Even El Salvador removed Bitcoin's legal tender status, so why do you think they did it if it started new economic age of that country?",

Because it is not possible to print any additional bitcoin.Well, even though the supply of money has a lot to do with inflation, it isn't the only reason for it. The country having Bitcoin as its official currency will still have to import things from other countries, and if the cost of those things increase, there will still be inflation in the country, besides, if the price of Bitcoin decreases, that will also cause inflation.Quote from: Nihum342 on March 09, 2025, 04:34:03 PMHowever, when all transactions are completely dependent on online, it will be mandatory for all of the country to gain skills in this regard.  That's one of the biggest hurdles. Every single person in a country has to use money for one thing or another, but you can't educate every person about Bitcoin and its usage, you can't provide everyone with a suitable electronic device with an internet connection so that they can use the system because Bitcoin doesn't have a physical existence like fiat.Quote from: Nihum342 on March 09, 2025, 04:34:03 PMFinally, if Bitcoin is the currency of a country, it will start a new economic age of that country.
