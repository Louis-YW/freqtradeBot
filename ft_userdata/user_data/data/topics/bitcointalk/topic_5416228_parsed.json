      "body": "Mopar,True. I think the cleanest way to categorize physical bitcoins is Pre-funded, Unfunded, DIY or round. But, the Buyer Funded marking on Lealanas are super helpful too when trying to figure out what a coin’s characteristic are. You have handled a lot of these coins by now so I have a question. Are the buyer funded etched with “Buyer Funded” like Smoothie’s coins of the past? I bought a roll of BF but they do not have BF written on them. I like all these latest coins.",

I was mainly wondering if they had buyer funded on the hologram as I like the look of the holo better without the extra words. And in this instance, I guess the answer is no words but not funded??Also - there's the value of the 0.01 btc to consider",

I like this, but I also think it is important to record the pub key in case any coin gets wear. They look like they could be easily worn and obstructed. Also, yes a have a roll of buyer funded coins without buyer funded written on the holos. I wondered if this was a new thing. A member dm'ed me today with a picture of a buyer funded holo and \"Buyer Funded\" is there. So, I think I just got a roll with the wrong holos. Not sure if this qualifies as an error but certainly a variety that is out in the wild. By the way, I'm still willing to trade a few of these.
