This makes me doubt the integrity of their Staking page. Your input will be appreciated.By the way: The rate for Cosmos on their Earning page is calculated as APR (Annual Percentage Rate) which doesnt use the the compounding effect of the interest. That means that this rate would be even higher in APY. I'm not staking $ATOM but I dont know why you are skeptical by their rate. I just checked https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/cosmos and there are a lot of validator which offers the same rate that is stated on the ledger tab. With Ledger live you are delegating ur $ATOM token directly to the validators that are shown on the previous site. You are not using a 3rd party for that. One last hint: Keep in mind that staked tokens are frozen/locked for atleast 21 days.

They are using Kiln for ETH Staking since its a service for pooled staking.",

This makes me doubt the integrity of their Staking page. Your input will be appreciated.Maybe Ledger should just demand that the cryptoassets of their clients be given directly to them? Without any extra shells under the guise of certain services.After those incidents with the loss of personal data of their clients, the dubious services they offer, such as sending the recovery phrase to a third party, some doubts about the reliability of the source code, which is closed, and other things, does anyone still doubt whether to use services from Ledger, such as staking?Staking is first and foremost a matter of trust. Are you ready to trust a company that has repeatedly screwed up?",

I manage to stake using Ledger itself as validator since they only charge 7.5% commission rate while other safe validators offer higher.Also I just want to share that 21 days is required unstake Atom tokens for those who will read this thread in the future. I will not stake my tokens if I knew that it took almost a month just to unstake it without any reward. This info should be displayed during staking procedure. Ledger sucks at its finest!",
