Do you really want to erase the data from the discs, then try to sell them in second-hand markets? Or do you want to destroy the disks completely?If you want to completely destroy hard disks, the best way is to destroy them. For example, you can use a drill and drill holes in the disks, that way nobody will be able to use them. Another way is to use a hammer and break the disk. This can even be a real exercise to relieve stress. If you just want to erase the data, to be safe to sell them, unfortunately you really have to do an individual cleaning.One suggestion I can give to minimize having to rewrite the entire disk is to encrypt all the information on the hard disk. And after encrypting format the disk. It may not be as efficient as rewriting it, but it will be very difficult for someone to recover that data.You can see how to do this in the following tutorial:https://www.cloudwards.net/how-to-encrypt-your-hard-drive/This method can save you a few hours doing it individually. Give it a try to see how it works.",

Even in my country they pay me about 0.5-1 dollar for bringing this equipment for recycling. But for 3-4 dollars these hard drives can be sold, and if you have 100 of them, then this is the price of a good video card. You do not need to spend time checking, but simply turn on the formatting mode with the impossibility of data recovery. You will spend 5-10 minutes on this in the evening.",

I'd suggest you to wipe them clean and overwrite them with large files or with a utility. The latter is far quicker and easier option. There are quite a few out there you can use for free. All data will be overwritten beyond recovery.

But buying the necessary equipment to effectively degauss is very expensive.In addition, special care is needed when using this type of equipment, as they can even damage equipment that is not intended.There are some equipment, which are drawer-type systems, which provide greater safety in their use. But I think paying more than $3~4k is not very viable for this case.",

Yeah, the drills have to be of good quality and for iron. In addition, it is advisable to use a drill support, to make drilling easier and not have to use so much physical force. Usually for lower costs and physical effort is to use a sledgehammer.Using the software is a good solution, you just have to have the patience to put the program to work overnight.",
