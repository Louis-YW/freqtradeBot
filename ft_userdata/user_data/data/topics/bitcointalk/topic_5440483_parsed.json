      "body": "It probably depends where you are but education can set and keep people free, a lack of education generally leads to the opposite too.Women don't have to lose their names either when they marry, or their homes and both generally move quite a bit in wealthier countries (either on their own or with others). If you can afford to educate both and are in an area where both can work (or could work) I think it'd be highly recommended you do - you have more chance one does well in life too.",

Â I think most parts of our world the man is supposed to be more educated. But I know some many men who are not and the women instead is the person who went to school for better job.",

They just do it, and haven't put together the fact that their doing it 9 months ago was what caused the baby. Of course, the fact that they do it a lot is part of what messes with their timing. So, they wonder what the real cause is.",
