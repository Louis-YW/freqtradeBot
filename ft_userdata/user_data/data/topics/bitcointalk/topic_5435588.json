  "content": "Mass adoption is happening again! We are seeing it with digital transformations and now we are witnessing it in the physical world. There is no doubt that mass adoption is the future and it is something that most of the businesses should strive to incorporate into their business model. Try to imagine that all of the businesses will start accepting bitcoin as a mode of payment even it has a high volatility. It's kind of heaven for me who really want to use bitcoin as payment.McDonald's are now starting to have ideas to incorporate the metaverse in their business model where they can sell virtual goods. The McDonald's has plan to release their own NFTs and also cryptocurrency that may use to purchase their good and services. What a great time to be alive, It is good to see that a billion dollar fast food restaurant are starting to adopt the change. If the idea of the McDonald's came true, for sure that a lot of fast food restaurant will also copy them that may start the revolution where the mass adoption will take place. Many people will become interested on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency if this happen.https://www.mashed.com/765965/mcdonalds-wants-to-be-the-first-restaurant-in-the-metaverse/?fbclid=IwAR1BX1feZedw3iKhGBJW3iqtfSJwJ_nAf0_AbrsKC71q5iEGsuxR-tMq-GQ",

They can do whatever they want, but that wont work good for franchise promotion. Why spend billions, when devs, gamer, artists and basically everyone already use yellow M in their created content. Id better work better on a menu, try to lower prices, as people complain that they are no longer cheap fast food. Virtually you won't be full, when you are hungry irl !",

And then stopped and did something that was more of a gimmick.Here in NY they had food trailers. Basically they would drop a take out only restaurant someplace with a limited menu and higher prices BUT have some GOOD give away to go along with it. (beach pass, local water park pass, whatever) and people would line up to pay more for less to get a free thing. Then they stopped with the 'real' gifts raised the prices even more and gave you contest entries.And then it died. Think that was late 80s early 90s don't exactly remember the years.Close to 30 years later when their app came out they were one of the earlier ones, and could have taken the lead. But nope, some perks and you could order the same food.And decades of the same in between. So I'm going with gimmick.Long post about fast food, but I see it as systemic to so many BTC projects. We all look at them and think of the potential, and then see what really comes out and shake our heads.-Dave",

It is blockchain and it is open source bro which means anybody can start from anywhere, it is not a must they have to own btc before joining the metaverse ecosystem. You make it sound like there is a guideline written somewhere by satoshi on how companies should approach adoption. Maybe you are not following the metaverse news but believe me when I say it has gain more recognition from companies far known than McDonald. You should do more research on metaverse adoption to fully understand what I meant.",

Remember what happened to The McRib NFT? Neither does anyone else, yet people were calling that adoption. And now they are making more? So far collectables have been about scarcity, community and art. If a Coca-Cola makes generic advertisement poster and brings one of them to Louvre museum as an art, that isn't art being adopted, that's corporations advertising and trying to ride with a wave of the trend they don't fully grasp or respect. Adoption happens when there would be actual use cases for corporations. McDonald NFTs make me think low quality happy meal toys without any scarcity or class.",
