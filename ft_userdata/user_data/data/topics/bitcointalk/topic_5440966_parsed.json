But without no other info you will most probably not find anything useful during your lifetime (and I'm being overly generous on this).So I recommend you read much-much more before offering this kind of services, which, at this stage, are dangerously close to what we call... scam.Quote from: un_rank on February 23, 2023, 12:17:39 PMI also recommend people don't give money or sensitive information to this \"service\".If one has lost some words of his seed, ask around publicly for advises and may recover it. If one lost his seed completely.. bad luck.Goind blindly for this kind of services can only get more money lost or even the initial coins stolen.",

If someone generate random seed-phrase and somehow generate one which contain Bitcoin, they should realize ethnically it doesn't belong to them.So there's no way for that...

Cracking a password is exponentially easier than cracking a list of 12 words where you have no idea which words were used or in what positions. Like you said yourself, even for your password you needed to give Dave some more information so he had something to work with. Knowing some characters from it, the total character count, whether or not you used numbers, special characters, lowercase or uppercase letters speeds up the process. A 12 or 24-word seed can't cracked. I think 4 words is the maximum that today's hardware can do under the assumption that you know the positions of the missing words and that the ones you know are correct.",

Â Our subconscious remembers all the information that we receive and use in practice. Â The main question is how to extract this information from your brain? Â You can try to do it yourself or with the help of another person. Â If you yourself want to remember a forgotten seed phrase, then you need to recreate the whole atmosphere of the moment when you used the Electrum wallet. Â You must be in the same room, the same music must be playing, you must remember what you were thinking when you prepared to make a deal. Â Gradually, word by word, you will be able to recall the entire seed phrase in your memory. Â You can also invite a specialist who knows the technique of hypnosis. Â The main thing is that he does not have the idea to steal your bitcoins! Â With the help of a hypnotist, you have every chance to restore a forgotten seed phrase in your memory.As for the seed phrase recovery method you suggested, unfortunately it is not working and cannot be effectively used in the situation under consideration.",
