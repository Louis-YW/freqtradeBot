In this image above, it is revealed that SONY has filled a patient for NFTs to allow transfers between games and consoles.   This is getting more interesting for play-to-earn games, it seems companies like SONY aren't ready to lose their gamers to blockchain gaming, if you believe that play to earn games aren't going to work out you are playing, and keep playing till things get serious.",

Much better to just play and enjoy without thinking seriously about gains. Because if you're thinking a lot about your gains and returns, you'll be serious with it and each move you do has to have something in return which is quite bad. Games should be enjoyed and if it's a play to earn, that's just an incentive that you'll receive while having fun. But the main thing about it is to enjoy and make yourself fun with the games you play.",

Just take a look AXIE, from his glory day not the NFTs team can be set up 5-10$.There is no play-to-win game that can establish this balance yet. First of all, they should love the game, game creators and distributed NFTs should be limited. Buying and selling should be analyzed very well and there should be a balance in between. In this way, the system can be more successful.The NFT I have should be able to be used in another game in the same universe. When this happens, ecosystems and customers will grow even more. He still has time, we saw a small attempt at the time of the pandemic. They still do not invest large sums of money. At the moment, they are more development-oriented, game companies or they do not release what they have.",

Because there are many play to earn games that's running on smartphones, there are some that are less graphically demanding too, you can try to look into Games For a Living (GFAL), this is a new gaming project and it's capable to challenge GALA games, the team are from EA games and other popular game developers still very new, and they have two games up and running, one is Elemental Raiders, it can run on phones.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/games-for-a-living/",

Yes, it was really interesting a known company like Sony brings such changes in the crypto world and offers P2E which I see really gains the attention of gamers. I believe their capability as builders will have positive results which is what we wanted to happen unlike the past set of P2E which just collapse after the season due to a lack of development and team support.
