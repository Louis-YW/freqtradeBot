  "content": "Hello,I want to introduce you to PawSwap. This project started on January 16th, 2023, with no presales and no team tokens. There are weekly AMA sessions where the community can ask questions, and the liquidity is burned on ShibaSwap (unfortunately, not on UniSwap). The team is DOXXED through Certik KYC, and the staking contracts are verified. All upcoming utilities will also be audited by the same company (Certik).Introduction: $PAW is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 1 quadrillion. Born on the Ethereum blockchain, $PAW is more than just a token; it's a thriving and vibrant part of the dynamic PawChain community. As $PAW continues to grow, it powers the PawChain ecosystem, enabling transactions and facilitating community governance. Our future goals for $PAW are both ambitious and promising. The token will evolve from its current status as an ERC-20 token to a truly cross-chain asset. $PAW is set to be at the heart of our Layer-2 solution, PawChain, linking all our utilities together. It will fuel our decentralized exchange, PawSwap, driving swaps and staking options. $PAW will also be central to our planned DeFi eCommerce marketplace, Payment Cards, Wallet Hardware, and much more, enabling transactions in a seamless digital and physical world. With our Layer-3 solution, we aim to connect all chains together, driving a truly interconnected ecosystem. Thus, $PAW isn't just a token - it's a key piece in the puzzle of a decentralized future.ðŸ”—Link for the audit + KYC: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/pawswapThe community is very helpful and supportive with everything.Contract Address: Code:0xdc63269ea166b70d4780b3a11f5c825c2b761b01 - ERC - ShibaSwapYou can find Whitepaper v1 at www.paw.to/whitepaper.pdf ðŸ“„The project will undergo rebranding next month and aims to move away from the \"meme token\" status. They are building L1, L2 and L3 blockchain, with the L2 beta and mainnet expected to launch this year. PawSwap and Aggregator will be updated to v2. ðŸš€ Feel free to join with the this weeks AMA - at X. https://twitter.com/pawTHEfuture/status/1716843517358559412All official links are findable at: http://pawchain.build",

Why would it make you cautious? I'd be cautious if it wasn't audited. Certik ain't got much reputation in their audit worthiness. Below are links to some Certik audited platforms which got hacked or scammed users. - DeFi protocol in $3m scam was â€˜Certik auditedâ€™- Merlinâ€™s $1.8m heist highlights role of code auditor CertiKQuoteArbix Finance, a DeFi protocol on BNB Chain, stole $10 million three months after a CertiK audit marked all major or critical issues as resolved.QuoteTwo DeFi protocols â€“ Akropolis and Saddle Finance â€“ have also previously been exploited after CertiK auditsIf project can get audited from reputed firms like Paladin, Trail of bits it's different thing, Certik is involved in far too many scams, rugpulls that one would want to stay away from their audited project than get in.",
