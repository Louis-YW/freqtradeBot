Personally, not at all mate, I always look at my BTC as a total amount of sats and I never look at the exchange rate.So let's say I hold 0.1 BTC, I never make the translation in dollars. I like accumulating BTC so much  I know I am not the average person, because I don't view Bitcoin as an investment but as better money, so I try to hold as much as I can of this type of money.By the way, I am not buying much BTC at the moment, because I have some real-life issues and I don't have a lot to save, but if I did, I would buy no matter what the exchange rate was.

If you already hold BTC and you want to accumulate more, i am not sure if it is a situation that can be called fomo buying.",

I think it is natural that because the price of bitcoin continues to rise, we can calculate the possible profits that we can get from bitcoin. Everyone wants profits and the best way is to have more bitcoins. If you still have money, there's no harm in buying bitcoin again and again because we see bitcoin price movements continuing to rise steadilyHowever, don't panic if the price drops by several thousand dollars because sometimes after an increase there is a correction but if I look at the chart it looks like it will continue to rise. Just my feeling, I'm not a professional traderQuote from: apogio on December 05, 2023, 07:30:29 PMPersonally, not at all mate, I always look at my BTC as a total amount of sats and I never look at the exchange rate.wow.. you are a cool person because you can see bitcoin as bitcoin while I can't, I see bitcoin in fiat rate. Maybe this is because my country still prohibits transactions of goods with bitcoin, so I place bitcoin as an asset that can be exchanged for fiat money. Are you planning not to exchange bitcoins and will use bitcoins as a currency, not as an asset, so that you can view bitcoins in sats, not fiat exchange rates?",

Anytime that I see the price pump, this thought comes into me, but there is nothing I can do than to trim my expenses and use any extra to buy bitcoin, which is my weekly routine. DCA is what has helped by to the level but I am not happy that I wouldn't be able to accumulate more this December because of the expenses that will come during this season. I wish I had a good amount of bitcoin, it would have been the best. You can continue to accumulate more bitcoin, as long as you can afford.",

We are just humans then feeling something like this or simply talking about FOMO is something inevitable that could be felt by someone. We dont really like on missing out the train again but honestlyif ever we've decided to buy then we should really be doing that earlier on the time that the price isnt really that hitting up that high. Now we might really be thinking that it might be shooting up its price upto 50k and this is something that a normal impression and that kind of boost feeling which it is really that normal to have. This is why decisions be made would really be entirely be depending on someone on how far they could really be able to risk on since not all wouldnt really be risk takers.So its up to you whether you would really be buying more or would really be that waiting for some correction but actually these things could really be thatdepending whether you are making some short term trades or really that basically holding for long term.",

However, life is life, so in case something bad happens to me and I need to convert BTC to FIAT, I will definetely do it, unless Bitcoin is so widely adopted that I can use it as it is. The plan is to use it as money, not as a means to get more FIAT money.",

If you've done your homework and believe the tech is solid, then I'd say go ahead, buy those satoshis.  But if you've got doubts better to play it safe rather than risk what you cant afford to lose.  In times like these the FOMO is real, but only you know what's right for your situation.",

You are not alone, even if I have invested some spare money during the previous months, when I see the price of bitcoin and how high it is already I definitely would have liked to get even more bitcoin at the time, but when I think about it, the bitcoin currently on my wallet is the highest I could have gotten anyway, so there is no point on regretting something that is completely out of my control, with that being said I thought I had more time to buy bitcoin for a low price as I did not expected the price to be that high before the halving.",

I've been saying it many times during the last bear market that for me 25k is the fair low for bitcoin and 20, maybe 19k is the low that bitcoin could go to. We went far below due to scams (Luna, FTX) which were artificially dragging bitcoin below its fair price.As for the fair price concept, I agree with PlanB, although I accept even greater low margins than he does, because he aimed at 26-28k fair value in q3 2022 when we were scraping the bottom. Anyway, I was telling people that selling below 20k is a bad idea, and here we are. I'm not surprised that we went to 40k, although I am surprised we did it before the halving.",

My advice to you is that in all you do, make sure you do not go as far as using money you’ll need in a couple of months, so you don’t end up forcefully withdrawing when maybe the price hasn’t favored your target, but yet you need the money.",
