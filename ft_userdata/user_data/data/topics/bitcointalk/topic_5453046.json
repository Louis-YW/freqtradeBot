Unfortunately, now on such video cards and others that are older than 6 years, it is very difficult to find coins for mining with a profit. Profit a few cents a day, I think you are not interested. I sold my old video cards, and I'll look at the prices and reviews of the RTX 4060.",

The miner can mine new coins that are not yet on the exchange, and due to this, earn a good profit. The price of video cards is cheap now, and will not fall much lower, so buying video cards can be a good decision if you believe in mining.",

The price of video cards is cheap now, and will not fall much lower, so buying video cards can be a good decision if you believe in mining.Mining makes more sense if the coin or new possible gem is not yet on the market and if it later gets listed and price shoots up or if the mining gear is somewhat efficient. But imagine someone mining a regular coin using old-not-so-efficient GPUs that are almost obsolete. They are in most cases going to do it at a loss in a bear markets which is why if someone just bought the coins using the money, they would be better off.But anyways mining makes someone more involved.",
