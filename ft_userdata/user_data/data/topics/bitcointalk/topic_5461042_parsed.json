  "content": "Crypto space can create a pathway to financial security; however the vast nature of the space also means that beginners often get overwhelmed. The lingering limitations in the industry like insecurity, volatility, regulations, etc– haven’t smoothened their experiences either.Nevermind these challenges, this space remains lucrative if properly harnessed and that explains why traders with decade-long experience are still active. So if you ever feel uncertain, overwhelmed or recorded a few losses, I'd love to know what you think.Crypto exchanges contribute to a large extent the level of success every trader can reach, in terms of securing your funds, delivering you products for optimal trading experience and support generally. A fiercely competitive sector, it’s no surprise then that the best exchanges are steadily upgrading their services to stay ahead of the pack.In light of that, Bitget has consistently integrated features that accommodate both beginners and experienced traders,  introducing Copy trading in 2020 (the novel top exchange to do so) a feature that allows beginners to emulate the trading techniques of the more experienced ones, rewarding both parties. Five years on since its inception, the dynamism hasn’t waned, a new tagline has been adopted– “Trade Smarter”, with the same goal of delivering top-notch trading experience to all users; new AI technologies have been integrated, along with a streamlined interactive interface. Doesn’t matter the challenges you face as a trader, the new Bitget promises you’ll trade smarter.",

      "body": "There use of AI in trading has gained a lot of momentum lately and quite a good number of exchanges are beginning to allow the use of AI as a trading tool that can help their customers both newbies and except alike to help them trade smarter,  I have heard about an artificial intelligence trading tools that make up to 90% trading success and record loses only once a week and the remaining tldsys all becoming profits,  this has helped newbies to trade smartly and take profits,  compared to trading by self. But more also we can't tell how long this trading success from AI will last,  since as you rightly said that exchanges are on constantly upgrading of their systems to meet up with current demands and AI as one of such may not have the upper hand in trading,  but what will help AI to succeed more in trading is one aspect that I noted earlier in one of my comment which is the trade vs who the other trader is. In a sense that,  since trading is done by an individual that is to say when a trader needs to lose for another to gain,  so trading is between traders,  and the exchange make its revenue from the trading fees and other commission,  so at that exchange may not take any precise actions since AI activities don't affect their own commission. Unlike in gambling where the gambler plays against the house in some cases,  so at that, the casino will try everything possible to keep AI or other bots' activities under check constantly.",

Being the main foundation for trading is our own ability on how to manage crypto, carry out analysis and also use several tools or support systems that will make it easier to trade.Does not justify the use of bots as a whole, but there must be control from the user as well so that what is set in the bot or what the bot produces can be as expected. The advice of others and some other suggestions should serve as a warning so you can integrate them with your own analysis. Wouldn't that be better than just rejecting whatever comes into your mind.",

Beside, its normal to have a sizeable reserve in exchange token cos most of them have utilities on the platform which obviously lead to increase in the demand. BNB is used for lanchpool, MX is used for their kickstarter and launchpad event while BGB has similar utilities on Bitget which includes Launchpool, launchpad and their super airdrop.FTX saga was purely mismanagement of users fund owing to lack of transparency and accountability. Apart from the PoR few exchanges, notably Bitget, Binance and OKX have been working hard to ensure the safety of user assets by launching customer protection fund as another security layer guaranteeing the safety of users assets.I guess all these efforts should be appreciated imho taking into cognizance the high risk of losing assets in this space.",
