I really want to promote the bitcoin circular economy but I can't. I dream of  day in my country where I can earn in bitcoin and spend in bitcoin. I dream of the day where, even though I need to keep my bitcoin secure in a cold storage, I can still have say $100 worth of BTC in a hot wallet that I spend to buy goods and services from people who accept bitcoin. The idea will be to spend from this hot wallet for purchases while promptly replacing it. That is, after spending the $100, I simply buy another $100 worth of Bitcoin to refill the hot wallet. I remain optimistic that my dream will eventually come true in my country. In the meantime, I would be happy to hear the experiences of bitcoiners who are already living my dream bitcoin circular economy in their country. What is it like for you?",

The ability to spend BTC in the economy has been confirmed by El Salvador, where people have been able to use the Lightning Network to make micro-payments easily, quickly, and at a very low cost. The only remaining issue is the legality and acceptance of BTC in your country's economy. I hope you have a government that is friendly to BTC and crypto, and it would be better if they are willing to accept BTC in the financial system as a means of payment.In my country, crypto are only considered commodities, we can trade and own crypto but are not allowed to use crypto as a substitute for fiat in payments. That is the way for the government to protect the role of fiat in the economy. Using BTC in payments would be the quickest and easiest way for us to get a fast ticket to jail",

When the incumbent government took over i was very optimistic about this and also thought it will be a thing of few months before people can openly use bitcoin or accept bitcoin as a means of payment but right now it seems those days are getting further far away due to the restrictions we are seeing on cryptocurrency. The problem now is shops or business owners will definitely be wary of using bitcoin as a payment because of fear of been picked up by the government due to the recent saga of financial market vs the government over naira/dollar manipulation. Aside that I have to agree with you that using bitcoin for transactions of smaller amounts isn’t viable at the moment because of the transaction fee which isn’t only caused now by the inscriptions alone but due to large volume of bitcoin transactions taking place on the network due to the upcoming halving/bull run",

      "body": "@OP Every Bitcoin enthusiast dreams of such a situation where they can freely use Bitcoin as mode of payment, accept as salary and merchants everywhere that accept BTC not only you.  But there are lots of hurdles for such a situation to happen.  First is the availability of merchants locally to accept Bitcoin.  Second is the confirmation time of the Bitcoin transaction, and the unregular Bitcoin fee where sometimes spike when the network is congested.Bitcoin transaction confirmation time can be neglected online but P2p will waste lots of time for buyers and sellers when is used in local market, unless they are using the same centralized services the dilemma of this action is that we need a third-party authorization to make this thing happen.Quote from: SatoPrincess on March 30, 2024, 09:40:26 PMThat day is not so far away.

High fees can be solved by using a centralized service.  Transferring funds within the same platform is often free, for example, the fund transfer within the Binance platform has no fee.  That is if one won't mind using third-party centralized services.",

Governments and banks will simply not allow it to happen and they have a lot of tools at their disposal to stop widespread adoption. But they don't even do that right now because of another biggest obstacle in Bitcoin adoption - people themselves don't want it. Bitcoin is too complex and too risky for them and offers no big advantages from the point of view of average citizen. They are fine with their bank handling their funds, and they are fine with inflation because either they don't have a lot of money in savings or because they invest their money.The most realistic adoption that can happen is that there will be simply more places that accept Bitcoin and you would be able to make a large share of your typical spendings with Bitcoin if you choose so.",

When someone is asked about their dream, they often say they want to use bitcoin as a currency to pay everyday bills. But my question is, how many people will do that if the government actually accepts bitcoin as currency? People who earn less than $500 per month and have families behind that need to be taken care of. Do they have the courage to spend $2-5 in fees per transaction just to buy a kilo of bananas or a loaf of bread? Also, everyone expects bitcoin to increase in price even higher, will people be willing to spend bitcoin or will they keep trying to accumulate more because its value is increasing every day? We all have the desire to turn bitcoin into currency, but when it becomes a reality, I really want to know how many people will use bitcoin as a means of payment when bitcoin prices are still volatile and delivery fees are high still high   .",

Although, Bitcoin just like all other cryptos is taxed and regulated, it can be bought and exchanged at will. It depends actually on the country region you are from. They may get around the idea soon or not unless the exchange agrees to be regulated for now and that's how such a dream of yours can become reality.Hold on to your dream as much as you do your coins and things might just turn out as you hope.",

Because as I know, most of us just like to invest in it to make profits, there are very few people who want to use it as currency because of its volatility. Additionally, approval of bitcoin ETFs means it has been recognized as an asset by the government and we can trade and buy & sell. And it is impossible to have an asset that is both a commodity and a circulating currency. I'm not pessimistic, but looking at what's going on, I see that bitcoin's path to becoming a currency is gradually closing as the world comes to know it as an investment.",
