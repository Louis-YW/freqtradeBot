So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset.Self perception towards your investment whether you do go for passive or active then it wont matter because it do still share up on the same idea or goal which is to make profit whether in short or long term.Trading isnt something simple thing to deal with which means that it do really requires sufficient time,effort and experience before you could able to make yourself able to handle up with this very unpredictable and volatile market which would be the main thing that you would be experiencing once you do step your foot into this market.Somehow, this doesnt always talk about good ending because along the way it would really be involving lots of trials and errors which would cause for you to make neither good or bad decisions.This would totally affect your success chance but of course experiencing mistakes are learnings for you to understand and mold yourself to be a better trader.",

So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset.I always believed crypto currency trading does not care about your ''emotions'' so irregardless of what kind of individual ''we are'' it does not stop or prevent traders from accumulating losses or profits. What is good for traders is consistency, and when i say consistency it applies towards improving one self and ones technique from time to time learning from losses and developing new strategies to win.When i say strategies, it ranges from day to day trading, long term plan trading, futures, etc. Important message, please don't rely on your emotions while trading.",

So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset.It's for everyone.Whoever wants to trade, they can try it. Passive or active, it's for them and what matters here is on how they know what they're doing. Trading isn't as easy as the mindset that we have.It's actually a hard thing to do and most of the traders are even losing. If you get to know more about trading and you're accepting the risk of it, then it's for you.",

So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset.Trading welcomes everyone but only those who have the capability to understand and are also those who are willing to change their mindset will stay and succeed. Even if we have a positive mindset but if we don't have skills and knowledge, that is still useless. Just like Lanatsa said, it requires ample time and effort to do trading as it was not an easy job to make. Though it welcomes everyone, somehow there are so many reasons why many had failed, not just only having a negative mindset.",

So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset.^ That is why trading is not good for everyone because trading will not give profit if you lack knowledge of it. Trading is meant for those people who are willing to learn, willing to risk, and willing to spend their time and effort, those mindsets will most likely succeed in trading in the end but those who want to have a quick profit will probably end up a loser. Laggy mindset will like the pump and dump activity, they cannot decide on their own and always relying other's opinions, which commonly falls into a trap and always a prey of those predators.",

So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset.Isn't a passive mindset bringing a negative connotation?  Something like not being responsible for anything?  Here is a sample explanation:QuoteYou're not willing to do something hard. You're not willing to sacrifice what's needed. The passive mindset is defined by an attitude, an assumption that life happens to you and you're not responsible. People with this mindset also say things like, “Why does this always happen to me?”source: Yes, It’s All Your Fault: Active vs. Passive MindsetsI think you are talking about our minds being passive in the sense that they just absorb anything without resistance or emotion.  but saying for the passive minds just beat the sense of trading since trading needs an active mind that is ever reacting to changes for adjustments adoption, and calculations, especially in risk management.",

Mostly got some gains but eventually loses too in the end. Why? Even though consistency is there, were not a fortune teller to make an accurate movement of the market. But surviving many losses is what weve called an expert trader. I myself didnt do much trading cause I know the risk. Maybe doing some scalping but not in the regular basis of I have quota per day to win a single day trade.",

At last if the fortune is not yours then your wallet will be red.I am not saying that learning about trading won’t at all help, rather it helps but that help doesn’t make a great difference between a normal trader and a veteran trader.These are my thoughts, this might be different for someone else.

So in conclusion trading is for the passive mindset and not for the laggy mindset. Trading if ending up as a \"hectic\" endeavor, then it is not being done properly. Trading means buying when the market price is poor and selling when the price is up. If this ends up giving a mental toll on the person putting their money in, then they need to rethink what they are doing in the first place. They mostly bought at the higher prices and now trying to sell at lower or they are out of money to buy anything more out of the bear market.While both of these are happening, people must remind themselves that trading is not everything in life. While market will go up and down, there are things outside the market which should be given attention too - if you dont divert to such things in life, trading will end up being a chore and that will drain you.",

But you also have to learn and adapt things, you can't just be linear here. Sooner or later you can be aggressive and then passive or both. In short there is no one strategy that is going to work. Your mindset adjust as you gain experience. And always remember that you are not always going to win, most of the time it's best to take some losses.",

Why newbie don’t understand the importance of just holding and forget other bullshit trading strategy to save time and hassle on thinking how to make profit because no one loss unless you sold so why not keep buying and holding and just wait while doing your normal daily activities in your life.Many people keep looking on the chart every seconds and always lead to fear when they see price is going down. This is always the case why most newbie trader never get success on this field.",
