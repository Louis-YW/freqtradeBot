  "content": "Elon Musks Plan to make the world multiplanetary is just waste of time and moneyElon Musk claims that reducing the birth rate is not a solution and it will not work, so making the world multiplanetary is necessary but he is forgetting or ignoring by his stupidity that not millions but billions are required to go outside of the world. So only billionaire will be able to travel outside of the world, at the current situation, there are only a few billionaires out of 8 billion people, even there are not much millionaire and millionaire can never afford to visit outside of the world as a tour will cost around million of dollars. So if we assume that Musk has had succeeded to make the mars a place where life can exists, then how many billionaire will travel? will we be able to send half of the world there? or 190 million people out of the 320 million from the United States? Evacuation of millions out of 8 billion will not affect the earth even, and nor every Chinese a billionaire to afford the evacuation. So we can say this that this is just a bogus plan, It will result at the end to destroy Tesla and SpaceX (resulting 100% loss of Tesla and SpaceX shares) Because is it possible that we can make everyone in the world a billionaire through blockchain? And if the current inflation growth rate is to be relied upon, it is still not possible in the next ten years. If we increase this inflation rate by a thousand times or make people's salaries in millions then it is possible. And it is also possible that we will be killed by global warming in the next forty years if we do not do this.",

Because the Artemis Program being done by NASA as we speak, suggests and indicates that the guys couldn't have gone to the moon back in 1969. Why couldn't they?

Starlink is part of Elon Musk's SpaceX and the satellites are part of a plan to make internet coverage from the satellites available worldwide, with the goal of launching nearly 12,000 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit.Space is becoming crowded and risks of collision -- whether with satellites or space debris -- are not new. Tellingly, China was among the first to help create much of that debris: In January 2007, China tested its first successful anti-satellite missile (ASAT), destroying one of its own inactive weather satellites and creating one of the world's largest space debris incidents. That space debris is still floating around in space, causing collision risks every day.The United States rejected China's claims that the Starlink satellites had endangered China's space station. The US stated that if there had been a \"significant probability of collision\" with China's space station, the U.S. would have given notice to China ahead of time. \"Because the activities did not meet the threshold of established emergency collision criteria, emergency notifications were not warranted in either case.\"China is now taking things a step further: Chinese military researchers are threatening that Musk's Starlink satellites must be destroyed. The problem, however, does not appear so much to be the fear of collision, but rather that China believes that Starlink could be used for military purposes and thereby threaten what China calls its national security....",
