We all know how this layer-2 network really became popular because of first their airdrop.Arbitrum because it is a layer-2 network, a new one that will compete with other layer-2 networks that already exist. And we saw how the total value  locked (TVL) on most of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms on this chain really grow.",

Aptos and Optimism are other coins that i have the same hope of going the same path. I'm doing cost averaging into these tokens. These tokens haven't experienced a bull market, a massive price growth and has a strong support behind it. These are the factors of the recent successful tokens last bull market, along with the trend, I hope that these tokens will get us good profits.I don't shill but I personally believe that new tokens or tokens created during the bear market are the one who will rise during the bull market.",

Both remind me of a competition in another technology field between Windows and Linux.- Similar to Window's development focus on optimizing different products, Arbitrum makes me imagine the direction they are pursuing in terms of developing everything of a complete ecosystem with full fields that can be approached near.- With Optimism, it gives the feeling that anyone can easily create a new L2 based on its core, just like Linux where everyone can deploy their own operating system.",

It has made a noise last year when its airdrop was released to the public and that was their governance token. So, it's Arbitrum and Optimism that I can remember that has been notable for their launching. Anyway, if you want to analyze the newly launched coins you may go through the list of new altcoins listed on coinmarketcap and coingecko but check it out if they really have been released for this year.https://coinmarketcap.com/new/https://www.coingecko.com/en/new-cryptocurrencies",

The best thing to do would be just realizing that they are bad and you should pick something that is a little bit better.Aside from ARB, there hasn't been all that many which got attention, not that I am saying ARB is great or anything, I am just saying it got attention and was it worthy of attention or not is depending on your own research. Go check the coins and tokens from 2022 and 2023 and you will see that none of them ranks higher than ARB at this point and that's the key point here, if that's the only one then there isn't really anything that could be shockingly different after a while. We need to realize that this is a different view and we can't really make it change for the long term.I hope that we could get to a point where it could be a little different, and yet we are talking about a situation that may not be all that easy to handle in the end. Just look for older ones, there is no urgency to pick the new ones, I get that new ones feels like it could be better than ever but that doesn't mean that we are going to end up with anything that could be a better just because they are new.",

This is because I never put much interest in altcoin information, only in bitcoin and established altcoins like Ethereum and BNB. This is why this thread captures my interest, in the hope that it'll spur my interest in altcoins generally. I'll have to explore this ones that you have shared, like the OP, i can also be able to analyse then for future purposes.Friends experiences in most new altcoins have been a discouragement to me in building interest in them. Because of scam projects and those that'll become worthless with investors losing. I still can't deny the fact that some of this altcoins are profitable, only they seen to me like gambling.",
