  "content": "Okay Ladies.. We have T-20 WC in the next 14 days, and as usual, some of us definitely want a mutual pool again.Quote from: Little Mouse on October 01, 2022, 02:40:48 PMPosting here to know if anyone is interested to have a pool for the upcoming T20 world cup. Sorry if it has been already discussed. I didn't take the time to read the last few pages though I have read a few recent replies. We may try to get some sponsors for the pool to make it lucrative. Please reply here if someone is interested. If we got 10+ interested users, we can create one. If Royse777 or JSRAW is up for creating the pool, I'm also requesting them to have their opinion here. Having a pool would be cool, would definitely enjoy it with you.Creating this dedicated discussion thread for entry fees and sponsors (if we find one)  as I don't want to derail the main thread. Also, we have a couple of bilateral series that are live so this msz will be lost there. If we look at overall pool history then I believe the majority of punters (almost 10-14) are okay with $30 as entry fees. If you think we need some change in the entry fees then please drop your suggestions here. I'll notify usual suspects who are regular in our past pools and bump this post in our T-20 thread too for more exposure. Plz feel free to remind me if I'm forgetting anyone or any interested party.@Pffrt @akhjob                                    @RapTarX                @Royse777              @Maidak                  @Haunebu               @Swordsoffreedom   @eaLiTy                   @Vaskiy                   @teosanru                @webtricks               @Little Mouse           @7788bitcoin",

For the last IPL pool, we had around 27 Bucks as entry fees so we should reach on some consensus soon.EditQuote from: Mahdirakib on October 03, 2022, 03:14:12 PMAs I have said it in the other thread, I'm interested to join in the pool. I have no problem with the $30 entry fee. Moreover, I won't have any problem if you increase or decrease the entry fee a bit by listening to the opinion of other forum members. Already 4-5 people has showed their interest to participate in the pool. 15-20 people participation will make the prizepool little attractive.Yeah, I've noticed and did reply you there.",

Has anyone tried contacting BTC365 again as last time they were the main sponsors of the IPL 2022. If they agree to sponsor the WC pool, it will be very good.Secondly, there is still time and more people may join in, but if you need 15 20 people in the pool, you need to lower the pool participation to say around 10 or 15$ maybe.Just my two cents on this WC pool.",

I haven't even seen BTC365 in a while. Regarding sportsbet, I haven't seen many sponsorship from them. Betnomi can be one as they are sponsoring a lot of pool for soccer competition.Either way, I think without a sponsor, we should go higher entry fee but if everyone agrees.Edit- I'm in contact with 2 sportsbetting site. Will check out with them, no much hope as I tried last time too with no good output.",
