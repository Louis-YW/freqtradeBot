      "body": "In times like this, when the mempool is congested and fees are very high, you are expected to note that small transactions could incur high fees which might be equal to their output value. However this shouldn't deter small transactions altogether. If you own a business and use Bitcoin as a payment option you may consider utilizing other cryptocurrencies for such transactions temporarily. This isn't the first time we've experienced mempool congestion, and it won't be the last, so fees may take a while to return to normal. Some might also consider using the Lightning Network for small transactions during these times, but not everyone is familiar with it.",

Have you stopped using bitcoin for small transactions completely because of this reason ? You can wait and you can use Bitcoin blockchain for small transactions again. Time is what you need because Bitcoin mempools can be loaded more or less with demands on Bitcoin on chain transactions.If you don't want to spend expensive transaction fee and convert your bitcoins to dust, you can have chance to see your bitcoin increases in value and can enjoy cheap transaction fee in future.In waiting time, you can use altcoins, I hate to say it, for transactions.",

Unless it is in a place like El Salvador, where Bitcoin is legal tender and many merchants accept it, I would avoid it. Merchants help their customers avoid high transaction fees by using lightning payments, which are fast and cheap. This is what makes it attractive. For example, the Strike App enables merchants to use lightning payments, which I believe is being used in El Salvador. There is also another app called BitPay, which also utilizes the lightning network for payments. You have to check which lightning app is available for your country.",

If the medium priority transaction fee price is more than 10% of the amount I am sending, I opt to wait for a while until the fee becomes lower.  I agree that it does not make sense to pay a fee equivalent to the amount we are sending.  If the fund is on an exchange, I convert it to another cryptocurrency that has lower fees and can also be accepted by the merchant or person I am sending the amount to.  I might look for another option until the price of the Bitcoin transaction fee returns to normal ($0.3 - $1) and it did not make me completely stop using Bitcoin for small transactions.",

That reason won't be enough to make people stop using bitcoin for small transactions just because the transaction fee as of now have increased. It doesn't mean you can't send your bitcoin although it won't be confirmed right away and will take time before it is confirm when you set the sat/byte for lower or cheaper transaction fee.

Like to make a $20 amount transaction, one has to pay about same amount, $20 in fees. This does not make any sense. Have you stopped using bitcoin for small transactions completely because of this reason ? I have never used Bitcoin for small transactions. It has never been a good alternative for such negotiations. It's better to use Bitcoin for big and valuable purchases, so the fees you are going to pay totally worth when you dilute it inside the total price of the transaction. If you send too many small transactions, you are going to waste a lot of money in fees. If that is what you are looking for, you should look for alternative altcoins which present cheaper transactions fees. At least on this matter, altcoins have a very practical function.Anyway, if I have a large transaction to do, I won't refrain doing so just because I have to pay a 20$ fee, because compared to the total value of the transaction, 20$ won't be a significant amount of money. So it totally makes sense to keep sending these transactions across the network, despite the high fees costs. What I suggest you doing is to accumulate the maximum amount of satoshis you can before moving it to another address. Don't be in a hurry. Thankfully we are in a good moment of crypto market to hold, so you can wait for the next increasement in price which should take Bitcoin to a new ATH.",

Yes, it doesn't makes sense if I'm going to pay with that amount and the transaction is even lesser than that. It's okay to stop for a while because the fees are going to calm down.
