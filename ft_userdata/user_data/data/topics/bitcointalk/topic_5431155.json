  "content": "Introduction:Over the years, we've had various project ideas. Some remained just ideas while others lingered in varying levels of completeness and not made public. Today however we'd like to present to you one of these projects.Some time ago we've got the idea of releasing a crypto stamp and ordered a very limited batch to play around with the concept. The idea was to create something fun and a bit different without taking itself too serious. But what about selling and trading something that comes preloaded? We mitigated that risk by loading it with something worthless! So we chose to preload them with a small amount of testnet coins*.It would be humbling to see them being redeemed to test out a cool new Bitcoin project! Actually, I can imagine this being a cool gift for a Bitcoin dev.Also, thank you very much to mocacinno for providing the needed tBTC*!*IMPORTANT: Testnet bitcoins are worthless and hold no monetary value, this is what makes them valuable.At this point we have no plans on taking this idea further and would like to auction off most of the pieces created (there are a few more stamps with slight variations that we don't really know what to with at the moment).Item Description:A total of 12 numbered Bitcoin Sunrise stamp displays were created, each containing four Bitcoin Sunrise stamps. #1 is a PoC and was used as a test (this is the item in the pictures).The Bitcoin Sunrise stamp has a famous Satoshi quote inscribed and a sunny Bitcoin rising over the mountains in the background.Each stamp comes preloaded with *drums rolling*... 0.01 tBTC*. Materials: acrylic, wood, paper, brass.Dimensions: 14.7x10cm (5.78\"x3.93\").AUCTION TERMSItem for Sale: 8 lots, each containing one Bitcoin Sunrise stamp numbered #3 to #10Bid Format: BTCStarting Bid: 0.00 BTCMinimum Bid Increment: 0.0002 BTCAuction End Time: Thursday, December 29th 2022 @23:00 UTC (18:00 EST)Sniping: Any bid made in last 5 minutes PER LOT will extend the auction 5 minutes beyond the ending time PER LOT.If within those 5 extended minutes, a new bid is made, 5 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid PER LOT.Payment: Bitcoin BTC. Address will be sent via PM. Watch out for impersonators!Shipping: Based on location and preference. Ships from Europe. Buyer responsible for any and all customs/duties.Payment Due: Within 24 hours.Escrow: Available at cost of buyer.",

Each lot contains one Bitcoin Sunrise stamp display, with four stamps inside. First lot is Bitcoin Sunrise stamp display #3, second is #4, and so on until #10.Thank you everyone for your bids and Merry Christmas!",

At this point these might be the only one ones, but if there's interest might spend more time on this, but trying to find a new way to load them with real BTC.Yeah, I'm into stamps! Already own a few CS so would rather leave the spots to someone that doesn't have any. But thank you for the heads up and the raffle!",

Indeed, to my knowledge and research this is the first physical Bitcoin item that offers loaded testnet coins, but didn't want to word the announcement around this. My reasoning is that if this piece intrigues you enough then you will find this out. The piece should prove itself instead of having to be proven by marketing speak. My take however around the testnet loaded items, and non-fungible items for that matter, is a bit deeper than what you see here today.Another thing about the Bitcoin Sunrise display that should be mentioned is that the design of the stamp is made by 3dOOm from our office, and for a non-artistic vocation/background individual he managed to surprise me a bunch of times with his creative ideas!A bunch of the proceeds will likely go towards funding the BitcoinTalkShow - I know it's been a while, but there's been some work put into it; soontm.All in all, thank you everyone for the bids.Merry Christmas and Happy Holiday season to everyone!PS: I assume you meant Bitcoin Sunrise display #10, which is Lot 8, if that's not the case pls let me know. In hindsight should've skipped putting them into separate lots, but I've seen this used a lot (pun intended  ) around here and imagined myself trying it.",

Thanks! Definitely One the coolest collectibles/ideas I’ve seen in a while. Your deeper take has me wondering Btw glad to hear the news about the btc talkshow, I’ve really enjoyed them so far. I’ve got an idea for helping fund the show’s future episodes, will shoot you PM about in a day or so (don’t want to be going off topic here).",
