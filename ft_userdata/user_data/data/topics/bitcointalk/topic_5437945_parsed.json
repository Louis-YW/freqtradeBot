I think they are delayed by a period of time making the data less useful for investment purposes. In the past there were threads made in this section of the forum noting a trend where new index funds planned to emulate insider trading data. Without much follow up, unfortunately.Can't comment on this from experience. Its possible someone could use the info to build a good trading strategy around the information. It is possible people are already doing it.",

That helps a bit at least, thanks a lot. Any idea which subscription is needed for that data set?Quote from: Hydrogen on February 07, 2023, 12:40:49 PMWhile there are resources for tracking insider data. I think they are delayed by a period of time making the data less useful for investment purposes.Yep, that's what I saw. I found a few free services, but they are at least delayed three months unfortunately. Quote from: Hydrogen on February 07, 2023, 12:40:49 PMCan't comment on this from experience.

It is possible people are already doing it.Pretty sure, there are plenty of trading strategies around this data set already. I would also like to experiment a bit with the data, that's why I am looking for some up to date insights.If anyone else has some input on the topic, please let me know.",
