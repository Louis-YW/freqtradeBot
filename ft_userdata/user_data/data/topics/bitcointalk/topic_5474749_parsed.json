  "content": "On the occasion of Armed Forces Day, I extend my sincere greetings and congratulations to all the members of the Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force.Â  Wishing all members of the armed forces and their families continued happiness, peace and prosperity.Â Armed forces are a nation's proud institution built of indomitable courage, bravery, valor and discipline.Â  The heroic role of this army in our great liberation war will be written in golden letters in history.Â  Patriotic members of the armed forces continue to play the role of vigilant guards in protecting our freedom-sovereignty and geographical integrity.Â  Their role in maintaining world peace is appreciated in the world community.Â  The members of our armed forces serving in the United Nations peacekeeping forces are bringing the reputation of the country with their efficiency and high level of professionalism.Â  Even in all the natural calamities of the country, the armed forces stand by the side of the afflicted people and jump to face the difficult crisis. Former President Shahid Ziaur Rahman, the promulgator of independence, undertook and implemented comprehensive programs aimed at developing the Bangladesh Armed Forces into a modern, dynamic and efficient professional force.Â  Today I pay deep respect to his memory.Â  I remember with humble respect Bir Shrestha Sepoy Mustafa Kamal, Bir Shrestha Captain Mohiuddin Jahangir, Bir Shrestha Sepoy Hamidur Rahman, Bir Shrestha Ruhul Amin, Bir Shrestha Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman, Bir Shrestha Lance Naik Noor Mohammad Sheikh and Bir Shrestha Lance Naiksi Abdur Rauf who gave their lives in the Liberation War. whoÂ  Since the time of former President Shahid Zia, the Bangladesh Armed Forces have become a well-disciplined, fast and ever-active modern force, which is at par with the army of any modern country in the world.Â  Later, with the government led by the former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the armed forces made progress in the continuous implementation of the programs adopted by Shahid Zia, and made the armed forces more modernized and strengthened.Â  Our efforts will continue in the future.Â I wish all the programs of Armed Forces Day all success.Â Allah Hafez, Long live Bangladesh. ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸ’ª",

      "body": "Although Bangladesh is a democratic country but Awamilig don't give the rights to the normal people of our country. I belong from Bangladesh and I seen what heppening in our country. The government trying to hold the power to his own the awamilig are not interested to left their seats. They trying to hold it in illegal way. At the moment they saw that type of work are hope less that's the reason they are playing dirty game agents all political teams. We saw in previous elections that awamilig are illigali aresting those type of person who are loyal BNP and other political supporter. That same work is happening in this election season. That time again playing this dirty game. I thik their main intentions to convert the democracy of Bangladesh to monarchy. They never wanted to left their power. If they are ligaly doing work for the people of country so why not they leave there position. They are not doing any work ligaly. They know that is they leave their power then they will have to face big problem for their illigali work. One dya every evil work will end. If Allah take us alive one day we all see the fall of awamilig.",
