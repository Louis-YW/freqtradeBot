But it the case of brave browser, it blocks so many things and I believe part of which is the coded font style. You can manipulate this with script, but I feel it doesn't worth the stress as both fonts are almost alike.",

There is actually a difference between the two images in terms of font style. The later font is looking like open sans.Frankly, I don't know if it's just me and my eyes playing tricks on me for I can't make out any difference between both pictures OP shared. Again, about a font type; I know everyone is restricted to Verdana. I'm cool with that. It's pleasant to the eyes. You don't want to have to adjust while reading like when users adjust font size and colour or when they use sup or sub texts. All those can hurt sensitive eyes. I like the homogeneity in font style and I believe it will stay that way a long time.",

In my understanding, browser fingerprinting also involves detecting user fonts installed on the system (if two users have identical fonts available to the browser, they are more likely to be the same user), so Brave browser probably masks this option as part of their shielding technology. This is probably the reason why Verdana isn't available as a default font on the bitcointalk.org website, causing the display to look different than on other browsers.",

This is not much of an issue and does not affect how the user interacts with the website.Actually the suspect here is not websites, it is the browser itself.If a browser doesn't attach any fonts to it (and I don't think SMF will use any beside sans-serif), then the default browser font configured inside its settings will be used to render the text. I know that this font can be changed under Chrome and Firefox, but I'm not sure with Brave Browser and its different UI; it's theoretically possible.",

Yeah, that's probably true. I wouldn't expect it to work in any other way. Each page is unique in its own way and uses different codes and styles. But I remember coming across some type of CSS code extension that allows you to copy/paste element style changes to have them registered for the entire domain. Can't remember what it's called exactly. Font changes should be an elementary thing to do I guess.Quote from: nc50lc on June 12, 2022, 12:59:28 PMThe developer also has a reply saying that it wont work if the CSS form is separate from the HTML form.
