If some coin has moved up like 100% or more in just 24 hours, it does not mean that you should also purchase the coin. You should first understand the reason behind prices moving up. Then, you should also analyze the benefits and demerits of the project. One such option has come again in safemoon. The coin has pumped more than 100% when they reduced fees from 10% to 1%. Now new investors are rushing to invest in this coin. This is the situation when the past investors in the coin are like in 99% loss of their invested value. But greed make people loose all senses I think. If you are still thinking to invest in safemoon now, think twice.",

One can go to coinmarketcap and see which coin has the maximum percentage rise in the last 24hours and they will obviously find some shitcoin that they never heard of existed.Such coins are a huge manhole to step in, because they are essentially being pumped and going to dumped, waiting for small fries to get their hands on them.",

Having that mindset and doesn't change it will make them feel that there's something wrong when they've just keep on losing again and again. It's a cycle that's repetitive and they will only realize it when they see that they're no longer progressing with this attitude and strategy. Quote from: krishnaverma on May 10, 2023, 02:56:31 PMBut greed make people loose all senses I think. If you are still thinking to invest in safemoon now, think twice. True to that, when someone allows greed to get inside of his head. Well, every project that they will see as some sort of pump and dump, they'll have hard time of avoiding it and instead, they'll be optimistic towards it.",

At the moment it seems like a lot of attention in the altcoin market is going to all those stupid meme-coins that are launching each and every day. Until a few weeks ago i was off the opinion, that the whole meme-coin hype is dying slowly but surely because after ShibaInu there was not really a big meme-coin since. Now PEPE came pretty much out of nowhere and that stupid meme-coin hype is revived again it seems, which is a shame in my opinion because i think it is harmful for the crypto-market as a whole because it takes away attention and of course also cash from the \"real\" projects that are actually trying to do something.",

Halving is a year to wait. It shoudlnt be surprising Memes are nothing.",

The sudden price movements may seem tempting, but it's crucial to understand the reason behind them and the potential risks involved. Jumping into an investment without proper research can lead to significant losses. It's always better to take a step back and evaluate the situation objectively before making any investment decisions.",

Or simple you do make yourself get FOMO'ed?This is is really a common thing here on this space on which FUD and FOMO would really be the main things that we would really be encountering. On the time that people would be seeing some huge pumps or gains on a certain coin and could be able to see the hype goes around then we dont really like to lose up the opportunity for us to get in and hope that we might be able to get some another +100% gain on the time that we would be getting in which it is really a behavior which would really be putting yourself in great hard. Sooner or later on the time that you would be messing up your investment decisions is on the time that you would really be wrekt up with these kind of projects.Its true that DYOR would be always the best thingbecause we know that this market is really that could easily make some HYPe and luring out those greedy and newbie investors and would be ending up on making themas an exit liquidity which it is really that sad to think of.",

The thinking of a quick rich scheme is just like a hype, many will share their success but never their losses. Sometimes you have to experience it before you actually learn the lesson, and with that you’ll realize that quick rich scheme is not that easy and you have to take things slowly at the right timing.",

Yes, it was too risky to invest in hyped projects where many people have been experiencing an unforeseeable drop. Many had suffered losses because of being optimistic and greedy assuming that once the price of the project goes up it will continue without thinking that a drop is inevitable. Well, inexperienced investors or traders will usually caught in this thing. Then I have to encourage them to try to change their insights about crypto and listen to advice.",

Yes some groups of persons might be unfortunate but we need to take a look at others that had been fortunate enough to have gain some good amount of profits from the market because they invested in the right coin. 8f you are not that fortunate or lucky to hold projects that has strong team and huge community backing then you might think to the other side. There are so many that invest in altcoins even without doing any research about the project and they are still making good profits from the market.
