  "content": "QuoteCountry aims to send astronauts to the moon within 10 yearsChina is expanding its ambitions in space, challenging the USChina plans to build its first base on the moon by 2028, ahead of landing astronauts there in subsequent years as the country steps up its challenge to NASA’s dominance in space exploration. The lunar base will likely be powered by nuclear energy, Caixin reported. Its basic configuration will consist of a lander, hopper, orbiter and rover, all of which would be constructed by the Chang’e 6, 7 and 8 missions. “Our astronauts will likely be able to go to the moon within 10 years,” Wu Weiran, chief designer of China’s lunar exploration program, said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV earlier this week. Nuclear energy can address the lunar station’s long-term, high-power energy needs, he said.China has ramped up its ambitions in space in recent years, sending probes to the moon, building its own space station and setting its sights on Mars. The plans have put it in direct competition with the US. NASA has a rover on the Red Planet and is seeking to return astronauts to the moon this decade for the first time since the Apollo program ended in the 1970s. Both China and the US are spending billions of dollars to not just put humans on the moon, but also to access resources that could foster life on the lunar surface or send spacecraft to Mars.In 2019, China became the first country to land a rover on the far side of the moon, and later brought back its first lunar samples. The base is intended to be the first outpost on the moon’s South Pole, an area scientists think is the best place to find water. NASA is also targeting that part of the moon. China aims to eventually expand the base into an international research station.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-25/china-plans-to-build-nuclear-powered-moon-base-within-six-years....Could this signal the start of a new space race between the united states and china?Given the current state of the global economy does space exploration and efforts to make the human race multi planetary remain worthwhile goals?The other hot topic for aerospace appears to be asteroid mining. Which is interesting as it has often been repeated that if the moon were composed of 100% pure gold, it would cost more to extract the mineral than its currently worth at market value. If there is a tipping point where it becomes financially profitable to mine asteroids. I'm not certain if the relevant technology to make the process feasible currently exists. Mining expeditions on earth typically also need large quantities of water to conduct mining. Scarcity of water in space, could further hamper any potential mineral extraction.Could china beat Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and all of the american billionaires with space start ups to a manned moon mission? That might be an interesting topic, if the economy wasn't in such poor shape at the moment.",

      "body": "People, governments, organizations plan things all the time, doesn't mean all of those plans will materialize. When China or anyone really would start actually building a moon base, that would be significant news. Until that happens, it's pointless to discuss the implications of moon bases, potential new space race and so on.And I'm skeptical about any big moon bases in this decade, the cost/benefit of such endeavor seems to be rather poor. Better focus on improving the rocket technology first.",

I wonder moons gravity is super lowit requires less energy to propel garbage into space than to drive it to a crater 20km away(EG landfill) to be \"out of sight out of mind\"also moon activities would do more recycling.and outside the \"submarine\" base there is no atmosphere to lock in carbon so it too would escape into space more freely. so moon living wil see less waste.. just over a few decades a tail of waste heading towards the sun",

China had occupied almost his boundary sharing countries,which includes Tibet,India.So they are moving from earth to moon.Their target was already with the Mars,but some research about the mass was I build the the huge volcano in the Marks.So I had personal think of skip due to huge heating after December 2022.",

While we are incapable of doing something as easy as this, that doesn't mean it is going to be that easy to build a whole lunar space base, imagine how harder that is. So, my idea is that humanity is not grown as much as we can organize in a way it could be growing enough for a lunar space station.",
