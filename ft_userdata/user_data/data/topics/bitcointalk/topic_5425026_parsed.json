  "content": "Hello everyone.In case this was asked before I hope some of you can guide me.So I am trying to set up a full node too, but on an older machine. But the laptop itself is not that bad. Intel CPU is 2.00 GHz x 8, 4 GB Ram.I set it up with a 2TB HDD so that it can house the blockchain.I am running the core client on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS, and I just don't know where to start in finding out why it just runs for a couple minutes, then suddenly vanishes/crashes.This is with the GUI client. I have not yet tried out the CLI version only.I tried to reduce in the settings the DBcache to 300 MB, but still seems to do this.What is the process one can follow in an attempt to find out why the client just decides to close itself out of the blue?Thanks a lot in advance.",

I can run the GUI only buy using the \"bitcoin-qt\" command, which keeps the terminal open at the same time too.But when the thing crashes, everything vanishes at the same time, terminal window and bitcoin GUI. So there was nothing left for me to see.What do you recommend as PC specs to do the task of just simply being a bitcoin node?

The minimum requirements listed here were met by it: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/requirementsLaptop specs:Ram 4 GB (and has additional 8GB swap on a SSD inside it)CPU: Intel® Core™ i7-2630QM CPU @ 2.00GHz × 8OS name: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTSHere is some additional info that I am now starting to wonder if affects how this plays out:The client I ended up installing was bitcoin-24.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz, I got from here: https://binarywatch.org/Now I didn't see this posted yet on https://bitcoincore.orgI am now in doubt if what I got is not a stable release. Would it have been wiser to just go for bitcoin core version 23? Maybe I should remove it and install this version...Here is another thing:The home folder of this linux install is set up on a HDD, while the rest of the directories are on an SSD. Still, I hope this is fine for the program.When I ran the \"whereis\" command on \"bitcoin-qt\", it seems the client is located in the \"/usr/local/bin/bitcoin-qt\" directory. I wanted to use the HDD just for storage, seems to work.Hope this helps, any ideas what I could try out?",

Does it also crash when you run it in testnet, signet, and regtest?I tried running the software as simply \"bitcoind\" to see on the terminal how it does. Nothing out of the ordinary, the PC did not seem to struggle. Just the process being suddenly gone.Alright, I installed lm-sensors, but also got no idea how to use it. Currently looking up details about its usage for logging.About Core behavior:It just run as usual, doing its tasks, then Boom. Suddenly all its windows vanish, taking with it even the terminal window in which it was running.",

Lets check if bitcoind is throwing a fatal C++ exception.Go to github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin, and go to the Releases page. We are going to download the source code for Bitcoin 24.0 and compile it, then have it run under a debugger.Under \"Bitcoin Core 24.0\" download the one that ends with \"x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\", Extract it to any download folder.Now, open a terminal and run:Code:sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils python3 libevent-dev libboost-dev libsqlite3-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtwayland5This will install the compiler and other dependencies needed to build Bitcoin Core.Next, go to the root folder of the bitcoin core source code and run:Code:./contrib/install_db4.sh $(pwd)export BDB_PREFIX=$(pwd)/db4     # This is supposed to be the db4 folder in the current die. If you get mysterious compile errors related to Berkeley DB, you probably forgot to run this command../autogen.sh./configure BDB_LIBS=\"-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8\" BDB_CFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include\" CXXFLAGS=\"-O0 -g\" CFLAGS=\"-O0 -g\"makeOK, now we have built Bitcoin Core 24 from source. Now we are ready to debug it. You can open the debugger with this command:Code:gdb src/bitcoind(If that says command not found, you need to install gdb using \"sudo apt-get install gdb\")This will open up a debugger.Now all you have to do is run:Code:run -nodaemonThis will start Bitcoind and pass it the -nodaemon option, so it doesn't fork and escape from the debugger.At this point, just monitor the debugger. If Core crashes or mysteriously disappears again, its going to show up on the debugger. Just copy and paste the entire output here so we can inspect it.",
