But you can know if a wallet is BIP39 seep phrase or not.To know if a seed phrase is a BIP39 seed phrase, import it on a wallet that support BIP39 seed phrase and check if the addresses are the same. Do it with a seed phrase generated for an experimental purpose, not your coin seed phrase.",

Otherwise if you want to know the type of the seed phrase created by someone else is, it is hard since in some cases one mnemonic can be valid in multiple algorithms (eg. an Electrum seed being a valid BIP39 and vice versa).

They are completely different types of seed phrases. Almost all non-custodial wallets (with a few exceptions) support BIP39 seed phrase. If you have a BIP39 seed phrase and you know the derivation path, there's nothing to worry about. There are many wallets that can be used for recovering your wallets. (Note that most wallets use standard derivation paths and there is no need to save or write down the derivation path at all) If you have an electrum's seed phrase, you can recover your wallet using electrum itself and bluewallet.

I've done some recovery stuff with btcrecover but never with that much missing (I wouldn't have started such a quest because it would've been a waste of time and energy).My educated guess is: this is too much missing out. You don't have the time and energy to search through 99 missing bits.It's good if you're sure about the last word, because it contains a 4 bit partial hash checksum, but still you need to find more of your words. Correct sequence position is not important, that you can brute force with less work. But having 9 completely missing words is too bad and I'd say not breakable.Why do you have only such a small fragment? Could there be somewhere another copy?Open a separate thread for your recovery issue. But if you can't find more words, it's very likely pretty much hopeless.Why is it hopeless? 2^99 are 633,825,300,114,114,700,748,351,602,688 possible choices. Way too many...",
