  "content": "QuoteThe chorus of those wanting a weaker labor market is getting louder and louder.After the recent job numbers were released last week, Bank of America analysts said in a note they are essentially \"rooting against the home team\" and hope the numbers stop being so strong. As higher wages contribute to inflation, the Federal Reserve appears to agree.“Chair Powell keeps mentioning the relationship between the high level of job openings and wage/price inflation,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday. “He’s not talking to investors. He’s talking to corporate America, and his goal is to have companies essentially institute a hiring freeze and end the cycle of paying up for new hires.”Wednesday's economic release of consumer prices (CPI) showed inflation rose more slowly in April (8.3%) compared to March (8.5%). While the report was expected to have shown a March peak, there wasn't much good news.\"[Substantial] declines in the annual rate of inflation are unlikely to materialize until there are significant improvements in geopolitical tensions (that would get energy prices lower), supply chain strains and labour market shortages,\" wrote ING's James Knightley in a note after the release. \"Unfortunately, there is little sign of any of this happening anytime soon.\"TD Securities analysts agreed, noting the \"report should be of concern for the Fed given price gains in the core segment appear to be spreading.\"According to the consensus view of economists and analysts, shocks to commodities, supply chain issues, and the red hot (and very tight) labor market are all keeping inflation high and unpleasant. But it's the labor market that appears hardest to vanquish.While supply-chain problems and big price shocks have been easing, \"we see no such let-up when it comes to labor cost pressure,\" Bank of America's global economist Ethan S. Harris pointed out. Employers can't find people to fill open positions, tons of people are changing jobs, and \"looking ahead there is no sign of stabilization.\"In Colas's view, the only way to get stabilize inflation is to use the monetary policy hammer to hit stock prices.“The Fed’s goal is to convince corporate America to enact a short-term hiring freeze, and it will keep raising rates and talking about aggressive monetary policy until that happens,” Colas wrote. “Lower stock prices are his way of convincing C-suites and boards to do that.”The Fed's 'blunt force tool of rate policy'Powell has been focused on the ratio between job openings versus unemployed workers and the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures inflation.“Chair Powell mentioned the ratio several times at last Wednesday’s press conference,” said Colas, who said job postings need to drop from 11.5 million to around 8 million to get to normalcy.The only way to get there would be some sort of freeze from companies.“[Freezes] typically [happen] when C-suites and boards decide that business conditions have become very uncertain. The Fed doesn’t have a seat at those discussions, but it does have the blunt force tool of rate policy and its effect on stock prices,” Colas said. “Chair Powell has made it clear that he wants to see openings decline.”The big question is by how much — and whether it will be enough to whip out the “R” word?Harris wrote if the strength stays at the 200,000 openings per month pace we’ve seen, “the Fed will need to push job growth down to ~25k per month.”But, Harris added, “If the labor force has slowed to a more trend-like 100k then they will need to push job growth to negative 70k. That is, they would need to trigger a mild recession.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-fed-wants-corporate-america-to-have-a-hiring-freeze-morning-brief-100055174.html....They are proposing a hiring freeze in the united states to fix inflation. Claiming higher wages contribute to higher inflation.This must be an esoteric region of the federal reserve's playbook that is not commonly utilized to address economic crisis.Their goal is to push job growth down to between 25,000 to 70,000 per month. Trigger a \"mild recession\" to fix whatever problems.I hope everyone is prepared in case circumstances do not pan out as expected.",

      "body": "I do not know who is making these rules, higher wages do not make higher inflation, inflation is the byproduct of so many other things and literally the only thing keeping people off the streets are their moderate wages, it's not even high to begin with, the most I woke give them is -acceptable- but that also for a few jobs not for everyone else, many people are getting way underpaid and that's why I do think that these laws would crumble down. There are countries like the UK which is asking people to come and work for them because of brexit and providing minimum wages as well, there is a shortage of workers, I feel like if they do this people might wanna move to countries which are accepting working class. Also they are literally asking to push people off the job, the medical bills alone costs a fortune, how about they start making it affordable first and then ask people to hold off the jobs.",

      "body": "FED has gone nuts it seems! Instead of making the lives of people easier, they are trying to put the salaried class in trouble. A basic way to control inflation is to reduce the money supply into the hands of the common people so that they spend less which pushes down the demand and thus the supply. Which eventually reduces inflation. If they are serious about it, they should increase the interest rate. Instead if pushing the burden to the common people, they should taken it on themselves.",

      "body": "The people running the Fed have done so from ivory towers for so long they have no idea what they’re doing. They didn’t see inflation coming when every other person in the world knew it was obvious. They couldn’t talk down the problem and they can’t print us out of this mess. That leaves them with the only thing they’ve seen crash prices in the past, a recession. They’re going to do everything they can to send us into a recession now to fight the problems their incompetence caused. Guess who that’s going to hurt? Buckle up…",

      "body": "High job openings does lead to inflation.Think about it this way. You own a small business and you pay $20hr for your staff. Half of your staff left because they found work for $25hr. Then you need to hire more people, nobody wants to work for $20hr so you need to increase it to $25hr.Now you are paying your employees more for the same amount of work. So what do you do? Need to increase your prices obviously which leads to inflation.",

Goods and services cost more, therefore salaries must increase in order to maintain a competitive market wage. Fed is playing a dangerous game trying to balance the economy and steer it away from recession despite how much money they printed in 2020/2021. You don't get to choose both lower inflation and avoiding economic recession.Quote from: stompix on June 01, 2022, 06:24:10 PMOk, so I read the text ten times and I don't see any paragraph quoting either a FED spokesperson or from BOA or anything that is not a personal opinion and 3 words paragraphs extracted from god knows what context.I'm skeptical as well but given what the fed has been doing over past years this type of incompetence seems in line with the norm.",
