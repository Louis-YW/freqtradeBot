There has been much, very justified, criticism of the decision to host the World Cup in a country that criminalises same-sex relationships and where LGBTQ+ people have fewer rights, where women’s rights are hugely restricted, and in stadiums built on the bodies of migrant workers.Source:The Guardian.I think they are the \"bureaucratic\" ways to get intelligent spaces to carry out demands for fundamental changes in a complex society like Qatar's.But who is actually the real winner with this action, I think first of all Fifa, which is still looking to clean up its image with one of the most controversial World Cups in soccer history.The Guardian:https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/referee-stephanie-frappart-world-cup-history-first-womanStéphanie Frappart:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stéphanie_Frappart",

South Africa organized the World Cup and society suffers from racial and ethnic discrimination. Russia has also never been a paradise for its residents, and human rights issues are very urgent.I am not defending Qatar and I know that human rights are the last thing the human rights authorities might think of, but I would like to hear suggestions about countries free from all kinds of persecution and discrimination against minorities or against human rights activists so that we blame Qatar.",
