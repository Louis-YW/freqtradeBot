      "body": "I don't understand what's the relation between NFT and Bitcoin because both of them are completely different, also it doesn't make sense if they can't sell Bitcoin because it's decentralized, even government can't shut down Bitcoin. If you refer to fake Bitcoin e.g. Bitcoin that run in unknown chain, of course there's a chance you get a shitcoins. That's why P2P in ETH, BSC, Polygon chain are very risky if you can't distinguish a legit and fake token.",

And also you are using rug pull wrong. Your example is not a rug pull because scammer just simply mislead the buyer on selling NFT with fake value while rug pull are those tokens that pump and become zero value before the devs manage to provide the project product leaving the project abandoned.",

So the smart contract is just coded with a specific address in mind, which is, it's the address of the smart contract creator itself. That specific address is the one that will only be able to sell tokens, every other else can't sell it, but they are only able to buy or move it.",

And sell their tokens by showing big dreams when they have accumulated enough money, they remove the liquidity from the decentralized exchange (DEX) After which no token holder can trade/swap that token.

NFT tokens are subjectively priced among collectors and do not have a common pool, like DeFi tokens. So I don't see how rug pull can be used in an NFT token. NFT uses another scam more appropriate for this kind of token, it's wash trading, where the user sells and buys his own token from himself to make it popular and in demand.",

Though a lot of rug pull incidents before and this is not new any more. This can happen any time to any project, especially if the project is still new. There’s a lot of fake project and any time can turn into a scam project, if you don’t want to become a victim of those fake project better to do your best research first before investing.",

      "body": "Rug pull scams is a very unfortunate phenomenon in the crypto space. It is really difficult to find out which tokens have the potential to carry out rug pull. This calls for serious research especially on the team members of the project. A reputable personality involved in a project may help to give a clue to a project that at least will not rug pull. Another noticeable thing is that rug pull are very common with tokens that are listed on decentralized exchanges. They are likely to avoid being listed on centralized exchanges because the exchange can expose them. Most times, such tokens are locked and are difficult to sell except for the owners who may design the code to suit their propose. IMO, It is a high risk activity to join new projects more so if the project is only meant to be listed in decentralized exchanges and have no plans for centralized exchanges. However, that does not mean that listing a token on centralized exchanges is a guarantee of safety, but it could be a clue to confirm how genuine a token is. However, there are also good projects that can plan to list only on decentralized exchange/exchanges. The bottom line is to do a comprehensive research before investing.",

But if you talk about NFTs, many of them are scams, in fact, that issue has been raised in the past days during their hype. It eventually gave us no hope to stop this kind of market drama as scams spread everywhere. But I hope you don't make it generalized and never include Bitcoin for them.
