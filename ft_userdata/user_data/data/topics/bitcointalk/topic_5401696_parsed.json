Anything with mining contracts just yells SCAM to me. Sorry just my two cents. Even your thread here seems very copy and paste.Hi,thanks for your feedback. Yes this thread seems not very organic currently.Some Background info:Kryptobay is a GmbH in Germany which is owned 100% (currently at least) by Peerschweinchen GmbH. Peerschweinchen GmbH is offering the mining contracts for XBTX, ETH, ZEC and compatible algo's. At the same time Peerschweinchen Produces the Bluebox 2 and Greenbox Mining/Staking PC's which allow to start some digging into the Cryptoworld for newbies at around 7W power consumption. Kryptobay pays Cashback on some product in Crypto. You will find also the PARA Club membership on Kryptobay which grants access to online tournaments and streams about developments in the TELOS / XBTX Community. https://kryptobay.eu/product-category/para/Also your monthly payment is equal to a 1:1 voucher you can spend on goods. For example you can take a Nintendo Switch (price ~220) and after 2 para club installments it is payed and you can take the next product. https://CryptoMages.io physical NFT cards are available at Kryptobay from now on as Stripe refused to accept further payments for NFT's. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cryptomages-trading-card-gameOnly Paypal is accepting NFT's as products.

      "body": "QuoteIs it only Bitcoin BTC,TELOS and XBTX the accepted Cryptocurrenccy?Technically we can support more but it depends on request and than how the cryptocurrency is supported by Payment processors or at least things like https://cryptocurrencycheckout.com - which is not a payment processor but a payment tracker. Please check also the [share] products as you can invest in rate collectibles which are than going to be auctioned at higher price. Examples are:[POP-NFT] [Share] Death Of Wolverine #4 Signed By Stan Lee[POP-NFT] means that you get a NFT as Proof of Purchase.You can join the collectors club and claim NFT's on the blockchain and show them to the world for 5€ / month -> the benefit is that the club Pins the IPFS files so the pictures, videos, animations or code is always accessible. [shares] allow you to invest in Shares of collectibles as like signed Stand Lee comics, original wrapped Gaming Consoles, Rolex Watches, Oldtimers and sport cars, or ART and stuff like rare shoes, signed Footballs and whatever. https://kryptobay.eu/product/pop-nft-share-death-of-wolverine-4-signed-by-stan-lee/The [shares] will be sold at a higher price of at lease 20%+ via auctions. So it is like Ebay where you grab something and resell it automatically later on at higher price. We take 1.95% of the dropprice as fee for fulfillment. https://kryptobay.eu/product/pop-nft-share-gameboy-1994-dmg-001-complete-in-opened-box/Soon we launch the re-commerce Module, so you can offer i-phones or whatever to us for reselling. So the mission is easy:You and us own crypto. We provide goods you need also on request and you can spend crypto on them.  Or you sell stuff and we pay in crypto. We also have a shop in Duisburg / Germany where you can checkout NFT's or bring in stuff.",
