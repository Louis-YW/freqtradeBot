Sometimes projects that behave like that are project which manage the bounties by themselves or they get low rank accounts to do it. This is why bounty hunters should know this things and always watch out for accounts that manage this bounties. You did not mention the project or manager. You have to do that so members here will advise you well and DT members can know whether to red tag them or not.",

Can you send the link of that bounty here so we would be able to check it?@joeperry you are making a double stand response to the Op question. More op is talking regard to bounty and not signature campaigns. We see that signature campaign don't have that kind of issue here and when there few that is suspected to be untrusted because of the new account they are immediately busted and users are warned to it. That is good here on signature campaigns but bounty is not. Bounty is very risky. Why will bounty manager will not update spreadsheet for the end of bounty like a month and 3 months of bounty? That is clear scam sign. A serious bounty will do update of spreadsheet regularly at minimum. Spreadsheet is to help for things being clear to everyone participating and the management.",

In this space, this is not too strange because there are many projects or BMs with bad intentions that take advantage of hunters to promote them. I have also encountered many more funny situations, but I don't need to care too much while we still have many other opportunities to participate in quality campaigns and have great rewards.",

That is the ordinary thing to do but good manager do random check within the week to see if someone is cheating the campaign.  Like for example, there is a case where a signature participant joined 2 different campaign at the same time.  He cheat the campaign by changing signature materials during the scheduled counting thus getting paid in both campaigns.",

This can help someone that will deal on that unprofessional manager. You can ask some dt's too for help, as dt's can make the feedback more noticeable. You need to promote another project? Then go.Let's only hope that the project is going to be handled by a better manager and let's hope that it was a legit project. I don't know if you can still get paid on the previous bounty that you have joined since the situation is complicated to sort out. Just don't hope too much on that one.",

You can ask it in their telegram group so that it can be commented on and replied to.
