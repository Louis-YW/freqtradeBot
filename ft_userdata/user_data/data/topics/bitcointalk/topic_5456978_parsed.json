  "content": "It's pretty amazing how we keep climbing up the efficiency ladder, taking Bitmain is an example and ignoring everything prior to AsicBoost because that was a game changer, I gathered the small piece of info below ignoring all the \"T\" models and some variation of some models that I don't see relevent.Code:S9  90w/th using 16nm chipsS11 76w/th  15.5% improvementS15 57w/th  25% improvementS17 45w/th  21% improvementS19 36w/th  20% improvementS19 Pro 29.5w/th  18% improvementS19 XP 21.5w/th   27% improvement using 5nm chips*Average improvement = 21%I have little to no knowledge of semiconductors design or manufacturing, but it doesn't seem like we still have too much room for improvement on the chip level, so maybe they'd start putting more chips on a single board, lowering the frequency and voltage to achieve the best efficiency at the expense of price, with more focus on the firmware level.Where do you see mining efficiency in the coming few years, any chance we drop below 10w/th? I am interested in hearing your thoughts.",

The example he used was put a space heater in a small room and see how fast the temperature rises then do the same thing a room 3 x the size. The above is all well and good.....BUT, in the world as he put it, space for servers costs money so businesses want density. Marketing & sales can't sell last generation things even if they are betting since the competition can point to theirs that are newer even if not better. And so on. Same thing more or less here. -Dave",

      "body": "Quote“Getting revenues from shipment can be defined as ‘commercialization’, but ASIC is a relatively simple kind of chip to produce, in terms of architecture,” Chen remarked. Analyst John Wang from Digitimes emphasized that the yield from Samsung’s 3nm GAA process remains low. Consequently, Wang believes the tech giant aims to attract a broad customer base to refine its procedures and enhance yield. The report from Techinsights concludes by noting the uncertainty surrounding the use of Samsung’s 3nm chips in any additional hardware devices in the market today.Does not surprise me. As I've often said in the past, mining ASIC's are excellent for refining bleeding-edge chip production processes: being dirt simple circuits and highly tolerant of process variability translates into them being the perfect high-volume test bed for advanced node sizes. Despite initial low yields it still provides the Foundries with revenue from any usable chips and gives them process data needed so more complex chips can be produced as the production processes become more refined giving higher yield of usable chips.The folks that paid TSMC, Samsung & Global Foundries for research into making smaller node sizes even possible were Apple, Broadcom, Cisco, Micron, NVIDIA et al. Thing is, research leading to actually being able to build & implement everything required is one thing, fine tuning everything to be able to produce the billions of gates & their interconnections present on each chip with 0-errors and repeat it thousands of times per-wafer is a whole `nother story. Ref https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count for insight into the phenomenal number of gates in them these days... From that article:QuoteThe highest transistor count in a consumer microprocessor is 134 billion transistors, in Apple's ARM-based dual-die M2 Ultra system on a chip, which is fabricated using TSMC's 5 nm semiconductor manufacturing process.Only actually producing hundreds of thousands of lower complexity test chips in the brand sparkly-new production environment lets you do that. The main users of the chips are not going to directly pay for those massively expensive runs of test chips: enter mining chips to let the Foundries figure it out before risking far more complex and valuable chips.TSMC did the exact same thing for that same reason using Bitmain and Canaan chips as the guinea pigs for their development of the 28/27nm (S1) thru 5nm (S19) production nodes. Samsung previously did this with Canaan's ill fated A941 which was the 1st miner to use the 10nm node.",
