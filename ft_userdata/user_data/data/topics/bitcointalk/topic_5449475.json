It’s better to use decentralized exchanges like bisq to trade your bitcoins to fiatQuote from: Greggry on April 19, 2023, 05:03:43 PMbitpay.com › blog › cash-out-bitcoinIs this the source?

Especially if it's a generic search over the internet, I'll expect to see there quite a fair amount of scam sites advertised before the really good methods are shown. Plus many do put centralized exchanges in the higher positions of their lists.So one more list will not hurt. Let's just help by improving it.Quote from: Greggry on April 19, 2023, 05:03:43 PM1. Use a crypto debit card like the BitPay Card.3. Use a P2P exchange.This should not be the first in the list. The anonymous ways should go higher. So p2p should be the first option.Plus: there are a lot of such debit cards, some better, some worse, some... better to fully avoid.Quote from: Greggry on April 19, 2023, 05:03:43 PM2. Sell crypto for cash on a central exchange like Coinbase or Kraken.This brings even higher risks than the crypto cards because some of the banks still lock in 2023 the funds from crypto exchanges, asking for questions and asking for a lot of papers.Plus it's 2 centralized businesses we're talking about.Imho this should be the last in the list.And some sort of warning: I recommend that if one uses this method he should consider using a different account (and bank) than the main account/bank (if you get funds frozen, at least you can still access those from the main bank).Quote from: Greggry on April 19, 2023, 05:03:43 PM4.

It would have been better if you had explained the stages or steps to doing it, just as you made mention of the steps. Normally, anyone who knows how to buy Bitcoin also knows how to exchange it for cash, so you can't count 2 before 1, it's always 1 before 2. Your topic would have made more sense if you had explained the full details of how to buy and how to convert to cash. Among all the method you mentioned, I think the charges associated with using a Bitcoin ATM are usually higher than on other platforms (not sure though).",

      "body": "@OP Just as other members have suggested, P2P should be your number one choice on the list, and aside from making them your number one means of exchanging Bitcoin to cash, you should also consider recommending some completely anonymous P2P platforms that don't require users' IDs for verification before they can use their service. When IDs for verification are required, the user's identity is no longer private and can be compromised. Here are two P2P exchanges that I have used and texted: 1.   Hodlhodl   No KYC was needed, and I had a smooth buying and selling experience with them. 2.   Agoradesk  registration was fast with just a username and email (not compulsory), and I sold Bitcoin using the platform and received a gift card. You can discuss and choose which payment method you need with your dealer. Their charges are also very low; you are allowed to select the amount of fee that will be charged from you when buying BTC; the higher the fee, the slower the speed of receiving.

Along side the high transaction fee of up to about 30% by companies. The idea of having to send to a third party wallet is a turn off. Just like the regular bank ATM the malfunctioning system of the atm could affect the smoothness of withdrawal. Some of these transactions ends up been delayed or faced problems that requires the customer service which are sometimes too slow in handling issues.",

It's not the problem again the right way. I just remember several years ago having a difficult experience exchanging Bitcoin for cash because not many local exchanges can do that. But, after today, many exchanges growing up and developing his project indeed giving an interesting bonus for the new user. So, with your list, I think if members haven't a problem with KYC, centralization exchange is the best way to cash it, it could be easier and not more complicated than another list especially for users who haven't experienced much with crypto.",

In Spain there are some like this one:https://tubitcoin.es/No kyc for amounts below €1,000, although there is legislation in the pipeline that I don't know if it will change this and they will require kyc for any amount. But I imagine that Spain is not the only place in the world where there are physical shops that will exchange bitcoin for cash. Has no one seen this in other countries? If there are many places where they exchange foreign currency for local currency, it should not be unusual to have some shops where they exchange bitcoin for cash or vice versa.",

Because it's centralised, you need to do KYC, which makes you known to the third party. There's no secret that by doing KYC, it means our identity is accessible to them. Centralised exchanges usually have an obligation to comply with certain government regulations, which makes us consumers more exposed and means we also need to comply with taxation regulations. It's unavoidable. So, the rest of the ways I think are the most advanced ways to cash in bitcoin, although actually P2P was meant to be the essence of decentralisation as based on Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.",

      "body": "IMHO, the only real option to convert bitcoin into cash is to sell them p2p for cash or use an ATM. What should be an even higher priority for bitcoiners is that we look for ways to spend them as cash because that's what bitcoin is. It's a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. When we spend bitcoin as cash, we not only help to grow the circular economy but we also help the counterparty to stack sats without having to undergone KYC.Sell for cash any way possible that preserves your privacy and the counterparty. I have not used the service yet but https://LocalSats.org seems like it could show a lot of promise for selling p2p at physical locations. It can be used anonymously and uses lnauth to login. Since this is a physical meetup with strangers, always be wary of honeypots, scams, attacks, etc.ATMs can be good but often have cameras and require some sort of KYC-lite data. Be careful when using any sort of machine to buy/sell because that camera can be attached to an entire hive mind of AI, facial recognition, KYC databases, etc.   Gift cards are a good option after selling to an ATM but I would do all I can to avoid using any sort of permissioned platform to spend bitcoin and I actively boycott any business that uses BitPay due to their policy where they will \"randomly\" require even the person paying to verify their identity to complete a purchase. I even consider sending any private sats to a KYC platform an attack on bitcoin. Once you receive sats without any KYC, you should only spend them with other plebs who value bitcoin privacy. The further away from KYC that sats get, the more private they become. LEt's keep that trend going. Here is my updated list for you.   1. Spend as cash2. Sell p2p for cash (meetups, p2p exchanges, and then possibly an ATM)3. Sell for gift cards4. Never send to a KYC off-ramp because you give them chain analysis data that is more valuable than data from buying via a KYC on-ramp.",
