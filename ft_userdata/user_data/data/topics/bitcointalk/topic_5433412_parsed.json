      "body": "It depends. It's not like they can show the evidence they gathered if it's going to implicate them more, whether said implications were due to how they got it or the content of the evidence, but anyway, I reckon they can't simply show it like that. In most cases, I usually just observe how they handle a case, whether they outright ignore it, answer the questions with as much detail and evidence as possible, or simply chalk it up with the user throwing empty words at them. I also judge them based on the proof the accusations first presented though. In most cases I reckon they just avoided something, created a new account, got banned for avoiding bans like that, and immediately assumed that it was the casinos fault and not theirs.",

Hence if there's any case or issues they user should be very smart enough to have some evidence maybe while dealing with them or could be during their conversation with them he could screenshots and save them as the evidence. Lastly to make sure he reads their ToS I think that is the most important aspect of any gambling site.",

What you say is nothing new, OP, we have accusations every week, but very few demonstrations of wrongdoing by casinos. In general the casinos we see on this forum do things right and the proof of this is all the forum users who use them regularly and do not complain.",

On long run casinos which cheat on their players to not pay them the won prizes properly don't survive on this industry, because with so many different platforms available, gamblers are just going to put them aside and move to a more reputable casino where users give positive feedbacks and have positive experiences. So don't worry too much about this issue. There will be always legit and scammy services, all you have to do is to check where you are going to deposit your money before doing so.",

That's why it is important to check some open scam accusation even from reputable gambling sites as you'll never know, even the known gambling sites are capable of doing some sketch works.Regards with your question. As a player, we can't do anything but to trust the casinos where we are playing as that's the only key for us to use their platform.",

Keeping an eye on this thread, to learn about other's view on this...Agreed, it is to be noted. One should know to differentiate the proper accusation as well as the accusation created to demolish the trust particular casino have gained through its years of service. For now it is the provably fair system that makes a casino trustworthy. Apart from this, the reviews from the users too gives trust, because only through the users they can stand long in the business.",

They make their monies from customers losses, hence why it might be quite difficult to win a case against them. I do also think that knowing and using the proper channels to report cases of unfairness should be a top priority before one chooses a casino to game with.It is more than just KYC, because once your trust is gotten and bet is placed, you are at their mercy and when it is worst is if there is no customer care responsible enough to give a soothing response.No one should trust a casino without legit channels to communicate with the management and also, regulatory agencies who sanction these casinos should be an open secret to the public/users.",

So it's really up to you, even if the top tier casinos have accusations, depends whether you want to trust and use their system just because of this accusations.And I'm not sure, I don't have the numbers but usually those who accused casinos have been caught red handed with cheating and yet they don't want to admit that and still pursue the case, just saying.",

      "body": "For chance games, we have the provably fair system, which as long as you know how it works and how to verify, you don't have to trust the provider. For other games, it pretty much requires trust and the provider can single-handedly reject your winnings without giving proof as per their TOS. So what makes their software trusted, well, they have to comply with the regulator or lost their license. It's pretty straightforward for table or chance games, so I rarely see a problem with trust. I also rarely see a casino that rejects withdrawal from chance games wins.For sports betting, it's a completely different situation as there are syndicates and all sorts of abusers. I'd say 99% of complaints/scam accusations were sports betting issues. Since I don't play sports betting, I still pretty much enjoy playing games whether it's hash games or 3rd party games without trust issues. Regarding to the evidence, sometimes they have it, but they just don't want to disclose the data/method to outsmart the abusers. It's like playing a cat-and-mouse game.But sure you can't take their reason at face value. You should use common sense and ask the question of whether casino A with sponsorship here and there worth hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars will cheat a customer for a $100 or $1,000 withdrawal.",

There are site that didn't care that much about the accusation here in the forum, its sad because they can't even address the problem and yet they are still here.
