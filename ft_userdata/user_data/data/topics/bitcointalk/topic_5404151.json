Are you using HDD or SSD? Do you have enough Peers connected? And is your system by any chance low on RAM and actively swapping?If it is: close other applications. If it's not: set database cache (dbcache) to 6144 (6 GB) and restart Bitcoin Core.Your sync should take about 8 hours.",

Please make sure you do.Then.. I am 99% sure you're saving the blockchain onto HDD. But do you have by chance SSD on your system (there's a very good chance you do). If so, use symlinks for your chainstate folder (and if you have indexes, also to the index folder) to copy it to SSD. However, give a read to this topic and see what was proposed there: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387672.0",

If you've got a hdd you can defragment it and see if that speeds it up but you might want to get an ssd for a faster install.How far are you up to with the syncs? Blocks tend to get more saturated around bull runs (especially the 2017 one) - also sometimes the estimator can be a bit random with its timings at some points too.",

Most likely, your hardware doesn't provide relatively fast blockchain data validation, which is the process where your node checks every block, transaction, signatures, etc. To speed up the validation process, you can try to move part of the files from the bitcoin core folder to an SSD disc, which are known to have higher IOPs (input-output operations per second) when compared to traditional HDDs. All things being equal, the higher the IOPs of your disc is, the faster is going to be the synchronization with the bitcoin blockchain. If your SSD disc is too small in terms of available space to record all blockchain data, you can split your data directory using the following guide: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Splitting_the_data_directory",

You haven't shared the config and the type of storage used so I'll just assume that it's set to default and both machines have the same type of Drive (SSD).But with this message alone, I can guess that the first machine should've synced in a relatively same amount of time:Quote from: Jaggen on June 26, 2022, 04:00:58 PMIt started out saying that it would take something like 5 years until complete, but has now gone down and stabilized at2 years and 2 weeks.You observed that it synced 3-years worth of blocks, the last 2 years may be slower, but with that spec, it shouldn't take that long.So it must be the 'time-equivalent amount of blocks left' instead of the actual estimated time to fully sync.Here's the screenshot of the \"green bar\" that I was talking about (SigNet):Here's the screenshot of the actual estimated time (SigNet):(opens right after starting Core or when you click the \"green bar\")",
