  "content": "A class action lawsuit filed in a federal court in Georgia alleges the crypto exchange failed to secure users' accounts against theft and hacks, and seeks damages upwards of $5 million.Coinbase, which last year became the first cryptocurrency exchange to go public in the U.S., is facing a string of lawsuits from unhappy investors. In addition to another aspiring class action lawsuit filed in New Jersey alleging the company allowed U.S. persons to trade unregistered securities, earlier this month, a Coinbase shareholder accused the company of misleading investors about last year's public listing. The platform is also trying to settle two separate lawsuits filed by investors through arbitration.The suit alleges Coinbaseâ€™s failure to \"establish and maintain adequate cybersecurity measures\" caused investors to lose their \"wallet and account access, the assets and investments in those accounts\" as well as \"sensitive personally identifiable information stored in their Coinbase accounts, and, among other things, their investment opportunities.\"(Source: Coindesk)",

Even if they get emailed to users, people in general just don't like reading articles that much; unfortunately.",

If you get phished, hacked, social engineered into revealing something about you to someone else, that's your fault. I am pretty sure they have all agreed through the TOS that they can't hold Coinbase responsible for having their accounts hacked or losing access to them. There is surely a clause in the agreements that allows the platform to freeze, lock, or require security checks from their users whenever they want to.There is only a case if they are found guilty of trading what the SEC considers crypto securities.",

People just look at it too much as a hindrance rather than a security measure.Part of the issue IMO is the lack of good customer service and lack of physical locations to deal with some issues.Had an issue with a bank starting in late July, spent hours on the phone and progress was VERY slow. But, after a few evenings of making slow progress I drove my ass down to the local branch and after about 90 minutes of the person I was dealing with and their manager working their way up the internal CoC the issue was fixed. Partly my fault, partly the banks fault and since the bank had bought the bank I was dealing with before partly the old banks fault. BUT, the issue was fixed since there were people who could handle it. You can't do that with Coinbase so you are stuck dealing with offshore support. To make matters worse, there are a lot of people who are just starting in crypto and wind up at Coinbase and just don't understand how it's done. So it's not just a new thing (crypto) it's an entirely new way of dealing with money and they have issues.-Dave",
