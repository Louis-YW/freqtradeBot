I'm sure you could find some dodgy two bit broker or individual who would be willing to \"sell\" you some stocks anonymously, but you will almost certainly end up being scammed.I wouldn't touch anything on DeFi with a 60 foot pole. You have no way of verifying that the token you are being sold is matched to a share or stock, and buying these tokens does absolutely nothing to the supply or demand of the actual stock. And how are you going to get paid your dividends? You won't. What are you rights in a merger or buy out? Likely zero. At best you are getting a worthless IOU which can be taken from you at any moment for any number of reasons. At worst, you are just being scammed.If you want to buy stocks using bitcoin, then the most private way of doing it and keeping your bitcoin activities private will be to sell the bitcoin for fiat in a decentralized peer-to-peer manner, and then deposit that fiat in to your standard broker account and buy stocks as you usually do.",

Last week, UST broke and depegged, taking down Terra with it. Mirror's pricing oracles seem to be taking 1 USD = 1 UST as fact, but 1 UST is now trading at $0.101 so stock pricing is broken (example: oracles are reporting $TWTR to be worth 38.23 UST (~= $3.84), while stock market pricing is $38.24 USD). Even if pricing was accurate taking the depeg into account, a lot of trust has been lost in Terra so most people are probably looking to get out.My interpretation:Quote from: LoyceV on May 21, 2022, 10:13:16 AMWhen pegging a stock to crypto, I would assume that when someone buys a \"crypto stock\" the organisation behind it buys the real stock and keeps it. If that happened, the stock must still be there! Who's taking the profit now? If it didn't happen, it was a ponzi from the start.TL;DR: don't do it. You'll need to trust some anonymous guy with your money.",

As part of this license is the AML policy which requires every customer to undergo KYC.I believe you can only purchased virtual stocks or an IOU stock if you want a non kyc method on purchasing.",
