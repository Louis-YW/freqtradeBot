      "body": "Bitcoin seems to be the safest investment in the world of cryptocurrencies. If someone just wants to regularly allocate some amount for investment and forget about these funds for a long time, then bitcoin seems to me to be a good asset. However, if someone wants to get more involved in the world of cryptocurrencies, then diversification is advisable. There are many interesting projects on the market that can bring more profit than Bitcoin over time, but you need to follow these projects on an ongoing basis, because there is also a greater risk of failure.",

      "body": "Even if you have limited resources its still advisable to diversify, though Bitcoin can be lesser risk for long term time frame there's still no assurance for its peak price so I suggest to buy other good crypto as well and do the DCA. Don't go all in regardless of its value, that is too risk so if you want to be more profitable then invest wisely. I prefer to allocate 50% of my investment to Bitcoin and the rest will serve as my capital for trading and altcoin investments.",

The meaning of limited resources depends on what kind of person you are asking but for me limited resources means that you only have money for necessities and extra money for something. I believe that we should invest on BTC if we are secured in real life like having savings and emergency funds. I sold my BTC back then because if don't have any funds at that time and I experience an emergency that force me to sell my BTC at loss. I learned my lesson back then and now I'm confident that my Bitcoins won't be touched even an emergency happen again.",

      "body": "IMO, there are several points and thoughts in your post that I would like to note. Buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is an investment decision, and it carries many risks. It is important to have a well-thought-out and well-formulated investment plan in place before deciding to invest in any currency. Accumulating Bitcoin and holding it for a long time can be of great benefit to resourceful and patient investors. This is not an investment strategy that works for everyone, and needs to be carefully evaluated and considered. For newer investors, investing in these currencies can require in-depth knowledge and experience to make the right investment decisions.",

It very hard to finish reading the whole content due to the small text and very long context without separator.It’s true that purchasing only Bitcoin when you have a limited resources is the best way to maximize gain since Bitcoin price is the best performing crypto asset in long run. Wasting your money on risky shitcoin will just make your investment slow to grow because shitcoins is worst during bear market. Buy only Bitcoin and keep holding until your bags is already. This way you can guarantee a maximize profit on crypto with less risk.",

Because if bitcoin is 100 thousand dollars as of today, you can get 4x at most. But if you say that I don't need a lot of money, this amount is enough for me, it makes sense to make this investment.

Choosing altcoins would put your funds at a bigger risk than with Bitcoin or other assets. Every asset has volatile market prices but atleast you would be able to compare which would have a more volatile one. I won't agree with others who pushes bigger risk and reward if you have limitations with your funds in the first place. Why? 'coz that would be a gamble. The bigger yout capital is, the more you would be able to endure market price changes ofcourse. Manage the risk all the time.There's no easy profit in any industry so better be more careful with a more volatile one.",

Exactly, the problem with a great deal of investors or traders is that they they want to run before they even learn how to walk, they want to invest in all kind of coins since the beginning of their journey and this is simply a mistake, in my opinion investors should restrain themselves to invest in bitcoin only for at least a cycle, then once they have proved to themselves that they have what is needed to make money by only investing in bitcoin and they know more about this market then they can take their chances with altcoins.",

It has shown long-term growth potential, and its scarcity and position as the first and largest cryptocurrency contribute to its appeal. On the other hand, if you want to participate more actively in the cryptocurrency market and seek higher potential returns, then diversification becomes important.
