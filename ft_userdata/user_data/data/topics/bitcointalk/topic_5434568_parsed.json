Right now Nigeria’s GDP per purchasing power parity is number 24 in the world. By nominal GDP we are number 27th economy in the world. Yes, some platform will put Nigeria only as 27th position GDP(PPP), and 31st position GDP nominal. Whatever the true figures are, my point remains that Nigeria must be credited for the progress we have made as a nation.Reference to post: Essay written by Pastor Dr. Sunday AdelajaLink for information: https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2023/01/11/stop-condemning-nigeria-we-are-doing-better-than-most-countries/God bless our country.

No doubt say Nigeria na the giant of Africa but this giant wey owna dey congratulate na one of the country wey get the highest unemployment rate for Africa. Recession, inflation and hunger wan destroy everybody for the country. For the thing wey this country dey good at na to get plenty personal achievements because na only individual growth dem dey after but to develop the country economic make things easy for the citizen na very big problem. Like mr brainboss has clearly stated, no need for any celebrations when the country itself is not adding any positive value to me.

The name alone should tell you that he is the defender of the jagaban dynasty so therefore, he should be cruising home with fat pocket after the success of every jury. We all know the jagaban himself will go at all cost to defend himself irrespective of the nature of the case or whatever the case may be. Money is not the problem neither is it a challenge for the jagabans to sort things out themselves  for their convenience, safety and all other stuffs which would likely put them in the public domain in a wrong way which we all know. Apart from that, we have no doubt he might double as the family lawyer so that grants him access to whatever he needs too and possibly business connect too.
