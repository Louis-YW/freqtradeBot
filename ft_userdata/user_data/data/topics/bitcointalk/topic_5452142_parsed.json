  "content": "Might we have deficiencies in Niacin and/or Glutamine negatively affecting the quality of our lives and/or our longevity?I wasn’t really sure if I should make a thread out of this or just post this information in some existing thread.. but I was somewhat struck when I came across what usually would have had been a bitcoin podcast from February 27, 2023 (nearly 4 hours long) – and the guest (Dr. Dmitry Kats) was talking about population deficiencies in Niacin/Glutamin in terms of being a kind of ongoing conspiracy and/or purposeful plot that dates back to knowledge/studies from the 1930s.. and so from his point of view there has been a kind of purposeful pushing of the creation of Niacin/Glutamin deficiencies in the populous… even though Niacin/Glutamin can apparently prevent and reverse a lot of mortalities (or would it be co-morbidities?),…. And to extend lives, apparently.Once Bitten! A Bitcoin Podcast.Dr Dmitry Kats - The Truth About Niacin. #317February 27, 2023And some of the discussions in the podcast regarding absorption of various nutrients and interactions (such as drugs and nutrients) was a bit beyond my abilities to comprehend, and even his suggestion that certain kinds of products were more pure or less pure is not a kind of discussion that comforts me very much, because I find that sometimes when the cure or the way forward is too technical, then I become more suspicious in regards to whether something is being sold to us.It seems to me that Dr. Kats seemed to be saying that sometimes we may well not be getting the right quality and combination of products.. and surely he is saying that some of the products that we are getting end up depleting our bodies in various ways… and frequently, I hate to believe that human health has to be so specific in terms of specific doses of supplements or whatever in order to fix the evils of the various experiments and plots against us – even though I have been motivated into at least looking into some Niacin/Glutamin supplement products.. and pondering why I had stopped taking Niacin supplements several years ago - back when I stopped being able to find the big bottles with 500mg tablets in Costco.Anyhow, at this point, I have been so motivated that I created this thread and also currently, I am likely going to start taking some form of Niacin and Glutamin… and then ponder further over details of the matter further… and even to use myself as a kind of Guinea pig to see if there might be some results in my starting to add those kinds of supplements to my current daily routine.. and yeah, I might end up abandoning or changing products (first I have to figure out which products I am going to try out).. but I am at the earlier research portion of my journey.. whether I end up being the Guinea pig or not.Have any of you thought much about Niacin and/or Glutamin deficiencies as a kind of current, persistent and ongoing root cause to health issues?   Are there some other important point(s) that I might be missing from the podcast or related lifestyle matters?  Of course, many of us likely recognize the values of diet, sleep, exercise and moderating stress levels too… so sometimes various deficiencies that we might have in our body could come from lifestyle choices or even genetics or even some inevitable aging issues that are not necessarily going to be fixed by either lifestyle or supplementing choices.  Of course many of us would like to be able to reverse negative health issues and/or to extend our lives in various ways that we are capable to accomplish, yet how to be successful in any attempt to achieve such goals might be another matter.By the way, Dr. Kats did weave in some discussion of bitcoin during the podcast (mostly at the end), and it seems that he is fairly new to learning about bitcoin, but at least he seems to recognize the sovereign individual angles of bitcoin.. at least at a foundational level.",

It's an older book, but many other doctors and nutrition people have confirmed what is written therein, and built on the foundation it provides.Thanks for that BADecker.. It looks like I can buy that book (in paperback revised edition from 2002 – and the earlier original version was 1995) on Amazon for $7.98, and it would arrive between 1-2 weeks if I choose the free shipping option.   I am not sure if the book involves the exact theme(s) that I had understood Dr. Kats to have had  been attempting to argue in the podcast interview involving niacin/Glutamin.. yet I am not proclaiming to have had understood exactly what Dr. Kats was so excited about in that interview, either…  Accordingly, for me it seems to be worth checking out the book, since at this time, I can easily get it, and perhaps it would not take me very long to read through it.. to the extent that I might at least be able to peruse some of the science (depending on how it is written).. not always claiming to understand a lot of the specific science details even though I had read quite a few nutrition-related scientific books around 2012…. and surely any of us likely can just attempt to get whatever we can out of any readings that we might do.. and perhaps certain kinds of readings will lead into further readings.. Part of my own personal desire would be to figure out if there are any relatively straight-forward “action items” without necessarily going down the road of some kind of supplement fad – since many of us (including your truly) are likely skeptical in regards to a wide number of supplement fads (and false claims) that seem to exist in our modern world.Apparently, the updated addition (linked above) has Morton Walker as one of the co-authors, and specifically outlining some kind of a diet/supplementation regimen... which might also be of interest for me in terms of what diet/supplements are suggested.. and still not sure about the extent to which this might contrast with anything that Dr. Kats had been working on and/or recommending... which seems to be a work in progress regarding his (Kats's) actual outlining of some specific products.",

Study and use this info wisely.Well?  I don't know.Maybe you are catching me in the mood to buy books? Initially, I was considering these nutrient matters in terms of overall health and longevity (rather than your seemingly brain-health interpretation), so I had not been so much concerned about brain health concerns, even though you are correct that a lot of overall health may well be connected to our having healthy brains. So when I looked up your two above recommended books (which maybe I should refer to as book 2 and book 3, through Amazon, they were $58 new ($42 used) and $14 new ($10 used) respectively, and even though I have some Amazon credit that I could have had used, but when I did an internet search, I found that I could get both of them for just over $12 including shipping, then I decided to go for the cheaper deal and hope that they are in decently good condition...and I am going on a trip, so I hope that they arrive in the next couple of weeks before my trip.. nice to have a little book reading materials during some of the down times.. or maybe being less reliant on electronics can be helpful sometimes too, perhaps?In recent times I have not been reading very many books, but in 2011, 2012 and perhaps into 2013, I read quite a few books about nutrition.. low carb type books, such as: \"life without bread,\" \"know your fats,\" \"good calories, bad calories\"\"why we get fat and what to do about it\"and there might have been a few others that I am currently forgetting (hence the need for some brain-health books         ).In recent times, it seems that I had gotten out of the habit of reading books, and I don't even recall reading any bitcoin-related books, yet even though I read quite a bit on the internet about bitcoin.. but I cannot recall if any of those were full books... another thing is getting bits and pieces of books or even perhaps having had listened to some audio books (which maybe I mix up with listening to podcasts.. were any of those books?  I am not sure).By the way, since I made the OP, I have started to take L-Glutamin in powder form (about 5 mg per day), and Niacin 500 mg per day (slow release), and for some reason when I went to the drug store, when I saw the Zinc bottle, I decided to start taking Zinc too.. .. so it has been about 9 days since I made the first post.. but even though I started taking various forms of the supplements, I think it is better if I would start counting from Monday.. since I did not have all of them available to me, and some of the products were not quite right.. but by Monday, May 15, I started to take all of them.. so Mr. Guinea Piggie is being tested.. to see if anything might be felt or noticed (besides having less money in the bank from the purchases).",

Ruminant animals that are fed on healthy plants. Why ruminant animals? Because true ruminants have 4 stomachs that actually convert the plants they eat into all kinds of nutritious chemicals that are not found in the plants. These nutrients are stored in their meat.One of the best plants is alfalfa. Why? Alfalfa roots can penetrate down as far as more than 100 feet in the soil. The roots take along microbes - humic microbes - that convert minerals into ionic minerals for the alfalfa, so that it can be healthy. To make the alfalfa extra healthy, grow it in a high CO2 area, because plants love CO2, and actually clear the atmosphere of it to grow. Generally, more CO2 means healthier plants.The way to do it right is to feed your cattle (ruminants) on healthy plants. Fertilize your plants with composted manure from your animals. Use a juicer to get more juice than bulk from the plants you eat... so you get more of the nutrients and less of the bulk - people are meat eaters, but even meat eaters eat some plants. Feed the residue (the bulk) of your juiced plants to your ruminant animals... along with fresh alfalfa and other grasses.Then supplement lightly on whatever extra nutrients you want, to be more fulfilled. Some nutrients are similar to drugs in the way that they can poison a person if he eats too much of them. So, take a break from supplements now and again. Some nutrient manufacturers suggest this right on their packaging.",

This topic is interesting and when I saw you posting about it, I thought that could be worth having a conversation since I like your neutral approach to analysing things. Since I have been experimenting with lots of stuff under various circumstances, I believe I have a couple of things to share.You called this topic \"Niacin / Glutamine...\", but I guess you wouldn't mind if we talk other substances / hormones as well? D3, K2, calcium, tryptophan, niacin (or all B-vitamins), etc. Impact on the nervous system (myelination), immune system, and interplay of those vitamins with cortisol, serotonin/dopamine, etc. I send this now because I feel bad. I had a couple of things to deal with in the last few (holi)days, but will continue this well awaited back and forth with you asap. My plan was to continue my post here, but give me a couple of days. I have some input for Glutamine, but life and organisms are more complex, yet pretty good to handle, if we dedicate some time to understand what drives our bodies. Sorry for the delay. Hope you feel optimistic for the next year that is running down our life clock! ;P ( psyche is huge, if we talk bad, everyone around us feels bad).Looking forward to coninuing this and carving out some good points we can benefit from! Cheers!",

These nutrient are found in our common food that we eat daily like Rice, fish, meat, Eggs,legumes peanuts etc. Our challenge  is we do not  get the right amount of these nutrients  our body need due to our poor eating habits.Niacin which is Vitamin B3 is a good source of energy, it's also good for the heart function and the skin. Glutamine is needed to support immune system. When the body is deprived of these nutrients, it makes the body susceptible  to stress  and illnesses. Combining the  right amount of these food Rice, wheat, meat, fish, legumes, Peanuts, Eggs etc with quality  supplements which are available in pharmacies will be  beneficial.Note:  Don't rely solely on supplement as it can not replace the benefit gotten from food( balanced diet) it's only to complement a balanced diet. Eating Nutritious food will give you all the required nutrients for your body to function properly.",

      "body": "Hey JayJuanGee / guys, I guess I will have to apologize a couple of times more in the future as I sometimes lack the time to respond in sufficient detail and then I decide to put the answer on ice for a moment altogether. So to get back to the title of the thread, I think the aspect of \"life-quality\" can be investigated through self-experiments whereas longevity really is an answer that only research can give. I mean, once we are about to die, we probably won't have an idea whether a Niacin deficiency contributed to our death. There is a lot of research on the topic, some of which focuses on Niacin, but many of the studies focus on the vitamin B category as a whole. The biggest problem in everyday lives is to clearly identify and isolate a (perceived) health problem, and then treat that problem while keeping the context in which the problem occurred otherwise intact. So for example: a while ago I had been suffering from both nerve pain (wrist and shoulder) and psychological issues, I'd mention especially panic or stress as a baseline feeling over the course of the day. It's actually not easy to distinguish between anxiety, panic and stress. It seems to be easy at first glance, but it's not when these things occur at a rather moderate level, but still severe enough to impact your life. Now, there is certainly an interplay between physical impairment and psychological impairment. One may cause or foster the other and vice versa. Now let's proceed with the analysis:There have been physical, tangible factors in my life that I could change to address the nerve pain. Change the load of my exercise, but also avoid certain activities that I know have had an impact on my nerves. That was pretty easy for me to identify. Certain activities that are (physically) nerve irritating and wrecking. I reduced or banned those activities and symptoms decreased, but didn't disappear. I then did more research on how to support nerves' recovery and health in general. And the answer is: B vitamins. Now I'll be honest about individual B-substances, it is close to impossible without the assistance from a (highly professional) doctor and frequent measurement to exactly identify the one substance that will cure the one problem. Frankly, most of the problems are not caused by a single deficiency. Often times it is a question of balance and interplay. One of the best examples is vitamin D and magnesium. The latter is required to facilitate vitamin D absorption. Magnesium is like that gas in the Ethereum network here (to stay in line with the forum's motto  ). If someone doesn't know that and uses overdosage of D3 (which I often do) without supplementing magnesium, it could cause problems. At the same time, vitamin D is the gas for calcium absorption and too much D3 can lead to hypercalcaemia. Either someone does sufficient research and does some experiments to find out what works and what actually has effects, or the only way to do something about the vitamin, mineral and hormonal balances is to consult very, very good doctors (and those are rare, at last from my experience). Back to vitamin B: I have been trying to isolate single substances from the vitamin B complex, but this goes too far for me personally. You would really need bloodwork nonstop and then the interpretation of the numbers according to some standards is one thing, your mental and physical condition is another. The standards define huuuuge ranges and as soon as you are within these ranges, the doctor will tell you it's all good. But that is not the case! Testosterone and free testosterone is another great example for this. The range for \"you are healthy\" is so wide that everyone with an average IQ and some knowledge about the topic would know that the definition of the range itself is the error. And it is extremely individual! There are people who can perfectly live on the lower end of these ranges for some markers, but there are also people who feel like trash when their values are around the mean of these ranges. I started using a vitamin B complex supplement of high quality and made sure that it contains the elements to support myelin nutrition and strength. The myelin cover is what protects your nerves. As soon as I took that for several weeks, my physical nerve problems were gone. This is now 6 years ago and I have rarely had any interruptions of supplementation. BUT: at times, when I abused alcohol, nerve issues came back in an instant. Any of these substances (alcohol, drugs, nicotine, etc.), are fiercely attacking the myelin protection and go straight to the nerves. I then preventively took higher dosages of vitamin B complex when I knew I fucked up with my lifestyle and it turned out that this can be a cure to an (avoidable) problem. This is of course no recommendation to drink and just counter it with B vitamins  But there is clearly an effect of B vitamin supplementation in the physical realm against negative impacts on the body brought in externally. Therefore, I clearly recommend the supplementation of a high quality (doesn't have to be too expensive) vitamin B complex unless you perfectly understand how to choose the composition of your nutrition. But there is still the mental health question: anxiety, panic, stress. In general, research has shown that the influence of our mind on our bodies, our health is clearly, clearly (!) statistically significant. There are very interesting documentaries about it and research published in the best medical journals available. Just read about the pla-cebo and no-cebo effects and how imagination and believe make a difference in physical recovery and health. Now there is also the biochemical sphere, which can be influenced with supplementation. Cobalamin (B12) is probably the most important vitamin B that supports biochemical integrity and resilience. It is incredibly important for the brain (fatigue, brain fog, etc.) and this is something I have supplemented as an isolated substance on top for a while when I had these brain fog conditions. It depends on what B complex you can get and how the dosages within the complex are distributed. Keep in mind that the public recommendations can sometimes (or very often are) on the lower end of the spectrum. To address anxiety, panic and stress conditions, I did some more research, banned alcohol and then later gave tryptophan a try. And now we'll come full circle regarding the name of the topic (Niacin, Glutamine). Ever since I started supplementing tryptophan, I have experienced that my mind far more often finds peace literally. One of the reasons is that tryptophan is the Ethereum gas for building Niacin (and others). Since alcohol is a Niacin killer and accelerates tryptophan depletion (a double negative), massive deficiencies are the consequence. I thought banning alcohol should therefore fix everything. I didn't drink anything for a few months and realized that I still feel far from perfect. That was the point when I introduced tryptophan. It helped! There are no miracles, but there are significant improvements over the status quo when deficiencies are present. To get back to the initial question, I think you can see that upping the Niacin intake alone may lead to no effect at all. We have to understand our very own complex environment, what we do to our bodies, what our intake consists of and what the potential sources of harm/deficiencies are. The good thing is that most of these supplements won't kill you and you can experiment with it. For me personally, a vitamin B complex with sufficient B12 dosage, tryptophan (before night) and magnesium, D3+K2 and creatine is my daily stack and I can say that it definitely does make a difference! That's 6 pills and a scoop of creatine per day. I do eat pretty healthy food and reduce alcohol to a minimum. My biggest issue is caffeine, which is of course a cortisol booster and bad for the nervous system (and actually not good at all in many other respects as well), but I accept that and can perfectly handle it with the way I set everything up now. I do have some variations according to life situations. If I know that I am going to have a weekend of partying, I increase some of the dosages. I understand enough of cause and effect and the substances to apply them under various circumstances.Hope you are doing great and now I finally prepared a wall of text for you!  Looking forward to hearing from you.",

[edited out]Hope you are doing great and now I finally prepared a wall of text for you!  Looking forward to hearing from you. I am going to try to NOT provide a wall of text in response, and surely deficiencies could be caused from some of our lifestyle choices besides strictly dietary problems, and I have so many supplements in my routine right now that I wonder if there would be any advantage to adding more or weaning some out.. and yeah sometimes one nutrient might not be bio-available without the presence of another - so then there frequently can be questions regarding how much are we already getting from our diet that is good and/or bad... and surely you mentioned alcohol and even coffee in regards to some negative consequences that may well end up causing some depletions and/or deficiencies that would thereafter need to be made up for.. in some kind of way whether that might come from supplements, diet or maybe even some activities, such as improvements to our exercise routine - which surely can contribute to our bodies healing themselves if we can get past some of the pains of exercise.I had recently joined in on the 100 pushups per day until $100k, and you can see my status update as of yesterday in this post.When you mentioned a good diet, we cannot necessarily know what you mean by that, and over the years I have gone through quite a bit of variation in my thinking on the topic, while at the same time maybe even accepting some of my own relapses into processed rather than natural foods. and sure we can have some processed foods in our diet without any problem so it could be a matter of degree, even though it also can be a slippery slope into consuming food-like substances rather than real foods... of course fats and oils are vilified in that regard, so there are some fats and oils that are more natural than others, and there could be BIG differences in our healthy feelings if our body is absorbing nutrients better.Maybe part of my point is that we cannot always figure out the source of our deficiencies in terms of if there might be some things that we could do, or whether we might have some genetic challenges.  Think about something so simple as the proliferation of bottled water and the other ways that we might be imbibing plastics without even thinking about it... and in recent times I have been traveling so much so it becomes way more difficult to make sure that water might be more pure and even have proper filtering.. and from my point of view it is good to be trying to drink a lot of water, even though we can sometimes be tempted into various substitutes that might still be sufficiently good and without extra negative additives.. something like carbonated mineral water in a bottle, but sometimes if you order it in restaurant it comes in plastic.Personally, I am not sure if I would be advantaged by adding some kind of a B-complex, but I will consider it - since it appears that most of them don't really have any overdose levels, and likely our body would just excrete out excess, if there were excess in the body.. and yeah, I am only going by the wikipedia page that i glanced through, so I don't have any extensive looking into it beyond superficialities.In the last few days, I had been thinking about a podcast that I had listened to recently in which there was discussion of memory improvement and longevity being tied to olfactory (smelling) therapy, which surely is interesting.. and also I have really been feeling shitty the last couple of years since when I first got covid and then I got the stupid-ass vaccine. and so who knows why my smelling and my mucous production (post nasal drip?) has been ongoing with periods of improvement, but still I have been thinking that it might be good to consider some ways to improve my smelling abilities, whether it is through self-help methods or otherwise.By the way, I was going to send you 3 smerits rather than 2 smerits for your fairly detailed post, and the reason for the deduction was that you had mentioned a shitcoin as \"the forum's motto,\" which I find problematic on at least a couple of levels... 1st - the comparison of anything valuable and important being attributable to a scam like ethereum is almost beyond belief.. 2nd... I find it important for all members to recognize and/or appreciate a difference between bitcoin and any shitcoins, even if we might not agree in regards to how much time, energy and/or resources to invest and/or allocate into shitcoins (I personally suggest no more than 10% the size of your bitcoin investment, absent some other compelling reason), so from my point of view, in a lot of senses there is an importance to both prioritize looking at the world of \"crypto\" through bitcoin first, and then second, even if any of us might happen to be somewhat of a shitcoiner by potentially going beyond a 10% allocation into shitcoins as compared with bitcoin, to at least not fail/refuse to make a proper distinction when bringing up shitcoins as compared with bitcoin in any discussion.. whether talking about finances and/or using it as an analogy in the realm of nutrion and/or health.  .. therefore deduction of 1 smerit..   hahahahahahaha",

      "body": "I listened to the podcast, Thanks to Dr Dimitry Kats for his tireless scientific approach for for bringing the knowledge and benefits of Niacin and Glutamine. His research on Niacin and Glutamine is truly enlightening for our daily well being, it's essential to address nutrient deficiencies for our overall well being. Niacin and Glutamine play vital role, so to ensure adequate Niacin and Glutamine our food intake should focus on balanced diet with rich nutrient foods. Having deficiency of Niacin/Glutamine can affect one negatively and most times without appropriate knowledge we pass  through these e.g fatigue, digestion problems  and poor immune function affecting our life quality. Niacin which is a  vitamin B3 is essential to convert food into energy and Glutamine act as fuel source for cell converting into energy through a process called glycogenesis. Niacin/Glutamine is like a power source for the body helping creat energy for various functions, the ability of the body to break down fats carbohydrates and proteins and use them to make energy is dependent on having adequate Niacin and Glutamine. Niacin/Glutamine play important role in energy metabolism and healthy cell functioning, during our workout and exercises having well diet will be helpful in other no to feel fatigue and lack energy. With understanding Niacin/Glutamine play a crucial role in maintaining life quality and longevity it's essential to have adequate intake and making sure that you have a good diet it very vital because what we eat or consume of wrong diet can always come back in the old age to affect our immune system.",

Now I re-read the post and saw your remarks about the 1 smerit deduction!   Let me clear up two things here: first of all, I am not an smerit hunter and therefore appreciate any smerit that is sent my way regardless of the number someone deems appropriate. Secondly, I am not a shitcoiner at all and I don't hold more than 10% in shitcoins. I hold > 0% since I have countless of addresses with some shitcoin dust that I will probably never touch again, but these days if I have spare cash for investment I am putting it into BTC and have been doing this for years now. I used the Ethereum analogy because I thought the term \"gas\" more properly resembles the processes in our body than the term \"fee\" (like in BTC) does. While I do not value ETH similarly or higher than BTC ever, I valued the semantic load as a resemblance for in-vivo processes higher than that of BTC's \"fees\".  I actually re-read the post here because I wanted to take the time over the course of the next few days to add some details from my experience. As for the B-complex, you can't go wrong about it. Whether it is necessary is sometimes a question of experimentation and whether you feel improvements or not. Most of the people I know don't get bloodwork frequently enough to be able to sufficiently assess whether they are constantly at healthy levels. That's why my approach has indeed become one of: I'll add something where it is cheap and doesn't do any harm. The B-complex is a perfect example for that. D3+K2 is another example for a relatively cheap supplement and the existing research definitely convinced me of positive D3 supplementation effects. You can't do anything wrong with 5000 IE of D3 daily. Creatine is a must in my opinion for all kinds of performance related processes. Apart from muscle performance and recovery, it has well-researched effects on the brain. It is usually cheap and you can never go wrong with 5g daily. Some other things I take depending on how healthy my food was and how intense my training was. The push-up challenge is a great idea and actually everything that stimulates muscle innervation is highly recommendable! Use it or lose it and nerves themselves are like a muscle. You initiate a plethora of activity in your body by stimulating your nerves and muscles. Hope you keep going and step up your game when BTC crosses the $100K. How about the challenge will be changed into \"BTC price/1,000* pushups indefinitely\"?",

I thought I'd leave an open question here and ask whether you got something to share, some good insights into a healthy life how you perceive it.

There are a couple of things that should be considered to keep the balance when you take zinc, for instance. Or magnesium. But in general, when you don't exaggerate, I think this is a good stack for someone who isn't suffering from very specific health conditions. Would you mind sharing something about the things that you are convinced had an effect? I know it is quite difficult to determine sometimes as it is close to impossible to test certain conditions in a perfect setup as life isn't very linear.
