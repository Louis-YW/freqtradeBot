  "content": "I have always observed that overtime, anything good is subject to adoption; this is applicable to everycase and there are no exceptions...Earlier today I had this information on Twitter and some fringe on the web; this is about the famous bitcoin critics, Peter Schiff who has formerly discriminated bitcoin and made assumptions to his own discretion about  bitcoin being a failure, has officially confessed that he would rather prefer to sell his bank for bitcoin if that could help his customers.https://ibb.co/cXgRKpZhttps://ibb.co/8DwqQWSI was surprised when I learnt that he also advised that anyone who is banking is afraid of bankrupt,inflation or probably collapsing entirely but in bitcoin, only the market value deteriorates. Schiff,a prominent American financial analyst took Euro's Pacific bank as his store of value, not until he was stopped for not complying to the net minimum requirements in Puerto Rico; with these, several customers accounts were freezed. This compromise almost led to the liquidation of the whole funds,for the mere alleged fact of money laundering and tax evasion. That is when crypto enthusiasts, recalled the economists of his statements that cryptocurrencies are scam and traditional finance.Nayib bukele, current president of El-salvador gave some useful advise which became a kinda mockery after the reprisal. I will always keep saying this;  nobody will adopt what he/she doesn't comprehend, that's impossible especially when it comes to stock in value. I believe investors that have changed thier perception today is based on what they have heard, learnt, seen and done practically about bitcoin; I'm happy,a great deal because El-salvador has started off something great, who knows if it will be United States next.https://cryptosaurus.tech/crypto-hater-peter-schiff-will-accept-bitcoin-as-payment-for-his-troubled-bank/Sandra",

      "body": "The same thing could happen to someone on USDT network too and on other centralized projects.Even with decentralized projects(bitcoin, eth, etc), defi and cex are marking dirty addresses(like when they are involved with money laundering or illegal activities) to blacklist them. He knew the rules before he created those accounts(just like how most cex works, binance can freeze your funds if they want to). I don't see how this is a W for bitcoin, when every second service in crypto is trying to mimick that model which they mock on his Twitter.",
