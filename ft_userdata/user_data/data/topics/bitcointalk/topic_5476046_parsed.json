  "content": "There are too many topics about it, but I haven't found the answer I want. I would post on older topics but I got the warning that the topics were older than 120 days, so I started a new one.I have 2 nodes and I am currently setting up my 3rd node.The first 2 nodes were constructed between blocks 700,000 and 750,000 and the process went okay-ish. On the 3rd node, my IBD is very slow. Let me share my setup.Hardware:1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8GB RAM.2. Cat6 ethernet cable.3. 2TB SSD 2.5''.4. SATA (on the disk) to USB 3.0 (on the Rpi)Internet speed:Download: 200 MbpsUpload: 5 MbpsPing: 4 msSoftware:Raspbian OS Bitcoin Core 25.0My conf is:Code:datadir=...server=1daemon=1txindex=1After reaching block 790,000 the process slowed down a lot. I have spent 5 days until block 790,000 and 3 more days until 810,000 and there are still approximately 10,000 blocks left, which will take even more It's normal, I know! Because it scans and validates recursively.Does anyone know if -txindex=1 slows up the Initial Blockchain Download ?If so, is there a reason?",
