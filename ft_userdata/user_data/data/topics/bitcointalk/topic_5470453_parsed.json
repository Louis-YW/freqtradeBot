In any case perhaps the best way to reach out to them is thru their official twitter account: https://twitter.com/letsexchange_io?lang=en.So that when you make some noises in their social media, you might get the attention that you needed and perhaps they will address it ASAP.However, based on this two review sites:https://www.scam-detector.com/validator/letsexchange-io-review-scam-or-safe-check-now-3/https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/letsexchange.ioThey got a poor score. Anyhow, best of luck, and hopefully you can get what rightful is yours.",

Even the comments on the Internet all indicate that this service is a scam. You can read some of them here ----> https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/letsexchange.ioI don't know if contacting BINANCE would lead to any results, as the BNB currency is very centralized and they can freeze the balance even if it is inside the wallet.",

At least they post updates here. I feel like JeromeTash is right. OP did not come back here to update the thread anymore and the possible reason could be, they got their fund. But, it's not a good idea to exchange a large amount in such unnamed exchange. There are a lot of reputed platforms.",

If you want some trusted exchange why go to coinmarketcap to search them after which you can make account to use them. I hardly clicked on random site to make account not even to talk of putting my funds into that site because I know how difficulty it's to gain my assets.",

Upon checking the exchange's transaction id it was already refunded good thing it was resolved already as you mentioned. Here's the response btw https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5321206.msg63098182#msg63098182Mods should lock this thread.",
