'fake nodes' is not a big weakness to the BTC network, i don't think the idea of fake nodes can be a problem if they don't control 51% of the network's hashrate, if they don't control 51% of the hashrate, then whatever malicious transaction would be detected by other nodes and would be dropped because there are far more good nodes than malicious ones.Quote from: pwn8 on April 20, 2023, 08:27:16 PMBut I believe that a permissioned and decentralized network is also possible.

      "body": "A web of trust cryptocurrency was the first idea for Ripple. The project was already around before Bitcoin, approximately from 2004 on.Some ideas can be found in old versions of the Ripple wikipedia article, and on their old website on Sourceforge (as an example, look at a short description in 2007).I remember that because I admit that I first believed Ripple to be something more useful than Bitcoin.  (Well, I changed my opinion drastically.) I believe the current Ripple system has no real web of trust elements anymore. XRP is simply a quite centralized cryptocurrency where servers of the issuers control almost everything, and the algorithm seems to use traditional BFT consensus.Web of trusts imo provide not enough security for a cryptocurrency, at least without another element, due to the sybil attack threat.(PS: what I wanted to write was more or less: XRP failed implementing a web of trust cryptocurrency, and instead went for a traditional centralized BFT-based one.)",

It also CAN use wasted energy, which is a huge benefit.5) You think its a good thing to ban nodes....Sounds like you just want a centralized altcoin that isn't useful.",

They certainly aren't gaining any kind of advantage and they also not capable of harming the network in any way since they will be banned quickly if they act maliciously.QuoteHumans are very good at identifying bots.They are also very good at abusing their power to some day start banning those who they don't like hence ruining the whole decentralized system.P.S. Considering your title and your title only contains the word \"PoW\" I think you are confused about what a node is and what a miner is. You can create a fake node but you can't create a fake miner because to be a miner you have to have real computing power.",

The cost of carrying out a 51% attack is unthinkable and the chances of being successful is not guaranteed, so if you sum it up it makes it impossible. Who wants to spend billions of dollars to purchase millions of Asic miners, and spend thousands of dollars on other things like electricity, coolers, building for the equipments, etc, just to attempt to gain more mining hashrate than all of the network, which may fail. If we even agree that the attacker successfully gains control, but for how long, in a secure network like BTC i don't think it would be too long before other nodes and miners discover and a solution is immediately implemented, which would leave the attacker with egg on their face after spending so much for nothing really.In a small and shady network like BTC Gold for example, a 51% attack can and has already happened in the past, but the security of the BTC network and the cost to attempt a 51% attack on it makes it impossible and not a threat or worry.",

You can spin up all the nodes you want and change anything you want with them. Unless the miners see and then mine the transactions that those nodes provide it does not matter.

If anyone is interested in creating this mechanism please let us know. Proof of Work is the only true Consensus Mechanism for any truely Decentralized & Trustless Cryptocurrency. It currently has no better/proper alternative that I'm aware of.  And it simply means to Prove Miners Works before they are rewarded and their works accepted. Higher price tend to attracts more workers/miners (possibly with more powerful mining hardware to be able to keep up with mining difficulty) thus making the Network more secure against 51% attacks and increasing the energy usage. By the way, Bitcoin is a Freedom System/Cryptocurrency that isn't supposed to limit users like PoS does with stake limit, lock limit, consensus limit etc . It's dangerous to limit the freedom its features gurantee to people that may need them to escape or survive a tyrannical opposite system or invaders. The proper way to solve problems on the Network is to creatively build on the existing foundation/principles, like on the Permissionless feature you mentioned. If you are worried about 51attack or the so called fake nodes, then create a decentralized identity system anyone can easily have, then get anyone who wishes to be monitored less (or have a smooth stay on the network) probably against 51% attack to verify their identity. Miners identity information must be hidden/private and should only controlled by them. Once there is an attack from a miner or group of miners the Network can have their identities unmasked via consensus. You can also use ID scheme to build miners reputation... If you choose only reputation without ID , I think that could easily be cheated.",
