  "content": "HelloI was testing Umbrel as I want to start learning how to run my Lightning network. I installed Umbrel on my Raspberry Pi4 and downloaded the BTC blockchain.I have been running into few issues of stability with Umbrel and I am thinking of moving to another OS (it is part of the testing and learning) So my question is how can I avoid formatting the hard drive and lose all the BTC blockchain I downloaded, if anyone has a procedure on how to back up the chain and copying it to a new OS install, that would be great!  I tried to look for some guides but couldn't find a step by step one Thanks for reading me...",

Create a backup and restore the data.If you want to keep switching OS without reformatting, it's easiest to keep /home on a separate partition (but I guess it's too late for that now).If you don't want to create a backup, and don't want to format, you can YOLO and manually remove all files other than your home directory after you boot the installation disk for your new OS, and then install without formatting.",

It will  help resolve  problems if  LevelDB files get corrupted ( for some reason) on you main SSD drive.",

Just asking this because you said you don't want to format the hard drive.Why not buy an SD card instead to install OS 64 GB SD card would be enough and use the hard drive as your external drive and set up Bitcoin core then point it to the external drive where your Bitcoin folder is located.I think you can find the Bitcoin data from the hard drive in the directory below.Code:/home/umbrel/umbrel/bitcoinOr check this link below you might get some ideas and suggestions on how to backup/copy the blockchain data.-  https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/issues/119#issuecomment-774775026",

It would only work if at least one of the USB3-SATA-adapters had an own power supply for the connected storage drive or using a sufficiently powered USB-hub.",

But for 100 MB files that won't compress much it shouldn't matter much.I had to look it up, it turns out both rsync and scp can use compression nowadays.",
