And if everyone has bitcoins, there will still be some way to distinguish between the rich bitcoin holder and the poor one. If you buy bitcoins once and just have bitcoin because other people do, you will not get rich from it. The rich people still have an advantage in bitcoins because they can always invest more, but someone with low financial capability need to plan to invest many times in bitcoins by buying not just once.",

I am a liberal, which means that all the socialist \"lets distribute the money equally\" things are way too funny to me, I believe that doesn't work and we have seen plenty of examples. However, social liberalism works, it has bene proven time and time again, as long as there is no corruption in the government, that means there is a safety net at the below level, so we are not making everyone equal, but we do not let anyone starve to death, or people like in the USA who dies because they can't afford insulin, all those are gone, the bare bottom is increased, however the top is not hurt while doing it. This allows a government that adjust a nations budget in a way where if you want to be a billionaire you can be, but you are at least guaranteed not to starve to death or be homeless, that is social liberalism and I believe that would solve every single issue we ever had.",

Even the holy books which sees into time, made it clearly so. Yes, money controls the populace, but even with the acceptance and use of BTC by both classes of citizens in a country, the ratio of profit or loss from investments in BTC is definitely going to be different for individual users, because there are several ways to earn from it, several strategies to employ and also deploy as tools for trading.Every individual user would be responsible for their finance and quality of life, but I wonder if the rule of law would have much sway because everyone can bail themselves out of the police nets and courts and prisons. The freedom to live anywhere would suffice and less care for border restrictions and visas, because if you have BTC, you can afford the cost and standard of living.",

The system is working as intended as this means a great deal of resources flow from the masses to them, in their opinion fiat currencies are doing exactly what they were designed to do, the currency they want to fix is bitcoin, as this idea of a decentralized currency that gives back the power to the people is something they do not want to see.",

It can also be used to oppress the poor like any other currency. Those who are Rich are the ones who will buy and hold the larger number, and when the price appreciates, they will also take the larger profit since profit is to be calculated based on the amount of holding. Anything that could be used for Bitcoin can also be used in those cases. The only difference is that in Bitcoin, transaction manipulation can't be done, or at least it's nearly impossible, and no central authority can also take charge of or restrict the transaction that is to be executed.Society has turned out to be that those who are financially balanced seem to be in control of a lot more things than those who are below them, because they will definitely want to offer twice what a normal person will, and the people in power seem to always be in their favor because there is more to achieve than doing the right thing. Those are not just problems with local currency; anything that could be used as money can serve that same purpose. Bitcoin is not an exception.",

Ain't know where did you get this price but it catch my attention and quickly look at the price chart but it wasn't.But I tend to agree with you, that's why Bitcoin has a smaller fraction that can able to have as long as you can cover the fees.That's good of what Bitcoin had.One of Bitcoin's unique features is its accessibility to anyone, regardless of location or socioeconomic status. With Bitcoin, everyone has an equal opportunity to store and utilize the currency, effectively eliminating the divisions between the rich and the poor.  By enabling self-custody of funds, individuals can take charge of their financial lives, free from the constraints imposed by traditional financial systems.  The most important is you must be knowledgeable enough about this system.",

Many keep Bitcoin only as an asset and investment just to increase their wealth, not as a currency that will be used in the future, Therefore Many sell their asset when touch high prices and make bitcoin is still fluctuate product, therefore many people have not been able to accept the fluctuate product.",

Because investing in Bitcoin can be done by anyone as long as someone has capital and understands how to do it, and it doesn't matter if someone is poor or rich. It's just that usually rich people are always more flexible in making investments because rich people always have the capital to do it earlier. Meanwhile, those who are poor always need to struggle to collect their capital first if they want to make investments like many rich people do. So that's all that distinguishes between rich people and poor people in investing. Apart from that, I don't think there is anything different and it could even be the same in terms of profit if the amount of capital is not much different.",
