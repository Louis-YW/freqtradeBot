  "content": "Hey everybody. Please excuse me if this is a silly question and bear with a newbie who is trying to learn the ropes step by step. But I have the following general question:If I were running a full-node but not a miner, could I manually enter a hash value for my candidate block by hand so that it would be propagated with the hope that the block would be accepted? Of course, the hash value I enter would have to match. Let's say may full-node has a candidate block and I was able somehow else (by accident  ) to find the golden nonce which leads to the block hash which would be lower than the actual target. Is that possible to submit this golden nonce into my node via bitcoin-cli or similar? Does this work at all or does it need a miner with mining software ?",

Thanks in advanceI give the spreadsheet away for free, here, calling it the \"F9 Miner\" because it does one hash with each time you press F9 (calculate) in Excel:https://modulo.networkI built it as a learning experiment for myself, but think it is worth sharing.  There are no macros nor any array formulas, so you should not see any of that stuff if/when you download it.  The spreadsheet self-explanatory, but if you have any questions (or find any problems) let me know here!",
