Another is altcoin board which bitcoin mixer will not allow because bitcoin is not an altcoin. Campaign managers have different reasons.

Second question is why do campaign managers exclude certain boards for posting and others where posting is allowed?First I will try to answer your second query, campaign manager does not allow or accept those posts made on board where the signature is not visible because those posts brings no benefit to the platform you are promoting under the management of those managers. Like to understand this, you should know, why we are putting their signatures on our profile, because we are promoting them, and the boards where their ads are not showing on when we post on those boards why they will accept our posts. Coming to the first query, why there are such boards? I think that's because the moderator does not want ads to be shown there. Nothing other comes to my mind.And I did not understand the rule I have bolded in your post. Can you shed some more light on it please.",

Posting on those boards will result in low-quality content that adds little value to the forum, particularly from individuals who only post to complete their weekly posts. Those boards could be for serious discussions, and they cannot be used for spamming or posting unrelated content that contradict the topic of discussion.QuoteSecond question is why do campaign managers exclude certain boards for posting and others where posting is allowed?This is quite similar to how advertisements are posted on social media or other platforms. Clients will want their advertisements to show where their target audience is most likely to be engaged, so that they can simply show their company to numerous users who are interested in such services. The campaign managers know best where their clients will create the most traffic to their businesses, which is why they gave them the job and monitored their ability to do it.",

Best example here are Wall observer thread and Serious Discussion. This thread/section is meant for discussing without any interference post that doesn’t relate to the topic. You will understand why the mods decided to have this kind of board when you are here during the time when signature campaign participants from campaign that has no max post quota still exist.  Literally bunch of garbage one line post in every thread in the forum. Quote from: alastantiger on July 05, 2023, 03:17:00 PM Second question is why do campaign managers exclude certain boards for posting and others where posting is allowed?It depends on the campaign that you are promoting. Also some campaign manager find some board low traffic which means posting in there doesn’t help the visibility of the project. Most campaigns too is removing Altcoin board as eligible board since that board is full of repititive and recycled post that is always just spam.",

I agree with @Nwada001, companies who come to advertise here have a target audience mind and their first priority is to reach that target market. It’s the reason why mixers and exchanges prefer to hire members who frequent technical board and have a reputation in that circle of discussion, most mixer campaigns do not count posts in games & rounds because they know their market isn’t there. Casinos want members who are active in gambling discussions and are into sports, hiring these individuals will boost their service in the gambling board.",

First question, why are there boards where the signatures cannot be displayed or aren't visible on the forum? Second question is why do campaign managers exclude certain boards for posting and others where posting is allowed?Both of these questions are kinda pointless, and you can easily figure out the answers using logic.In certain boards, signatures are intentionally hidden to minimize spam and promote higher-quality discussions, hence the name \"Serious discussion\" board. In such cases, it can be logically deduced that managers will not include those posts in the weekly quota. The answer to your second question varies depending on the manager. Each campaign manager has the freedom to set their own rules for the campaign, either based on their preferences or client requests. That is why you might come across some campaigns that require a specific number of posts in the Gambling section, for example. It all depends on the individual manager's decisions and requirements.",
