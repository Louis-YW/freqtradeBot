  "content": "Hello Members,I want to bring your attention to this SCAM bookmaker CSGO500.They have voided perfectly valid bets and provided no clear evidence from their side or a valid reason as to why. I tried to contact them via live chat and their responses are just shocking. They literally voided my bets without ANY valid reason. I presented them the evidence that they should be paid and yet they ignored it. All other bookmakers paid out on the same bets.The match in question is : https://www.aiscore.com/basketball/match-louvre-surabaya-bangkok-tiger/oj7x6sz6pxnt47gI bet  TWO different BETS . OVER 173 and -20.5 handicap Handicap (incl. overtime) Louvre Surabaya (-20.5)They for no clear reason VOIDED approximately $500 worth of bets.Their response is : \"Hey,The odds on Total markets were wrong, and you have clearly abused them by placing multiple bets on that game, all pregame bets were refunded/cancelled, and live bets were correctly settled.\"But i made HANDICAP bets as well as TOTALS. They seem to have chosen to ignore that fact? https://www.aiscore.com/basketball/match-louvre-surabaya-bangkok-tiger/oj7x6sz6pxnt47g AI SCORE shows the pre match handicaps which were very close to the ones on this SCAM bookmaker. The same handicaps were offered on ALL other bookmakers and they are making up any excuse to not PAY their customers.I urge you all to avoid using these scammers. I have attached proof of screenshots of my bets that were voided.https://ibb.co/sVRSSfn  ---- PROOF!SORRY ADMINS IF THIS IS THE WRONG SECTION - PLEASE KINDLY MOVE IT TO SCAM ACCUSATIONS. THANKS",

AI scores exactly the same lines i took pre match , but i also took HANDICAPS.Are you saying that two separate bets (TOTALS & HANDICAPS) were BOTH incorrect? When the rest of the world had the same lines and paid out without problems, magically your \"provider\" which you do not disclose told you to void all the bets?Clear indication of a fraudulent attempt to not pay out winnings to a legitimate betting customer.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",

I hope this is an eye opener for all other people just how shady this bookmaker is. In fact, I took 3 different bets and they claim all three were incorrect \"odds\". HERE IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE!I took the same bet on STAKE.COM - See the screenshot below - THEY FULLY PAID the won BET for the EXACTLY the same lines. Is CSGO500 a scam or not? You can make up your own mind. I hope they will do the right thing here and honour the won bets.https://i.ibb.co/H2wRb85/SCAMMEPROOF3.png   <--- PAID out bets by STAKE.COM.",
