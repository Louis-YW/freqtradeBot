This two are flexible enough to do other computer works but the creation and migration of miners to ASIC removed that option since as stated ASIC is created for specific function only and that is to mine Bitcoin at a specific algorithm.  If it is not sha256 algorithm, then it can't help.Though it is still possible if there are still miners that still mine Bitcoin with CPU and GPU.I believe your question is related to this article @OP  https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/27/how-blockchain-can-create-the-worlds-biggest-supercomputer/",

With a random computers around the world it would be very difficult. Technically there are already networks for running some programs such as Folding@Home and Prime95. These are running on people's desktops and laptops and communicating with a central server, so it's not truly decentralized (but for scientific tasks, I don't see why that would be necessary).",

Because it has a cost, and people who spend money on it would expect a reward. But what you can do is create a decentralized mining pool to let any supercomputer join it.",

Just some people don't know it, calculate some primes to heat their system and shut it off again.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime95It is the official client of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a volunteer computing project dedicated to searching for Mersenne primes.Quote from: seoincorporation on December 26, 2022, 05:26:52 PMQuote from: satonaka736 on December 25, 2022, 07:29:28 AMIs it possible to build a decentralized supercomputer from networked bitcoin miners?If it's decentralized then who will get the mining reward?Miners are already globally decentralized and whichever miner submits the next valid block receives the mining reward.Do you really think Bitcoin mining has to be centralized to be able to determine 'who will get the mining reward'?Quote from: seoincorporation on December 26, 2022, 05:26:52 PMAnd why do you want to make it decentralized? i feel it's better to get a group of people to make that supercomputer and share the reward among all the people who spend money on that supercomputer.Mining and supercomputer are 2 completely different concepts.

      "body": "I want to point out that there is a difference between distributed and decentralized.TL;DR: Decentralized is related to control. Distributed is related to performance. They are independent properties.Decentralized means that it is not controlled by any single entity. Ethereum is an example of a decentralized computer. Whether it is a supercomputer or not can be debated. Anyone can have Ethereum do any computation and the computation cannot be stopped or manipulated by anyone. That is what decentralized does. Decentralized refers to control, and to some degree robustness.Distributed means that a process is split among many nodes that are all working in parallel to achieve a combined result. Bitcoin is not distributed. In Bitcoin, the same processes are performed by everyone. Distributed processing is to increase performance, and to some degree robustness.So, when you ask about a decentralized supercomputer, I think you are really asking about a distributed supercomputer, which is not relevant to Bitcoin because Bitcoin is decentralized, but not distributed.",

I don't see why that would be a problem; that it doesn't need fast internet. If anything, it's a benefit, no?My point is not all scientific computing use little data, so there are limited things you could do with home's computer and internet connection.Absolutely! Even Folding@Home sometime takes a while to download all the data for a computing task. That could definitely be a big limitation for a 'decentralized supercomputer' project such as proposed in this thread.Sorry for the misunderstanding.
