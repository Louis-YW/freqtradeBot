  "content": "$GOR是一个 Layer-1 金If you miss Kas, can you seize the small opportunities surrounding Kas?Whether it is a risk or an opportunity, you need to judge for yourself. Due to technical problems, it was postponed twice and a lot of trust was lost. Now it is ready to go, let everyone wait and see.He is now the only project that can produce one piece per second like kas.If you are interested, you can find out for yourself. I am just a miner watching the project release and sharing it with everyone.GOR is a decentralized cryptocurrency, that is making waves in the world of BlockChain.This innovative project (hard-fork of Kaspa) *** with full asic resistance system ***is based on the Proof of Work consensus algorithm and uses the hashing function to ensure the security and efficiency of its network.The team behind Gorbaniov Network is made up of experienced blockchain developers who are dedicated to creating a financial system that is accessible to everyone.By using decentralized technology, Gorbaniov aims to provide a safe and secure platform for users to transact and store their assets.The Proof of Work consensus algorithm is a tried-and-true method for securing blockchain networks. By requiring users to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions, the network is protected from malicious actors who would seek to undermine its integrityThe hashing function is a cutting-edge technology that provides fast and efficient processing of data.This means that Gorbaniov Network is able to handle a large number of transactions quickly and with minimal energy consumption.With its advanced technology and commitment to security and decentralization,Gorbaniov has the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way we do business.Overall, Gorbaniov Network is an exciting new project that has the potential to revolutionize the world of cryptocurrency.With its focus on security, efficiency, and accessibility, it is sure to attract a wide range of users who are looking for a better way to transact and store their assets.Official website:https://gorbaniov.com/v.php?ix=gorbaniov",

      "body": "I am the miner of this project. In fact, the practical significance of this project is much better than many current paste-and-copy methods. Precisely because it is a reference to kas, there was a lot of immaturity in technology at the beginning. Six months later, the technical staff We are constantly working hard and things are much better now. As long as it is not a pasted and copied project, we should all praise the developers.",

This innovative project (hard-fork of Kaspa) *** with full asic resistance system *** There is no asic resistance, it's a lie, it's just a poorly functioning fork that got 51% attacked and rearranged 20 times, people lost most of the mined coins, devs are incompetent to a point, they couldn't even properly fork the wallet, the wallet would constantly lose any coins in them.

Don't get baited to even waste your eli on this. Not sure about the asic resistant part, but I am able to solo mine this coin using my local node to my wallet with around 50 gh/s hashrate from my GPU rig and bzminer.Devs are working hard on this, it is not easy to implement fork. There is no such scam that they have done. There were some reset that happened early, but now things work fine. The cli wallet is working fine with full functional mining. May be someone can implement pool as the devs are tied up with so many things at a time - webwallet, pool , exchange listing etc.",
