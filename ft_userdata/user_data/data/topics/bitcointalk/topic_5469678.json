They have however come to know the worth of it and the fact that it is gaining value against the dollar makes it one to either control or regulate. In the end the regulators will win but I don't think it would hold much weight as to when it becomes more used and an investment friendly option for users. The issues of ftx crash, luno saga , Binance and kraken lawsuit still tastes sour on the government lips and as such it must endeavor to do all it can to prevent a further recurrence of such an event.",

It is quite simple, they can't control Bitcoin so they will look for an alternative to lessen the influence of Bitcoin and the government see that creating CBDC may get majority of Bitcoin users and have a change of heart.  It is also possible that the government sees that blockchain tech is good and wanted to try it out through CBDC even though CBDC can be not a blockchain tech.Quote from: Amphenomenon on October 08, 2023, 08:31:26 PMWhy do the US government give up their pursuit to control bitcoin after over a decade because bitcoin is Decentralise and no one can have total control over it so won't they just give up on their pursuit? The US government wanted to exercise its power so it wouldn't easily give up on their pursuit to control bitcoin.  Since they found controlling the Bitcoin network impossible, they instead wanted to control bitcoin that flows in centralized services by setting up regulations and limitations to these centralized services.",

If they did, you'd see a lot more efforts to control developers, control exchanges, control the flow of money between banks and Bitcoin ecosystem and so on. None of this is happening on a large scale, amercians have no problem with buying/selling or using Bitcoin.2. Nearly every government in the world talks about CBDC, because its a trendy thing and makes them look all high tech and progressive. But it's just talk, there's no signs that they are actually planning to implement it on a wide scale.",

The government can't control Bitcoin as they were unable to identify who owns it. If this is the case, whatever plan they have to make Bitcoin keep on their control, it will never be possible. What they came up is to create their own digital money as we are in the digital era. They go for CBDC to improve the mode of payment and make it efficient for everyone while making payment. As I have said above, no one can identify who owns/created it. They are unable to take control of something that owns by an anonymous person/group. Aside from that, they have a different goal, their aim is to keep up on the digital era and make their own digital money that is equivalent to their fiat money.",
