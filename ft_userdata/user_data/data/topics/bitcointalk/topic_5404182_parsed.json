I will exercise not because I'm being paid but because I want myself to be healthy and not be prone to health problems.Sweatcoins have been there for a long time but they became an abandoned project. I tried downloading their shitty app years ago and I didn't expect that they will re-develop their old project again. It's because Move-2-Earn concept is becoming a hype that's why they decided to create it again?Like @Maus0728 said, as long as we users will not give our personal information to them then I might try to use it but I'm not expecting too much from them. If they will really pay then good but if not then ok. What make me curious is what will be the use of their tokens? I mean in some P2E games, the tokens that we are farming are being used to burn. In Move-2-Earn concept, I don't know what will be the use case of the tokens that we will be getting.",

It doesn't solve anything and you probably can hack your phone to think you walked a thousand miles and collect the coins/tokens. Not that it would be even worth the time. There's a reason why MangoCoinz wasn't a success story, and i am unsure why these people want to take that same road.",

You won’t earn much on this, since the cost of the token in my experience will not be very high. Why install another unnecessary sports app? Personally, I am quite satisfied with Strava for sports and relaxation from cryptocurrencies.",

I think move to earn is going to be the new hype if marketed well, and it will not just end up being only a hype but a real utility project because you really have to move around for you to be able to earn. This is new so it's not easy to determined what will be the success level.",

Almost most of the new tokens that come out in cryptocurreny are for them to get investors they will say all sweet words and promises they're doing it for the sake of funds only, and once they  raise big funds, I just hope they won't run in the end. So with every new token it is very hard to trust immediately and issue capital for this, so as an investor we still need to be extra careful so that we do not regret it later.All projects in which are new to this cryptocurrency has future, we just don't know if it is good or bad, or it would depend still in the whitepaper they have in accordance to their roadmap and how aggressive they got to achieve it in the near future.",

That is a very welcome income for something you have to do everyday anyway.However, I'm not ready to adopt this for two reasons: first, because I would have to turn internet on all day long at my smartphone when walking on the streets, what means extra costs for hiring internet data and I doubt the income from Sweatcoins can cover the expenses. Second, because I don't feel confortable being watched and monitored by a third party service everywhere I go.

It is worth moving around, walking and doing exercise even without any reward because of the health benefits.  Having an extra reward is a bonus.  But I wonder about how Sweatcoin will get value, and what are the benefits of holding these coins.Quote from: avikz on June 27, 2022, 06:41:11 PMThese kind of coins are not really cryptocurrency.

There's no such thing as free money in the real world, let alone free crypto, so the fact that the former is the main selling point of this app already raises a big red flag.

You'll be able to trade Sweatcoins for crypto, just like you would with any other altcoin being traded across crypto exchanges worldwide. I know you won't be earning that much walking for coins. But at least, it's better something than nothing. MangoCoinz and other similar projects turned out to be a huge failure, so I wouldn't count on Sweatcoins as a long-term investment anytime soon.
