I think we dey get somethings wrong about pidgin english and abbreviations. As dem no teach us pidgin for school e dey hard for us to get di right spellings of some certain words. So there are no true spellings, while writing in pidgin we use English words and sometimes we try to make our words different by using words like: odas(others), dis(this), Pipu~piple(people), sae(say), neva(never), dem(them), di~de(the), den(then), kontri(country), tori(Story) etc. I wouldn't call the aforementioned words abbreviations if am writing in pidgin, they can be called abbreviations or wrong words when I'm using them in formal writings. Abbreviations in pidgin and English language that I'm aware of are words like 4(for), 2(to), yr(year), ur(your), d(the), con3(country) abbr(Abbreviation) etc.",
