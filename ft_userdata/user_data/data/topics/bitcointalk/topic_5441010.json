Please my fellow fans friends and family I need your advice how to invest on bitcoin and cryptoCertainly, you can profit from bitcoin investing, but do you believe it is as simple as you claim? It is advisable that you go and read about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general before investing in it so that you don't end up losing your money and regretting why you invested in bitcoin, anyone who tells you that bitcoin investment is easy is lying to you.People are definitely working and getting paid in bitcoin. Let me use the forum as an example, you can participate in a signature campaign and get paid in bitcoin, and I'm sure there are other jobs that pay in bitcoin.",

Please my fellow fans friends and family I need your advice on how to invest in bitcoin and cryptoThe best possible advice I can give you right now is for you to stick around the forum for a while and try to read as much as you can and try not to see cryptocurrency as a get-rich scheme because that kind of mentality have led many into investing in scams, but if you take the time to build a quality knowledge it will help to guide your future decision-making process.Always make sure to know that making money or profits is the primary motivation that can lead you to frustration because there are a lot of ups and down in the cryptocurrency market and without motivation this happening that deray your motivation if you have a wrong mindset.",

I really want to be part of it I would like to invest in crypto and Bitcoin. Please my fellow fans friends and family I need your advice how to invest on bitcoin and cryptoYes is possible to work and be paid in Bitcoin but you can mostly do that working remotely especially in cryptocurrency related jobs. You can choose to pick a career in social media, community management or other careers in web development (web3, Defi etc) and get paid in Bitcoin or other cryptocurency that can be converted to Bitcoin. Most physical job hasn't started paying in Bitcoin so it'll be difficult to get a job although you could pay yourself in Bitcoin in the sense that immediately you received your salary in dollars or whatever fiats associated with your geographical location, you can immediately buy Bitcoin and store in your personal wallet.Bitcoin isn't centralized so it can be used Peer2Peer all over the world provided you have internet access over there. Getting yourself involved in the industry isn't hard to achieve but what matters most is if you can have the patience to wait and be in control of your emotions to avoid greed or Fud make a fool out of you. Stay active on the forum and you can get ideas on how to go about investing in Bitcoin. For now just keep saving up capital to make your first purchase.",

It's really possible someone to work and get paid with Bitcoin because it can be used as a currency. Bitcoin is a borderless currency which mean you can send it to all over the world, there's no difference with anything e.g. fees, speed, etc unlike bank accounts where they will charge more fees when you send to different bank, especially to other country's bank and the speed would be slower when you send it to other country's bank.If you want to invest, just invest in Bitcoin and only use money you can afford to lose.",

Many people profit from their investments in it, especially those who were fortunate enough to participate in its infancy. They testify and discuss how they generate money, but they never disclose the risks or losses involved. Bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency investment, but it also carries risk, so if you think you can invest and see a quick return, you're mistaken. Before investing your money, you should first educate yourself on the endeavor you wish to undertake, conduct your own study, and keep the possibility of financial gain in mind.",

But before you start it is important to make a business plan that will guide the business to achieve the general and specific objectives. Starting early could also mean that when we identify any cryptocurrency business opportunity we must maximize it immediately. Which means we must avoid procrastination and delay. The path to achieving the investment goal might not be easy but with determination and persistence, these goals can be achieved. Starting and running a business can be very challenging which is why it is good to have a job that can sustain you as you wait for your business to grow and become profitable so that you can depend on it to pay your bills. That is why it is important to develop yourself in some areas that can help you secure paid jobs",
