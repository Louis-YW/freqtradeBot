      "body": "For assets like bitcoin and high marketcap coins with high trading volume and liquidity on the exchange you are using, you can use market order. Market order means you will be able to buy or sell the coin at available market price so it filled immediately.I prefer to use limit order, it works like this:If bitcoin is at $20000 and you want to sell it for another coin, no one will want to buy at a price above $20000, so the trade will only be filled when the price of bitcoin is at $20000 or below because people buy from you at low price. If you want to buy, the trade will be filled at high price, so if bitcoin is at $20000, the order will only be filled at $20000 or a price above if you want to buy.",

Most of the exchange didn't have built in order feature for the conditional order that you want to do Base on what you are describing. A trading bot might help you with this matter because it requires a specific setup for that condition to be both meet.",

On the other, you use sell stop order if you want to sell below current price. This is simple to understand better and you can work that out yourself.",

      "body": "The perfect answer is given by edgycorner. You can't place normal order above the current price. If you place then it will fill automatically in the current price. You may place buy orders below the current price simply. But you can't place a sale order below the current price, if so then assets will be sold at the current price. But you can use the stop limit below the current price. These are the rules of a centralized exchange, otherwise, there would be huge pumps and dumps.",

For instance its very simple to trade on Binance exchange, I don't know what exchange you want to place the order. So checkout for some videos on youtube for best knowledge.",

And if it goes bearish, then you want a buy order on 50 Dollars. You would like one single order, because you want it on the same money aka your balance. And you don't want to divide it between two different orders.Give a confirmation if this is what you want.",

I don't know if you try to watch in youtube like a tutorial of how to trade buy and sell using stop limit order in terms of buying and selling where you're the one who wi set it of how much something like that. As far as I know there are a lot of the members here in the forum doing this methods dude.

      "body": "Well, it all depends on the kind of asset on question here. Let’s take for instance that you want to buy an asset with a very high marketcap and possibly, high liquidity; Let’s take BTC as the asset for example, then you’d need to make use of the market order; now the question is, how does market order help or what does it do? Market orders generally executes near the current sell orders or ask price. I actually choose to go with the market order because they are popular considering that they are a fast and reliable method of either entering or exiting a trade.Quote from: Ararbermas on June 24, 2022, 11:25:19 AMLimit order is can be use to set buy and sell in specific prices, but you need to wait until the candle stick reached your target price.

Well, to some persons, the limit order could be a good other to use in this case but at the same time, personally I realized that the risk inherent to limit orders is that it fails to execute your orders if the market price doesn’t fall within the order's guidelines. Another issue that may take place is that after reaching a target price, it may happen that there wouldn’t be enough liquidity to fill the order that was set, when its turn comes. I experienced this a few times when using the limit order, it wasn’t actually a very good experience for me, so I don’t know how it favours you!",
