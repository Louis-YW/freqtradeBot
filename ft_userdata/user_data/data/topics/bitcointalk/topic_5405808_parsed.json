There is something little confusing I found in you About page, stating only countries you shipped written below, with some that don't even exist (I think), for example country Reunion, Republic. Lativa and Austrilia... so you might want to correct this  QuoteUnited States, Japan, Austrailia, Germany, Mexico, Canada, China, Switzerland, UK, France, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Ireland, Czech, Republic, Reunion, The Netherlands, Thailand, Lativa, Poland, Israel, Spain.https://www.cryptocloaks.com/aboutus/",

I personally work with Crypto Cloaks and print/ship as part of their team and I have shipped out close to 1500 prints that I myself have printed for them.There is no need to worry about whether their orders will make it out or not.",

Thank you for your concern.Nice work.Sorry I had to point that out in public, but I developed that habit after checking out and inspecting many suspicious websites, and many of them had spelling mistakes that was red alert or me.I know you are not a scam, but you might want to check rest of the pages and fix other potential errors.  It looks much more professional especially if English is your native language.PSI see you are not printing guns, but you obviously print bitcoin bombs and hand grenades",
