If you are not planning to use the marketplace and EUR wallet/exchange and you just want to use their wallet and mining you can make a new account with email only according to this \"KYC tiers\".I am also one of their previous users I never heard or even inform via email that they added KYC.About the alternative, if you just want to sell your miner's hashrate then miningrigrentals is a good alternative without KYC.",

It’s not an exchange.Apparently to curb \"abuse\" of their platform, which I find to be a completely bullshit reason, and from what I know there are just going to keep adding new KYC rules with time until the platform is completely unusual minus first getting KYC verified.This is how profit driven services always fuck up.",

      "body": "It said that if you had a old account before the upgrade you didn’t need to KYC but they still said I need to KYC when I try and go to their marketplace section and it says my tier allows nothing pretty much. Went and tried miningrigrentals and they state in their FAQ that since they basically only connect miners to buyers of hash that they are not required by law to KYC. So no idea why Nicehash which is foreign decides to KYC when miningrigrentals is USA based doesn’t. Great way to kill their business plan.",

I've never seen it anywhere else.I agree with you.Nicehash works like a regular mining pool and their software allows miners to mine the most profitable coin at the moment. This does not require KYC.With the rental markets for mining equipment, you need to ask a question to technical support. I asked Russian technical support to answer.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5132119.msg62704098#msg62704098",

No KYC is necessary. However, if you are using their services like buying/selling hashrate or buying/selling cryptocurrency, then KYC may be necessary.",
