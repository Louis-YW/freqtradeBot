      "body": "Diversifying your portfolio is a good thing to doYou have Binck, a subsidiary of Saxo Bank, perhaps the cheapest in the EU but I'm not sure. You have also Degiro, Trad Republic, and Trading212 good for usBy the way, non-U.S. citizens living outside of the U.S. can open an account with a broker there as long it accepts applications from your country of residence and uses SEPA (since in the EU, we use SEPA) Just to show you, you're not limited to EU brokers.One I don't recommend is eToro, I could write long stuff about it...It's up to you to check the fees, the minimum investment (if there is), the UI/UX, and other stuff Quote from: BitMaxz on May 19, 2022, 11:08:15 PM@OP isn't looking for a way to buy crypto in Europe, he's looking to invest in the stock",

After all, stocks aren't something you can easily profit from if you don't know what you're doing. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with trying other ways to invest, because you may find that you are a real talent for stock trading.While you're waiting for the new bull market, you'll have plenty of time to try things out - just remember not to invest more than you're willing to lose",

Probably not the very best platform when talking about actively trading (because of the spreads), but if you're only going to hold positions for months and months, you're most likely going to be fine.",

On my own suggestion, i will encourage you to still run your investment through cryptocurrency or bitcoin, but from different specific directions and hold for long time and probably those coins that have potentials and when bull market occur you make your Profit.",
