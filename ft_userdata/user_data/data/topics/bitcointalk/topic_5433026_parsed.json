It is compatible with multiple chains, meaning if you have assets of Ethereum and BSC, you will see both chain's assets you own on one single dashboard. Giving you real time profits & loss statistics of each individual asset and the overall portfolio's performance.Boss Track is currently compatible with the following chains with more to be added soon:Ethereum ERC20Binance Smart ChainPolygonAvalancheCronosStart Tracking Your Wallet In SecondsBoss Track doesn't require any download, signup or even site permissions from your web3 wallet.

For example, I have an metamask-based ERC wallet and then when trustwallet became a trend, I also have a wallet on TW, with some of my assets on MM still sitting there these days. Can I put both addresses on your plarform and simultaneously knows my entire assets on both wallet?",

Once you add a wallet address it gets saved in your browser cookies so you don't have to go through the hassle of signing into your different web3 wallets just to see your portfolio's value.",

Allow me to clarify using your attached picture. Is there a page that shows all of those assets on \"Personal 1\", \"Shib #2\" and \"double up\" into one?So, suppose I have 3 eth and 20 BNB on \"Personal 1\", 50 eth, 3 BNB and 1,000 usdt on \"Shivb #2\", and 3 xrp on \"double up\", the \"overview\" --or whatever they're named-- page will shows:- 53 eth- 23 BNB- 3 xrp- 1,000 USDTinsread of having to select each wallet and look at the amount on the said wallet individually?",

The only information input to BossTrack is a wallet address, we don't collect information such as e-mail, phone, name or any usual profile information that could help a bad actor to social engineer a CEX account or government to track you. We know as much about wallet holders as the blockchain does.2. We don't connect or require permission from a web3 wallet, there is no contract being signed by users - it simply displays info on the blockchain in an easier to digest format.3. I designed the project to have as few vulnerabilities for users as possible, even in a worst case scenario and the project is compromised by a hacker - they simply have a page that takes API data from BSCscan, Etherscan, etc with zero control of your web3 wallet or any of your personal info.Quote from: holydarkness on January 12, 2023, 04:28:38 PMAhh, maybe I was a little bit unclear.
