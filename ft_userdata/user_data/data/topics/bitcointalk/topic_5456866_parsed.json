  "content": "This news is a week old, but I still wanted to share it with all of you because I believe it will shock you when you read the full articles and see the prominent names in the tech industry who fell victim to these scammers. I have summarized the entire article here so that everyone can understand what happened. You can find the link to the article here.According to the article, hackers managed to steal $3 million in digital assets from 1,932 victims by posing as journalists from well-known media outlets like Cointelegraph and Decrypt during fake interviews. The hacking gang, known as the 'Pink Drainer,' gained access to accounts through social engineering, tricking victims into trusting them and leading them to websites used to obtain Discord login keys. The gang was able to compromise accounts on various blockchains, including Mainnet, Arbitrum, BNB, Polygon, and others. This incident should serve as a wake-up call for both individuals and businesses to be more vigilant in securing their digital assets.These hackers are incredibly cunning, and just thinking about how the victims must have felt after realizing they had been hacked sends shivers down my spine. My advice to everyone is simple: stay alert and stay informed about such topics if you want to avoid becoming a victim.",

My advice to everyone is simple: stay alert and stay informed about such topics if you want to avoid becoming a victim.There are so many different attempts to scam on the Internet: emails, private messages in instant messengers, advertisements on hacked sites. When everything seems to be true, it can be quite difficult not to fall for such a trick. But when it comes to money, you need to check and double-check everything. And especially do not rush to do anything if something remains incomprehensible: do not log in through your applications on unknown sites, do not confirm incomprehensible actions with your wallet, such as receiving an unexpected airdrop, do not follow links from unsolicited emails. It is always important to remain extremely careful.",

It is so alarming how people easily believe it when random people contact them over the internet, they do not even verify if the person is who they claim to be and the next thing they are clicking on links and following instructions dished out by the scammer.Do not trust; but verify and do not click on links sent to you by random strangers who send you unsolicited messages or try to build trust with you over the internet. Until it is proven otherwise; it is a scam!",

      "body": "Maybe people should really learn how important it is to keep assets in wallet installed in completely airgapped devices such that even when such security breaches happen. The hacker won't be able to access the assets. I still can't understand why someone would have assets worth over $3M but can't even go through very strict security measures in order to ensure the safety of the asset from online hackers.This also highlights the danger of storing private keys or seeds online.",

Most of us lack patience and when money is involved greed takes over. Every time I read about a new scam or hack I always think how much intelligent and cunning these guys are. It is not that easy to convince someone to throw their money into their wallets. With the AI they have become more powerful then they were earlier.",

It is not that easy to convince someone to throw their money into their wallets. With the AI they have become more powerful then they were earlier. Almost all of the advice on how not to fall for scammers just says that scammers are trying to make the victim feel that the time for making a decision is very limited, that they need to act quickly, right now. So whenever someone pushes you and says you need to do something right now, it's best to develop the habit of saying no. There are very few cases where something really needs to be done urgently, but you can try to avoid numerous risks of fraud if you give yourself time to think and understand that the offer is too tempting to be true, and also if you conduct additional research on the issue, including, for example, to consult on the forum.",

These hackers will always reengineer whatever they can as they're focused in stealing others fund's. While these cons will keep on learning the new tech and possible technique that they can use for their victims. We as users and keepers of our wallets should also continuously learn on how to get protected in every inch that we can.",

It's really fascinating how naive people can be, because how else to call people who agree to KYC for an interview? This just proves that there are a lot of people who have no idea what they are doing, and they have always been and will be easy targets for any average hacker.QuoteAfter gaining the trust of their victims, threat actors inform them that they must perform a KYC (know your customer) validation to prove their identity, directing them to websites used to steal Discord authentication tokens.",
