  "content": "Hi, so I have two different machines mining XMR to the same wallet address. I was comparing the payouts and happen to find that I have 3+ payouts of the same type. Please see the pictures attached. Can some1 explain why this happened or whats happening? I wouldn't think i'd have same transactions on different miners. https://ibb.co/PjD0hcc",
