If you want to lose activity and the posts you have made are of no use to yourself/anyone else then sure, there shouldn't be anyone stopping you from deleting your posts. If you are actually contributing to the forum or participating in discussion in a meaningful way, I don't see why you would want to/how you could delete your posts (other than things like giveaway/game and round entries).

Activity points are earned in every two weeks period ( i.e. every 14 days, starting from Tuesday). You'll have to delete your entire posting history in two weeks period to loose just 14 activity points. If you made 100 posts in 2weeks, deleting them all will not loose you 100 activity points but only 14.",

What I think necessitated OP's question is that they want to know how to be on the safe side by not tampering with their rank if they went on deleting some of their posts in order to possibly keep a clean post history.",

Bear in mind that Recoverable Activity would not be available as an accelerator to recovering Rank if you delete all your posts.In broader terms, some people have managed to de-rank their account from Legendary to Sr. Member and even back to Newbie, as well as others have taken their Hero member account back down to Sr. Member through to Newbie.The following link details 115 significant cases of accounts that have been de-ranked by deleting some of their posts (and/or them being deleted by the mods/self-mods):https://public.tableau.com/views/BitcointalkMeritDashboard/De-ranked?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_linkThe toll I account for is really of 630 cases, though the Newbies to Brand New are not really relevant and are likely a result of simply being nuked.
