It did hurt a lot for citizens in my nation when this became the order of things. It was just a means to prevent electoral malpractices which eventually did happen and banks took great advantage of it.This made popular the innovation of fintech banks but, the actual banks weren’t having it. The fintech made their services an easy to access and quick transfers while normal banking networks were slow and difficult to access. Even with you having the capability to do certain transactions, you just didn’t have the access and guess who was in business, the banks.We need Bitcoins continued existence and in time, we would have it being the order of the times.",

Anyways transactions that can be made with bitcoin straight up will be easier than things that requires little units of bitcoin. I'm not very sure how their government regulations are over there but things could be way more difficult if they don't have crypto legalised there.Bitcoin too is a method of digital banking and if the cyber issue is a big one, bitcoiners may not be able to do a thing.

Bitcoin is not a legal payment method in my country so it does not necessarily become an alternative unless a legal agreement is made at that time but the lack of adoption also makes transactions using bitcoin ineffective. In addition, it takes time to reorganize the transaction system because not everyone understands how bitcoin works. For those of us who already know it might be easy but for the general public, it will definitely take months/years and where can they get bitcoin if all savings accounts cannot make deposits.",

So it's easier to tackle such hacking incidents of the money is not withdrawn via other means. At the same time, tackling a bitcoin hacking is not at all easy.
