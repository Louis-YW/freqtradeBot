Are they just hoping that people won't notice and play the old one or something?As much as that they are practically identical (visually) there must be some change in the game mechanics, in the bonuses or some extra element that was added or removed.The increase in RTP is necessary to attract users to try it, because what would be the incentive for players to test something new in a game that still has its mechanics unknown and that brings more insecurity to the player?And yes... I believe most players don't even notice these differences and keep playing the old one, especially if they've already added it to their favorite games.",

Having essentially the same game and then just renaming it and giving it a different RTP and others?Maybe this would cause players to think that it's the same game as well when they see it or maybe they will go with \"Isn't this the game? I thought it was Sugar Rush not Sugar Twist\"",

      "body": "Each slot game will have a different RTP and in every casino, of course, it will also have a different RTP even though it is the same game.RTP aims to provide greater returns for gamblers who play in slot games so that they will be able to minimize losses when playing them.RTP is also aimed at making gamblers more loyal so they can play one type of slot game longer.But sometimes RTP is also not guaranteed because this might only be for returning capital but not for winning it.Usually gamblers who like to play slots will first see what percentage of the game has an RTP and the average gambler chooses the game with the highest RTP.",

      "body": "Some gamblers like to play the latest slot games launched by casinos, and some continue to play them frequently and rarely check the list of new slot games added by casinos. Each slot game in the casino has its own fan, and the providers know this, so they launch slot games that may be almost the same as those already on the list of slot games in casinos. Some gamblers pay attention and check how high the RTP is, and some gamblers don't even care about the RTP, like me, who chose the slot games I like. Although I sometimes play the newest slot games that are in the casino. Gamblers only care about how they win at slot games and will probably keep playing the same game every time they gamble.",

As we know the slots provider can modify the RTP on each slot, with a higher RTP you will see the bonus hitting more frequently, and I think is a strategy to make the customers try the new machine. But I would bet the RTP will go down in some months when the new version of that game comes out or when they have a lot of players wagering on it.",

      "body": "In your scenario, you have two slot machines, one with an RTP of 96.50% and another with an RTP of 98%. The higher the RTP, the more favorable it is for players, as it suggests a higher chance of winning over time. However, there can be various reasons why players might still choose the slot machine with a lower RTP, such as Sugar Rush, over the one with a higher RTP. As for Pragmatic Play, the game developer behind these slots, it's unlikely that they are intentionally hoping players won't notice the RTP difference. Game developers typically provide a variety of slot machines with different themes, features, and RTPs to cater to the diverse preferences of players. Some players may prioritize other factors over RTP when choosing a slot machine to play.",

Many gamblers do not understand anything about RTP, percentages, mathematical expectation, etc. but they believe in their luck, omens and other nonsense.

Quite the contrary, Pragmatic wants the people to notice that their newer games have a higher RTP to entice them to play, cause that's where money's made. The more people who play their newest slot variants, the more casinos are going to implement such games into their rosters in order to cater to a wider audience. However, I think this plan's not working, as of the moment there's still a pretty high amount of people/gamblers who play with the old slot variants, probably because they're so accustomed to it they don't wanna try other games anymore, or just because they had it bookmarked and are one of the games that they see first whenever they login. All in all, the higher RTP is to entice newer customers, not swindle them.",

This is quite normal for the provider to do and the new slot game can also be added to many casinos to see the reaction from people. If people's reaction is interest, the casino may still put the new game on its list but if not, the casino may remove it. So it's up to us as gamblers to choose which slot game we want.",

I think all players who are used to the old version would be happy with the increased potential profit. Is it really more expensive to remake an old game than to make a new one and put it on the market?",

Instead of a whole modification, they will just create another one. I also do encounter some related games with their new version. For example, the Mahjong Ways by PG Soft. After the game became hyped by most slot players, later on, their developers released a new version, Mahjong Ways 2, and just recently I think, Mahjong Ways 3. Basically, it's for a new attraction since the classic version become hyped. Aside from that, there are surely lots of slot players who won big on the classic version therefore they will surely try the new version to test their luck. And I'm 100% sure that regardless of the RTP of those games with different versions, that was totally ignored by most slot players.96% compared to 98% RTP doesn't really have that much difference in terms of chances of winning as others might think it has a big impact.",

On the other hand, if those gamblers had access to the information you shared on this thread about the RTP of each game, I'm sure they would be migrating immediately from Sugar Rush to Sugar Twist. The point is that most of them don't notice this difference between both versions or probably don't even know about the existence of the later game. It's curious, though, that Pragmatic Play launches two identical games with different RTP rates. Are they collecting statistics from both games to do any experiments or something like that?",
