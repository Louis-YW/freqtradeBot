I find that the need to scan QR codes constantly is quite annoying as well.If you decide to go with it, I know it supports BIP39 (like pretty much every other wallet out there), but I'm just not sure if you can add a passphrase to it like you intend to do.",

You can buy Passport hardware wallet directly from the company. It is supporting 226 countries and I think your country would be there. On the site, click on 'add to cart' -> proceed to checkout. If you use IP address, your country will be there by default as the selected country the wallet should be imported to. I think your country will likely be among the listed countries.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on September 16, 2023, 10:54:27 AMIf you decide to go with it, I know it supports BIP39 (like pretty much every other wallet out there), but I'm just not sure if you can add a passphrase to it like you intend to do.Safepal is supporting passphrase. But as you just have commented already, it is one of the worst bitcoin wallet. It is close source and it can not be connected with open source wallet like Electrum.",

Regardless of the fact that Passport is perhaps the best choice when it comes to HW at the moment, only those who are exclusively interested in BTC and have significant value in it will buy it.",

I visited the site and found that safepal supports passphrase.  But my question is: let me say it like this.  I use Coinomi, after gives me the recovery phrases, an option to add a passphrase appears and a password can be set.  But this option is not available when creating a safepal wallet.  So how does it work?",

Tap that, and then you can type the passphrase you want to extend the phrase with. I would imagine that the process for the hardware wallet is more or less the same.[1] https://docs.safepal.io/safepal-app/security/passphrase",

I have never tried it, but I had time to discuss and follow the discussion of local members who have experience with HW Wallets, that the Ellipal Titan Mini Cold Wallet has a new feature regarding Auto-selfdestruct. This feature is useful If any tampering is detected, your private information will be automatically deleted.sources regarding the features of the Ellipal Titan MiniBased on the results of our discussion, the Auto-selfdestruct feature functions when someone physically dismantles it.When I looked at the table https://thebitcoinhole.com/ I highlighted the Ellipal Titan Mini wallet regarding its Firmware which is not open source. In my opinion, closed source bitcoin wallets are not safe, although open source wallets can also have vulnerabilities.https://www.ellipal.com/blogs/support/how-can-i-factory-reset-completely-erase-ellipal-titanhttps://www.ellipal.com/pages/start-guide",

As someone who doesn't understand the underlying technology, relying solely on one company is always less reassuring than using multi-signature technology. For example, if my hardware wallet malfunctions and I buy a new wallet that has been compromised in the supply chain, what should I do? However, with multi-signature technology, it would require both two counterfeit wallets simultaneously to be compromised.        I happen to have two Ledgers, so I am using the Ledger + Trezor solution. I won't store any assets solely on the Ledger, because it is closed-source.

I won't store any assets solely on the closed-source Ledger. When sending a transaction, the Ledger (purchased in September 2022) displays the xpub of the two wallets and the transaction information, while the Trezor only displays the transaction information. Both displays are normal, which is why I haven't discarded the Ledger.       I don't understand the underlying technology. What is the problem for trezor? May I ask? Is it because that no secure chip in the Trezor?      By the way, Dear dkbit98, do you think Keystone and BitBox are currently the best altcoin wallets? Thank you for your advice.",
