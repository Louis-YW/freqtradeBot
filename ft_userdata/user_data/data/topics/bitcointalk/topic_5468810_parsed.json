What Bua just did will help many homeless Nigeria to acquire home through this means even though the period is short. Million of Nigeria will make use of the opportunity, I have a friend who purchased a land and was ready to build then the price of cement then increase, my friend have to stop with work due to the increase in the price of cement. When I so this I was very happy that finally my friend will start is building work. Bua you are a hero, you will not know what you have done for millions Nigeria.Federal government should copy from him, If one person can do this and non individual in Nigeria will say his richer than Nigeria if really our resources are manage well, so learn from him by subsidise food products even though it is a short time we will also appreciate.",

Nigerians will prefer to pertronize BUA cement than Dangote cement company, If this decision is implemented, it will greatly benefit our country. Because many people have plans to construct but their cannot afford the cost of cement, particularly we poor. We're struggling to purchase the land and there's no money to buy the cement, this will definitely force Dangote to reduce his cement price as well. Since BUA strateging will take over from Dangote cement.",

Kudos to Bua as they bring comfort to the people of naija. We hope to see other big companies emulate them to ease the hardship for the common man in Nigeria. This singular act of Bua require continuous thanks as they have the people of naija at heart and they are ready to help prosperity and housing spread in the land. Good job Bua cement.Our prayer now should be about suppliers as they also cause this price manipulation.",

      "body": "The Best market strategy to reduce Monopoly market, is price reduction. When there is Monopoly in the economy things becomes expensive. Dangote is one of our biggest problem in Nigeria. he was the only one given license to dominate the country. there by making other investors inrelivant. He is virtually into manufacturing and distributing almost everything in this country and all are expensive.If every investor reduce their market price like this I think others will no longer continue with their price. And it will serve as an example to others. People always have that thinking that Dangote cement is the best and making other cement company not relevant but with the way things are I believe no body cares to know about quality anymore.I am really happy about this development. But I pray the price wount change from the distributors just like forever101 said.. because that is one problem with 9ja. Dey always see every opportunity as a get rich quick scheme.Another problem na high demand but low supply according to mmate2237, how can it get to every corner of the country?",

This will further cushion the effect of fuel subsidy that was removed earlier thereby getting a bag of cement for almost same price it was before the fuel subsidy was removed when correlated together. Subsidizing the price of goods like this should have been the main aim of the subsidy removal in order for citizens to not feel and go through the hassle they are now as a result of the subsidy that was removed. This is the best possible palliative approach that if they employ to other sectors it’ll help cushion the effect of the fuel subsidy removal. I hope the big rebels (wealthy monopolists) don’t hijacked this cements and later sell at high price to end users again because it is something they can do.Quote from: Mate2237 on October 01, 2023, 10:14:49 PM One thing wey I dey feel be sae, the supply e no go reach the way dangote dey supply im own. Because community nobody dey sell am and only dangote cement nai dey there. so di matter still e get as e bi.  Maked di supply e dey rampant for all di corners.For my place, d way Dangote cement dey everywhere naso BUA cement dey too. There was a time when Dangote Cement sold expired cements to customers, those cements were supposed to be disposed and not sold again but maybe some factory workers smuggled them out and still sold to end users, which affected many buildings and constructions they were used for because I also experienced one that time. Since then, builders here always prefer to use BUA cement than Dangote cement because of what happened, as some people still felt it was their builders that didn’t know how to the work not knowing or believing it was the expired cement sold that caused it. BUA cement here gets finished on time because of its demand than Dangote cement which is always available but no much patronage than before. BUA cement is even N100 more costly than Dangote cement due to its demand here.",

Ever since this decision was made on the 1st of October to the 12th being today no good information concerning the price changes. I have heard Coples of people complaining that the change of price is just only on Internet but no were is selling for #3500.  People selling on retail said dey want to clear theirs old stock, before accepting the new price. And now even if dey buy #3500 from factory, they can not sell that same amount they bought. They will like to make profit, so there for to me I see no possibility of achieving that price in my own understanding.So what do you guys think about this?",

I think there is more to this move by BUA founder than we could imagine. The cartel holding that industry seems to have had enough but whatever the case maybe,  BUA just did something every reasonable human would have deep thought about and do. This move by him will definitelycause reform in that particular industry that would benefit every Nigerian and the nation as a whole. BUA cement has taken over the cement industry.
