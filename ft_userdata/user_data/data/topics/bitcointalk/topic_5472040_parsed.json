The 25% discount will now be valid until further notice.sourceQuote from: gunhell16 on October 28, 2023, 10:41:48 PMI use Binance a lot, and I don't pay attention to whether or not a cryptocurrency I trade on this platform has a fee or not.

But the trading fee is decreased when the account type increases for example, the Regular account has to pay a 0.1000% / 0.1000% fee in BNB and VIP1 has to pay a 0.0900% / 0.1000% fee in BNB.

They frequently trade in daily basis which makes fee painful for them especially if their target profit per trade is below 1%.Thanks for shedding more light to my statement of --> \"It does matter for many\". I am not a trader, not do any type of trading (spot or future) so I don't care about the fee because I often make trades only when I need some stable currency to withdraw or etc. But overall, I don't make trades for the time being (but planning to). Those who make huge volume of trades, they definitely have to make all type of calculations to book some good profit because sometimes, a trader does not give that much importance to the trading fee while using \"X\" exchange and booking profit but at the same time if he will be using some \"Y\" exchange then the profit would be increased by 1% to 2%.",

I will say try to collect some coupons because you might save some amount while paying fees, one of the best with the least transaction fee is Binance then comes bybit according to my knowledge.",

You will always pay fees, if they are not in the form of Spot Trading, they may be in the form of higher withdrawal fees, low liquidity levels, slow execution of orders, or for purchasing a token such as BNB or for hidden fees. Trading platforms are not charitable organizations and to run their business they do not require fees. You can search for the lowest possible fees or try to use several platforms to reduce fees, but do not dream of 0% fees.",

I’m pertaining retail traders that buy and sell Bitcoin seasonally not a day trader. Your sample breakdown is for a day trader with 150 trade using 1000USD margin. This kind of trading quantity is already equal to more than a year of trading of normal retail trader.Do you think that kind of fee will charge that same amount on a 1000$ capital buy and sell few times?

It's not preferable to use BUSD in the futures trading since the trading pairs are very limited which is not good if you're a futures trader because it takes time to see a setup in coin/token that's why it's prefer to use USDT pair.QuoteFor marker and takers in the spot market, the fee is 0.075% on Binance.0% fee for USDC pair on spot trading on Bybit0% for spot trading on MEXC.You don't need to pay for a taker fee if you used their \"convert\" feature.",

I can still remember some of my friends being crazy about FTX for their zero withdrawal fees for ETH. They were DeFi application user so they had to buy and sell eth often and they were happy about FTX for its zero withdrawal fees for ETH. I have been using Bybit for some times but i have noticed they are very strict about using multiple IDs. Some people from one of my local community companies freeze their accounts after they have used multiple bybit IDs to join their promotion. Actually bybit has been doing a lot of promotion recently. I think they wanted to take the place of Binance and they are also pushing their own blockchain project.",
