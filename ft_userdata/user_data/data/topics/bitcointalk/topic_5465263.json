      "body": "It is not a must to post on your local board, the reason I think behind for local boards is simply to have you relate with people that speak your language. The entire forum set up is on English so not having local boards will limit the users who are not from English speaking nations and do not speak English. That’s why you see local boards in here and the reason why threads are also been translated to different local boards. This way even non English speaking members can join the forum and benefit from its knowledge. If you feel the general boards has given you everything then no need to go to local boards again, it is fine although I would say you should guide people from your local board too. Also local board doesn’t mean where you are coming from but you can join a board that you can read and understand that board language as well not necessarily your local board. But be aware that the use of translators are strictly forbidden",

If you don't find any of those necessary, then you can stop going to your local board. No one will penalise you for not visiting your local board or for being inactive. It's just a personal decision, nothing more.",

The purpose of bitcointalk forum is to discuss about bitcoin and make people all over the world to understand bitcoin and its usage. Then the essence of the local board is to prevent English from being a barrier to people who wants to learn Bitcoin. It is not necessarily for hang out. Any user who understands English very well might not need the local board for anything. So to keep the records straight there is no board that is compulsory for anyone to post. This forum is a representation of Bitcoin. It is all about Liberty, just play within the unofficial rules and you are good to go. No limitation and no jail.",

How posting on local boards reveal anyone's real identity? If I am a regular on a local board that only means I am from that country. There are a few individuals that I have seen discussing topics on multiple local boards. That does not mean he or she is from all of those countries. Your real identity remains anonymous even if you are posting on any board or local boards. It is not compulsory to post on your local board, if you want to be part in a discussion related to crypto issues in your country then you can participate in that discussion if you want. I do not think such a question needs to be asked as it is simple logic and does not require a discussion surrounding it.",

Actually, huge part of forum members don't have their local board because English is their native language. Another part of members also don't have local boards because they comes from small countries and there is no dedicated board for their language. And some local boards isn't active at all, so, actively posting there is like talking with yourself.You can post in locals or not, it's your choice.",

If you maintain confidentiality, you don't have to reveal things that are closely related to your personal life. Local forums are convenient for communicating in your own language. For newbies who have not yet understood all the rules of the forum, it is also easier to first publish posts in their local section. But nowhere does anyone say that you should do it. Therefore, if you speak English, the language spoken by the entire community, you may not visit your local board at all. But keep in mind that your compatriots will sometimes be able to give you the most complete and valuable answer based on the laws of your country.",

Instead, just use the English Bitcointalk Boards like Bitcoin Discussion for Bitcoin and Services for offering or providing any service in terms of Bitcoin as a payment. If you want to stay hidden and dont want your location to be revealed, or atleast your country, you can avoid posting in a local board.",

Just as others has explained to you in their respective comments, going to local boards is not compulsory for any user for identity because this is a forum where all the users are anonymous and there is no need to reveal our identity.Local boards were created to help people who are not from English-speaking nations communicate and share information related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the forum because there are people who don't understand and can't speak or write English. That is why prominent users of this community do visit their local boards to enlighten, answer questions, and share valuable information and knowledge with them.",

It’s not a must to post on your local board but sometimes you get joy meeting people from your local community and again it is easier to communicate in your native language especially in countries that English is not spoken generally. Posting on local boards does not reveal your identity unless you reveal them yourself it only reveals your country of origin. Local boards may contain contents and things happening in your country that the general board will not so sometimes it is useful to visit your local board once in a while and read through threads even if you don’t actually post in the board.",

It is a matter of choice for one to identify himself with you local board or not. It isn't a compulsory thing. Local board can play a major role in your growth in the forum because from your local  board, you can learn easily and ask questions that you don't understand and it will be addressed in your language. Local board helps to bring people from the same region and country be familiar with one another and to also make new friends. Some people in this forum are very poor in English Language when expressing themselves but they are very brilliant and can add value to the forum, so such people will do well in their local boards. I have seen some forum members that got 90% of their merits from their local boards. Imagine assuming there is no local board how will such people grow. There are benefits that are attached to local board users sometimes,when it comes to signature campaign. As I have seen a campaign that was lunched,which say they need 5 or more participants from a specific local boards. If your English is sound and you feel you don't need to contribute in your local board discussions,then it is a free world here. The bitcoin white paper has been translated to many languages so that everyone can understand it irrespective of your country and language.",

It’s left to the individual to post wherever he/she feels comfortable posting. There is no requirement for anyone to post in their local boards as not every nation even have a local board on here. Discussions about what goes on in a country is generally held in the local board and It’s entirely left to the user to partake or excuse yourself from such discussions. Amongst the unofficial guides and rules of the forum, it’s not stated anywhere a member has an obligation to post on their local boards. It would be crazy if it’s a must to do so.

This forum promotes freedom of speech and association. You have the right to post on any board based on your choice and knowledge. Nobody is restricting your posts or activities on the forum. To answer your question, you are not mandated to post on your local board. There are some benefits of posting on the local board such as better communication, cooperation, and support. I have also seen a situation where the community will ask a member to seek the approval of a reputable member of their local community to gain the support or acceptance of the bitcointalk community. But some persons want privacy so they prefer not to be associated with their community. But generally, I think it will not be bad to contribute to your local board, it is just up to you.",

This is not necessary you have freedom to choose if you like to post on your local board or not.But its great advantage for you if you actively posting there if you know your local board is so much alive and to many active posters there since you can easily understand all the topic posted since the word use is your native language. But in my case my local board is not so active and the post their is so generic that's why I choose to stay on global boards since there's a lot of things to learn there.",

Are you perhaps referring to any signature campaign? Or a normal poster here that is not in any campaign? I don’t quite understand the identity reveal part though because when you make posts in your local board the only thing that’s being exposed is that you’re from that country so how will your identity be exposed? The forum does not ask for kyc neither do your local board ask for one before you can make post there. No one is forcing anyone to make post in their local board, take me for example it has been quite a while that I made any single post in my local board despite the fact that I normally frequent there to read and get information from there no one is forcing me to post there it’s a matter of preference nothing more.",
