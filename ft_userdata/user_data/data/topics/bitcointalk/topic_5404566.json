The last time it jumped from $20,000 to $60,000, it took less than two months for the price to double. And since there are only a few months left until the end of 2022, this is also possible.On the other hand, most expectations point to the continuation of the recession over the next few months at least, due to the Russian war and the decline in the indicators of most of the world's economies.",

We do need that recognition and demand which is something that we do mainly need if we do speakabout reaching new heights and this is something that cant really be controlled nor be rushed up.Lets just see on how the progress would go in upcoming years to come.",

Crypto cycle is always repeat the history and it usually happened every 3 to 4 years and hitting the new ATH within this year will just result to a bubble and hype growth which leads to sever dump once people panic sell. I’m not expecting to see the price goes near the previous all time high this year or next year. We need to again a parabolic growth in long timeline to guarantee a strong bull run cycle.",

It will be difficult for the price to hit $100,000 before the end of this year 2022, because the price is still moving between $19,000 and $20,000 which will be difficult for investors to experience $100,000 soon than to experience $60,000 before the end of 2022. I think, the price will hit back $50,000 before the end of this year 2022 for long term investors to smile again before the price will increase to $100,000 next year 2023, because people are already experiencing the sign of improvement in the community.",

I think that figure will be passed after the next halving, although I also think it will be difficult to beat, as I think there will be a lot of sell orders around that figure.",

Economical declines and unstable political situations should have influence crypto investments, in my opinion. People become disappointed in traditional financial instruments, they no longer receive the profits they are used to, and therefore - they have to look for some new ways. Why, then, does the crypto market not show growth for several months, especially after the start of the war against Ukraine? Where do people keep their finances now?",

I checked the price just seconds ago and instead of rising it is actually falling. For the nth time, it has once again fallen from $20,000. Of course we are not losing sight of that goal but perhaps we should be a little more realistic and think of more reachable levels like $25,000 and then $30,000 first before thinking of a new ATH and $100,000.",

Only way is maybe if fed prints money again which obviously they won’t because it would make inflation worse. Right now we need to see demand destruction which is not happening. Same with job markets. Record unemployment lows. So inflation is still going to be high. It matters how high. If it’s over 1% again then fed will be aggressive and markets will go lower. If it’s going to be average or negative then markets will be happy.Not the time to expect ATH anytime soon.",

But, that will not be enough to reach 100k, it would be good to reach 50k for sure, and the another 6 months or so will get another 2x and we will be 100k but that would be inside of 2023 or even 2024 after next halving.",

The bearish market would probably continue on till a few more months, and even after it, we aren't going to see a bull season since it's going to be a steady season instead, with straight movements and probably a really slow but gradual increase to the past ATH. At the very least, we wouldn't see a price above the ATH until the next halving, which is still in two years. If you asked it before the bear market a lot would probably answer yes or maybe, but with the current state of things and seeing that we're halfway into the year already, it's highly doubtful.",
