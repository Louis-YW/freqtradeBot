Do you have any link that gives this information ? I haven't heard anything about this yet.If this is true I wonder how India is planning to do this. I am curious to know their plan.It won't be an easy job though. Monitoring on darknet is little tricky although the FBI is already doing it.",

Any source would be very well appreciated for such things in the OP itself, nevertheless I also read it on same in an article on Investing.com - https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/india-to-develop-dark-net-monitoring-tool-to-combat-crypto-fraud-report-3180499 . But more than Crypto related scams it looks as if this is more for all types of shady activities that go around but the payment method is cryptos. Also the payment mechanism could actually be useful in creating the whole link of the transaction and finding the person as well. So I think it'll actually be a great tool if we an build one.",
