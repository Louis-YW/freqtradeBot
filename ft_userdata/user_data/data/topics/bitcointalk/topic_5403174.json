It doesn't mean worthless since it will be used again and the thing is, removing the paper money one by one isn't easy, it's time consuming.Now I ask, in which country you're live and which currency you're using to pay goods, bills, etc?",

I see before when the ancient people even transacted through only seashells, or more advanced minted coins,... Now we see paper money and it remains an important part of financial operations. I think the change of the future will be very difficult to predict. Maybe when our lives are good enough for the things that people are using to function properly, there will be change.",

I am guessing that the best thing we can do right now would be to let time handle all of this, we do not need to do anything.",

But fiat currency is more acceptable to those of the countries a digital and decentralized currencies is been accepted. So believe that no country currently that doesn't accept fiat for payment of bills, so therefore before fiat can be eliminated and other currency take over it will be one thousand  (1000) year's coming.

Maybe in the later years we can experience these flowers bouquets replaced by a paper wallet.Paper money will still exist a hundred years from now, but we are not sure about digital currency.  It seems to look at that people appreciate much with paper money more than these digital currencies which in fact, some countries aren't yet supporting. It is to say that people are too much confident with this and they can use paper money where ever they are and are accepted, unlike card payments. And much more as a gift than other stuff like flowers.",

Paper money will be killed by CBDCs and it will be hugely beneficial for the government while commoners will loose their rights to privacy. Bitcoin will remain as a parallel economy the way it is doing right now. Adoption percentage will increase but the mainstream economy will still be dominated by fiat and not bitcoin.
