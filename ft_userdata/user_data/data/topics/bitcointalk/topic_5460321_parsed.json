  "content": "Hello everyone, ðŸ‘‹I would like to introduce you to our DCA WebApp from CryptoDCA.io. You can use it to buy or sell bitcoin and other coins on existing crypto exchanges using DCA - this comes with a user-friendly interface. In using the app, the coins remain on the exchange (e.g. Kraken) and we cannot withdraw the coins. It also takes advantage of the lower trading fees of the exchanges. We built the product because of:Existing crypto savings plan providers are too expensive.Existing DCA trading bots (e.g. found on Github) are designed for very tech-savvy usersThere is no option to sell via a savings plan as well (an important point to take some profits emotionless)You can also check out our DCA calculator to see the advantages of using the DCA strategies in a visual way!We both have been using the product ourselves for months and would like to invite you to use our app as well, as we are of course very interested in feedback. Currently, the app is in beta status and only works with DCA purchases with Bitcoin or Ethereum and the crypto exchange Kraken.As an incentive for early participation, we are offering 3 months of premium usage after going fully live (There will be a free version of course). If interested, feel free to write me for a personal invite code, read more about the \"why\" and us, or post here in the forum. I am looking forward for you and some discussion!",

It's known as Recurring buys. Binance (Binance Spot DCA) and many other popular exchanges have the same feature.My question is what advantage does your service (which will have to be paid for in the future) have over the various inbuilt exchange DCA features, which are actually free?These are some good questions and let me answer them.I tested and reviewed the Recurring Buy feature on Kraken. The feature does not have a competitive fee because it charges you at least a ~1,50% fee, depending on the payment you choose sometimes even more. I know it does not look like this at first.Binance does offer a feature like this - which I have not tested yet. I expect the fee to be pretty high because they only accept debit and credit cards (when using Auto-Buy with national currency). There are other advantages to not using Binance and not leaving your assets on Binance.Reviewing many of those \"in-build\" auto-buy features on exchanges, I can tell you that they have usually a pretty high fee. For me as a cost-conscious investor, I won't pay more than a 0,5% fee per trade.Â  Â Another advantage will be selling crypto assets with the DCA strategy.",

First of all, let me clarify and eliminate misunderstandings that the App I described in the first post is not found on cryptodca.io (yet). Because it is in beta status it is running on a separate domain. So if you are interested in using the App as an early user we can send you an invite code or you can subscribe to the newsletter to get one.Nevertheless, we welcome your feedback for our DCA Calculator as well.Â  Let me start, by answering your questions.Quote from: rat03gopoh on July 19, 2023, 03:53:26 PMSo how does \"taking advantage of lower trading fees\" work? Just need explanation from user side, will it have extra task to support it?Using a DCA broker usually costs you around 1,5-2% per trade but crypto exchanges usually have a lower trading fee between 0-0,25% (depending on various things).

It has a similar mechanism as DCA in that you're harvesting BTC into your wallet at regular intervals in the future regardless of price. Our calculations show BTC mining is a better long-term wealth creation strategy than DCA with the same amount of funds, with the caveat that a mining rig is hard to maintain for most people.",

So in our opinion, Kraken is one of the more secure ones. If we detect that our DCA App has demand we gonna add more exchanges and features (e.g. withdraw to own wallet).

Also, built-in \"brokers\" of exchanges charge a higher fee than their standard exchange fee (see the Kraken or Coinbase example above).Right now we plan to have a free plan that executes DCA plans with a low fee for multiple coins. Later on, there will be a premium plan with more advanced features. For our early-access version, I will provide you with 3 invite codes that you could use:BITCOINTALK1BITCOINTALK2BITCOINTALK3If you are interested you could create an account here (https://app.cryptodca.io/sign-up) and use an email address and one of the invite code to use the app.",
