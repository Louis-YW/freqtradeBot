You shouldn't be curious about learning who Satoshi Nakamoto is, you should channel that curiosity into something else and learn more about Bitcoin. Because the only thing that this curiosity is going to give is more fake Satoshi, the more you read about Satoshi the more you'll see different claims and none of them have been able to successfully been able to provide an evidence that indeed they are Satoshi and so you shouldn't be concerned about it.

Revealing the identity of Satoshi Nakamato would change a lot of things, and could lead to the fall of BTCAs far as I know, only message #3 (I have a doubt, but it was one of the first 5 messages) of Satoshi on Bitcointalk doxxed him, and this message has been definitively deleted: this is a good thing and I hope that the few admins and people who had access to it, don't remember about this content",

Does it add anything to the table? Haven't you also taught about it that it's just better we stop researching and focus on bagging more Bitcoin?Do you not also know that the entire federal government that is against Bitcoin will come for the creator immediately the person is confirmed to be the real Satoshi (which will never happen)?Bitcoin is okay the way it is without the real identity of Satoshi.",

Satoshi may have just pulled off the ultimate disappearing act by blending in with the vast sea of information on the internet, never to be found again. Maybe they are just waiting for the perfect moment to reappear and shock us all with their grand reveal. Or maybe they are just sipping margaritas on a deserted island somewhere, enjoying their newfound anonymity. Either way, it is a mystery that will keep internet sleuths scratching their heads for years to come!",

With so many individuals resorting to attention-seeking tactics and ultimately proving to be fraudulent, the only reliable way to authenticate Satoshi's identity is through a signed message from his address. Therefore, it is not worth expending time and energy attempting to uncover information about Satoshi. Instead, it is more beneficial to concentrate on educating oneself about Bitcoin. It is crucial to learn about Bitcoin, and it is acceptable for Satoshi to remain anonymous.",

But after more than 10 years and yet people don't know who Satoshi is, I doubt that we will find him in the next 10 years. I'm not clicking that youtube link, it will just give him the exposure and the algorithm he needed to keep his channel alive because we know that Satoshi can't be identified. Sure we have all our speculations and we even have a lot of discussions here in the community. But there is no smoking gun as to Satoshi's real identify. So sorry to say that it will be just a waste of your precious time. If there a community that can better identify him then this forum is. But you have to search it for yourself because I have said there are tons of it.",
