  "content": "REFERNECE/SCAM SITE: https://donate.coincryptotogo.tk/cab56kapl.php Few days ago, i received an email from a fake google form account telling me \"thank you for filling out the form\"(i did not fill any form.) and that \" i have BTC0.694099 available to claim\" by me participating in a unique project, which luckily, i am among those selected. With my years of experience online, i already knew that this was a scam, but i really wanted to know how this ones operate, so i followed the link in the email address, it took me to a page where i was asked to fill in my payment details. i filled a fake name, they already have my email address, i created a new bitcoin address and submitted the address in the form and clicked the \"Accept donate from project participants\" button to submit the form.In the next page, i was told that 55 persons will help me (fake persons by the way.) by sending random amount of Bitcoins to my account, i will have to accept the transfer from them all.After accepting the Bitcoin transfer from the first person, i tried to withdraw but was told i can only withdraw after ive accepted all bitcoin transfer from all 55 participants.So, i got to work, i started accepting the transfers and at the end of it, i collected a total of BTC0.1948 from 55  project participants.Time to withdraw   , i cant wait for this money to land in my wallet. I hit the withdraw button, and i was told to donate BTC0.0034 to one Grace Grant before i can withdraw my BTC0.1948(fake BTC by the way.)END OF STORY.Scammers are every where and looking for all means to steal your precious Bitcoins, steer clear and never you fall for any of their tricks, always remember that if the offer is too good to be true, then its likely not true . Newbies , beware of this strategy, scammers can never get your bitcoins if you do not send it to them or allow them access to your wallet, so be extra vigilant out there.",

      "body": "I don't waste my time with that kind of \"offers\". I see them coming from afar. The bad thing is that it pays off for the scammers because someone always ends up falling for them. Let's hope that we don't have in this same section soon threads of people complaining that they have fallen in this scam, because something similar happens with the 1xCrap casino. As much as it is known in general in the forum that they are scammers, every now and then we have someone in this section complaining that they have been scammed.",

Have you tried sending the 0.0034BTC from your 0.1948BTC?This is actually a strategy to scam people of their coins. It won't work that way, you'll have to send from your personal coins and not from the donations I think. I don't expect many people here to fall for this format except greedy and gullible ones. As for me, whenever I see something like this knowingly I didn't fill any form, I wouldn't hesitate to delete the message from my inbox. I will not even read to the end talk more of clicking on the link.",

People should not waste their time on this because no one would send a huge amount in exchange of small fraction so better ignore it since the offer is so shady.",

Based on my understanding of the concept of this scam you need to donate first before you can withdraw the amount donated, the amount is not yet on your wallet and you have to donate before they release it, its an automated system, and they all own those addresses and, I have this in casinos where they give you rewards and they made you win then they lock your account and you have to deposit first, same concept with a twist, scammers are very imaginative now.",

I'm sure scammers have sent spam emails like this to the billions of people in the world who use email, never believe it, even if it's from an email that looks convincing though.",
