  "content": "I was thinking the other day that many people stopped using old miners because they can never generate the minimum of the pools to actually withdraw, so they never get anything in return.But with nicehash you can rent your hashrate and then withdraw through lightning with a minimum of only 2000 sats:Quote from: https://www.nicehash.comMinimum withdrawal amount is 0.00002 BTC.So even if you have some miners that don't generate much, you can still get a few sats from time to time.If you've never used lightning, you can get Muun to receive the sats through lightning and then send the funds to an on-chain address, almost for free. It's a free, non-custodial wallet that can receive sats through lightning, very convenient.",

      "body": "I also like the fact that as nullama said in the 1st post NiceHash allows you to withdraw via lightning. No reason to move such small amounts onchain.And since you can mine other algos there if your 8 year old miner space heater dies. You can still run your GPU or CPU for a few hours here and there to get your funds out. Unlike every other place where it's just lost.I still don't think you should be running old miners just to mine they are just not worth it. If you are doing what several of us here do and use them as space heaters for the winter that generate a little bit of BTC then it's not totally a waste of power.-Dave",

Our team has years of experience dealing with information security, and has evolved to be some of the best prepared in the world, as well as working alongside some of the top global security companies, 365 days a year.NiceHash Miner only updates or adds digitally signed third party software, to ensure the end user is not at risk of any malicious activity by unknown authors.I can't help but laugh, oh and by the way, did you happen to repay the hacked amount?Quote from: philipma1957 on May 20, 2022, 01:38:24 AMIf you have a coinex.com exchange accountyou can mine at viabtc.com and move coin for free to coinex. the minimum is pretty low.The problem with this approach is that coinex has a minimum withdrawal of 0.001 BTC and a fee of 0.0001 BTC, even of other coins the lowest seems to be around $10 worth, so this sends you back to square zero, and honestly, if I had to, I rather keep my coins on the pool's wallet than the exchange's.I have to side stompix's opinion here, if you really can't hit the minimum payouts for most pools, you are wasting your time and efforts.",

At any pool it would take you months to get anything, but with NiceHash you can get a few sats every week or two via lightning.Also, depending on your electricity costs, you can actually make money with this. It's just a small and silent operation at home, you're not necessarily wasting money in certain configurations:Also, some people might want to basically buy Bitcoin through the electricity bill as well, and nicehash allows this for tiny miners.",

We actually had to reimburse 122% as we had to pay Slovenian tax above the actual amount.The hack made us stronger. Our investment in security is probably far higher than any other crypto company. Another important thing considering security is the use of signed miner. Excavator (QuickMiner) is in-house built. It is not developed by an unknown developer.

It's distributed with your closed sourced GPU miner(excavator) to mine with the CPU:Quote from: https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashQuickMiner/wiki/Why-NiceHash-QuickMinerXMRig miner (https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig); we have compiled version 6.7.0 with some modifications. The miner is stored in Excavator and it is extracted and launched when needed for CPU Mining.Since xmrig is released with a GPL license, any redistribution of it requires sharing the modifications. I didn't find any source code for xmrig at https://github.com/nicehash/excavator so maybe they are published somewhere else?You seem to take these issues very seriously, so I'm sure you're publishing those modifications somewhere to comply with the GPL:Quote from: https://github.com/nicehash/excavatorWARNING!!! Excavator is a proprietary software by NiceHash and has a special EULA. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REDISTRIBUTE IT!",

Shared libraries for time's worth! There's no initial decompression overhead involved.Call me a crank but I never like it when people distribute auxillary add-ons as separate programs inside the codebase, base64'd and gzipped. That would be a pain in the ass to maintain.",
