  "content": "After BenCodie was able to take the discussion completely out of context to \"prove\" his point, let's have the discussion about the issue without taking it out of context. About the issue: Here's where it started: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5115291.msg63055617#msg63055617Well, actually here already: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5115291.msg63017210#msg63017210The question was about BenCodie's statement, while participating in a gambling signature campaign: Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on February 28, 2019, 12:04:58 PMView this as an example. Quote from: 1miau on October 18, 2023, 01:08:44 AMWhere the OP (CryptopreneuerBrainboss) pointed out that: Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on February 28, 2019, 12:04:58 PM[2]: Join a campaign you agree with and not just for the payout.After denying all this, BenCodie started a misleading poll by taking the entire topic out of context. Option 1 is what we said: Wearing a paid signature is (inevitably) an endorsement: The brand name appears directly right next to our forum name and our forum profile. High paying campaigns are selecting the most reputable forum members for a reason.Therefore, we should select the campaigns carefully and if we hate gambling, think gambling is harmful and we oppose gambling, it's hypocritical to join such a gambling campaign just for the sake of getting a few sats. As a participant in such a campaign, we should be able to say about the service: \"yes, the advertised service is a service I can get behind\"What any viewer does, when coming over our signatures is not our business. It's not something like \"hey, please use this service in my signature\", like written by BenCodie in his misleading poll. We've never claimed that. So we, as a participant in that campaign, should always be able to get behind the advertised project. Otherwise, we should not join that campaign.We should also know that viewers will think a project advertised in a signature from highly reputable forum members is more legitimate than advertised from a red tagged shitposter account. This is inevitably tied to signature campaigns. Option 2 is what BenCodie said:BenCodie said, that joining a signature campaign doesn't mean an endorsement at all. He even did it himself, that he openly opposed the service, a gambling service. So, what's even the point to join such a campaign, if he thinks it's unethical? Just to get a few sats, most likely.  In addition, BenCodie says, that we would have said that \"the wearer encourages you to use the advertised service\". No one ever said that. It's up to the viewer if he signs up or not. You can read his entire \"argument\" here, here and here.  Our conclusion: Yes, joining a signature campaign and displaying the brand right to our name is (inevitably) an endorsement, that's inevitably part of a signature campaign . We can have a simple solution if we can't get behind a certain service: no need for us to join a certain signature campaign, if we don't like it, if we think it's an unethical / risky / shady business. Why even joining that campaign if we called it harmful somewhere? Participating there, would mean to advertise a \"harmful\" service, if we called this service like that somehow. There's also no point for such a service to pay posts opposing the service or industry entirely, like BenCodie did. As simple as that. The solution for BenCodie: Don't join gambling signature campaigns, if you really hate gambling and think it's harmful. Otherwise, you would inevitably contribute to be \"harmful\" as well by wearing that paid signature.  Only join a campaign, where you agree with the advertised service. And that's exactly, what CryptopreneurBrainboss pointed out in his topic.",

While a single post might not make much of a difference in a signature campaign's product, we've all seen some users here who are generally disliked by the community because they're unable to participate in campaigns.

Have fun with it as I will To all those who voted the first option, be careful what you wish for. If we are personally endorsing something, we are adding liability to all outcomes.

If you guys genuinely disagree with that, you're not right. Go look at the data of gambling related deaths and bankruptcies ... And think about how many are not considered in the data.Stop being purposefully ignorant just to prove the validity of your attacks against my opinion.

There is a clear community consensus about the issue when it comes to joining a (scam) signature campaign:If there's undeniable proof, that a service is a scam, only then your concern applies. Everyone who still joins a campaign at that point or continues to promote it, despite the community has shown undeniable proof about the service being a scam and this consensus is accepted by DT, only then we are liable for knowingly advertising a proven scam. But we can't know if any service turns out to be a scam in the future, so everything what happened before the service goes scamming, is not our responsibility. So, yes: we are liable if we are knowingly promoting a proven scam service and the result will be a negative trust from DT....Quote from: BenCodie on October 27, 2023, 08:39:32 AMTell me if I'm wrong.Yes  Quote from: BenCodie on October 27, 2023, 08:39:32 AMGambling destroys lives. Okay, let's assume that's a reasonable argument and of course, it's completely okay, that you really hate gambling, that's your opinion and you are allowed to have it. But then, why THE F*UCK are you advertising a gambling site in your signature / profile picture? So, you are complicit in \"destroying lives\" according to your viewpoint.   Your gibberish doesn't make any sense! Of course, people will call you out for that.  In which world are you living in? Quote from: JollyGood on October 27, 2023, 12:55:58 AMHe is a multi-level hypocrite because he says one thing about joining signature campaigns and another thing about ethics and another thing about censorship yet ends up doing the very things he claims (he and) others should not. Giving him any attention is a complete waste of time and energy therefore he is remaining on my ignore list.I don't even know what he's trying to achieve. Right now, his clownery is a good example of Streisand Effect, where very soon, the whole forum will know about his \"gambling incident\", every campaign manager will be aware of it and the following picture might become a meme:",

Go look at the data of gambling related deaths and bankruptcies ... And think about how many are not considered in the data.Stop being purposefully ignorant just to prove the validity of your attacks against my opinion. That is worse than anything we are discussing in these threadsBut if you really believe in your opinions, I dare you to say publicly that you think gambling is good for your overall health. What a stupid opinion that would be, but still, go right ahead Speaking of misguided thinking, consider this: Is sitting detrimental to an individual's health? No? I dare you to publicly say that you think sitting is good for your overall health! See how stupid that sounds?Sitting, much like gambling, is an activity, and like many other activities, it can have both negative and positive effects on one's health. You claim that gambling (as an activity) is inherently bad for the individual, but you are being purposefully ignorant and refuse to acknowledge that there is a clearly defined distinction between gambling as an activity and gambling addiction as a psychological disorder.But we digress here. The main point of this discussion is that YOU believe that gambling is harmful and that it destroys lives, and yet, you have no problem promoting this activity with your personal signature. This means that you are purposefully and directly contributing to the number of gambling victims you speak of, all for your own personal gain. Well, if you dont see anything wrong with that, then you are not right and I cannot help you there.

But you know, it makes me think maybe we should all stop having sex too, because, apparently, thats a gamble that could kill you too!",

Otherwise, you would inevitably contribute to be \"harmful\" as well by wearing that paid signature.  Only join a campaign, where you agree with the advertised service. And that's exactly, what CryptopreneurBrainboss pointed out in his topic.  Maybe you have free time so you have time to write something like this. I think benCodie is entitled to whatever his stance and beliefs are. Apart from that, if the campaign manager considers this to be a problem then he will remove Ben from the campaign participantsI have read BenCodie's comments several times, I think he is a person who has principles and beliefs. I don't think it's necessary to give him advice, let him be himself. I once PM @royse777 regarding campaign issues, because I was afraid that my comments would damage the good name of the Sinbad brand, but I didn't get a reply.But this is just my personal opinion, I don't have much experience in campaignsQuote from: JollyGood on October 27, 2023, 12:55:58 AMBenCodie created false accusations about me by alleging that I took discussions out of context and he even accused me of censoring my threads. After all the drama he tried to create surrounding my locking of my threads and citing fake censorship, BenCodie ended up deleting your post from his own self-moderated thread because he did not like what you wrote.He is a multi-level hypocrite because he says one thing about joining signature campaigns and another thing about ethics and another thing about censorship yet ends up doing the very things he claims (he and) others should not. Giving him any attention is a complete waste of time and energy therefore he is remaining on my ignore list.Oh yeah..... There are also those who accuse me, even though that person has no evidence. Just speculation. But that's okay, lower level members don't get much attention. Indeed, sometimes we remember more when we are accused by someone than when we accuse someone",

      "body": "Let me prefix by saying anyone can advertise what they want as long as it is not a scam.Now to the point of the discussion, I don't think users should wear signatures of projects they do not agree with, they feel may be detrimental and will not use for themselves. The world is not utopian and people do things for money in the real world due to situation and circumstances, but this is an online forum and what you do here is well within your control.There are also numerous campaigns available, granted majority of them are gambling related but there are definitely others.You can simply apply for some other campaign.There's another argument that endorsement can have different meaning. Advertising a site can be me telling you that it's not a scam website. I'm not encouraging you to gamble, but if you must this is a good website to do it on.",

Each person has his own way of looking at things.Sometimes a person faces difficult circumstances that make him abandon some of his convictions. For example, I am against gambling because it is forbidden in my religion, but I faced difficult financial circumstances and did not have any campaign, so I had to submit an application to join a gambling campaign despite my lack of conviction in the service, fortunately. I was not accepted into the gambling campaign, but the idea is that I changed my conviction due to special circumstances.Therefore, I believe that in general, people should not be judged without knowing their circumstances.",
