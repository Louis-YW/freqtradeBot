Or you think we should all be aware about each and every scam accusation case?I am surprised to see that no one in MetaMallVerse scam accusation topic mentioned their ongoing bounty campaign and warned Royse777 about this situation as it looks like a clear scammy shitcoin project with anonymous team and plagiarized whitepaper. Anyway, I will contact him and let him know about it and if he still continues with bounty campaign he will bare the consequences. Although I don't understand how he missed that project he is promoting for a month has been tagged and flagged. Quote from: Scambuster03 on January 22, 2023, 03:51:21 AMSame kind of Whitepaper Plagiarized was happen with the Project UKAN Promoted by Mr Crank and was given 3 Negative feedback.I guess you are an alt account of MrCrank? Since at first it looks like you were only the bounty manager there, stopped bounty campaign upon discovering plagiarism and didn't have previous tags for something else, I will look into it a little bit further and if everything checks out I might change negative to neutral.",

Red tagging him, usually closes the doors to work with him, so people are more reluctant. Plus he has a group of friends on the forum who believe in him no matter what.",

I had completely forgotten about this plagiarism case and wasn't familiar with their bounty campaign as I don't regularly check that board. I'll definitely take a look at it now.

Red tagging him, usually closes the doors to work with him, so people are more reluctant. Plus he has a group of friends on the forum who believe in him no matter what.I am thinking Same about Mr crank. At the time when he was tagged he was launching most altcoin bounties other than any manager and most the reward was escrowed there. Even Ukan( Pilgrized Whitepaper) has been paid to hunters for their half work. This negative tag closed the door for him. You can check his profile that how much altcoin he managed. I respected both but rules should be same for all Quote from: FatFork on January 22, 2023, 08:50:21 AMI,ll definitely take a look at it now.

I think it will not work. Here is another example if Qi Blockchain Project Which Whitepaper was Plagiarized. Even this project token is now listed in two big exchanges XT(No 2 in volume) and bitmart exchange and still project alive but compaign manager Jawadu has been tagged for running compaign Here is the Qi Blockchain Pilgrized Detail Quote I don't see why OP is making a fuss because he hasn't been tagged.I want justice.

IMO to protect campaign managers from any oversight and bounty participants from investing their time in such projects... Before a project is entered for a bounty some kind of whitelisting process should be introduced on the forum to ensure whitepaper is plagiarism free and to protect all parties interests which is also a huge ask tbh because end result might be a not successful project...So basically plagiarism can be brought toba minimal but bounty success isn't guaranteed!",
