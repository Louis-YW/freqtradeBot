      "body": "I‚Äôm here to verify Cygans claims. Polymerbit produced sixteen of these samples. Six of which were subsequently destroyed. Four samples were sent to Cygan to showcase in Innsbruck. They are now being auctioned by him with my permission. They are were made to unveil our newest in-house clear window technology. Currently at about 0.0051 BTC each to make, they still too expensive to create normal Polymerbit runs with. We are working on bringing the cost down over time. V 1.3 stands for the version of the technology. Biggest improvements are material feel, details possible, and accuracy of the print. For context, mystery 2 (the monero note) was 0.1. Some images of the clear window part:",
