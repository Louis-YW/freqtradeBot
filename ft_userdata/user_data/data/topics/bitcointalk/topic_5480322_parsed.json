  "content": "Going all the way back to 2008, \"Mad Money\" Jim Cramer has perfected the craft of being an unironic reverse indicator. Yesterday he managed to do it again; except this time it was for our beloved Bitcoin.\"This thing is... you can't kill it,\" said Cramer on CNBC yesterday. \"It's a reality and its a technological marvel and I think people have to start recognizing that its here to stay.\"The comments led to a near-immediate drop of over 8% in the price of BTC. It has since recovered slightly and is now down about 5.5% over the last 24 hours. The drop was likely due to people anticipating some kind of even bigger drop because of some kind of information known only by Cramer and those who told it to him.How does Inverse Cramer work? The thinking is that he manipulates his audience into becoming exit liquidity for himself and/or the firms/individuals he deals with behind the scenes. These entities sell into the FOMO created by Cramer's recommendations, or buy in the case he is telling his audience to sell.The earliest and most famous example of this phenomenon occurred in early 2008, when he assured his audience that Bear Stearns, one of the biggest real estate brokerage firms was not going under, despite clear warning signs that the housing bubble was beginning to pop.Just a few of the other ridiculously wrong calls he's made: - fading Tesla's IPO at $17 a share- predicting a probe into Coinbase in July 2022 which he said was \"very bad news\" (the stock went up 50% a week later)- in June 2021, he said Bitcoin was doomed \"because of structural reasons\" (price reached an ATH of $69k in Nov.)- in Feb 2023, he recommended buying Silicon Valley Bank -- it collapsed weeks laterHe also frequently makes several suspiciously-timed wrong calls about the same stock, yet for some reason anybody keeps taking him seriously:This Twitter account chronicles all the times Cramer blew it... They have over 6,000 posts:https://twitter.com/CramerTrackerSo what do you think? Does Cramer's endorsement of Bitcoin mean something terrible is about to happen? ETFs rejected or delayed, institutions pulling out? Or is it all just a superstition?",

      "body": "This man is funny and entertaining. It's hard to take him seriously. That his predictions are the exact opposite of what's to come makes his presence and statements light and bearable. And for this skeptic to finally say something positive about Bitcoin just before the price plunged made him a lot easier to handle. But I don't think he's playing with the market. I don't think he's carefully weighing his words because he's got positions and he's trying to manipulate its volatility. I guess it isn't intentional. All is most likely coincidental. He also mentioned those pro-Bitcoin words seemingly in passing. He's probably just an unlucky man who got most of his predictions wrong. He's a jinx. Also, if we take his words as the opposite of what's to happen, rather than a spot ETF rejection, there would be an approval. Right before he mentioned that Bitcoin can't be killed, he actually predicted that there won't be an ETF.",

Truth is, he himself knows some of this sayings rarely hold water and it's sad that there's investors who take him seriously. From research made it shows he makes his money from hosting two shows on CNBC, profit made from his old hedge fund,  surprisingly having an investment club and also selling investment books and being paid just to make speeches; so one can understand why he makes this God awful predictions! It's just for the cash. I feel he garners much viewership simply because his viewers don't really know anything about effective market hypothesis cause I doubt one would bother to sit in on such shows except for the laughs.   Cramer has a lot of insider investor knowledge but one has to be careful when these guys share their secrets to success stories with the public.",

Even still, people have built a correlation to his prediction in an inverse relationship after a move towards what he had said.We can’t always expect all that falls off his mouth to be false and even now, I don’t believe he has had he’s say on Bitcoin based on what he knows or out of his own complete thought on the innovation but, an outburst based on what’s been perceived and this time, he just might be right and buy himself some more listeners.",

However, sometimes statistics on the results of this fund (expressed graphically) come across on the Internet. So, it cannot be said that this fund was very successful. Rather, it is a curve going up, but very slowly, through a series of dips. The assumption that Kramer can always be right or always wrong and you can get rich just by watching his show and betting against him is quite strange. We can say that he is good at guessing the desires of retail traders on the stock exchange... but this is also quite doubtful.",

Bitcoin isn't dependent on someone's predictions and even if someone with inverse predictions says something about Bitcoin then again the inversion fails and Bitcoin will go up and up again.Although, Jim Cramer is the king of inverse predictions but I'm with him if he supports Bitcoin because the cure for curse of inversion is Bitcoin.
