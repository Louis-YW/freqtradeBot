Trading = highly riskyGambling = highly riskyAs you can lose in trading, so can you lose in gambling. Quote from: Bitcoinpoly on December 05, 2023, 12:07:39 PM1. Learn about the volatile marketYes. But also better to trade less volatile coins like bitcoin that is not volatile like many altcoins.Quote from: Bitcoinpoly on December 05, 2023, 12:07:39 PM2. Learn how to analyze chartYou can learn how to analyze market and still be losing if you do not use the right strategies. Quote from: Bitcoinpoly on December 05, 2023, 12:07:39 PM4. Do not be greedy, take profit when it’s best to do that, do not hope to get the whole world at a time. This happens to me frequently. It still happened today. I have won over $50 and later the position went bearish and I lost. It is not good to be greedy. What I noticed is that the losses I have before can result to this. If you know you are losing, just stop trading for that day.",

You should always start with basics. Remember,  all experts started with basic trading. But the question is, do you know the basic rules in crypto trading here? I think you don't know that. Because of what you said, usually those who know have real knowledge of trading in the crypto business.Do you think it's that easy to learn or know everything about crypto trading? It looks like you don't know that either. I think you should study well in the field of crypto trading before you say such things in the trading industry here in cryptocurrency.",

As a newbie within the crypto space kindly check the following before you go into trading.Actually their is difference between trading and gambling but people that have not trade before do think that trading and gambling have same similarities, its very obvious that gambling is a game that deals with luck and it does have to deal with skill acquisition or undergoes a serious training before you become a gambler, while in Trading it has to do with understanding, timing and observation, so if you are not concentrated you will continue to be experiencing loses everytime Quote from: Bitcoinpoly on December 05, 2023, 12:07:39 PM1.

The thing that is very necessary with trading is that you most learn and understand it very well and what you listed is among what a trader have to learn and understand before it can be a successful trader, something like learning how to analyze chart is very important in any trader because the analysis we are emphasising on is the signal some people paid to get, so to analyze a chart and understand it perfectly is the major key a trader can be use and make a profit....greediness is one of the elements that makes some of trader lose, when you are getting greedy to cash out the profit you have already made, just have it in mind that their is every tendency that you will lose the one you have already secured...so therefore greediness is one of the things that's traders to lose...in all ramifications I think all your points is meaningful in the aspect of trading.",

I have a question for you, dude: is it easy to analyze a trading chart? Do you know what the two types of chart analysis are?Are there any patterns to use to analyze a chart? For me, the information you are giving here is lacking. Yes, what you mentioned is correct; that's why I'm lacking. Newbies who come here for the first time on our forum platform will not understand that. Maybe I'm just advising you, dude. Next time you do these kinds of topics in detail, I'm just advising you on this. Thank you",

Take your time to practice demo trading before If you must know how to trade avoid Demo is a waste of time and energy why because when trading with demo you have this full confidence you can trade with real account without knowing is just like someone looking himself on the mirror. Demo has deceived lots of people and when they went ahead to fund their account they ended up sweeping it within some space of time without knowing the demo is their point of failure, my advice is as newbies try at least to fund your real account with $10 to $50 if you must learn very fast and learn with real account also gives you the bold step to withstand pressure and lost otherwise if you focused on Demo and then start using real account just that day or that week you would developed a serious health problem due to the effect of your lost.",

You would save yourself from depression that comes from losing money because you didn't set a stop loss.

You might really be that slow but with the steps that you are making then it is really that much more better compared into those people who are really that making those fast trades without even trying to think that it cant really be just that so easy on having that kind of approach. You are really that prone to mistakes whenever you do make out those rush trading because you are really that comes after with profits on short time period then you are really just that putting yourself on such hard situation because you are really that making tons of mistakesand errors since you cant really be able to think up clearly just because you are in a rush on seeing profits on which this could really affect your overall efficiency when it comes on making yourtrading analysis. This is why it would be better to be slow but having that kind of sureness on every move that you would be making.",
