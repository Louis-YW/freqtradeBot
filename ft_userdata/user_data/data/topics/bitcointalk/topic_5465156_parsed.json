      "body": "I chose Surprise us because I like surprises at Christmas where I often give gifts to my family. But I'm still curious as to what the calendar will look like. Will it be like our home calendar, or is there another form?People also like surprises, especially on special days. So you can start from now to think about what surprises you can give us. Maybe give bonuses or free spins or capital to play gambling And I hope it's something interesting that you can give us",

      "body": "I can't choose one, as both suprise us & highroller deposit bonus without wagering both look ideal. I would go for both and not a single offer. If you want us to select a single offer then as like others I would go for suprise us. Unpredictability & uncertainty is what makes gambling an addictive entertainment, with suprise us both conditions apply. I would be eagerly waiting for what you would be offering to the community.",

I must say, participating in such rewarding activities is enjoyable. However, it would be even more exciting if you could brainstorm and introduce a fresh, original concept. Surprise us!",

      "body": "Christmas is significant and so are the marketing offers that pop up before the celebration starts. I would like to see what you can offer the community without the community recommending you. The third option which is surprise us would be my choice at the moment as you have not suggested anything different than what others generally would offer the community, I hope you come out with something that is exclusive to the forum and that is unique in itself and possible have not been provided in the past.",

      "body": "Surprise Us will be my pick too. I mean, the other choices had been made by a lot of casinos. Something new will make it feel fresh and maybe it will be a new spark in the new era of the cryptocurrency gambling industry.It's nice to ask your customer. Maybe you will find a way to make the marketing area a bit better. I have seen customers that are not satisfied with other gambling sites and they are still looking for better offers. Maybe you can give them what they want although I still doubt there's something that could satisfy them.",

Otherwise do not bother as there are a big bunch that respect the community. They exsist because the offered something unique for the community.Maybe they don't have that much budget compared to other sites that's why they couldn't offer something exclusive and that's fine. The Calendar is good enough if they can find some of the best promos that aren't getting enough exposure.",

What new do you wanna people wanna surprise us with again? Just lemme say Yes but it should something cool and much better.",

      "body": "Yeah' \"surprise us\"!  That option will fit so fine in the calendar as we wouldn't know or have a clue of what we're expecting. People tend to be attracted by things that brings surprises to them, the curiosity and the suspense that the idea of surprise creates within them increases their interest and add much fun to the whole stuff.In as much as what you'll be offering as a surprise is fun and unique then it's perfect. If people keeps giving out their recommendations of what they would love to see from you guys, in my opinion that can put much pressure on you from the community, so just surprise with something interesting and fun.",
