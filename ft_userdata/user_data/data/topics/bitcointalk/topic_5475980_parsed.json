Do you not know one would need to pay before they receive their order? You want them to do a discount for you; is it for free that they are making the order?Quote from: pr_btc on November 29, 2023, 07:11:52 PM1. Escrow is must. We can do escrow here or any other reputed website which offers escrow service.Would it not be better that the escrow come from this platform because there are reputable members here well known enough to handle  such rather than go outside the platform because no member would agree to it if you insist on choosing an escrow outside the platform. Quote from: pr_btc on November 29, 2023, 07:11:52 PM2. Payment will be sent to escrow service once you place the order & the escrow will be released once the order is delivered to my address/you provide the proof of delivery.I think this aspect of payment terms should be the other way around, OP. You should make payment first  to escrow for confirmation, to see your seriousness first. Then your vendor confirms your payment with escrow and places the order  because it would be your address that the order would likely contain. When you receive the order, then they get their payment. I think this way you will make headway with your offer; otherwise, nobody would give in to your request to deal with you, and to start with, you are just a newbie here with no reputation.",

What are we earning to help you? 10% commission?  Well, actually, Bitcoin is worth a lot more than amazon gift cards, plus, buying Bitcoin is hardly 1:1, in most countries it costs some fee to convert your fiat to btc, and then you get the privacy aspect of transferring your fiat to btc without using an exchange.So websites like Purse.io or Bitoff are real and legit, you place an amazon order, chose your desired discount and someone else picks it up, it is very common to get 5-10% discount orders accepted on the same day, 10-20% discount might take a while.It is safer for OP and those who want to trade their amazon for BTC to use the websites mentioned above.",

But now they have closed their operations, thats why i am trying to reach people here.In that case you'll have to search for an alternative of Purse.io instead of asking people on this forum to do that for you. No one will ever do that here because most of the users of this forum love to have trades with Bitcoin only and that's why finding someone to do that for you is going to be very difficult or you can say close to impossible. Although, I used to see the user who were selling Amazon gift cards on digital goods board but I haven't visited that board for a long time and that's why I don't know that are those users still selling Amazon gift cards or not. But, I would alert you that there can be some newbies on that board offering you to purchase gift cards from them but they can be scammers and to avoid being scammed you should look for a reputed escrow of the forum.",

Saves more time and stress.You are not going to be able to fulfil your desired volume with those terms of yours. This is no gift card marketplace where you will have several members competitively giving you offers. At most, you will just have a couple of members in a long time accepting your offer for that one gift card they are trying to get rid of, but they have no choice else where.Sorry if it may sound rough, but that's the reality.",
