It does not sound like a bad idea, but you need to provide more information and perhaps invest a bit into the development and in a copper-membership, so you can promote your page in a proper way here in Bitcointalk.Coingecko and Coinmarketcap have a lot of failed projects and scam coins listed on the platform, if you somehow managed to include only cryptos that do not tend to go to zero as quickly as the usual scams we all know, then you could even earn some money off this, through some ads and the gambling games you plan to build.",

      "body": "Welcome to Bitcointalk forum. There are reasons why project owners have hard time time to get their project listed. Do you really want to list projects that are new that looks promising but in the end it is a scam project. Who would want their platform to be responsible of making their scam project known by many and many got scammed. I personally don't want anything to do with scam project that people know because of my platform. Anyway, that's one of the reason for it and there are more.",

Is having 2X profit not good? why take the risk of losing everything in these new projects while you can make 2X or 3X profit with coins like BTC, ETH or BNB? I don't understand how some people think",

However, good luck with your rare project.Hello , I care about your ideas and find them valuable.  Of course, everyone is free to share their crypto projects. a free platform. we already highlight DYOR when you review our platform.+We offer many ways to avoid scams when you enter the profile of tokens. Honeypot(explains everything about the token / detecthoneypot.com) scan is one of them. We do not say that it is the most reliable project with the most votes. if our platform grows and has almost +10k token listing. maybe it will take your time, but you can catch a project that will enter the top 100 on coinmarketcap. do not invest in any tokens without doing your research already. not my tokens why should i force people to buy them. I try to offer the most reliable platform. always user friendly.",

Being listed on an airdrop site can gave them an extra exposure. I like how they add extra features such as this free spins and then gambling. I haven't seen that on most airdrop sites that I visit. This can be their main advantage to attract users on their site.I remember freebitco is a faucet site so obviously, this was their main feature but later on they add casino games and sports betting but they also have a thread In the gambling section other than the faucet section so im thinking that this site can also do the same.",

If we add gambling games in the future, these games will not be addictive. our games can be nft coinflip or jackpot games and if you lose an nft. you have to buy nft from another market to play again.  it is not a fast system, it will not be addictive.",
