  "content": "JUST IN: The ticker for BlackRock's spot #Bitcoinâ€¯â€¯â€¯ ETF, $IBTC, has just been removed from the DTCC website.https://twitter.com/WhaleWire/status/1716837831413317965?t=EydGLZZcFp8A-mNL-rlweg&s=19Another FUDs have started to emerge.BTC's rise this time was full of drama and manipulation, first fake news ETF Blackrock then listing $iBTC on DTCC. Is this what whales do to manipulate BTC prices?After the news (https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-listed-on-nasdaq-trade-clearing-firm--bloomberg-analyst-3206311) regarding $iBTC listing on DTCC BTC price was able to rise to the $35K range and penetrate MA200 which means switching to Bullish mode, will there be a fakeout and it will fall back into a bearish direction again?My worry is that there will be many tricks like this that will continue to emerge and give rise to distrust.*updatedAfter the DTCC website went down, I checked again, and it turned out that the iShares ETF Bitcoin (iBTC) Ticker had appeared again. Maybe there are some updates or changes that have occurred there. You can check it too on dtcc.com by yourself.",

      "body": "The recent price pump has been linked to the ETF news right from the time that Cointelegraph announced their fake ETF approval news and the price of bitcoin spiked to the top, which was good news for some holders who were waiting for such a price pump and bad news for short-term traders.Â If this is true, then there are no other explanations than that it's a means to manipulate price. With the positive everyone has in mind in regards to Bitcoin ETF, any positive news in respect to that will pump up price, but what I don't know is if the price will go back to normal as the ticker has been removed or not. But what's normal price anyway? We can just be expecting a stagnant price or a price correction, as the speed at which the price used to move up was shocking to almost all. Let's see what the market turns out to be in the coming days, but I don't think there will be much negative price decline.",

They don't like BTC they don't have investments in it (besides seized BTC). Well, the dtcc site is down, maybe it is overloaded by the traffic. Well, whatever the reason will be. I think more surprises are on the way, let's see where it will take us. I read somewhere that, they might be adding other ETFs' tickers on the list haha, I mean, that's also a possibility but fingers are always crossed in crypto.

I don't think that there will be another deeper fall back that may take Bitcoin's price to $28k levels because currently it is already above $33k and surely we will see another fud that will take the price higher and when the real ETF news comes in then things will change to very good levels. I'm quite sure that we'll see another price appreciation in upcoming days.",

Let's see what the market turns out to be in the coming days, but I don't think there will be much negative price decline.I think it's sideways and a little pump and dump then slowly goes down. Because of this situation, many traders and large investors are also confused about the current situation, a lot of news appears and then after a while it turns out that it is very different from reality, aka fake. The confidence that has been formed as a result of the good news that comes first makes some people complacent, because the price action is rising rapidly here and many BTC shorters are experiencing liquidation and large losses, making them also doubtful and afraid of losing more funds if they place a short position, so Therefore they choose to remain silent or take a long position. Then it was hit with the news that the good news was fake and manipulative so this created great confusion in the market, therefore the market still tends to be stable and has not shown a very fast price correction. They are still waiting for the whales to come out, I'm sure if the whales come out and lots of whales go short there will be panic selling and cause the market to crash more quickly. It seems like someone is still holding back or there are still plans to make a similar incident happen in the next few days. Be careful that FUD will come out suddenly, the Fear and Greed index also indicates that we are in a greed condition.Quote from: Faisal2202 on October 24, 2023, 05:33:46 PMAt this moment, I hope I have some buddy from the SEC department.

A decision that is not hasty will produce good results. There are many reasons why prices don't fall quickly, I explain a little in my post here (top)Quote from: KiaKia on October 24, 2023, 06:12:25 PM~snip~Just keep finding your comfort zone in this space and avoid running after a green candle, there is a big chance that they plan to dump the market even more, but to be on safer side it's better to be prepared for any thing, Correct.

The fact they have it ready and waiting tells a lot about the state of this ETF.I also don't believe all this money that came to Bitcoin in the last few weeks is from normal people. It's big companies and funds buying. Your every day bitcoin trader doesn't have the money to do something like this. We're talking about thousands of bitcoin bought in just one day. When did you last see such volumes? They weren't this big when bitcoin was dropping from 25k to 25k.",

It does create a FOMO, and investors start accumulating; hence, we saw the pump. Adding it without confirmation and suddenly removing it seems unprofessional. If it were for the test or fake, then it was a bull trap by them. DTCC should encounter legal action due to the loss of huge funds.
