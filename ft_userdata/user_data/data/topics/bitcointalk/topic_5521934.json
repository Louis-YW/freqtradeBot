  "content": "I entered the crypto market in 2017 during the ICO craze, a period when token sales were touted as the next big thing. While it seems naive in hindsight, the hype was palpable, and many of us were swept up in the excitement. Unfortunately, the subsequent crypto winter wiped out my ICO investments, leaving me with only experience and a newfound conviction: BTC, the original crypto, was the true asset to hold and it could reach 100K USD.In 2019, with Bitcoin recovering from the 3K USD low, I started accumulating around the 10K USD mark. The 2021 bull run, dubbed the \"super cycle,\" fueled hopes of a 100K USD Bitcoin. However, the market's eventual downturn dashed those expectations. I was unable to sell at the peak, exiting the market in early 2022 around the 40K USD level, still securing substantial gains compared to traditional investments.After initiating a DCA strategy in 2023 with a 100K USD target for BTC, I've successfully realized that goal. To capitalize on this bullish momentum and secure profits, I'm transitioning to a Reverse DCA strategy. This involves gradually selling portions of my BTC holdings at strategic price points to maximize returns and mitigate potential downside risk.Given my average DCA price of 50K USD, I've already secured a 100% return on investment. As a first step, I sold 20% of my BTC and converted it to USDT. The remaining 80% will be held for future sales, targeting price levels such as 150K USD and 200K USD. I'll also monitor technical indicators like the Kumo cloud and uptrend line to identify potential market reversals and adjust my selling strategy accordingly.While some long-term holders and diamond hands may scoff at my decision to realize profits on BTC, I have a clear and strategic approach. By implementing a disciplined Reverse DCA strategy, I prioritize capital preservation, psychological well-being, and tangible financial gains for my family. A 20% profit allows me to extend my investment horizon, compound returns, and capitalize on future market opportunities. Given my risk tolerance and financial goals, I prefer a cyclical investment approach rather than a long-term, \"hold-to-die\" strategy.I would like to know your opinion on this:Have you taken any profits from crypto this season?What is your profit-taking plan for this season?What price do you think BTC can reach its ATH this season?",

Bitcoin has not yet reached the price when I start selling, so I'm waiting for now, I also think that bitcoin will not be able to rise above 150k, and I admit that the growth above 100k can be quite fast and will not stay at the top for long, so you will have to act quickly. In any case, selling in parts as the price rises is a reasonable decision.",

      "body": "Nice journey so far! So, to conclude, you’ve already taken out your capital, and what you have left now is just the profits. That’s a great strategy. Doing DCA is indeed very profitable, especially if the timing is right.I’m glad you were able to sell during this bull run. As for $150k? I think it’s possible, but it might not happen this year or next year. If the market corrects, we might see another panic dump like in the past, unless the market cycle has already shifted.anyway, I'll answer your questions.

Now  price is going up and down between $90,000 and $100000 which is good time for experienced traders to make money from changes. To trade well you need to stay alert and adjust to changing market. You can make money by buying low and selling high but you need to be careful set clear goals and control your risks. Experienced traders can make money from changes but it is essential to be careful. By the way if ask me so I am still holding my Bitcoin. Because I am looking a brighter future of Bitcoin at this time. And I have plan to sell and waiting for it.",

Nevertheless, I can go and continue to save and accumulate more and see how big the bull run will be in 2025.Taking profit to have cash for resolving things in life is very sweety. I agree with you by taking profit partially but will you plan to take profit with all your bitcoin when price reaches $150,000?Price can never reach $150,000 or move much higher than $150,000 but I think if you want to take profit in this cycle, you will have to take profit all your bitcoin around ATH price. You can guess it accurately or wrongly but waiting for higher prices will result in missing ATH range for taking profit. If you plan to hold most of your bitcoin for future cycles, I don't complain about target price at $150,000.",

If it continues to rise I will sell more but never more than 50% of what I own. With any luck I sell somewhere near the top so I can buy back cheaply in the bear market, replacing as much of what I sold as possible.",

Mostly just to supplement some stuff that I was buying but a few weeks after I'd always pay it back. I do have one big sale though before, sold at around 90k ish iirc. Bought like half of it back immediately though but still, half was made into profit. For the big sale, the plan was to sell at 100k by 2025. Since we hit 100k earlier though, changed my plans to a watch and wait until 2025 instead and see if I can sell any higher. As for BTC price, idk, probably around 150k ish max? Not expecting more than that for next year. I mean it did take a long time to go from 20 to 100, I reckon 100 - 150 would be harder (same with prices above 150).",

I don't know the exact percentage but that is more than enough for me. I will use that for myself and families and use it for something I want from a long time ago. Well, speaking about how much higher Bitcoin price can reach the new ATH this season still be mystery and no one will know for sure. We can only predict by our analysis and guess and the rest will be depends on the market. But that will be more than $100k and I am sure that price is not the real ATH because Bitcoin price will still increase more.",

Many have already prepared ahead of that and have been waiting patiently for it to reach there before they sell any of them. The bitcoin market has been on the uprise for quite some time now and I think that may have made a lot of people have a change of mind to not start selling at $100K. With the increased momentum and how it rose fast to reach $100K, a lot wouldn't mind to wait a little more time to start selling, many now have a believe that it can as well reach $150K in this bull run. To be safer, you can be selling gradually as it’s rising, that way you can continue to collect your little profits and not lose most of them when it never gets to your anticipated price for it in this bull run.",
