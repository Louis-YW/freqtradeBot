Thus keeping response limited to humans only.They do have a lottery tho, but only like 3 people will win. 10% of participants might get 5~10 USD worth amazon gift card(depends upon your response)I took the survey, it seems like a study on how people take risks and their socioeconomic status.Probably trying to find some kind of relation between these two and a few other variables(like your education, portfolio, etc)Quote from: LoyceV on May 31, 2022, 04:26:32 PMCan you switch to a privacy friendly webhost?
