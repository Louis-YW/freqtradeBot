      "body": "Nice to see a new thread too, I was getting a bit confused actually with all the stuff going on. Superbru's not working for me right now I went in to check how many participants we had and couldn't see, does anyone know yet how many?Quote from: swogerino on November 15, 2022, 07:13:51 AMQuote from: Woodie on November 15, 2022, 12:19:04 AMWith the embattled Ronaldo of Manchester, can this lad take Portugal all the way despite being out of formRonaldo cannot do anything alone,if Portugal team have a lot of quality players that may help Ronaldo anything can happen because Ronaldo is going to give his 110% as it is his last World Cup and most probably soon after he will quit football because of his age which should be 38 in February.Ronaldo is not embattled, he took the battle on himself, and has lost the respect of so many people. I never liked him to begin with, but I at least had a lot of respect, now I'm only respecting his abilities, I think he has given football such a terrible reputation now from neutral sports observers.Remember Ronaldo no longer carries his team, he wants the team to carry him. He would have helped carry Portugal on for sure but they cannot keep thinking they can win things with him in that kind of attitude. And I bet secretly they also don't want this anymore. Even Portuguese clubs have not offered to take Ronaldo back, what does it say?",

The pool is the simplest since Superbru sends notifications. There remains a competition where you need to make a bet of 0.5 mbtc in each round, plus a Fantasy football competition (I don’t know what and how to do there yet), plus I have already made a separate forecast on how the teams will perform at the World Cup. Totaly 4 competitions, right?",
