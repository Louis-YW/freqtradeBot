      "body": "Crypto debit card platforms offer a limited amount of cryptocurrencies that they are supported, you won't get many options of tokens besides an established one. Since you are seeking for BSC-based token, as far as I'm aware there is no other way to directly connect it, but your best bet would be to use Binance Card. You can see more information here: https://www.binance.com/en/cards.",

You can see more information here: https://www.binance.com/en/cards.Yes but it only applicable on selected European countries. Im from Asia but still this isnt available and hoping it to become available anytime soon. As this will be helpful if our funding page on binance can be used to services or such payment when using their Binance debit card.Maybe crypto.com OP but thats supported limited too but maybe bsc chain also included.",

As far as I'm aware crypto.com cards are prepaid cards that needed to be topped up first, so OP can't directly purchase using cryptocurrenices fund. Anyway, I bet it is likely that any services wouldn't provide to connect their debit card with a BSC token. I think their overhead cost would be much more expensive besides accepting a coin/token that has been established.",
