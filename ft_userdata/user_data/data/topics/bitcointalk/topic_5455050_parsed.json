  "content": "Me Simon Tadros After the series of false accusations and slander surrounding Energi, a victim in Belgium decided to press charges, leading to my arrest and subsequent imprisonment in belgium for six months. For the past two years, I have been trapped in Belgium, stripped of my ability to work and devoid of basic human rights. The authorities have failed to present any credible evidence, as what Energi provided to the police appears to be nothing more than a work of fiction. Despite this, the prosecutor has become consumed by this narrative and refuses to back down or offer an apology. As a result, I have become a hostage to a justice system that presumes guilt before innocence, epitomizing the worst form of human injustice. It is a stark reminder that there is no more oppressive tyranny than that which is perpetuated under the guise of law and justice.\"\"I have taken matters into my own hands and initiated an investigation into the transactions involved. You can follow the details of my findings in the thread belowhttp://[url=https://twitter.com/spuriousdragon/status/1665072317305704448]https://twitter.com/spuriousdragon/status/1665072317305704448[/url]. I intend to publish a comprehensive article documenting how this baseless article has shattered my life, destroyed my company, and inflicted untold suffering on my family.\"",
