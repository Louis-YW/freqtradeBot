  "content": "Since they couldn't suppress Bitcoin, some banks are now endorsing investing in it. I remember seeing that I could buy and sell Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies if I remember correctly) straight from my business banking app when I was working on financials in some company a while ago. Now I wonder, do they just want to enter the market and profit off of it or are there some other intentions? Since they offer an exchange for business users, could it be possible that the system could be used so the government could actually tax Bitcoin by taxing the company investing in it trough the bank account?Maybe I'm overthinking this, but when banks are involved with Bitcoin it always seems like an attempt of gaining some sort of control over it or push it to be more centralized in some way. And seeing more and more of them getting involved doesn't really comfort me.What do you guys think, should banks even be in 'the game'?",

I would say it is done just not to lose costumers or to gain more. Although it would help spread the news of bitcoin more since many people are interested in physical entities and banks involved in cryptocurrency would help spread awareness and adoption to these set of people. But overall it is not a save way because we all know that they would certainly require KYC. KYC, centralization and custodianship of one’s keys are what make crypto centralized exchanges scary to hold or trade cryptocurrencies on, for the banks it even more dangerous because it exposes you not to hackers only but to the government which is against the main purpose of bitcoin. Ones the government decides to take a hefty decision against bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large your funds could just easily be frozen through the dealing with banks.",

Once they realize how to transact with btc and store their own satoshis, they will surely get their btc out of their banks. But with banks doing business with bitcoin, it will surely add credibility to this market especially for previously non-crypto users. Most users who are still not into crypto are still thinking that this market is a fraud or scam, but it is the people who are doing business are the ones who are tainting the image of this market, not the market itself. They will understand this once they got a hold of their own satoshis.",

When you purchase Bitcoin with fiat, the bank will levy charges, and the same applies when you sell it. However, it's unlikely that the bank itself is assuming the risks associated with Bitcoin's volatility. Instead, they may choose to partner or integrate with a cryptocurrency exchange to mitigate these risks. Additionally, if Bitcoin trading is legal in your country, the government may impose taxes on such transactions.",

But of course, I knew that there is no 'clean' business there, you can clearly see that without even getting into detail.I even considered investing trough the system, but luckily I never even brought up the suggestion. Lack of knowledge in some moments is a killer.Quote from: ImThour on June 25, 2023, 08:53:30 PMThat's a great addition as it will bring many boomers to try and invest directly in Bitcoin.

I get that it can be a good addition for increasing the number of Bitcoin investors and growing the market. But there are big disadvantages as stated in the topic, which I think would bring more damage than good to Bitcoin. Are you worried that Bitcoins system could be affected in a bad way with banks entering the market?",

It is going to be a complicated service for a bank to offer, are they going to transfer BTC to customers address of choice after purchase, and if they are to hold the BTC, is the customer going to open a separate account with the bank to view BTC balance, etc, this is why i think it is too complicated for a bank to offer this service, and maybe your bank was only telling you that you can buy BTC on crypto platforms using your bank details. It would also be strange to find a bank involved in moving BTC's.",

Most of them already invested in the currency a long time ago but can't make it public because of regulation and attacks from outside.If your bank is already showing you this kind of offer, then that's a great development considering that the government of that country has reduced the pressure they were using to tackle it and restricted the banks from engaging themselves in anything relating to crypto. And if that's actually true, then it could only mean one thing, which is that both the bank and the government of that country are trying to benefit from crypto.Which is a \"yes.\" They want to tax every account holder using their account to directly deal in crypto transactions because they could easily detect it and tax those using it. Right now, most governments are already feeling cheated since they can't stop their citizens from not using crypto. Why can't they be earning and benefiting from it? I believe that's the reason why they are now gradually moving from the hatred of Bitcoin to the tax and regulatory parts.",

I have always said that the two can actually go exist and there are people here who has a way of working with both the crypto-currency sector and the banking sector.But if the involvement of any banking system would actually cause an infringement in the anonymity of crypto-currency at any point then that when the toxicity is drawn.

Although I feel if there is really advertising like you have mentioned, then it will remove the fear of doubt most people have in Bitcoin, like some new investors will come into the picture, but who knows what the results could be? Because of the way banks operate now, if you have a huge amount in your account and you want to withdraw it, your account manager will always want to know what you are using the money for (speaking of my country). So, I think that's likely a situation people will face if they decide to invest in Bitcoin through a bank. I don't buy that idea. Bitcoin was created to remove financial control from the hands of those financial elites and put us in charge, so we must not still rely on banks to make investments in Bitcoin.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",
