  "content": "The IMF should take it easy on trying to propagate bad news about bitcoin despite having evidence to the contrary. Earlier this month, the IMF visited San Salvador from Jan. 30 to Feb. 8, and two things to note from their visit are, first, that the risks it raised in accepting bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021 have mostly been avoided, and secondly, that the Salvadoran economy grew rapidly by 2.8% in 2022. Now, instead of hiding their heads in shame, they are calling for a ban on Bitcoin or more regulation. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, crypto needs “more regulation.” She added, “We should not take off the table banning those assets,” if regulation fails or is too slow to implement. Too bad for them, the evidence is clear from El Salvador that, despite their status, they do not know it all, and secondly, there is a positive impact of Bitcoin on a country's economic growth. The only point where I agree with them is that any country that chooses to accept Bitcoin as a legal tender should also consider implementing Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies and increasing fiscal transparency. These are my thoughts, what's yours?",

AMLs tend to make every bitcoin transaction perfectly identifiable, like a bank transaction, and that goes against the very spirit of bitcoin.On the other hand, let the IMF say what it wants, they are not going to ban bitcoin, if they haven't already done so, although I wouldn't mind if they banned or put many more restrictions on the thousands of shitcoins that are constantly emerging, and which in many cases are nothing more than pump and dump schemes.",

For example end of the pandemic and increased tourism and attracting more foreign investment are some of those reasons.But of course IMF existing to fulfill American interest should be fearful of bitcoin adoption specially in places where it replaces US dollar (El Salvador doesn't have its own fiat and uses dollar).",

Top voices from big offices like IMF, FED, Federal Reserve, world & top banks and others have always made the world know their reservations about this, which is normal. But the project of Bitcoin is too large for a total condemnation that would cause a total ban, the haters could only rant, nothing more.Still, it's worth noting that as time goes on whether we like it or not, more regulations would be meted out on cryptocurrencies, but banning is out of it. While those countries that restricted or banned it would gradually lift their bans.",

On the other hand, some people are against it with the logic that it can be used for illegal activities. I personally feel that these people who are against crypto have not themselves even tried crypto. They have formed an opinion against bitcoin just based on past bad experiences with other investment options. Thus, as crypto users, we should ask others to start using crypto even in small quantity. Once they have used it, they will also understand the benefits of crypto.",

Thats right. However if your country ban bitcoin, your only choice is to do psp with other people that can agree to pay you in fiat by wallet to wallet transfer or leave your country and go to a more not restrict area and less regulations about bitcoin and crypto. Kinda hassle if you are a normal guy but if your asset worth tons of money maybe leaving is the logical choice.",

      "body": "The IMF has been having a problem with El Salvador's Bitcoin-friendly policy for a while, I believe. It's not about an attitude to El Salvador, of course, but about Bitcoin being a legal tender. The reason the IMF is against it is, apparently, because they believe \"crypto assets should not be granted official currency or legal tender status in order to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability\". It's true that it goes directly against monetary sovereignty, which is \"the right of a state to issue a national currency\" and employ its monetary policy. It is truly disruptive when it comes to traditional state of affairs, but that doesn't mean that the state of affairs is fair and that countries should not give up monetary sovereignty. The point of the IMF, though, is to stabilize economies, it's listed by them as one of the top facts about the organization. So I think it's understandable why they are against cryptos as legal tender. franky1 also has a good point about loaning and how Bitcoin doesn't play well into that.",

In any case, I think the reason as to why they wanted bitcoin in chains is to force the people to these unlivable and only worsening conditions of living brought about by inflation and all these economic struggles. It makes sense when you consider the fact that bitcoin in some countries act as a fresh economic start for some people. Its high volatility rate even working in their favor and making their pennies worth more. This is something that you simply couldn't do in a single lifetime when you're stuck with the current economic system, with the rich feeding off of the poor's gullibility.",

You know that nowadays the definition of terrorism can be adjusted and almost any individual or company or country can be called a terrorist for little to no reason (just because it can profitable for someone?).",
