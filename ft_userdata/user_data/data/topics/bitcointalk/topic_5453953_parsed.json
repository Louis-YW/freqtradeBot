But if you're too concerned with the current surroundings and what's happening in the world then take those stocks that are related to pharma or health.And you know what's best? Aside from the stocks, don't you want to consider buying Bitcoin? It's a no brainer investment and you've posted in a Bitcoin forum so, I guess that you're aware that everyone here is going to suggest you to buy Bitcoin aside or after you bought Bitcoin.",

The volatility of stocks are not only a thing because the nature of the market but also because the mistakes or screwups the CEOs of those public companies can commit. I still recall I was interested on putting a little bit of money on Netflix stocks and Meta because how well the first was doing during the pandemic and the second because the concept of Metaverse. I ended up not buying anything. Netflix was wrong with their viewers growth estimations and Meta's Metaverse was just a badly done MMORPG with expensive headsets.One needs to have a good eye to know whether or now a company is doing sound decisions, before investing.",

There’s no guarantee that the market will recover anytime and give you decent profit while Bitcoin growth is imminent since halving is near and more adoption is happening globally due to this economic crisis.I know that buying on stock market now is really tempting due to dump price but there’s no certainty on how long this market will go dip while you can gain huge profit on Bitcoin right now without being exposed on high risk of economic crisis.",

Especially considering the crises in the banking sector, it is possible to say that bank stocks are very risky in this process. I think that it is necessary to chase a better buying point for a while, considering that not only bank stocks but also the stock market in general is in a downtrend. I think that especially health and technology stocks will offer serious buying opportunities. In addition, when we consider today's conditions, I think that by following the news well, opportunities with better earnings potential can arise in the cryptocurrency markets rather than stock markets. For this reason, it will be useful to follow the news and markets very well.",

I recommend that you buy Bitcoin in the midst of a declining price.The choice of investors when the economic condition is weak is that many have turned to other types of investment apart from investing in stocks.I offer you to consider choosing Bitcoin over buying stocks even though when the situation is like now buying stocks is very tempting, but with Bitcoin we can expect greater returns even though there are those who think that Bitcoin has a large level of price fluctuation.There is an article from bloomberg that you can see how the percentage level of investors in maintaining wealth.",

If you check the beginners thread, a lot of newbies are yet to build confidence in it so when I hear someone trying to move into stock in this age that bitcoin can give higher return, I'm not surprised. To compare the fears they have, they feel that the banks CEOs and the company's management are liable to a failed investment stock and so they may sue to get their money back but this on the other hand shows a lack of understanding of the deflationary decentralised cryptocurrency like bitcoin and halving is just in the corner which investors are expecting at least double of whatever value of bitcoin they are hodling.",

You must be joking We are here to invest in bitcoins, so we advise you to buy bitcoins instead of stocks. Maybe there will be an increase in the share price, but I don't know about that because I don't invest in stocks. I advise buying bitcoin because the potential increase or profit is greater than stocks. And you also have to have a lot of money to buy stocks.",

Maybe I'm just an old fart, but if there are people here who have no clue what the volatility difference is between the stock market and bitcoin (not to mention altcoins) or simply that the stock market is volatile at times, they really ought to learn a bit about finance before plowing a bunch of money into anything.And yes, as I said stocks can be volatile--but overall it's nowhere near the level of bitcoin.  The wild swings have seemingly settled down as of late, but you don't generally see 20% (or more) gains or losses in the course of a day in the stock market, and if that were to happen it'd be front page news.  But that kind of volatility has been seen in the bitcoin market repeatedly, and everybody just yawns.OP, do a lot more research before trying to pick stocks to buy, and don't rely on people's posts unless they seem well-informed.  The fact is that we've been in a sustained bull market for well over a decade now and at the moment stocks are overvalued in general.  So if you buy some tech stock with no earnings or a P/E >25 or so, you're probably buying near the high.  The safest thing to do (and it's been recommended by many economists and financial advisors) is to buy into an index fund that tracks one of the major indexes.  That way you're basically betting on the stock market as a whole and not on a single company.Good luck in whatever you do.  Markets are crazy right now, so get a feel for things before making a move.",

Another reason is that you can't use little amount of money to buy shares,and at the end of the day your investment will be under the care of someone else. Bitcoin has a great potential and can be bought with little amount of money,it can give you a good profit if you can hold for long and keep on accumulating more coins,knowing the market analysis. There is a sure guarantee that you will be happy on your investment. Lastly,you are your own bank and you can monitor your investment and all your profit belongs to you but in shares,profit will be shared amongst investors. But if you feel it is stock that you prefer,then make a research on the most favourable and with low leverage stock.",

Compared to companies engaged in technology, it is still unstable at this time, especially in the sanctions war between America and China, it is even more risky.
