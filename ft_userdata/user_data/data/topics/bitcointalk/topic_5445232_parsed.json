  "content": "Have you ever wondered how \"currency\" will evolve in the future? What will come after Crypto Currency, and ultimately, what \"currency\" will we all \"agree\" to use for transactions?Throughout history, money has taken many different forms, reflecting the changing needs and values of societies. From the use of conch shells in ancient times to the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the evolution of currency has been a rapid and constantly developing process.Early civilizations used items such as seashells, beads, and precious metals as a means of exchange. As trade and commerce expanded, paper money was introduced, first in China around the 7th century and then in Europe in the 17th century. With the advent of technology, electronic transactions became the norm in the late 20th century.Today, we are witnessing a new era of currency with the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. These digital currencies are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any government or central authority, and they rely on complex algorithms and cryptography for security. While their legitimacy and value are still being debated, there is no doubt that they represent a significant shift in the way we think about money.In summary, the history of currency has been marked by constant change and innovation, from ancient bartering to electronic transactions and the emergence of cryptocurrencies. As we continue to adapt to new technologies and changing economic landscapes, it is likely that the evolution of money will continue for centuries to come.-Personally, the development of currency has not stopped at Bitcoin in particular or cryptocurrency in general, but will continue to bring about many other types of currency that are better, faster, and cheaper. One thing I am sure of is that we humans did not invent currency, but rather discovered it, and I believe everything already exists in the universe.",

      "body": "This is what I term the \"payment revolution,\" and this is just the beginning, many are yet to be witnessed in this land of the living. Bitcoin is the surprise of the 21st century, it's a qualified rival to the dominant system and has a lot of rivals that could not even dare to compete with it. It has bridged a lot of gaps and eliminated disparities in the payment systems and more are even coming to unlock with the possibility of the coin itself. Nonetheless, it might not be the end as the OP says, the revolution continues though it might take millennia before another one is unveiled.Above all, they are becoming more people-sided, which is the best against the tyranny in banking and many centralised systems.",

      "body": "My opinion In looking at this regarding the evolution of currencies, there are several possibilities that could occur, one of the possibilities is the emergence of digital currencies issued by central banks, such as the proposal for a digital yuan by the People's Bank of China. These digital currencies will be backed by each central bank and potentially be used for day-to-day transactions.Another possibility is the integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking systems, creating a faster and more secure payment system. This could lead to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and potentially create new ones.In short the future of the currency will depend on many factors including technological advances, government regulation and societal acceptance.",

Today it's a different thing, Bitcoin has come today with some much in-stock for both users and those that are investing in.I'm even counting myself lucky to witness this evolution.",

So yeah, as human evolves and so is the currency, and that is a good sign.And the thing is, with bitcoin, it's like very short span, in 10 years or so, it had gain so much around the world.So just imagine what it will be in the next coming years, maybe we will see the adoption that we all have been waiting to happen.",

Currencies, like valuable stones and objects mentioned, were not invented; rather, it was only discovered in ancient times. However, change always occurs, as evidenced by the emergence of unique forms of paper money and coins. Complex codes were used to create bitcoin and other crypto currencies. We will soon find out if bitcoin and decentralized altcoins will replace the very old centralized money. Anyhow, they can exist together.",

One thing I am sure of is that we humans did not invent currency, but rather discovered it, and I believe everything already exists in the universe.If you are saying that (bold text in your post) out of emotions then yes I can feel you but if you are serious then why would you say that ?I mean, of course we have invented it. I guess you are being little spiritual but think it this way that we are doing something and the outcome is our invention.We did not find the payment system out of the blue but improvised and evolved it.Talking about what next and when as we know cryptocurrencies are newer form of payment system (although not fully legal in some countries).So as more time goes, it will keep evolving and at some point some newer technology or payment system will evolve and that is how it will keep going on.Nothing lasts forever and so the payment system will keep changing too.Quote from: seoincorporation on March 17, 2023, 12:18:34 PMAnd another thing that I can predict is: Digital payments with DNA private keys. I mean, our address will be part of us in the future, and some kind of biometrics will be involved.And then kidnapping people and stealing their DNA to steal the funds. Just imagine what more types of scams will happen in the future. Quite thrilling.",

And with the rise of cryptocurrencies, we're entering a new era where money is becoming even more decentralized and secure.But what's next? It's hard to say for sure, but I believe that we'll continue to see new types of currency emerge that are even better, faster, and more efficient. Maybe we'll see the rise of new digital currencies that rely on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence or quantum computing. Or perhaps we'll see the development of new forms of physical currency that are more secure and harder to counterfeit.Whatever the future holds, I believe that we humans have an incredible ability to innovate and adapt to changing circumstances. So even if we can't predict exactly what \"currency\" we'll all \"agree\" to use in the future, I'm confident that we'll find a way to make it work. After all, humanity has always found a way to overcome challenges and find new solutions â€“ and the evolution of currency is no exception.",

We never expected something like bitcoins, likewise as we are not expecting anything soon, we may be surprised. For the now, the technology behind bitcoin is solid, and complex into the future, it becomes hard to imagine another innovation that will do better than this, but in truth, it is not impossible.",

What will come after Crypto Currency, and ultimately, what \"currency\" will we all \"agree\" to use for transactions?No doubt every technology whether it BTC/Blockchain or an industrial one, never comes to a point where someone can say that's it, no more upgrading or revolution could come to it. But that's just a theory which falsified later. Just like the revolution of the \"atom\" that we studied in chemistry, at first scientists said it can not be divided further but later they came to know it can be divided and there are 3 main components in it which are Neutron, Proton, and Electron, But it also falsified later by saying there are more components in it. Well, the revolution just kept going even today 2 of the elements are still missing in the periodic table. (you might be thinking I started chemistry class here) but these are the real facts that we can use to understand nothing in the world comes to completion. Everything evolves with time. Then why BTC and digital currency will not evolve, now as you asked to what extent? maybe we can use it all over the world by using BTC cards (decentralized ones like debit or credit card) regardless of the country we live in or go to for a tour.There are numerous possibilities that we can not predict but we should think about them, If Banking is exchanged withÂ  BTC then what financial system and how it will be run by governments, Because Gov like control, politics is all about power, and without power, there is no politics and governments. Without money (untraceable) and centralization there is no power, So what will happen to politics if BTC replaces Banks?Â  Quote from: seoincorporation on March 17, 2023, 12:18:34 PMHad you seen the movie \"In time\", Yeah, i was also amazed to see the concept they came up with. Because everything was priced on the basis of the time they have to live. This horrified me because in reality no doubt it's not possible but the idea in itself is very scary. Maybe I feel that way but the upper class lives more while the lower has no chance. Have you watched a series called \"Star Trek Strange New Worlds\" there are many other series and movies of the same sci-fi genre in which there is no money to earn, you can make your favorite food by giving commands in a machine, you can not only make food but other things too like clothes, etc. So how did they manage to give power? the one who contributed more to the community will gain more respect and rank unlike here in our world the one with more money have more power.",

      "body": "With the technology getting to aim and develop more, there's also the counter that the government is doing with the revolution that bitcoin has introduced and that's through CBDC. However, it's likely to fail and people will just have to go with the typical digital transactions made by the banks and other wallets and services that are being offered by them. Today, with bitcoin, it's not just all about the payment processing that we've used to get. I think that in the future, it's more going to be a basis of how valuable a person is and that's through having bitcoin. If the government can't stop this innovation and changes, they might just push people to sign onto their forms and ask them how much their citizens got to know the net worth of someone which is what we're experiencing already through forced KYC in exchanges but it's going to be more than that.",

Many banks today have instant zero-fee transactions available 24/7. So does Lightning Network. What more can you improve? It's impossible to make perfectly stable currency, because everything in this world changes value with time. And the trusted custody vs self-custody will always have their own flaws and benefits.",
