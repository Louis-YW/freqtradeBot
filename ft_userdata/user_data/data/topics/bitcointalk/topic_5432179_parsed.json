At the moment the teams that have qualified for the tournament are: USA, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Iran, Argentina, New Zealand.I thought about your perspective for a second and I agree, Pochettino could be the best choice because both the USA team and he can only win at that World Cup unless they take a lot of punishment during the group stage. But if they get past it, Pochettino can make a name for himself without winning the whole cup. This is usually what he has done with the clubs he was working for so far, but for PSG and Chelsea and Tottenham, second places or vice champion titles don't count. The further they make it into the final stages of the World Cup, the more he will get back into the football limelight. If Pochettino had been a title winning coach for years now, the expectations and the pressure wouldn't match the quality that the USA team brings to the table. I think that is what you meant? I know I rephrased somehow what you said, but the point is an important one. What I also think is that the national coach positions have gained popularity and are becoming more and more desirable. The times that national coaches earn a fraction of the average player salaries are over. More free time, many privileges, a lot of money and the most exciting football events on the planet every few years. There is not much more a professional football coach can ask for.",

      "body": "I think had Pochettino been a title winning manager he could have approached the USA job with a different mindset. Had they hired a serial winner they would have had extremely high expectations therefore having a coach such as Pochettino works to their advantage.Given a choice between managing week in week out in a fiercely competitive football league and taking charge of a national team knockout tournament, many would like to experience the national team tournament. Whether it is the Euros or the World Cup, the pressure is on the manager for the duration of the tournament and there is almost zero chance he will be sacked while the competition is running.National team coaches are paid very well, they have all the perks of free travel to watch games in executive boxes and have many benefits and privileges. In the case of Pochettino, regardless of what happens with the USA team in the World Cup, I think he will return to European football immediately once the competition has ended.",
