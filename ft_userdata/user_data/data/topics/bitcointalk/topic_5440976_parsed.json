Yes, that is something we will always encounter when we first start to enter the world of trading. Not infrequently many people have good experience when they start by getting multiple profits. Believe that everything we experience will be a very valuable lesson in the future, from there we can learn what mistakes we made at that time that made us lose, and make us even better traders.",

I don't know if it's bad or it's good, But it's funny I am sure  When I started to the first trade I had to take help from customer support. My knowledge about trading was 0. The exchange was Cryptopia which is closed now. Customer support helped me a lot that time to make the exchange successful. But the funny thing is that I had deposited a very lower amount (altcoins - I forgot the name) and once I exchange it for BTC I was unable to withdraw the fund due to withdrawal fees lol. Later I deposited again and made the withdraw",

      "body": "I have felt bitter and sweet before in trading, especially in altcoins, where there were lots of big losses, of course all of that was due to carelessness and greed, while my analysis was still new to the point where I even experienced FOMO by buying without thinking about anything else, including getting caught up in shitcoin that fell to 90% due to overconfidence.I was sinking but behind this negative experience it made me think clearer and more careful. I continued to learn from previous bad experiences so that it should not be repeated with big losses trapped in shitcoins and now trading requires strong fundamentals.The sweet experience is that the profits you get are quite large, I won't mention it, but I never forget that when the market became bullish, I took advantage of bitcoin and several other large altcoins.Now more focused on bitcoin which must continue to be piled up until there are more to reach the next ATH.",

      "body": "tradin has been one wild ride for me. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions, but I wouldnt trade it for anythin' in the world. I remember this one time when I mistakingly bought a stock instead of sellin it, and then it frickin' skyrocketed in price. I was like, \"Oh snap, what do I do now?\" I panicked and sold it right away, but then the price just kept climbin even higherr. Lesson learned - alwayz double-check your orders before you hit the execute button. And sometimes, leaving your mistake alone can earn profit. Such hillariousBut you know what? It hasn't all been bad. One of my best tradin' experiences was when I invested in a company that I totally believed in. I watched it grow and grow over time, and it was a long-term investment. I wasn't expectin' any huge returns for a while, but then the company announced a merge, and the stock price went through the roof. I made a fat profit, and it felt like a huge frickin' win. It just goes to show that sometimes you gotta take a risk and belive in yourself.Tradings full of ups and downs, and you gotta take the good with the bad. I've had some awesome experiences and some not-so-awsome ones, but overall it's been a dope journey that has taught me so much about the markets and myself. You gotta find that right balance of risk and reward, and hey, a little bit of luck never hurts either, amirite?",

It must be very painful to see the price skyrocket because you thought it would never happen, so you decided to sell the assets you owned at that time. So luck was not on your side at that time. Indeed, sometimes luck will also be a factor in making us profit or not.",

Correct me if I am wrong and honestly I did not know how that altcoin is in the last bull run as well as now. My guess is it turns to a dead altcoin now.Back in 2018, John McAfee could pump altcoins with his tweets and I remembered people can spend a lot of time to follow his Twitter around his favorite hours to wait for his tweets.QuoteAfter that, I immediately withdrew all of my Bitcoin, and just held it (until now I'm still holding it ).You did it right.
