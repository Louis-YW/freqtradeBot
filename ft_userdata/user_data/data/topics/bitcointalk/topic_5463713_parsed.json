SMF had this feature to enable/disable guest posts, not sure if the feature is still there or not. However, although it seems like it was also allowed in Bitcointalk to post as a guest, sometimes, I get confused because, in some of the very old threads, some anonymous were changed into anonymous. They had usernames too. I can't remember if I had read regarding this prior to this post but as dar as I can remember, it was also allowed in Bitcointalk.",

The username of the account would just be renamed as anonymous.I think you're right. I have found a more or less plausible explanation for the appearance of such users on the forum. I also hold this opinion because I found a post by theymos that confirms what you say.Quote from: Quickseller on April 02, 2016, 04:36:55 AMWhen both the forum and Bitcoin was still very new, Theymos would sometimes honor requests to delete accounts and when he did this he would change the handle on all the posts they made to \"anonymous\" The account that created that post most likely had his account deleted. And here's what theymos writesQuote from: theymos on March 08, 2012, 05:49:57 AMQuote from: BadBear on March 06, 2012, 05:50:15 PMDeleting accounts doesn't mess up any threads, like this thread. It just changes to anonymous, with no profile information. Post stays intact.As you can see here, I only change the username to \"Anonymous\" on request.",

Just abandon it. Quote from: theymos on August 28, 2011, 11:16:31 PMDone. Now only moderators, Donators, and VIP members can change their names automatically. Other members should contact me. I'll probably ignore your request if you have less than 50 posts (unless your posts are very good).In the last three years, theymos has been more friendly to change usernames for cases if he sees fit even you did not donate either 10 or 50 BTC and your name is not in Donations page and list of VIPs/ Donators.",

You can check out the third post in that conversation, where someone quoted the original poster and his username was still there.Yea, I just got that now. As I can read from the comments below yours, I understand how the deletion of profiles happens and all of that, and one of the major reasons why they are being deleted is for security and identity protection. But what's the point of deleting the user's profile if their username can still be visible on the places where they have been quoted before the name was deleted and changed to anonymous? I guess the true purpose is not entirely achieved if their username can still be attached to the post or anything in relation to their identity. It could have been better if the profile was deleted. Even where they are quoted, the names will also appear to be changed to anonymous, although I don't know how possible that can appear to be.",

In the last close to 6 years I have been here I have seen only one case and in that case the username was only changed to anonymous in that one thread, else where, the username of the member still shows.Just changing a username to a new one does not help that much as the quoted texts will still show the old username",
