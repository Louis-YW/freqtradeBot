Apparently, he meant to promote such projects that promise those high-yield scams. By the looks of thier website, it's surrounded by ads. The blog instead ruin the reputation since they compiled a list of HYIP projects. That made them easy to spot. Good job.",

And that is why reason why there is no to low traffic with this site.So I will still be very cautious here, I'm sorry to tell the OP but the site doesn't look professional as well. Guaranteed investment? there's no such thing as guarantee when you market, you are giving false hope to your clients.",

      "body": "I don't mind the name of the site as that wasn't a big deal. My issue with them is I don't believe that their site has good traffic to promote a certain website but as they say, it's not on that site but maybe they will market it on their own various methods. But I don't know how can they prove that their marketing service is genuine.Their site also has tons of improper placement of ads. Not a good site to browse with those banners and ads everywhere on the page.If someone will market their site, why not stick with proven and effective methods instead of doing business with an unknown marketer?",

      "body": "Since your brand name is quite new here, you should tell more about the community, anything about your company's profile, and more details about your offered marketing service. You don't need to publicize everything but much better if important details are already posted. You can't attract potential clients with that kind of announcement and introduction. You should give them reasons why should they contact you.But honestly and to tell you frankly, such offers coming from a brand new account are not really being entertained or supported here not unless you found a way to answer all questions and prove to all that your offered service is worth spending on. Since marketing requires a decent budget, companies will prefer to choose a popular and famous marketing service that will be worth their money, and your company seems not to be on that tier or level yet.",

Try our marketing service the name on their domain is very much related to HYIPs that just included casino advertising because they think that HYIP investors are also into gambling, OP deserves a tag for promoting HYIPs something we hate to see being promoted here.",
