Apart from a new miner on the Monero algorithm, and another BTC rating, would there be corridor noises about other types?Second: if to date you had the choice to mine over a period of 2 years on what type of algorithm would you do it? apart from BTC ...Thank you",

Now bitcoin mining is more profitable than any altcoins, but you should have cheap electricity and the ability to buy inexpensive ASICs.",

Now bitcoin mining is more profitable than any altcoins, but you should have cheap electricity and the ability to buy inexpensive ASICs.I not agree. I get more sats/watt with my GPU´s as an BTC miner.My RTX3070 rig with 12x GPU´s uses with dual mining around 2000w and give me 30000 satoshis (stable for months now) while my S19J+ pro uses 3300w at the wall and give me only 24000 sats and this is declining. The good thing is we can nearly mine all coins direct into BTC with 2miners, Zergpool, (Nicehash)",
