Before you can join a signature campaign you have to rank up first, you need atleast 1 merit with 30 activities to be a junior member, you need atleast 10 merits with 60 activities before you can be a member Rank, you need atleast 100 merits with 120 activities to be a full member, you need atleast 250 merits with 240 activities to be a senior member, you need atleast 500 merits with 480 activities to be a hero member and you need 1000 merits with 775-1030 activities to be a legendary member. I will recommend you go through the link I will be dropping. Newbies - Read before postingIf you want to rank up on the forum, then you should have the mind set to learn or to make impact and not to get merit or make money, if you post for merit sake dont be suprise that you won't really be getting the merit, but if you post freely then definitely you are going to be receiving merit.",

MONEY.Forum tidak membayar siapapun pada setiap postingan yang dibuat. Jika anda ingin menghasilkan uang dari forum, anda bisa join di sosmed Campaign atau signature campaign ketika anda sudah promosi ke Jr member.2. MERITYou can post on any board you like, getting Merit is not as easy as imagined and you don't have to beg for it, Merit will come when someone judges your post really deserves it.As a Newbie, you must learn something interesting and master the material to increase your knowledge about forums. One thing you have to throw away from your mind. Don't ever think that Merit is hard to get, because in this forum there are so many contributors who appreciate every quality post. You can also stop here to find out some Forum rules which can be used as a guide to continue to exist here.",
