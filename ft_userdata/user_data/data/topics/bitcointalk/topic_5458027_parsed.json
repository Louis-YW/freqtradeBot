If you think about inflation, taxes and your salary at the same time, you'll understand how the government eats you alive. Let's start with the fact that იf you live in Europe and have a normal salary, you have to leave almost half of it in taxes. Then, when you want to go for shopping and buy something in store, including food, clothes, technics, etc, you have pay your taxes of those items with already taxed money. Then, the store owner has to pay taxes of the income his store generated. Distributors, who deliver things to these stores, have to pay taxes too. Then there are vehicle taxes, property taxes. So, absolutely everything is taxed and on top of that, our salary is taxed and even on top of that, we experience inflation. This is not fair!So, my legitimate question is, after all the robbery, a person, who doesn't pay taxes, is a bad person for the society or not? More likely I want to get answer from those whose countries have a model similar of European healthcare and employment insurance.",

In general, it is impossible to manipulate taxes, whether by reducing them or eliminating them in any way.On the other hand, business owners allocate part of their budget to assign accountants specialized in tax laws to make it easier for them to reduce the percentage of taxes that they must pay. They all admit that without carrying out the manipulation process, the profit becomes unsecured and they cannot continue their business, especially since the state does not bear the burdens of the budget with them during periods of decline in their work activity, and in many sectors it deducts a fixed tax, especially for craftsmen and small companies.I live in a country where taxes represent more than 85% of its budget revenues, even though the parallel market accounts for more than 50% of the market economy. In the parallel market, all goods are smuggled from neighboring countries, and all activities are undeclared and therefore not subject to tax. Unfortunately, the state is unable to contain this sector in order to preserve civil peace.",

You do not have to evade tax, pay your tax.I think ops have a valid point,  even though the government need tax to fund capital expenses,  this is a clear indication of over-taxation because, from the ops point of view,  there is no justification to pay income tax as a salary earner because, at the back door, you still pay value added tax on your expenses and necessities. The government have indeed robbed the citizens in multiple ways,  just as we have tax invaders as citizens the same way we have tax robbers from the government and its agents who impose multiple taxes on citizens.",

And who elected the government? Its you and your fellow citizens. Government gets the reputation of being an ominous authority detached from the interests of their constituency where people seemingly forget it was they themselves who elected that body in the first place. Yes, it's immoral to not pay the taxes you're entitled to pay. If you don't like the tax rate, the answer isn't to avoid paying taxes, it's to petition your government for a lower tax rate.",

I know that everyone should pay as that's how the system functions and we couldn't live without it as we do, but most of it is really stealing hard earned money.I wouldn't suggest illegal tax evasion, you should rather do it smart and stay in legal circle. If you research enough, you will see how many options you have on being eligible to write some taxes off.Of course I wont pay for something I don't have to if I find a loophole or trick to avoid giving out money while avoiding being in trouble with the authorities.",

First, I like to say that if a country is taxing you but providing the basic amenities needed for good standard of living then I don't see a problem in that since they also account for the capital expenditures and all that has to do with proper running of the government. So apart from natural resources that are converted in manufactured goods to be exported, the government look inward also to generate income used to run the government. Tax are IGR for the government but they have to be moderate because over taxing is more like slavery.So to your question about being a bad person if you avoid paying your tax, there is a line between morality and law. So morality brings your conscience in the mood for you to know good or bad while law is inscriptions charged with offenses and punishment. Therefore If you evade tax, legally it is a crime if you are caught. If you are caught is the word but with morality, your conscience gives you the instant judgement.",

My personal view is that governments should be spending more time on chasing and closing down loopholes that are being abused in this way, as it would be a lot more cost effective in helping to raise missing tax revenues. Just as an example, Warren Buffett even expressed his annoyance with financial tricks enabling one of the richest men in the world to pay the same amount of tax as his receptionist.",

More likely I want to get answer from those whose countries have a model similar of European healthcare and employment insurance.I totally understand your concerns here, and i also sometime give thoughts to same query but you specifically mentioned Europe and I live in middle east so I think we both are living different level of life style because there comes two types of poverty and taxes (I know taxes have more than 2 types but let's talk about only two here). Two types of properties are Absolute and Relative one. And in my POV, European citizens are facing relative poverty and they find it difficult hard to pay taxes but they have left with no other choice and then there comes the role of tax types because takes are progressive and regressive tax. And in Europe countries progressive taxes save most of the people from high taxes. But we live in middle east where taxes are regressive and level of poverty is absolute which means it is way harder for us to pay taxes than the one I mentioned above and now coming to main query.Long answer short: I do not see the ones in middle east as thief if they avoid to lay tax (which is nearly impossible for them) but if they somehow find a way then it is loophole in the system from which they are getting benefit and I find no wrong in it because governments are doing corruption while poor have to pay high tax same as rich pays and their is not relieve for poor then in that conditions to face the situation poor if find a way to bypass taxation then I find it ok there is nothing wrong in it.",

It's like is it correct if I kill a terrorist which killed 50 people. Problem is it's still illegal might not be unethical on your part but in all terms it's illegal. I would rather say do what your conscious says. If it says that it's no big deal then go for it, otherwise don't do it because ultimately it's your share to the community and even the resources that you use. I know it might not be very equitably distributed you might be getting too less in return of giving too much, but this is how it is.",

For example if an oil company is exploring a certain environment, it can also be agreed that they take up some social responsibility like taking care of the environment, scholarship in education to youth in the environment etc while they per lesser tax to the government.
