      "body": "It depends on what bets you're looking for. Parlaying the big favorites (Chiefs, Eagles, and 49ers all to win at 1.75) would be the safe play, but that's just me if i'm desperate for a win this week. Only the Chiefs are playing on the road, but it shouldn't be a problem against the Jets, who recently lost their main QB due to an injury.If you prefer singles over parlays, then the Bengals, Bills, and Browns are worth checking out at 1.70~ odds each, depending on your sportsbook. The Bengals are the only road team between these three, but their opponent (Titans) isn't as impressive if you look at their stats.",

I am thinking maybe putting down like $50-$100 just for shits and giggles. (I never really gamble at all). That's a good amount of money, but I recommend analyzing bets on your own. Personally, $50-$100 is already a significant sum to me, and I wouldn't trust anyone else to make betting decisions for me. Trust me, the satisfaction is much greater when you're the one selecting your bets based on your own analysis. I suggest looking at statistics and perhaps consulting betting forums to gather some tips, but ultimately, the final decision should be yours.",

There are other things that you can use your weekend to do. Do not gamble in the sport that you know nothing about.I have used some prediction sites before but the prediction on two of them is better than on other sites, while some can be good at some odds like under 2.5 or over 2.5. When I was using prediction sites, I still make sure I analyse those matches myself.",

I am thinking maybe putting down like $50-$100 just for shits and giggles. (I never really gamble at all). Opening an account means you haven't tried betting on sports yet? If so, I guess you should start with your own picks. Relying on others would make you lazy, and that will not help you achieve consistency.@Natalim has shared a good forum; you might want to visit it, as they have more active tipsters than here.One tip I could give, don't ever think winning in sports is easy. (That's based on my experience)",
