I am expecting to see the pictures of your functional briefcase computer in this thread. When that time comes we would celebrate your success.

My TRS model III still sits in my moms garage. I should gut the thing and hack a pc into it. Hmmmmmi have a trs80 model 4p,,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_4#Model_4Pnot exactly briefcase sized (more like sewing machine sized like the osborne) and it needs an outlet. but it was the bomb back in the day - z80 8 bit cpu, 128k ram (bank switched) two 180k floppies, 1200 baud modem, 9 inch green screen with 80x24 character display. ran cpm/80 as well as trsdos, dosplus etc.i wonder if its possible to pull the guts out and use it in a briefcase type deal. after all most of the space was for the 9 inch crt screen. mod it to use a flatscreen lcd and a notebook keyboard.. but still need a power source.although it would pale in comparison to whats being considered here.there was also a trs80 model 100 (i have one of those too). notebook sized before therer were notebooks lol. ran on 4 AA batteries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100 again pretty lame compared to whats being discussed here.if this is too off topic, my apologies. but maybe it can spark some ideas.",

      "body": "The nvidia t-1000 came today hooked it in to the lenovo p320 tiny.I am a bit busy today no photos coming yet.This cost was 444.44 for a used p320.it has an intel i8700 tit has 24gb ramit has a 512gb nvme ssd with room for a second one.my big issue is how to battery power this.I will post more late tonight.i actually think i could mine a bit with it.and it is very efficient set to 70%.  It pulls 35 watts to do 15.42 mh this is a nvidia t1000 card purchased rom lenovo. So this is earning 33 cents a day and burning under 1.2k-watts  I pay 17 cents a kwatt  so it nets 13 cents a day if I mine it.",

You're either lugging around a portable power station, which is going to set you back quite a bit or like the video I linked, you'd build your own. I like the idea of building my own, since you know it satisfies the nerd in me, however from a safety stand point I'm not quite sure I trust my skills in doing so. Then obviously that has to be replaced after a certain amount of cycles as you'll be using lithium batteries, which naturally degrade with use. That's what's stopping me from doing this build at the moment. Everything else is pretty easily sorted, even doing it somewhat compactly as well. If the battery could be a reason you're pausing your project, how about trying out this link and see if the nerd in you can do something cool with it. https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Voltaic-Systems-Generator-Briefcase-Including/dp/B008HBREWG&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjn8PLtnsL5AhVKhqQKHZlUCOcQFnoECAwQAg&usg=AOvVaw2p1ES6uUjFQnOxGiHZH3uU.  Wish I can get a look after the invention tho😁😁",
