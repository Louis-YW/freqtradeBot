He didn't even aware if this is also triggering so many governement to yelling about the regulation for the stable token. Even some regulators are thinking of the stable tokens issuers may come from the bankers. I think that that's for a long term but remember that if this can give so many people horrible experience with crypto. They are loosing their life but what was the worst thing other than it? He lost nothing and he can say that but people who have been loosing their life can't say like that.",

Othervise crypto would already be dead after silk road, mtgox, onecoin or bitconnect. No matter what scammer X do. Bitcoin will always be here.Quote from: FMCPAY_GLOBAL on May 21, 2022, 02:42:14 AMTerra posted three new revisions to its revival plan. Their plan was to back oce coin with second coin. It failed. Now their plan is to issue third token to rebuild value for the 2 that collapsed. Its it doomed to failure.",

Let's give him a chance but let's not give him 100% trust, this guy is so arrogant lets see if he change his character now that he is in an uphill climb, this is going to be a hard climb and he needs to show humility this time.",
