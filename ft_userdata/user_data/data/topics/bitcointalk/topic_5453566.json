(You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.You do not need any other installations to run your full node, but it is advisable to run it over TOR to better your privacy. As a full node you also relate to lightweight clients like MultiBit [2] to allow the relay of transactions.[1] https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#minimum-requirements- Jay -",

In my node hardware topic, I show how even 4GB of RAM is barely enough to feasibly get the initial block download done.8GB of RAM are so cheap nowadays that the saved headache and waiting time will be worth it in 99% of cases. As Cricktor already mentioned, the disk size is outdated as well. You want a 1TB disk, preferably SSD. Spinning works fine too, as long as you have enough RAM.",

You are telling me that spending hundreds of $ on a Raspberry Pi, SSD, power supply and everything needed to setup Raspibolt is going to be 'a bit cost-effective' because you may save a small sum of money in electricity?Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 23, 2023, 06:58:15 AMSo instead of using your old computer or buying a new one, this solution is a bit cost-effective.Also 'instead of buying a new one' and 'this solution' (buying a Raspberry Pi) are mutually exclusive.Don't get me wrong; I do like the Raspibolt project and even recommended it to people in the past. It's just that if you don't care about the size and appearance of the whole thing, it may be wiser to build a $50 or $100 node and spend the rest on buying more BTC.",

In my experience, all you have to do is regularly clean the cooling system from dust. Hardware without a fan is even easier.Quote from: n0nce on May 23, 2023, 07:05:04 AMThey are, don't worry.. Exactly!Quote from: ETFbitcoin on May 24, 2023, 09:50:39 AMYeah, just make sure it's not too hot/humid and then most computer should able to run 24/7 with little or no problem.I've never considered humidity, but that might come with the climate here. As long as the hardware is slightly warmer than it's surroundings, I don't expect condensation. I've seen problems with using cold laptops (coming from outside) in a warm room though, but ironically that's from turning it off, not from keeping it on OP has long abandoned this topic, and I don't believe he cares. So OP goes on ignore so I don't fall for this again.",
