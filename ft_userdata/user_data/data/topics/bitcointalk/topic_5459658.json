The decentralisation is not to the level since it's already switched to PoS so the validators are holding the verification authority not everyone who owns the full node.

In order to confirm my transactions myself, I have to become a validator.So I would need to deposit 32ETH for that.How do I protect my privacy as a validator?As far as I know, you cannot put the Ethereum Node behind TOR.Will Ethereum be as decentralized as Bitcoin with the Node + Validator?Or does nothing come close to Bitcoin in terms of decentralization?Thanks You and best regards",

      "body": "Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on July 14, 2023, 10:18:12 PMI see, so it improves my privacy. Nobody sees my IP, wallets and assets. It improves your privacy by exempting the possibility of third-party tracking/recording/linking your IP with a wallet (account/address). Your wallet and asset in essence still observable on the blockchain.Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on July 14, 2023, 10:18:12 PMIn order to confirm my transactions myself, I have to become a validator.Full nodes enforce and verify the rules, they also gossip (share) a transaction they receive across many nodes. Whereas validators, propose a block from and to the full nodes.Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on July 14, 2023, 10:18:12 PMWill Ethereum be as decentralized as Bitcoin with the Node + Validator?Or does nothing come close to Bitcoin in terms of decentralization?Nothing come close to bitcoin decentralization. Proof of Stake consensus is surely unfeasible to achieve the decentralization that Bitcoin currently has.Just try to compare the cost to run Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes.Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on July 15, 2023, 11:19:09 AMIn order to confirm my transactions myself, I have to become a validator.So I would need to deposit 32ETH for that.I doubt that it is possible to pick your own block even if you stake 32 ETH cause as far as I know the blocks are assigned randomly once a committee has been assigned to a block, one member at random is given the exclusive power to propose a new block of transactions. Note: ignore the above part, seems to be wrongly posting the draft.Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on July 14, 2023, 10:18:12 PMDoes the same also apply to the Beacon Node?Are the transactions there also randomly verifie?After the Merge, Beacon nodes known also as consensus clients are no longer separated from the execution client. See: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/Also, regarding how transactions/blocks get proposed, see: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/faqs/#how-are-validators-selected.",
