  "content": "Hi, I have just been limited by Duelbits for playing competitions in minor leagues.I do not have a big bankroll, so my stakes were max 50 €, as you can see here: https://i.imgur.com/ojVjbbR.jpgYou can see that on April 8th I had to bet only 19 € because that was the maximum accepted (Laktasi vs. Novi Grad, minor bosnian league).After that one I could bet only 4-5 €, even 2 sometimes, so I just withdrew (and they required the KYC and this was the FIRST time, but they paid).Moreover, in total I was not a big winner. My real revenue was < 150 € (see here: https://i.imgur.com/rpNmYpp.png), so they just did not like what I played (odds that dropped afterwards, basically).This is the chat I had with the support:10:01 PM | xxx: Hello, today I tried to put stakes on some bets but I get it reduced to 4-5$. Have I been limited?10:03 PM | David from Duelbits: Hello there! Thank you for contacting us!   Please give me a moment to look into it for you.10:04 PM | xxx: Thank you!10:05 PM | David from Duelbits: Our trading team has applied appropriate limits for the time being and will not be reviewing these currently, as they seem adequate. Thanks for understanding.10:05 PM | xxx: Thanks10:07 PM | David from Duelbits: While we're still here, will you please take a moment to leave us a review once the chat closes?   It's a quick and straightforward approach for you to influence how our company provides services so we can improve our approach toward you.   Thank you in advance, and have a great rest of your day!",

      "body": "Unfortunately, casinos limiting users who they think are winning too much is very common, and from what I know, one does not have to win big amount of money or wager a large sum before they get limited, limitation happens when the casino notices that the user is just betting on one particular game series, and is consistently winning.To better avoid being limited, users have to not focus on betting on just one particular kind of sports where the user is consistently wining without losing any bet, try to spread your bets to other types of sports, even if it's little amount the user wager on this other types of sports, let there be winnings, as some loses too.",

Try another bookie instead.Yes, that's true, and cases like this happen a lot, not only in Duelbits, but in several other casinos.Gamblers who win too often are considered a threat of loss for most bookmakers even if it's only in the minor leagues.It is better to use not only one gambling platform but several so that when in one platform limited gamblers can still bet on other platforms or you can also make bets with a slightly longer delay so that when you often win the dealer does not suspect and limit gamblers.Things like this are reasonable in my opinion because dealers also don't want to lose money too often for just one person.",

Now based on what you've seen most you almost always win.      Maybe because of that, their management suspected you, why did they suddenly require you to submit a kyc, you should have just done what they said? did you submit kyc? Did they lock the account or ban it? because if not, just wait for their answer to you for now because that's all you can do right now, honestly.",

But at least Duelbits has paid you and if you are not satisfied with what Duelbits is doing you can look for other bookmakers that provide bets on the league although I'm sure you won't get it easily at many bookmakers because minor leagues don't bring many players either one where they lose money because the victory of the favorite team is almost certain.",

It seems like some online casinos don't like it when you win, no matter how much or how little. It's not fair to the players, but it's unfortunately a common practice. What you could probably try to do is find other online casinos that offer similar games and leagues that you enjoy playing, but without the limitations. Another thing you could consider is reaching out to Duelbits' customer support and asking why you were limited. They may be able to provide some insight or offer a solution.
