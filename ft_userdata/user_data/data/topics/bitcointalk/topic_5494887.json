Although if we think about it more broadly this is part of an attack on privacy, for which it seems to be money laundering anything that has to do with protecting it.

The fact that Binance even has issues with my country has made me almost completely stop working with it, but for other exchanges and centralised systems, my cautious approach with them since they merely \"owe\" me the amount with them and not a guaranteed arrangement has ever made me careful in dealing with them.However, there is no way this sentencing will ever affect Binance in any way, it is now under new management and the operation of the exchange continues to run smoothly after CZ excused himself as the CEO months back, which will not be different now. But what pains me is that the sentence is too little regardless of whether he pleads guilty or not, the 4 months will soon pass.This will continue to embolden these rich guys to launder money, so what's the point?",

Firstly you put binance in the same bunch as privacy services and go on to talk about the privacy risks of using it. What's happening to Binance has nothing to do with reducing privacy of bitcoin users, it's a criminal investigation.CZ pleaded guilty to the charges, aided be investigation and binance has greed to pay fines to the tune of $4 billion, hence the lighter sentence.",

If you support the US government's assessment as being correct, you should prepare yourself better because sooner or later they will intervene more deeply in the cryptocurrency market and completely control it. The interesting thing I see is that millions of users on X are trying their best to support CZ for his contributions to the crypto industry. Meanwhile, on the forum, there are some people who don't like him. It is true that it is difficult to please everyone.",

Some of them went down without a warning. Some gave many warnings before they collapsed. Maybe this is one of those warnings. I am not saying that you shouldn’t be holding any coins on an exchange but think about this: If binance went down today, the amount you’ll lose on their platform would make you mad? If you are saying “yes” then you should lower your risk levels and hold more coins in your cold wallet.As long as you manage your risks the right way, there is nothing to be worried about.",

A system needs to be built, on the blockchain where there will be no way for any centralized entities to stop it from running and it will serve as a dex, all teams will have to get it running and vanish into thin air just like what Nakamoto did, I believe this is the way now.Enough with trying to get popular, the more popular you are in the crypto space the more dangers of getting locked up will come looking for you, the only way to be powerful in this world and stay powerful is to be a shadow, remain unknown, pull your strings in a no man's land.

That's formal but behind the scenes anything can be manipulated to make us fooled. But I don't care that far regarding the CZ case, there is no gain or loss for me personally in investing in Bitcoin as long as I can find my own way. Binance is just 1 of 1000 bridges so we have the right to choose. The most important thing is that our investment is safe, no other party touches it, so there is nothing to worry about.
