  "content": "[ANN] [USDG]U.S. Digital Gold is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform built from the original Bitcoin code, then upgraded to Blackcoin’s PoS. U.S. Digital Gold is meant to preserve wealth against the erosion of consumer inflation. The U.S. Digital Gold open-source project is the first private digital money focused on being widely accepted by merchants through regular audits and transparency as well as a demonstrable stability of inflation-adjusted value, speed of transactions and clear cost-savings compared to credit, debit, retail and gift card purchases. U.S. Digital Gold intends on having the largest decentralized PoS network in the history of cryptocurrency and has made it easy for anyone with a PC, Mac or Linux computer to download a desktop wallet and start staking any amount of USDG for an annual reward of 0.275%.Since tracking inflation to price the U.S. Digital Currency the creators of the USDG Inflation Index chose the election “victory” of one U.S. Presidential Administration to the next as a way of judging the impact of that regime on the nation. Since November 2020 the consumer inflation as tracked by the Bureau of Labor & Statistics has risen ~12.5% while circulating U.S. Dollars as tracked by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank have increased by the same, brining the total inflation on U.S. Dollars to about 25%. As U.S. Digital Gold is pegged to one hundred dollars plus inflation on one hundred dollars the total perceived value as of October is about $125 per USDG from $100 in November 2020.",
