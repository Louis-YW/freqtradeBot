  "content": "TVG Coin and its owners are scammers.The team behind TVG Coin refuses to pay the bounty rewards to the bounty community without any reason.A total of $40,000 in TVG Coins are promised to be allocated to the bounty campaign which ran for 8 weeks.The team did not deliver on such promise and continues to neglect their responsibilities towards the bounty community.If asked through their main telegram group (https://t.me/tvgcoinoff) you will be automatically banned or kicked out of it.The recent known team behind the project and its CEO Rochak Sahu claims he and his entire team resigned due to months of pending to no salaries.Interestingly, when the CEO and his team \"resigned\" and left the TVG Coin project, the bounty community is left with no one to communicate with regarding the bounty campaign rewards distribution since there is no longer any visible team or person in charge behind the project now, just bots randomly kicking anybody on their main telegram group.Add to the fact that the TVG Coin and it's owners owe the bounty manager a pending management fee for a total of 5-weeks which they also refuses to pay up to this day.        Disclaimer: I am only the Bounty Campaign Manager for this project. I am paid only to manage their bounty campaign and post this announcement thread in behalf of the TVG Coin team. I will not be held responsible should the developers/project team fail to reach their stated goals/obligations to the bounty participants, investors, and everyone else. Join (on their bounty campaign) or Invest (on their ICO/IDO/IEO) at your own risk.",
