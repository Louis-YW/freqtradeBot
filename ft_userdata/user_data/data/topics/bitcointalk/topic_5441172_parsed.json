  "content": "So the hype this week was when Coinbase listed Blur. Then we got the airdrop and if you are looking at the Gas guzzler sources you will see that Blur has more activity than Opensea. It also has more volume. And there is another airdrop round 2 coming and they are going to airdrop more tokens for bidders and holders of NFTs.Already there are many people who are buying massively on Blur to get the airdrop and maybe are listing their NFTs on Blur from Opensea. Seems there is a massive fight between these two NFT giants.What does everyone think of Blur? Does it have the capacity to overtake Opensea in the long run? Currently its market cap even fully diluted is like $2B but Opensea was valued at something like $13B so it seemed under valued even with full diluation. Currently there is only 400,000,000 or so token released out of a possible 3,000,000,000.",

People seem to trade there because the airdrops might be profitable. There are countless of sites that have been trying to take over fit in the markets or even competed with opensea and everyone of them have left in the shadow of it. Volume in Blur will be high as long as rewards are worth it, after that people move back to that one place where all the customers are.",

And it would be dangerous signal if people started to trust them more as they have only 21 validators from which half of them are responsible for the network governance.

Versus ETH2.0 that has over 500k validators now.I can not say it on behalf of Binance or CZ but if you follow Binance and CZ Twitter accounts, in 2020 and 2021 bull run, when Ethereum ERC-20 chain was congested some times by massive demands on DeFi 2.0, GameFi and Metaverse projects and communities, transaction fees on ERC-20 some times boiled up to $200 or $300 for one transaction.Binance Smart Chain was launched in that time and they tried to shill their BSC chain like \"The chain for the rich, ERC-20 is a chain for the poor\" and many other shilling tweets. I believe they want to become a bigger and better chain than ERC-20 chain and making noise helps them to get it faster.",

Are there any advantages of using these marketplaces?Currently, the opensea does not have an incentive system to rewarding to buyers and sellers. Also, the opensea marketplace does not have its own token.  But the blur marketplace has its own incentive program to reward all the stakeholders. This is the main reason to overtake Opensea.2.

At least that's what I came to realize...The Opensea and blur situation kind of reminds me of the Uniswap - Pancake swap situation and all those other swaps that exploded into the scene because of hype, especially after the UNI airdropI think Blur could become a very big potential competitor to Opensea, it will all depend on how aggressively they market the platform and the long term goals top sway the numbers in their favour.",

This is the only negative part of the Blur marketplace.That's one good comparison you got there mate. By this, we can clearly see the advantage and disadvantage of each of them. I am thinking that maybe open see will try to imitate what blur currently has because they might be afraid with it but who wouldn't be when blur already had a 2 billion market cap even if they are only getting started.If given some time, they can easily be at the level of open sea in terms of market cap and will be higher than that if open sea didn't do anything to attract more users in their platform. When open sea first started, they also support eth chain only but later on they add other chains. The same thing can be happening in blur right now.",

If Blur will continue to grow, then it can easily compete with Opensea and might take over the top spot. Anyway, didn’t see any new hype with the NFTs so Blur might stay behind for a while now but if the volume continues to increase, then its an indication that many starts to trust Blur and Opensea should feel this threat already.",
