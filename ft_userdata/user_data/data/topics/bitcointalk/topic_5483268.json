This comment made by J. Daimon only, once again, shows his lack of understanding in what Bitcoin is.It seems that what we are now seeing, due to the institutional interest in Bitcoin and the appreciation coming as far as it has to this day, is the \"founder\" ghost coming to cause new FUD. Idea wars...and J. Daimon is insinuating that Bitcoin is one giant \"rug pull\" and is not really going to fulfil the purpose that it proposed in the whitepaper for as long as it can naturally, is an idea that can scare a lot of people. Overall, \"source or GTFO\" can once again be used on J. Daimon. Add this comment to the hundreds of others, it should mean nothing to anyone by this point.",

Sadly, people do listen and do care! “ I'm not saying he's a scumbag just because he's anti-bitcoin or anything like that”.  I didn’t say he was a scumbag because of his bitcoin views (which technically he is as he’s spreading false information). He’s a scumbag piece of shit because he runs one of the most fraudulent companies of all time. As a long time financial advisor I’m all to aware of what a shit company he runs and how much fraudulent behavior goes on under his watch. He’s a scumbag of the highest order.",

Although I don't take Jamie Dimon as a serious person when it comes to taking people's opinion as far as Bitcoin is concerned or even the future of Bitcoin, really. Secondly, it is great to know that Bitcoin is an open-source technology and what that means is virtually all the users of Bitcoin have a control, in a way, over how it operates and nobody has a control over the future of Bitcoin because it's a people oriented platform. So, let's even assume today Satoshi Nakamoto is to come into limelight. I don't think he has a strong opinion or any strong effect on the development of Bitcoin and there are no any back-door control room in Bitcoin. If there was something like a control room for Bitcoin, people with more knowledge about the Devs of Bitcoin must have mentioned such a thing. Lastly, the 21 million BTC cap. It's not even going to happen now, so why worry about it in the 1st place? For me it doesn't make any sense, rather it's coming out from a pessimist like Jamie Dimon. Laughs.",

The fact of the matter is that as soon as bitcoin was launched Satoshi's got no hold of its technology anymore (I think) except for the few thousands of bitcoins at his disposal. He relinquished his role as a core dev way back in 2012 and since then we haven't heard of the guy, and I don't know about Jamie but when I relinquish shit I don't go thinking I could still take advantage of it on the side lol, plus Satoshi doesn't paint himself as someone who's going to do that anyway. It's just these people throwing out weird circumstances that are remotely possible but highly improbable to either throw people who aren't decided if they wanna go the crypto route or give those stupid fearmongers more fuel to hate on cryptocurrencies. I personally wouldn't worry about this kind of shit since it's not gonna do anything for the crypto industry anyway but every now and again a stupid motherfucker's gonna have to speak up and a couple smart fellas from that industry's just gonna have to shut him up.",

What good word, idea or a good sense of reasoning do you think can come off from an anti-bitcoiner? Same Mr. Dimon was the person that made a hypocritical statement just about two weeks ago, when he said that Satoshi will just appear and increase the total supply of Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon doesn't support Bitcoin, and what he only wants to do is to keep creating FUD, but the question is: Could he be the able to stop everyone from investing in Bitcoin? Or can his Word make Bitcoiners to sell off their Coins? No! Is the answer. He is not the only person that has been creating FUD against Bitcoin, and it will definitely not stop with him. It's 10 years now and Satoshi is not yet out to claim the glory of what he created. Now we are in the 15th year of having Bitcoin, and yet Satoshi doesn't think that there is any need to come out. What is the evidence that he will come out anytime in the future? Even if Satoshi comes out today, there is no way he can just erase Bitcoin with just the click of one button.",

Maybe there is a possibility that he will be confiscated by the US government or there may be a plan to kill him that is why he is not coming in public. No one can say for sure whether he is alive or not, so whatever predictions we make about him are all conjecture. Whether Satoshi returns  withdraw his bitcoins from the total supply or burns them after the total supply of twenty one million bitcoins is complete is entirely speculative.

There's also this other theory that I like to think about where he's secretly a fan of bitcoin and that he's a bear that wants the prices to go down so he can either short it or buy at a lower price so he does this shenanigans about bitcoin collapsing, bitcoin being used for money laundering and that Satoshi will rise from the dead and delete bitcoin.",
