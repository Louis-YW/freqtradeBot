  "content": "Hello,I'm wondering how Satoshi has managed to remain anonymous. Governments and high-level institutions have expressed interest in knowing his identity, and some have even tried to employ significant resources to find him, as evidenced by certain news reports.However, Satoshi did use an account on this forum, along with an email address. All connections to this forum logged his IP address/user-agent and other digital traces.His emails also surfaced during Craig Wright's trial. How is it that the email provider does not have IP and other information? Even behind a VPN, I believe that major institutions have the means to request the real IP from the VPN provider.I don't want his identity to be revealed ! But I'm simply wondering how he has managed to evade the most powerful entities since 2010. Even with current anonymization technologies, the most prominent cybercriminals/activists get caught.Forgive me if this topic has been covered or if it seems silly to you, but I am amazed by the myth of Satoshi",

In any case, this story is fascinating.They won't be able to track him because he hasn't left any trace of his doings. Anyone who's a cypherpunk knows how to doing getting caught and such a person would try each privacy enhancing mechanism to avoid others eyes. He was truly a genius and that's why I don't think that anyone despite spending millions of dollars will be able to know his true identity. Even many cyber criminals who did wrong are still not caught, those aren't cyperpunks but Satoshi was, so now you should think on it yourself to see the whole picture.",

Anybody or organization that comes up with the puzzle of knowing who Satoshi is, has to convince every crypto believer beyond reasonable doubt that he has found who Satoshi is. First of all, let Satoshi sign a message with his wallet(doubt it will ever happen). That evidence alone will be difficult to come by. Even if Satoshi revealed himself to the world tomorrow, people would ask him to do that. For me to do that, he's bringing himself into danger and questioning because bitcoin is meant for one to stay anonymous via his or her identity",

With the way he crafted bitcoin, and based on what others have stated regarding its code, it's pretty evident that Satoshi has a very deep understanding of the internet and computers, so its highly likely that he also knows he's literally untraceable despite being seemingly 'close' to getting discovered by some of his close associates when he was still actively working in bitcoin.",

Going back and skimming some pages and highlighting some things to send him to show him some examples of what the book is all about, it discusses all this stuff.  Lot of talk around people I ended up getting to know, getting to chat with, being yelled at (hey Nick Szabo lol) ..just such a fun look back at how little I knew then compared to what I know now.  And becoming buddies with some of these pioneers, and even just having slight interactions ..just so happy to be a tiny speck a part of it.  I think we all are, or at least those who are here for more than just sig money and bountys and whatever else that's money involved.  Sure I'm here for that, but that's secondary.  Anyways, pick up the book Digital Gold, you wont regret it!  (oh and I always thought Satoshi registered bitcoin.org and that somewhere a company had his real info, but it was Sirius who did that at his request.  Satoshi thought of freaking everyting!)",

Unless they didn't even care about the users personality as well.Stop spreading this lie. TOR with default settings doesn't protect anyone from anything. TOR nodes can be easily monitored for traffic, thus de-anonymizing anyone who hasn't set up TOR correctly.We need to move away from .onion routing and use I2P.Satoshi's anonymity primarily stems from the fact that people only began to care and search for the identity after the fact. Initially, when it was just an idea or a meme internet currency worth very little, no one paid much attention to the identity. By the time the majority wanted to know more, many clues had already been lost to time. Additionally, Satoshi's privacy knowledge further contributed to maintaining anonymity.",
