If I am using small amount, gambling to just have fun, I just continue to gamble and never think of it as losses, if the amount I set for that time is lost, I stop to gamble. Next time, I would have forgotten that I even lost.",

If it was a pretty long streak then damn hell I'd be done and just move on to a different game instead, or maybe stop altogether if I'm that frustrated. If I am to ever chase a loss, which I sometimes do, I usually just stay on the same bet instead of changing anything, just continuously doing it instead and stopping whenever I feel like I've returned my losses (if it ever happens anw). I don't chase winnings at that point, I just want to break even.",

Much better stick with your current bet and try to hit the winning streak, but if that not came then stop there are still opportunity to bet tomorrow since you are having a bad day today. Just increase your bet size when you are lucky since this can possibly give you better profits unlike when you are in losing phase where you might lose more money by doing that.",

I know I decrease chance of winning back but experience I got through would be entertaining. And also, I obviously focus on limiting amount I lose instead. Its different strategy.",

I mean that's exactly what I have done when I collected my 2-week signature campain payout on YoLoDice and gambled it on their website hoping to cover my previous week's loss. After maxing my bet amount on dice, it only takes 1 tap of a button to lose it all in instant  .That's what you get for chasing losing bets :v",

Chasing losses is a big problem for me as i intend to double my bet after a lose to recover quickly but turns out that most of the time losing more. I could say that \"patience\" really plays a big role in gambling so if we want to stay longer in this game we should be disciplined and patient enough and not hurry on recovering our losses. If I'm on a losing streak I usually take a break then bet again and if lose again then that's it for me on that day and come back tomorrow hoping that I would be lucky this time and recover my losses yesterday.",

To be successful, you need to maintain consistency so you will not regret it in the end. If you feel you made a mistake, you have to reflect on it and correct that mistake. It's not good to chase your bets, as that's a sign of being an undisciplined gambler, and you know where it will take you based on your experience.Learning is the KEY!",

I remember when I was new to gambling, I also read this strategy: if you lose, you need to double your bet until you get back your loss. Well, in my opinion, it will work because there is no way to lose 10 times in a row. So I've tried, and I experienced my first ever big loss. That idea was really dumb because all of my deposit money was lost on that game because if you go on a losing streak, then it's your end. Don't do it unless you have unlimited balance so that you can still bet even if your losing streak is 100x.",

I don't think if you are in a loss situation it is much better to call it a day than trying to chase your losses, in terms of doubling your previous bet that is a martingale strategy which is a good strategy assuming you have a good amount of bankroll.Usually what I do is same betting amount every time until I hit a win streak and if I lose 5-8 times continuously then it's not actually my day. There's is no good advice actually double down or bet twice can still wreck you. If you're lucky you'll feel it and if not you're getting greedier and greedier.Setting a loss stop is a good idea too. For example if I lose $20, then that's it I'm done and if I reach $100 today then I'm done. It actually let your bankroll grow or stop your losses in a day.",
