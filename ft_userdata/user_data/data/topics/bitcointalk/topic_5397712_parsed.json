I on the other hand had good experiences with Binance P2P, but I am always mindfull of what can happen and that sometimes, even me being aware of that is not enough from stopping scamers from taking my money. It's always good to protect yourself as much as you can, but it seems that even that won't be enough.",

It should be a lesson learn to be served. There are lots of notes and warnings on how-tos in binance p2p though. Idk if how binance can recover her future coin but they can disabled the account of the scammer if proven, also you can report the transaction where you send the $1500 if it's a bank or what.",

For example, if you are expecting a wire transfer payment, don't rely on sms or email notifications, log in into your online bank account and verify you received the money. Also avoid payment methods where it's easy to make a chargeback such as PayPal.",

OP's baby sister may have committed a mistake, but it was never her fault that she was a victim of a scam. The fault was on the scammer's end. And if this is not resolved favorably, also Binance's. Always, it is the fault of the scammer rather than the victim. Sometimes, I feel infuriated that a victim is blamed more than the scammer. Everybody commits a mistake every now and then. Even theymos himself who has been an early bird in this technology has mistakenly sent a thousand dollars to the wrong address.",
