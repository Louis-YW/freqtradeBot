      "body": "Hey everyone,I am thinking about this group buy for the SOL NOCTIS 2019 silver coins, and I have an idea that might add some value to these coins. I'm a designer and I'd like to offer to create holograms for these coins, with a unique and original design that I'll come up with. I'll also number the coins from 1 to 15, which will bring them back to life and add a security feature.This would of course add some cost to the coins, but I'm confident it would be worth it. I'm estimating that the final price per coin, including the holograms and numbering, would be around 120-140 dollars in bitcoin. If there's enough interest, I'm willing to put in the time and effort to make this happen.What do you guys think? Is this something that would make you more interested in joining the group buy? Let me know your thoughts and if you're interested in purchasing a coin with a hologram and numbering, please let me know which number(s) you'd like.Thanks!p.s of course + loadable amount 0.001btc",

However a few things that are on my mind that sould be cleared first:- how do you plan on handling the security of the private keys? Working with someone trusted in this sector would be much apprechiated. Afaik MJ and some other escrows were involved with key-generation and handling, maybe you can work something out with one of them- the design - if I don't like it I am not interested, would like to see at least some initial sketches on the subject- interested to hear other's opinionsThe idea to take a cool coin design like this and turn it into something new and maybe even better than the original resonates with me.",
