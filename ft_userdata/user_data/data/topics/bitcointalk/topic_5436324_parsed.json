That doesn't even mean they believe in them! Back in 2017 everyone was saying price is going to reach $100k just because price was on the rise for some time and in about a month went up 2x.It's the same story these days, just because price dropped for a while a lot of newbies who claim to be \"analysts\" was too caught up in the drop that thought it should continue indefinitely.QuoteAlso, when we look at the fundamentals, they are also all bearish with events like Luna Crash, FTX Crash, Stable coins fund, Gemini and other companies' bankruptcy.Most of it had very little to do with bitcoin or its price although they usually cause weak hands' panic sells.QuoteAlso, we do not have any positive news about bitcoin recently, do we?Good news is not the only reason leading to a rise.QuoteIn these times, the bitcoin to pump makes me wonder whether it is due to manipulation and short squeeze to liquidate many short positions opened on bitcoin?Bitcoin is not pumping (pumping demands a follow up dump). It is rising and in my opinion the main reason is simply because it was undervalued (a reverse bubble) so it had to correct and go back to realistic values.After all the dump itself was manipulation to push the price to unrealistically low levels.",

But this time bitcoin just gain a little around 3% to 1.30% in the last few days, and also did that percentage movement in both directions. So all I can say is the bitcoin is just acting out its normal market movement, and the only event I can point to be responsible for this increase is the US inflation rate that made many stocks gain a few percentage volumes against the dollars in the last few days.",

Not to mention with all the adoption we had price had to have gone up not go down. But when a lot of bitcoin is unloaded on a small market with thinned order books, the price tends to go below the intrinsic value very easily.",

Institutions might be holding longer I think, for sure they have entered already at $15k and are only waiting for a huge pump. Economic recession I guess has nothing to do with this one. For sure they are not dumb enough to put their threshold into another investment which is too volatile.

But this is something to look forward to for this year given how long the market remained on dip last quarter of the previous year.Tes, the markets are fickle and I think they are still heavily leveraged. This new little pump upcould well have been as a result of short trades getting liquidated which in turn pump theprice, which in turn liquidates more short trades, and so on.I can imagine that a lot of long trades have been placed by traders thinking the market is goingto keep rising, which means that eventually they are going to get liquidated causing a fall back.",

Throughout the twitter it is being discussed that Bitcoins will cross 30k usd very soon. Those who were waiting for more low price, they gonna regret. Bitcoins have started increasing in price, and won’t stop till they reach a price correction point. Many are also predicting that Bitcoins will take a pause at 35k usd, but still that’s just an assumption, anything can happen in between. But currently what I can see is that, there are more buy orders then sell orders for Bitcoins. So bitcoins will keep on rising for now.",

Market never gives profits to all the participants.I would say that bitcoin can still dump and reach 12K levels but it will only happen when no one will anticipate for it.

If you take a look at lower time frame, you will see a very volatile, lot of candle wicks green/or red but on higher time, all good, fewer wicks.The breakout from the $21,000 level for me seems the bullish for short term for me, especially since the monthly candle is fast approaching.If we manage to hold the $21,000 level this month, for me this is not a bear trap anymore. A bullish sign for me until the end of first quarter of this year.",

It could be because FTX were selling fake bitcoin because they didn’t actually have any to sell. This was artificially increasing the supply which is weird but what actually happened. This suppressed the price so now FTX has blown up the foot is off bitcoin’s head so maybe it now will start to rise.These are all theories, the only way we’ll know if this is a fake pump is with time.

Expectations and reality often go in different directions, and that was the case this time as well - although even today there are those who think that another crash will happen. My personal opinion is that the price is returning to where it should realistically be, which is somewhere between $25k and $30k, with the possibility that it will be even higher by the end of the year if the world economy continues to recover.Quote from: virasog on January 22, 2023, 05:47:47 AMAlso, we do not have any positive news about bitcoin recently, do we?As some have already written, there does not have to be positive news about Bitcoin for its price to rise, but you, like many others on the forum, do not look at the big picture and what happened at the beginning of the year slips completely under your radar. I wrote a little more about it in this thread, and if you take into account that Bitcoin has become part of global markets, then it is logical that such (positive) events have an impact on its price as well.",

As pointed out above, people were gunning for 100k 5 years ago (not to mention the prophets of 1 million dollar Bitcoin). That might seem like a certainty in next ATH (I certainly think so) but we'll probably hear about 500k and more in the run up. Don't buy any of it.This isn't manipulation, to me. It's just a return to the mean. We'll probably suffer a lot more before proper confidence pushes price back to actual value.",

Besides, we dropped below $19k, which was the previous cycle's top and such behavior is abnormal for BTC to say the least.

It's the only place where it's predicted so accurately. It's actually a Miracle, from our CREATOR rather than price manipulation. And this will continue to happen until the end. If a news a million times worse than the current fundamental appears it will still move up. If $100billion is remove from the market it will still move up.The price movement is nolonger in the hands of the so called Whales. It's in the hands of the one whom Bitcoin serves and obey.  The truth is that If you break free from the Matrix you become the richest and have the ability to influence things including the price of Bitcoin.I hope this truth isn't too much for you to handle. I expect intelligent and open minded people to see this as a possibility. Afterall many believe human could live forever, something that seem very impossible.",
