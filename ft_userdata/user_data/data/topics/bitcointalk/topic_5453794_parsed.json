Or maybe the father is really a disciplinarian and wanted the boy to stop gambling as well. A boy having that much in Nigeria can live a life on his own afaik. Fathers can see where this boy is heading and he'll have a say in the family which a father will not like.",

As for me gambling is not a bad something but the individual can be bad and also the way you present yourself in the society can also tell people about your personality.How do you see the father? Was he right by rejecting the son gambling win?His father's decision might have a religious or cultural undertone. I am aware that some religions and even cultures see gambling as immoral. Islam absolutely forbids gambling, it is called haram. It is seen as an avenue that leads to the loss of wealth. Christianity has no explicit law on gambling but the Bible frowns on making haste to get wealth. The father might be religious which makes him view the win as a proceed from sin. Some cultural views see gambling as an abnormal behavior because they feel it could lead to laziness or even crime. The father is entitled to his opinion. He has the freedom to reject the win. But his action is strange in a country that is going through some economic and political challenges. I doubt if most parents will reject such a win except they are rich. I also don't know how old is the boy because the wins can make him rich and independent. He doesn't need to stay in his father's house because he can buy a good house and live a comfortable life.",

      "body": "Maybe the son is incapable of controlling such amount of money that was why he ran to his father, usually an average nigerian who wins on gambling site can never go to their father telling them what they win from gambling instead they will think of development and investment.To me the father is wrong because they don't know if God wants to use that to bless their household but with the father's behavior they might lose that money. If that the son is living alone and knows what live is I don't think he would ever adhere to what his father is saying because life in the city is too hard to survive, so the father has done wrong by asking his son to return the money, instead why not he said that he won't involved himself spending that money than asking his son to send it back knowing too well that the money wasn't stolen or gotten from a fraudulent activity.",

But in father perspective or if you are viewing this with same ideology then I think the decision is right since it’s based on what’s your life guidelines to determine good and bad.",

The man must be a good fearing man or a Muslim that gambling to them is not part of their faith. If I was in the boy's shoes I wouldn't listen to my dad because he is not aware of how must his son has lost before he could be lucky to win this huge sum. I will use some of the money to set up myself and only visit my dad once in a while because he would never accept that the money was a legal means of getting it. Some persons down here in my country see gambling as something evil and destructive to man,due to their understanding of the term gambl",

The child should also understand that his father, even though he is a poor person, still upholds the moral principles set by his religion and his son should respect his father's decision to refuse the money he gives. Because not all poor people in this world want to receive money from illicit proceeds, even though they need money, and maybe their father is one of those people and to be honest, I really salute his father for sticking to the teachings of his religion by not receiving any money from gambling.",

Was he right by rejecting the son gambling win?the truth is that here in africa this kind of thing has been happening frequently, this is because there are many religions that brainwash their followers, I know that some will think that these religions that I am talking about tell people to return the money they earned in the gambling, but the truth is none of that, what happens is the following:here in africa many religions have lied to their followers that they (the pastors) remove the demon in people's bodies and that the pastors have the power of the angels of God, I know that without a doubt this is a great abuse, but it is the reality from here in africa, so now where does gambling come into all this? just think like this:bad luck = devil (this is the thought that the pastor puts in the heads of his believers)so what happens is that when a member of the family of the person who goes to these churches wins money gambling, the person who goes to the church keeps accusing the person who won money gambling that he is possessed by the devil and that is why he needs to go donate all the money in the church to purify yourself, this is not a fictional story, these are real things from africa, I believe that what would be happening to this family that OP spoke about. in the case of my country, we are a country of people who play these games of chance a lot, we have not had these problems, but in the past there were many stories of this typeQuote from: Oshosondy on May 23, 2023, 06:04:35 PMThe most common religion in Nigeria are Christianity and Islam.

Am from the same country with you, most parents are so religious and they believe gambling is not good, i believe that will be the main reason why the man rejected the money.To me gambling is not bad, but we should make sure we don’t do illegal things just to make money which we will gamble with, some people are addicted to gambling, whenever they don’t have money to gamble, they always end up doing illegal things like stealing money just because they want to gamble, that’s why in most societies they always see gamblers as dangerous and irresponsible people.Quote from: Mate2237 on May 23, 2023, 04:58:06 PMHow do you see the father?

When talking about morals it has less to do with finance, some religion doesn't see gambling as a sin since some of the top religious leaders often time take money from followers without necessarily haven't to know the source of such money, so it left for the individuals in question to avoid any activities that are illegal and in some cases, gambling is not illegal.",

Was he right by rejecting the son gambling win? Gambling isn't inherently a bad thing, but the connotation it brings is definitely tainted over the years of exploit and suffering that most gambling addicts have gone through in the past. They serve as a cautionary tale per se. But I think that's not the main reason why the Dad's not so stoked about the son's winnings. I think it's all about the effort it took the son to amass that much money. For most people that's going to take a hell of a lot of time and blood sweat and tears, which the father is kind of hoping the son would experience (which is stupid lmao I'd disown my father if he's like that). Which then lead to the father rejecting the son's winnings. Basically all the father's aiming for is to have the son see the value in effort and taking the time to gather that much money, instead of taking the easy way out and gambling it. I don't really stand behind the father's  logic considering how hard things are right now, and it's not like the son's going to forget them or is going to ditch his past life over a life of luxury or anything.",
