I am happy you are enjoying celebrating but I have to agree with Rikafip.Quote from: Rikafip on August 14, 2023, 11:21:19 AMI honestly see no point of having this topic in Meta as it doesn't have to do anything with the forum. Since its Pakistan independence day, it makes sense to celebrate it in your own local board and not here. As far as the forum itself is concerned, what is the significance of having an independence day celebration post in Meta (where it was originally placed) or in Reputation where it was moved. Surely the appropriate place for this thread would be the local Pakistan board that has been advocated for quite some time: Request: New Local Board for Pakistan (Urdu)",

Freedom is necessary for country growth.It is great to know that your dear country is celebrating its 76th Independence. Pakistan has grown to be one of the leading economies in Asia. And the nation has upheld her religious and cultural beliefs since after independence.  Your country is great indeed. But I want to humbly state that Pakistan is not economically independent from foreign powers. Any country that still relies on international banks for loans and other financial aid cannot claim to be independent. And from the scanty research I did, Pakistan is indebted to both the World Bank and IMF. Even my country is also suffering from the same external influence because of loans from these international lending organizations. I wish that this independent celebration will lead to the granting of the request of the Pakistani community in bitcointalk.",

No one in this world wants to be subjugated especially the birds flying in the sky don't want to live a subjugated life in a cage. So they want free freedom and freedom to move around in the sky. Similarly every person in the world wants to live a free life, moreover in a subjugated life you will never get any taste of living in yourself. Every country of the world is always ready to achieve freedom even at the cost of hundreds of hardships and blood.",

IMO, it doesn't belong there, probably Politics & Society would be better place for it. But I don't think it would be great idea if everyone would start making topics about their country independence days.",
