  "content": "In a modern world where technology has been dominating in all aspect, new inventions and new technology. Creating of robots in all aspect, marketing sector, agro sector, etc. So in the cryptocurrency space people use robot to predict the Price, gambling and trading of bitcoin. the human brain is made up of billions of nervous tissue, and it can accumulate and store thousands of information. On the other hand robots has a stuck brain, that has been programme for a particular purpose, a robot cannot do further thinking. Robots cannot take the place of humans when it comes to prediction and future telling because robot has a stuck brain and can't think of what will happen in the future and if it does, it will give that particular answer all the time. robots are been programme and it cannot think and act on his own, so robots are still controlled under human intelligency. In a situation of comparison, man is a creative being. humans have the ability to think, the human brain has the ability to think and make multi decisions. And cannot be compared to robots in essence robots cannot think beyond the purpose and programing. making use of robots to predict the price, gamble and trading of bitcoin can affect the feature generation, making the generation lazy in thinking aspect.Conclusion: therefore using robot to predict, gamble, and trading is not a good idea, because the disappointment will be a great damage.",

Because if nah we use our brain take predict anything and e no con work out Wella, we go like try again or harder but if nah robot predict some things for us whether nah Bitcoin price, gambling o or Bitcoin trading and lastly we loose based on watin the robot predict, e go pain us wella.",

      "body": "This is good to go. According to Indian Movie titled: \"Three Idiots\". There place where the main actor (Racodius), I have forgotten the spelling, was an engineering class and the lecturer asked him to define a machine and the boy said, a machine is anything that reduces the effort of human beings. And that also be the case of Robot. Robot is to assist the labour force me of man and it cannot take over the position of man. And whatever they do, they are doing it according the programming chips of the programmer. What about the Indian Movie titled: *Robot\". The main actor created a Robot to assist himself but the Robot fought against him after he has inputted a chip that give the Robot feeling of human being and the robot destroyed things but at the end. Since it was created by human they reconfigure the chips and destroyed it. That is to tell you that the matter di robot is active to help human beings it cannot think like human, that sense of humor is not found in it. Most traders and gamblers normally use Robot to do the work for them though they are some time the Robot can predict correctly but the time of losses are more. I have even seen some reports of some users were using Robot to post their activities. I believed Sir Ratimov had reported such case in the Meta Board from the Russian Board. Robot typings never be the same with human. There is always a different features found in them. Robot repeat itself again and again because there is no abstract thinking but it has one way of thinking. I have also seen someone using Robot to trade forex trading and bitcoin trading. Even to predict. So to my point of view on this robot isssu, since industrialisation with machines did not take over human labour even Robot and the new technology that coming to the earth will not over power man power. Human labor is very much needed in the world. And in all aspects of life. Robot is just a creative art. And anyone who's using machine to predict the price of bitcoin will come back and tell the story. If it was favoured or not.",

      "body": "Don't joke with technology and creativity. The volatility of Bitcoin is not as a flexibility of a nature being.As long Bitcoin is not a natural currency but an invented currency as a digital currency being technologically controlled by its programmer.Satoshi is been trying to keep to an integrity that is why he chooses to remain anonymous so that even friends and relatives no go dey tell am  things like... Baba consider me, tell me what's next in the nearest about the coins market race so that I can don't count lost on the coin marketing parole.I am trying to say that the inventor of the coin (s) are the once governing the frequency (values) of the coin (s) by technical technology programs despite being a decentralized currency and if by any means an external body have a way (link) to invade, I believe he would successfully make it a count to succeed on his own about reforming technologically and may be able to be presumed.Hence, Satoshi would give no such room of invasion. He would do his possible best to keep the website concretely safe and solidly secret by himself alone else there are gurus to invent such A.I's to fit predict the next move of the coins as long it is not a natural volatility.But however, as long as the coin (s) inventors technical programming codes are strong enough to keep off from a second party, then there is no just probability of an AI getting the coins prediction right.",

      "body": "From what I have observed, I can tell that it's only crypto newbies or traders who are being deceived into believing that they can earn more by relying on trading bots. There's even a new trend now where scammers are deceiving new traders and disappearing with their money. What the scammers do is make the newbie believe that trading bots are using AI, which is much smarter than human knowledge in terms of trading. They will ask the newbie to give them money to purchase the bot, use it for trading, and generate profit for them. Some people have really fallen into this scam in my place, while some people too have done things on their own, and they end up blowing their accounts still with the bot bull shit.",

Robots seems to have aided humans innovation over the years but that doesn't really mean that they will supersede the wisdom of human. The knowledge of man will keep on increasing because among all the creatures on earth, human knowledge and understanding is supreme.Cryptocurrencies, more especially bitcoins being a volatile asset cannot be easy to predict it's future as humans and other modern technology like the Artificial intelligence can only speculate it's future but that doesn't mean that their speculations will be exactly the way they predicted it and speculations are mostly done in respect to the current price of stocks in the market and their continuous rise or fall in prices.",
