  "content": "So I decided to have a bit of fun on stake casino. From a little fun turned into a huge addiction. Like every other site I decided to permanently exclude myself from stake. Only issue is that I was literally able to make another account on stake within 10minutes. All it takes is a new fake email and fake name and I'm back to gambling.  I've lost count to how many accounts I've made because I always wanted to end the madness. I would actually tell them hey I'm using a VPN, hey I'm 16 and playing here for them to ban me from they're sites but I just kept making new accounts and kept playing.  How are they allowed to do this? Why am I able to make as many accounts as I want to continue gambling. I've self excluded again but I guarantee that in 2weeks time I'll.be back making a new account gambling. No other site allows you to do this. How will stake address this issue of players who permanently self exclude themselves but continue to make new accounts. I've actually got it down that I'm able to make a new account and play within 10minutes. It's a joke. I'm scared of what will happen.....",

You have a problem that you have to try to solve from within yourself. Even if you managed to exclude yourself permanently from stake and they won't let you create any more accounts, there are plenty of kyc-free crypto casinos where you could still gamble.If you find that you can't quit on your own, get help.",

In this situation, the stake is not at fault since they already operated as a no KYC casino so the sole responsibility is placed on players to try to protect themselves from addiction.",

No casino will be able to block your registration if you are using VPN to create new accounts after doing self exclusion from other accounts. You wouldn't be able to do that if full KYC verification was required during the registration process. But none of the crypto casino does it. You should tell about your situation to your parents. Otherwise tell about it to your close people who can help you to get out from this gambling addiction. You should block the URL of gambling sites from your browser. Although you will have the option to unblock it, but you will get some extra time to think before repeating your mistake.",

      "body": "I really find your concern a bit odd! Yeah sure, you can create as much account as you like, but I think, it is absurd to accuse Stake of lacking an effective self-exclusion program. They operate a casino and having someone to possibly lose their hard-earned money, is in its entirety, their business model. Plus, there is a delay before they can detect accounts with malicious intents.Not being hard on you but, I hope you find a solution you are comfortable with for your gambling issues.",

Further depending on the users requirement there are levels of KYC verification. Here the problem is with OP. When you find yourself addicted and go for self exclusion, further what's the need of creating new account. You can request support team to remove from self exclusion.If I'm not wrong someone could've said when playing with a new account it is possible to have higher chance of winning. And this is why OP is continuing to create new accounts.",

Highly likely you wont be able to as if the amount is truly huge, you might have to go through KYC. There are levels of KYC as well depending on the amount you are working with. Almost all sportsbooks and casinos are very friendly while creating accounts but the issues arrive when it comes to withdrawal. If you are suffering from gambling addiction and the only problem you find is \"its too easy to create new accounts\", you should seek professional psychologist/help. Hope you get better.",

Before you can deposited on your account on Stake, you will have to submit ID documents.   I was surprised that you come here with yourself saying you are able to open two and more accounts on Stake but I do not believe. If you click on deposit on the site, the image above will popup and you will need to verify.Having more than one account on gambling sites is against their ToS.",

If you register another account VOLUNTARILY, then you also want to gamble VOLUNTARILY.Where the OP is driving to is that without stringent verification that it will be hard or not possible to successfully use self exclusion feature on a gambling site. That it is possible you self exclude yourself on a gambling site or your family self exclude you but you keep on registering on the same gambling site again and again because of verification that is not taken stringent, but that is not the case for Stake.Even addict should not deceive themselves and be blamming one gambling site, because there are other casino sites like https://livecasino.io and other trustworthy online casinos that he can also play, even if the sites all support KYC, an addict can register on more than one casino site and this is nothing different than moving from one casino to another and yet still gambling, making self exclusion more difficult to achieve by themselves.Quote from: Prguy22 on July 07, 2022, 06:58:33 AMThere were big deposits and big withdrawls on each account.

I set my VPN to France and just like I am using my IP address, verification was still required.",
