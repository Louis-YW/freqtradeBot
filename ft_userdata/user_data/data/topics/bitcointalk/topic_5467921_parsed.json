  "content": "I think everyone here must be having a telegram messenger account. Telegram recently integrates crypto wallets for TON coins (native crypto of Toncoin blockchain). With the help of the said wallets you can easily send TON crypto to other users within the telegram app.--> Remember: these wallets are custodial so keeping huge amount of fund is not recommended. As of now the list is small. Wallets are: 1:  @wallet2: @cryptobotThese are basically officially recommended telegram bot app wallet you can simply add them just like you join a telegram channel. After adding the wallet it will start appearing in the \"attach\" symbol.",

It is enough to register \"without a SIM card and log in using blockchain-powered anonymous numbers\" - https://telegram.org/blog/ultimate-privacy-topics-2-0.

This is one of the worst wallets that are existing. People should totally avoid it.Telegram has a huge customer base and I am sure that many will use this wallet. Do you think people will install a third party wallet when there is one already built into this app? Of course not. And those who are far from the topic of cryptocurrencies will definitely do this. They are simply not informed enough and will think that using \"Telegram in-app wallet\" is normal. But you and I know that this is not so.Quote from: Charles-Tim on September 24, 2023, 04:16:45 PMThe advice for not to hold high amount of coins on a wallet is about online versus offline wallets, that it is better to have low amount of coins on online wallet.

I remember telegram had some problems with them.When I initiated the wallet bot it showed a video with this graphic. When I actually tried to set up a wallet they asked me to verify my number, which is a US based VoIP number, and then got an error message saying this feature isn’t supported in my region. I guess their solution to avoiding SEC scrutiny is to prevent US users from using their wallet.",

This service is undeniably risky, even if your intention is to store a small amount of money... it's not a good recommendation to follow. As long as there's no policing of scams that are quite common on Telegram, this app still lacks high trustworthiness when it comes to storing money.Let's stop promoting these dangerous things... people who are unaware of the risks associated with Telegram bots might fall victim. i really dislike when someone continues to share harmful things that can be used by others.",

I know that TONcoin boasts a lot with it features and then so its wallet is attached to that boast and then will make everyone seem to care and excited about it. But you know what? If you're going to have a discussion about this wallet on the forum, you'll see a lot of us are not optimistic about it. Why? Because they're even swarmed by scammers that are using their own platform and they don't do a lot to stop it. Such policies need for them to strictly apply but we don't see anything from them. Although they have some reporting feature if ever a concerned citizen finds one. And that's why if they're like that with their platform, how much more with the feature they have that includes financial matter like this wallet feature they have? Seems like a more favorable thing for the people living in there that uses it for their tricks.",
