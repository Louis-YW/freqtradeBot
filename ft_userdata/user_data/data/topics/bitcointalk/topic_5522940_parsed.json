  "content": "From Cointelegraph:Once inside the car, police say Hussein asked to borrow the passenger’s phone because his device was broken. In the second case, Hussein offered to troubleshoot the Uber app after the passengers questioned why it indicated the driver hadn’t arrived yet.It’s alleged Hussein then used his passenger’s phone to raid their Coinbase accounts with a phone-to-phone transfer of crypto and a phone transfer to cold storage.https://cointelegraph.com/news/fake-uber-driver-arrested-stealing-thousands-from-unsuspecting-passengersDoes anyone have any idea how this guy was able to bypass login credentials, or did he simply open the Coinbase app and transfer coins to himself? I would think phone apps would have greater security than this, and again this points to a phone app vulnerability once someone physically possesses a phone. This could be an argument for not storing or accessing crypto in a phone.",

This could be an argument for not storing or accessing crypto in a phone.Most likely that was the case, he didn't have to bypass the login credentials as he could be holding the phone already and so all he has to do is to open Coinbase and most likely the owner had the password save in his account in the phone itself.And with that, it's going to be very quick for him to do the transfer. So yes, perhaps one lesson learn is that we shouldn't save the password itself on the phone so just in case it's not compromised, it might take days for someone to steal your crypto. And by that time, you might have reported to Coinbase already, or change everything.",

Otherwise, such a customer lost the cryptocurrency on their way or due to their carelessness with the Uber driver.",

Some are very self-confident, believing that nothing like this will happen to them, not caring about the basic protection of their gadgets. But the amount that the robber received does not look like a trifle, so the risks were high, even without giving the phone to a stranger, but simply losing it completely by accident. I wonder who the victims would blame in this case, since firstly they should have taken care of their funds and started blaming themselves.",

And of course it's very bad for such action to take effects immediately without the knowledge of the owner and how did he smartly or outsmart the owner of the phone to transfer out his coins. Again, like I know it's imperatively to have another phone or laptop to have their wallet installed then phone should be for monitoring and not for serious actions or operation.",
