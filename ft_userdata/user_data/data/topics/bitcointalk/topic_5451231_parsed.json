  "content": "So as expected by most, the Federal Reserves have raised interest again by 25 basis points. the FED's targeted range is 5%- 5.25% And since traders are already expecting this, it didn't have much of an impact on Bitcoin. And it's still playing 28k-29k$ up a level.Although Jerome Fowel has not said that they will pause the rate hike, the expectation is that it is possible to pause because it is already in the targeted range.And of course what the FED is still avoiding here is that if the interest rate increases too much, it will end up in a Recession which they also don't want to happen. Because the FED has only two enemies here, INFLATION, that's why it raises the interest rate, but as they continue to rise, the banks are put in trouble. And their latest here is the FRC (First Republic was rescued by the FDIC and JP Morgan.So this event a few hours from now I think 4 hours from now it is possible that Bitcoin's value will pump 35k$ or more and suddenly dump up to 25k$ if its minor lower high is not broken.What do you think will happen? this is a type of event that every 16 years actually has this problem due to inflation.

However, it's difficult to predict with certainty what will happen to Bitcoin's value in response to the Fed's actions. While some traders may anticipate a price increase, there are always unexpected variables that can influence the market.As for the broader implications of the Fed's interest rate policy, it's a delicate balancing act between controlling inflation and preventing a recession. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain a stable economy that benefits everyone. It will be interesting to see how the Fed continues to navigate these challenges in the coming months and years.",

If the US was producing more oil instead of having to beg for it from dictatorships it would have less inflation.The fact that it is raising interest rates is not all bad, since it is partly offsetting the excesses of its monetary policy of the last few decades, which has consisted of printing and printing. The problem is that this leads to a catch-22 situation, because if it continues to raise rates it will lead to situations such as the bankruptcy of banks (which have given long-term loans at very low interest rates and are now borrowing at higher interest rates), as well as slowing economic growth or even leading to decline.In the end, the way the system is set up, I think they will have no choice but to continue printing as they have already done by providing liquidity despite the rate hikes. The system is set up this way and leads to a continuous devaluation of the dollar.",

Until confidence in Bitcoin is lost due to some unexpected news or another smear campaign, I think that we can expect to stay quite steady while BTC changes hands from those trying to cap the price, to those who are accumulating it. Until there is another banking disaster (in the grand scheme of things, imminent) then I doubt there is much reason for Bitcoin to continue to exceed the 100% gain that it has already posted this year. At the same time, there is not much reason for it to go further down either, other than the already-known quarterly Silk road sell-offs which will not have as much price impact as what most would expect (due to increased demand from weakening USD)",

I think believing on btc as a hedge against inflation is only good in theory but practically it wont happen. We only started rising from this year because the fed slowly got their interest rates downwards. If they again start more stronger tightening, do you really think btc will go against spx?Bitcoin is definitely a hedge against inflation, this is just simple economics. It isn't an unproven theory. When the supply of one asset grows, the value against another decreases. For example if the USD monetary supply grows 1%, it is 1% weaker than Bitcoin and therefore the value of Bitcoin theoretically increases by 1%. This change might not instantly reflect on markets however economically, USD has grown weaker and Bitcoin is stronger.2022 is a poor indicator on whether or not Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation. In fact, so is 2020-2021. The reason why I say this is because markets were artificially increased by Luna, FTX and their subsidiaries during 2020-21, and then artificially decreased during 2022 during their collapse. This among speculation caused by news that effects markets more than economic principles is why the direct impact of inflation can't be see directly on the market of Bitcoin. If the noise of news, speculation, fiat markets, manipulation and so on were removed from Bitcoin's market, Bitcoin would programmatically increase over time as USD and fiat money inevitably increase their money supply to be able to survive, while Bitcoin's supply inevitably remains the same.",
