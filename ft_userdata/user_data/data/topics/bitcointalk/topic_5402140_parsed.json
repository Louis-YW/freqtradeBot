This person is a Professor of Economics. She is a Certified Cryptocurrency Trader. She has a lot of experience in trading stocks, bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. One thing that worries me is that she has got me reading books on the basics of bitcoin. Also, a book on emotional intelligence. We meet every fortnight to discuss the assigned modules. She says I first need to be grounded in the fundamentals of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As for emotional intelligence, she says it is a key success factor for every experienced trader. After my years of HODLing, I thought I was already grounded in the fundamentals . Well, I must trust her judgment. An African proverb says, \"What an old man/woman sees while sitting down, a young person cannot see it even if he or she climbs to the top of the tallest tree\". In my spare time, I skim through articles and resources on bitcoin trading. Did you jump straight into bitcoin or crypto trading as a novice or did you already have some experience trading in stocks, and Forex before venturing into trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?",

Take care in deciding to run before you're able to walk. If you're getting into trading you're better off testing the waters before throwing yourself in deep water without being fully prepared.Calling yourself a \"certified crypto trader\" is also worrying and I'd take everything she tells you with a pinch of salt (generally, I'd advise you don't trust things until they've been proven to you - if she's got a strategy or a few she's trying to teach it doesn't hurt to paper trade it for a while or trade with lower until you've proven your chances for success).",

This means you are going through the right part by trying to be tutored into reading the fundamentals first. As to emotions I don't think it comes while you are still reading and studying because you have to practice a while before you know how your emotion can function. The process is to read and practice on and of then you watch the emotion and read about it. But there is really nothing you want to read about emotion concerning trading, you have to be the one to train your emotion with time and experience.",

You should've told her the exact thing that you want to learn and things that are related to that because as you've mentioned, you've been trading for years so studying the basics will only be a waste of time for you. You should have asked her the lessons that you really want to learn to maximize your time frame of learning. Trading is a long process of learning but since you have experience, I think strategies and technical analysis would suit you.",

It's the best way to get information and learn about a subject.

I did lose a lot, and when you convert it today, it's even more depressing. But that's just life, and you need to move on.

Jumping right away just because you have money isn't gonna work, especially if you're trading in futures. Cryptocurrency trading is hard, especially in futures, at least you know the basics first and emotion control would help too. Stock trading is hard as well but safer than futures since your money won't be liquidated but you're unlucky if you bought a coin and then it rug pulled, that's why technical analysis is a must.",

I find them hard but I didn't feel that the first time I heard about bitcoin on some PC forums. It is truly amazing that bitcoin is our stepping stone to become more familiar later on in trading and investing.There is no need to learn stocks and forex because we can get the same benefit here in cryptocurrencies. Goodluck by the way OP; please be a good student to your mentor. Always follow his advice as that can make you a better trader later on. To some of us, maybe it is not time yet to get a mentor because we have a problem in financial and we can still be able to learn our own.",
