  "content": "I didn't flinch a bit since I started selling Bitcoin on Monday. This is not because I often make accurate analyses but because of the high assurance I have on the selling for the week. And as my simple chart reveals, only price action, trendline and RSI did the trick and was a good success.It's worth mentioning that Bitcoin has been dramatic after hitting the year-high of $30934 in April. I was able to notice a barrier at that time, which made me draw the simple trendline since the 16th of April, and ever since then the market was unable to breach the level higher and has been a guide for my weekly speculations.I retrained from taking any position when the price action was positive under the trendline, particularly last week when the market was ranging. This happens until last week's candle closed negative below the trendline and a new negative price action was hence activated, which coupled with the confirmation of the weekly chart's RSI.upload imgWhen will the bearish bias last?That I can't say for sure, but as a trend trader, I see further selling of Bitcoin in the near term and the $19,501 (low of March) is the only immediate noticeable target on the weekly chart.Tell me your opinion about this and the current situation of Bitcoin from your angle.",

Exchange analysis and for that bitcoin volatility, have allowed everyone to take advantage of DCA market accumulation which grants most investors who can rightly speculate the market to make constant gains from the market. But we must note that the year is still in its first quarter, And before we make a conclusion on the price ATH price of Bitcoin stamping it at 30900 we should note that there are still possibilities of Bitcoin reaching another all-time high that will be above the last 30k+.",

We arent all aware on whats the cause on the current decline of price but one things for sure that this one would be connecting with the current high fees or that BRC but here's another one.Bitcoin Price Plummets to $26,200, Nearing $25k Mark as Worried Investors Seek Catalysts: Is BTC Destined to Hit $20k?

      "body": "The problem is your downtrend line is simply based on the last few weekly candles, with a coincidental connection to ATH. As you know based on your previous analysis, Bitcoin has already broken out of it's long-term downtrend based on it's resistance trend, even re-testing it as support around $20K. As for why the price has been declining in recent weeks? Because price reached the resistance zone around $30K, not much else.As for whether the most recent breakdown from $27K was a good selling opportunity? I'm not so convinced. Already today price is bouncing from the 200 Week MA around $26.1K and therefore we may not see a re-test of even $25K, let alone lower levels. Of course the real test will be getting back above $27K that could act as resistance, as well as $28K that is now distribution, but overall selling a breakdown of $27K was never clear-cut as a bearish position, but instead risky in an uptrend. The problem generally right now for the bears is that while $27K was a support that was broken, there is still support nearby around $25K to $26K. And if Bitcoin get's above these crucial levels, it could easily melt faces against and liquidate most of the bears who are targeting $15K-20K levels, that I personally think is way too optimistic.",

It’s not a large market but it shows how regulations are cracking down. And this leads to Binance eventually leaving the US most likely.We also got issues with the debt ceiling and there is still inflation and the rate hikes. Way too many issues going around to pick a top but I still think we will grind up higher and maybe top in Summer or Fall.",

We're not always accurate when we predict the market with the chart analysis(TA) and we have to look also the side of fundamentals. Well, right now I guess that the fees have been also stopping this trend of plummeting.And that's because the transactions have been dropping as well but it seems that the fees have gone low and this will make the demand higher again.

It has risen sharply in the previous days, which will force anyone who wants to buy or sell to think about stopping it for a week or two until things improve a little. It is also a profit for the miners, as the blocks are now almost full, which It means more profits, all of which will put pressure on the price to move down a little below the $30,000 levels on average for the coming weeks.Returning to less than $19,000 is currently excluded, so we will remain between 22,000 and 29,000 for the coming weeks, most likely.Binance halts bitcoin withdrawals twice in a day,I don't think it's smart to sell at $27K  as a bearish position in an uptrend.",

I am in doubt that the Bitcoin market will touch $20k, I also think that the market will start to recover since the problem with TX fee is somehow diminishing.  This may change the bearish sentiment into bullish because transacting with Bitcoin will go back to normal again.  But in case it did @OP would benefits a lot in this scenario since he can reaccumulate his holdings and will have a better position and more holdings assuming he shorted and use both the fund and profit to reaccumulate Bitcoin if ever it dips more.",

We can be able to wait maybe because we are just an investor but for the trader, they can sell at a much earlier time. Investors are also continuously buying and stacking more bitcoins while for the traders, they can just buy smaller portions for a while. This dip is not really for us old timers because we already bought some coins before but it is for the newbies.There are still newbies who feel confident investing when the price is rising than when it is falling. For the people who need money, some will think properly if they will sell now or wait. They might look for other options as well, only for them to not sell their bitcoins.",
