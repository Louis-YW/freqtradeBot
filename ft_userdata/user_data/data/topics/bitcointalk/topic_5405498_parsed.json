I want to recode it from scratch in c or py but I need the source code to learn and knowing how they work .regards.",

      "body": "There are only TWO asic mining software: cgminer and bosminer, take your pick, both projects are Free and Open Source Software.If a manufacturer changes it, for example to support their chips, and redistribute it publicly, for example in a control board with their asic miner; they are in the obligation to release the source code. Failing to do so, terminates the license, and becomes illegal (\"pirate\") software. In the case of bosminer, a manufacturer could approach Braiins and negotiate a different license but for cgminer, this is apparently not possible since the 3 authors are either unwilling or unavailable anymore.So, ask Bitmain for the source code, they are obligated by copyright law to give it to you. If they ignore you and you are American, feel free to contact the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Free Software Foundation, they might provide assistance. I believe Bitmain did release code for the S9, so you would need to ask for the L3+.PS: I don't see what you need about Braiins OS with a newer version, it already supports the S9 in the community edition.",

Are you pretending to be a noob? I didn't say anything incorrect, in fact it comes from you (you really love the drama, don't you? Attention seeker?)The only one looking bad is you when you open your mouth. You have still not retracted from your LIE to the community regarding that asic reseller, with plenty of evidence you still look the other way and pretend you did not lie when you did.BOSminer+ belongs to Braiins in its entirety. BOSminer OBVIOUSLY can be dual licensed like SEVERAL open source projects do. Nobody is forcing you to use the + version, you lied for years about the \"can't find blocks\" thing as well. Your passive attitude with the industry infringing cgminer is baffling to say the least, its like you don't even care. If somebody adds code to the community edition and this change gets into the + version, then it would as you say: everyone would need to agree. Take a look at github and spot any code accepted contributions. In any case Braiins did separate both codes before such a thing happened since the beginning.Since you are not providing a complete solution, the only way to run an S9 without infringing cgminer is Braiins OS. This is a FACT, Bitmain provided firmware, which you do not ban from your pool, INFRINGES cgminer. Its literally pirate software and you even took part of it when you accepted a commission from them. The other two authors have a problem with you for good reason. If there were some other minor contributions from others, then add those as well.Kano is seen publicly here asking for the source to fw modders, but Kano is not seen asking the large Chinese manufacturers to do the same, after the S9. Why have YOU not asked them to release the code where they added support to the newer chips to cgminer? How exactly did you got the specs for BM1397?So before pointing at others, point at yourself first and foremost.",

Why have YOU not asked them to release the code where they added support to the newer chips to cgminer? I asked this question a few times before but he usually gets aggressive and avoid answering, I do respect Kano's decision not allowing custom firmware that either 1- violate Cgminer license 2- has no proof of finding blocks to mine to his pool, that's a great moral to have enforced, but he is cherry-picking all the stuff he wants, if he was genuine he would ban every other Bitmain miner except S9 and older models, did Bitmain provide the source code for the S19j pro firmware? does Kano has any proof of it finding any blocks, so why let Bitmain slide but not the others?QuoteYou have still not retracted from your LIE to the community regarding that asic reseller, with plenty of evidence you still look the other way and pretend you did not lie when you did.Any links to the story?",
