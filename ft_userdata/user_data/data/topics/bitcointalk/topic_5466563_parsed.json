      "body": "In as much as I understand perfectly what you mean, I will not completely agree with you on the comment you made on ,no matter the problem one faces, he or she should not sell his or her Bitcoin or altcoin for what ever reason..Look brotherly, life is deeper than what you and I can see, never take anything in this life too serious, because nothing is as important as the life itself, imagine having money in Bitcoin and you are at the point of death in the hospital, and the doctors require the same money to save your life, will you on your dying bed tell your family that on no account should they sell your Bitcoin? That's plain stupidity if you ask me ..We invest/save money, not just for future profits, but that when ever we are in trouble and they is no other way to go about it, the same money we saved or invested , will come around and save us as long as we have access to it ..Now , this is not me encourage us to go sell our Bitcoin on every little issues that arises, No, all I am saying is, don't die saving Bitcoin,¬† it is only the alive and healthy, that can sell Bitcoin, and still buy it back later.",
