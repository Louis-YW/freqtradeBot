  "content": "As per topic title. Over the past day or so the forum has been frequently giving me 400 Bad Request errors. It seems either Firefox, Cloudflare, or the forum server itself is doing something stupid. (It's probably Cloudflare, since if Firefox or nginx were managing to get something as simple as a HTTP GET request wrong then half the Internet wouldn't work, whereas Cloudflare seems to really like causing intractable issues that inexplicably only affect some users on some sites. It's their thing.)Is anyone else experiencing this?",

Got that in the past now and then - very seldom - but not today.I am reading the forum from Chrome on desktop and Firefox on mobile.I don't think it's a problem related to the browser, I would blame the ISP and maybe your current IP address (did you try to restart your router?)Quote from: Little Mouse on October 04, 2022, 04:32:51 PMHowever, not sure if it worths to mention (not relevant I think)- I had very bad experience with forum search as it was taking years to load the search result which resulted in giving up.I've done a search right now, it was not fast, clearly, but not too slow either, but the keyword/number of results matters.However, I recommend you use https://ninjastic.space/search , it does the job better in most cases.",

It is surely caused by your own connection, mate.   I access the forum most at times through my phone but I notice that the connection is slow when I use Firefox than Chrome. Although the 400 error I had experienced was through accessing from chrome. I think the bad/slow connection was as a result of bad weather, because I notice ones there is a clear weather it moves on fine.",
