Maybe there is another reason towards the sudden rise.  The bull circle is expected to take full effect after btc halving but that does not mean the market will remain stagnant. I don't feel left out at all, even if you have not accumulate btc around 16k there is still time to do so since this current price will likely correct. There is enough time from now till btc halving to buy whatever you can afford.",

Bitcoin pumped to 69k from 3k. Dumped from 69k to 16k. The 16k-20k recovery is nothing spectacullar that needs strong positive news to happend. Its just an everyday price action. It only looks like a big move because bitcoin was in ATL in terms of volatility last 2 months. BTC is in bear market for 400 days. 600 days if we skip fake new ATH in Now 2021. Fear greed index show extreme fear for last whole year if we skip few days of fear and neutral. This bounce is nothing strange.",

It does look fake as it suddenly just jump this high while I expect to dip lower than $16k because, in the previous months, it goes that low, I was thinking it may retest that support line again before going up.I'm almost sure that I'm not just the only one who looks at it that way but yep. If I chase the market and buy, I might get burned. The bears who tried 10x on the futures market probably got burned already.",

It is still yet too small of a movement to conclude that bullish market has either started or is yet to start.No worries about it if the money you invested is worth losing anyway and that's usually my go-to rule when it comes to buying more Bitcoin during these times of bearish. I stay away from altcoins as much as possible considering on how some devs back then decided to screw with me.",

We can say that we are not yet recovering as the price of Bitcoin is still below $20k but never I think we drop more. You have read about halving and many people are talking about it because it is expected that the bull market will come next to it. That is why they are more excited to see it happen again and they are preparing and accumulating more coins to make ready for the said big crypto event before the surge begins.

Maybe at the beginning of this year, there was a positive market trend that we experienced so that we could breathe a little easier for a moment because the price of Bitcoin has increased quite significantly lately, after previously we felt very low because the price of Bitcoin was decreasing. However, on the other hand, we are well aware that a price drop is very natural during the bearish era and we must be able to overcome it.Quote from: SmartGold01 on January 13, 2023, 05:27:19 PMJust one last more,  how do you feels with the market? Do you feels you have been left out or possibly you wanna make a turn to buy now since it hasn't touched $20k yet?Once again, it's okay for us to feel a little more relieved with the current market conditions, but we shouldn't get carried away with the next market because we know that the market is very unpredictable. I don't know whether this positive trend will last for a few days, but one thing is certain, if there is a deeper wave of market correction later, we must be prepared no matter what. stay alert and don't panic with the various conditions experienced by the market.",

I think the market was been getting over the FUD. now, it is up to you if you will accumulate more while it is still below 20k. once it surpasses the 20k level, it may go up fast. so better decide now while it is still good opportunity to collect more satoshis. it depends on how you look at this market, either you are a believer or not. we have seen countless times the up and down movement. so if you do believe that it will go up more than 20k, why not lose this opp to get more if you have extra funds?",
