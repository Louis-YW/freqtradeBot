  "content": "Hello all, 6 weeks ago I started investing in HBAR after reading and watching a lot of good talk about the project and its potential.Would be interesting to hear how many others are into HBAR and also if anyone knows the best way of sending it from Crypto.com onto my ledger Nano S Plus? Have done some research and looks like I have to send my Hbar to somewhere first and then onto my wallet but just want to know for sure before I try and do this?",
