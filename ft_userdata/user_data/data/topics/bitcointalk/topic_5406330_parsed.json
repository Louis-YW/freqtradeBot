  "content": "137,000 BTC worth roughly $2.8 billion will soon be released into the market as funds lost to the Mt. Gox hack of 2011 and subsequent loss of 850,000 BTC worth around $17.8 billion at today’s price. In 2014 Mt. Gox reported that it had found 200,000 BTC, but those coins have been locked in litigation until now.https://news.coincu.com/108363-mt-gox-to-disburse-150k-btc-is-approaching/Will the Mt. Gox coins affect Bitcoin’s price? Or is it another FUD in attempt to dump the price of BTC?According to coincu.com:\"...many creditors have already sold their claims to crypto funds. Groups such as Fortress Investment Group LLC offered creditors an early payout of between $600 and $1,300 in cash.Moreover, creditors who do not want to pay early may not want to liquidate their Bitcoin because they want to store long-term BTC. Many of those who plan to receive payment with Bitcoin are likely to store BTC rather than selling it when Bitcoin has decreased by more than 60%. Others invest in altcoins like Ethereum.\"",

But, I think most others that have been waiting years are going to wait for the next bull run. At which point 200000 coins although a large number is not going to matter much as they are not all going to be dumped at once. And even a few hundred or a few thousand being put into the open market over a few days is not that big a deal IMO.As for the people who bought out peoples claims for very little. They are the ones who are going to sit on the coins till well into the next big bull run since they are in it for the money.Obviously, this is all just what I think, could be totally wrong.-Dave",

Those who had btc for trading in 2013 and wanted to make fiat as soon as possible will probably sell. Those who despite losing money on Gox bought back in and remained in the space will probably hold or at least hold some of it.",

Or is it another FUD in attempt to dump the price of BTC?The bitcoin lost means the coin value is distributed on other remaining coins in circulation, this makes the remaining coin in circulation to have more value as the supply in circulation reduced as the lower the supply the higher the price. If coins that has been abandoned for years is introduced back into circulation, this may affect the price of bitcoin as the supply in circulation increases as dormant coin in the past is released into circulation as they distribute it for people. But the question should be 'is 137000 BTC large enough to cause price decrease'? I think it is not significant enough to cause significant effect on bitcoin price.",

I remember when certain companies were buying up peoples claims on their bitcoins back in 2015-2016 or so. However I am pretty sure it wasn't for $1200 per bitcoin they had missing I think it was more like $100-$200. They started buying them when bitcoin was in the 3 figures and they didn't pay market value. I think it was maybe 50% of what it was worth. So if bitcoin was $1000, the max they offered was $500 or so. There is no way they would offer 100% because there is no risk/reward there.These companies most likely have huge profits as a result and they will sell some of these coins to make their quarter results look good for investors. I think it will have a negative effect.",

If you buy, you should only use a small amount.Do not trade Future right now. The market is very unpredictable, the price can be scanned so that Kill Long Kill Short at any time, so you limit Future transactions at this time.Hold Stablecoin. Your portfolio should hold Stablecoin as the main period. This helps you be more active when the market has good signs.Ok, I understand the don't buy now thing, he thinks the market will crash, but then why not trade futures if you think this is how it's going to end? If you're unsure about the outcome then why clearly focus on one way the price going. The last one, hold stablecoin! Because yeah, holding some UST or holding some tether in time of a crash is the best idea, it worked marvelously in the past so it will do now too, especially since they now claim it's backed by some non-us bonds, and guess what, other cryptos.Anyhow, I don't know where did he get the date of August as the start of payments:https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20220706_announcement_en.pdfIn the letter, there is only one August mentioned, and it's not about the payments but something completely elseQuoteThe Rehabilitation Trustee may, if necessary for the implementation of the Rehabilitation Plan and with the permission of the Court, set a period during which the assignment, transfer, succession, provision as collateral, or disposition by other means of rehabilitation claims are prohibited (the “Assignment, etc. Restriction Reference Period”).Following discussions with the Court and in accordance with the Rehabilitation Plan, the Rehabilitation Trustee plans to set the Assignment, etc. Restriction Reference Period from approximately the end of August this year until all or part of the repayments made as initial repayments is completed for safe and secure Repayments.",

If the former users of Mt.Gox don't receive compensation in August, then this month there should not be strong fluctuations in bitcoin price. But someday they will still be sent bitcoins and something tells me that most of the Mt.Gox former users will easily sell their BTC. I think so, because quite a lot of time has passed and people are tired of waiting for their money back. Despite the current drop in the value of bitcoin, this still allows for a very good profit. Which in turn will encourage people to sell btc even now. 200.000BTC is unlikely to be sold at once, but most likely this is the fate that awaits most of this. Perhaps these sales will not affect the value of bitcoin much, but may serve as a trigger for panic selling of other investors. So, I assume that the compensation to the Mt.Gox users will negatively affect the situation on the cryptomarket in one way or another.cитyaцию нa pынкe.",

So all this MtGox coins \"drama\" is somehow thrown out whenever somebody wants bitcoin traders be uneasy. It has happened before and it may happen in the future too.The \"when\" matters a lot. As Franky said here, the chance is very high that it will take quite a long time until all the funds are sent out (from the moment they start sending). If 200k BTC is sold in a month or two that would be only some 3-7k BTC per day, which is not a big deal. Of course, it depends if this happens in a bull market or bear market.While there's indeed a good chance many of those people will sell their coins (my take is 50% of the people though), I expect many are smart enough to wait for the price to recover and sell for much better price in a year or two. Since they've been waiting for so long, they may know already what patience is.So I expect the sales will be actually scattered over many months (or years).",
