Even when you stuff like: \"hey look at this project, what do you think? Is it a scam?\" This isn't a new way, but it's clever, since it doesn't sound like advertising but it brings traffic because post sounds skeptical.Your take isn't that smart as you are saying \"minimum 5x\". I am hoping you won't get paid for this low effort spam.imho newbie accounts sharing links should be banned here.",

Buy during presale can be very profitable but also you need to understand that the team can easily do away with the funds at anytime if they have the intension to scam investment. You are not part of the team and I am surprised the way you are so confident about the project trying to convince us to invest without any concrete proof that investing in the project will worth it.",

The best thing you could do for yourself for projects like this if they're exceptionally hyped is to get in and get out as fast as possible because when you start getting comfortable that's when you'll most likely lose. These kind of projects have no fundamentals or utilities so you should keep that in mind as you interact with them.",

It's clear that you are being driven by the hype and now under the spell of being FOMO because of what you saw but still you want to push for it.When you are expecting a x5, x10, x15 in a project, basically you are being hyped, not because of the project's potential but for what their community is being vocal about. And you talk about huge marketing but the name of the said project doesn't even ring the bell.",

But to answer your question, and because there might also be others who are reading this thread, let's just suppose that you're really looking for opinions. I'd say it's just good that you missed it. Presales could easily be manipulated. Also, you think 97.25 ETH makes it successful? That's a very small amount for a trusted and reliable project. Forget about the rumors. They're called rumors for a reason. Use your money to buy the topmost cryptocurrencies. That's the thing that you shouldn't miss especially during this bear market.",
