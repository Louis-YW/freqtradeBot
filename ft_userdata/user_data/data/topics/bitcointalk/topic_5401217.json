But can actually be seen as going in the same.In what is known as upstate NY there is a lot of green energy and such. Almost total usage.HOWEVER, it is not that populated and does not have that much industry as compared to the rest of the state.Or to put in another way. NY has about 20 million people living in about 55,000 square miles (145,000 km2) [approx numbers]Long Island is 1400 of those square miles with 8 million of those people living thereManhattan is 24 square miles with 1.7 million peopleThe Bronx and Staten Island are about another 2 million people living in 175 square miles.So more then 1/2 the population lives in less the 10% of the space.Very little green power is generated here just due to the amounts needed and lack of space. The rest of NY can get away with hydro and other greener sources.In order to meet green goals they are trying to make sure that what is built does come in and stay green.So they are pushing the tech end so to speak: https://fortune.com/2022/02/01/new-york-city-silicon-valley-cryptocurrency-startup-funding/While trying to also keep mining clean.Will it work? No idea, get back to me in a couple of years and I'll let you know :-)-Dave",

Despite company B using during the night all the hydropower they are not labeled as green since they don't have a contract that stipulates the source!So basically all I have to be green is for my company to have a contract for all the power with a green producer and that producer to deliver that quantity to the grid, it doens't have to be the same energy at the same hours at the production and same quantity!Quote from: DaveF on June 04, 2022, 11:59:59 AMIn what is known as upstate NY there is a lot of green energy and such.

I was living under the impression a lot of that green one comes from Canada?  You are credited in green for what you bought not what you received. Since power is fungible so long as 100Mwh of green is going into the grid that you paid for and in theory could be delivered to you it's all good.As for power from Canada, I don't know. Not sure if all the Niagara Falls power is US or US / Canada mixed. As far as I ever knew the US power grid is separate from the Canadian power grid, but I never really paid attention as to where it comes from so I could be wrong on that. -Dave",

It appears that we might only be again the victims of mainstream media's favorite part of their job. This is to have news readers click their clickbait hehehe. It also appears that the mainstream news media is beginning their mining uses too much energy storylines again. I speculate that because of higher energy prices, many politicians might start campaigning for the ban of miners in America and it will get the support of much of the public.",

This isn't the first time it has been hot in Texas, and there were major issues with the electrical system just last year. Given the political climate, I don't think it is any surprise there are regulations being implemented on mining in New York. I think the crackdowns on miners in China was a legitimate surprise, but the crackdown in places such as New York, and the rationing of electricity in Texas is just poor planning on the part of miners who are mining there.",

I am quite certain there are factories and manufacturers that are also affected by the higher electricity costs. I reckon depending on their 12 month projection, they can get a loan from a bank to support their cashflow until conditions for mining become more optimistic again. However, the problem might be many banks might not want to take the risk of giving a loan to a company that mines a volatile speculative asset.",
