  "content": "Since May of last year, I have had the opportunity to rest and watch my surroundings and society. One thing I have noticed is that an increasing number of users are depending on computers as a source of income. Some of my neighbors, including some of mine, have begun working from home as virtual assistants, while others are advertising their services and selling goods online. It took me back to a period when I was still looking for job chances online and individuals still worked outside their home. I was curious at that moment and wondered if it was possible to make money while using a computer or if there were any opportunities. After several times searching, I came across this forum and started to do some odd jobs and services here. At one point, I thought that \"is there any other platforms in which I could work and still get paid by bitcoin?\". I did my research back then and found some platforms that offer such salaries, but of course I didn't try to work there since I am also hesitant if what they are offering is actually true, nevertheless I didn't bother proving the point of earning on those platforms. Why would I? When during those times there're so many phishing sites on a loose, one of my friends also lost a lot of his altcoins kept from his MEW due to such schemes.After reminiscing those years, I suddenly remembered a question that bothered me before. It was the same question back in the day, and since today's age is mostly inclined towards computer and modern technology, I was wondering if there jobs that offers to pay crypto?When I returned from my sweet vacation, I have noticed that there have been only a few campaigns running and there aren't that much jobs I see here on this forum, and so it makes me wonder if the question I have in mind few years ago would be answered today. I am already aware that there'd be people who'd say \"there're so many out there, you'll just have to find out\". I had learnt it a hard way that in this forum there's no such thing as spoon feeding that's why I took my time the other day to look for those said jobs.So if ever one of you guys know such jobs or sites, can you list me what's your favorite ones?",

I know that there're groups that hires moderators in discord or in telegram and being paid by their personal tokens or it could even be either bitcoin or fiat. IMO I would also choose fiat to pay as a salary for those jobs knowing that the volatility of crypto is unexpected. It would be a lie if I say that it could go to waste or it could become undervalued. In the end both the employee and the employer would have to decide which mode of payment they will opt, to ensure that both parties accepted the risk.",

Or, if you do any sort of freelance, you can try to tell clients that they can pay you in Bitcoin, but I supppose it depends on the kind of people you deal with and how popular cryptos are in your country. It doesn't usually work out for me because people normally don't know what Bitcoin is or how to pay with it and prefer the good old fiat (cash or card). Also, sometimes you might not want people to know that you accept Bitcoin because then they might think you must be rich and try to steal your coins or decide they want to pay you less because you don't need money. So it's all a bit tricky. I've spent Bitcoin on things but I don't remember earning it, excluding sig campaigns.",

If I wanted to, I could just google it all the way, but the question is, \"is it reliable?\"Ask yourself, why these gambling companies spend so much money weekly on signature campaigns? they are looking for jobs; clienteles. The internet of today is about growth. Many people work as VAs to make some funds to sponsor their project or job search campaign. Haven't you seen job seekers that launch a landing page for the sake of getting hired? they run ads on google to get their target audience. You mustn't depend alone on the forum to get cryptocurrency related jobs. Quite correct, they are jobs on the service section, but these people who tend to hire you knows the market price per week for some tasks. Compared to those you get on google ads who don't know much about the cryptocurrency market, all they need is solution and they pay you handsomely. Quora is a good place to get such clients, always look out for places where they're a huge variety of people not just marketers. Get your audience there and move on. What matters is the quality of your service. For instance, getting a community moderator job on this forum is averaged at $50 per week but, that'll be far better when you get the job through google ads launched by you; working directly with the source, or joining startups.",
