Bitcoin was created as decentralized digital currency and it was meant nto be as anonymous to everyone and if it is in this nature then the creators of it should also be anonymous. Gavin Andresen is not different from other fabricated stories. Did Satoshi Nakamoto offended anyone when he was creating Bitcoin? No. So why Gavin Andresen would visit him with CIA. Well since the creation of Bitcoin, there different stories around it so this is one of them.",

You can’t even tell if it’s an individual or some organization but, you could as well keep calm about the pseudo nature of Satoshi Nakamoto and learn about;what is Bitcoin,how it’s utilized,how to remain private about running your wallet and all, andhow not to get scammed as well.These are of the most importance to you than looking out for;What could be the real nature of Satoshi.You would be waiting precious time that could serve you better.While I would be so bold to tell you that I don’t know whom or what nature Satoshi might be, I would like you to know that, it sure ain’t Craig S.

At this point, after all those years of investigating who Satoshi Nakamoto is, nobody will take guesses seriously anymore.

If only one country allows Bitcoin and there are a couple of running nodes, Bitcoin will survive. I don't think all the countries will agree to ban or block Bitcoin. Some countries are working on adopting Bitcoin and companies adopting Bitcoin as well. If only El Salvador does not agree to ban Bitcoin, it's enough for Bitcoin to be active. We don't need 15K active nodes. Indeed more blocks make the network stronger. But that does not mean we need them to keep running Bitcoin. The government can't shut down Bitcoin. Or else, they could have done this a decade ago when Bitcoin was slowly growing. They were unable to shut it down back then, now it's not possible anymore.",
