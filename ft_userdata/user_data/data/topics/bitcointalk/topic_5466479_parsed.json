And like other speculators, Michael Saylor isn't saying when that will happen because he doesn't know for sure either.And after the halving, more and more people will say their predictions about the high price of Bitcoin. They want to prove that their predictions are correct to use the situation to gain more followers.For this end of the year, we may already hear predictions of what the price of Bitcoin will be for the end of the year and we just have to look and wait at it. Bitcoin may end up at $ 30k- $ 40k for the end of the year or it could be higher than that price or even lower. And with the decline this time, it has already panicked people.",

We're investing with the little money we make, so I think the more realistic we are, the safer things will be. Instead of waiting and hoping that bitcoin will hit $1 million, $5 million or $100 million. I expect bitcoin to surpass $100k or $150k in the next bull cycle, and making higher predictions requires a specific assessment of the market situation. I don't see any point in making such delusional predictions.",

His predictions reminds me of MCAfee prediction by bitcoin going to a $1M or so.Can it go to $5M. Sure it’s possible however it won’t be anytime soon. We got a nasty recession ahead of us and nobody will be buying digital assets or stocks with inflation so high.",

It may happen, but not for decades.But in any case, if the news is true, perhaps Michael Saylor is deliberately saying this to give some optimism and boost the price of Bitcoin at this downward time. These fiery statements give optimism to investors in the long term, especially if they are from influential figures in the world of Bitcoin.",

He says that bitcoin is going to acquire practically all the market cap of other financial assets, first gold, then bonds, and even the real state investment market. I don't know, he went from not believing in bitcoin to believing that bitcoin is like God's creation. I don't think so much or so little.",

Once the positive news disappears and the negative news and panic rise, it will be the beginning of a long road to $32k, to $38k, to $41k, to $56k, and so on.At the present time, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain the level of $25k, which if it is broken, I do not think that we will see the beginning of the upward path during this year, let alone reaching $5 million for Bitcoin, which requires the price to be about $90 trillion (larger than stocks, gold, and  US public debt)",

We know that Michael Saylor is a billionaire and an influential businessman, but he didn't say that this is what will happen. It's too good to be true, but if in 2021 the ATH reached by Bitcoin is around 69k each within 11 years, how about 5M each? How many more decades will we have to wait for that to happen?

There is no metric or historical happening that could predict the price of Bitcoin as far as $5,000,000. This is mere propaganda unless he's a spirit being that I don't know of.Frankly, Bitcoin like any other asset could reach any price, but calling that huge 6 figures is hilarious. At times, these people are doing this to gain more attention and relevance in a particular industry, and thanks to people who often buy such unforeseen events that just come to the head of the issuers.This prediction is worthless, but for Bitcoin, it will always be progressive in the long run.",

So soon we might see Bitcoins touching millions.I believe the value of Bitcoin will rise very high. Over time, many governments and institutions will diversify their investments by purchasing Bitcoin. I predict that these will happen and we all follow the development of Bitcoin from past to present. We feel that what we say is not a dream.What I really want to say is that we need to be careful when investing in this journey of Bitcoin. That is, after you invest, the price may decrease and continue like this for a while. We need to get used to this and this situation should not affect us negatively spiritually. We have all witnessed how the price of Bitcoin has risen. When the time comes, the price will rise again. We must learn to be patient. If investing wears you out, you should give up if necessary.It would not be a surprise to see Bitcoin reach millions. If we know how to wait as long as necessary, we can see a lot of things in the Bitcoin market.",

John McAfee is a mere snake-oil salesman who used his popularity to shill shitcoins. I agree, the two can't be compared for anything, whether it's about things related to Bitcoin or the way they treat life in general. After watching the documentary about John McAfee, I got a much broader picture of him, so even though I'm not a psychologist to draw conclusions about someone's mental health, I would dare to say that a lot of things were not right in his head. On the other hand, Saylor is a successful businessman with no scandals (as far as I know), and the only bad label that can be attached to him is his tweet about how he thinks Bitcoin will fail, as well as online gambling, but that was before some 10 years.As for the speculation about $5 million, that's news from 2021 and I don't know why someone decided to bring it back into the public's focus - but even though I don't think it's impossible, I would still put that price in the context of the time it would take to make something like that happen. If I'm not mistaken, we are talking about a market cap in the amount of even $100 trillion, and for the sake of comparison, that would be as much as 10 companies the size of BlackRock. This is simply too much money to be realized in the near future and could only be realized if central banks start buying Bitcoin the same way they buy gold today.",
