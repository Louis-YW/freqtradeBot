All in the name of 'we went bankrupt, people can still use that as an advantage, anyway enough of the James bond sixth sense, I believe that these events must happen for crypto to collapse very hard, it's like a monopoly, this is just my own mind saying things, it doesn't mean they are facts. Such events will always keep happening in the future, that's why decentralization is very scarce in this space, it's a big sign that everything centralized is highly manipulated, trust not any CEX with your Bitcoin, no company, banks, or government entities can keep your Bitcoin safe than your non-custodial wallet.",

History has been made and Bitcoin has set up solid foundation for evolution of blockchain industry, even it is not a first cryptocurrency [1]. We can assume, if Bitcoin had not succeed, there would have been another cryptocurrency achieving the success of Bitcoin.Reality is Bitcoin already did it and so far, since 2009, there is no other cryptocurrency can surpass Bitcoin.About decentralization, only Monero can have it but still can not compete and take over a King position of Bitcoin.[1] Bitcoin prehistory",

I would say those bankruptcies came into being due to the creation of BTC. BTC gives birth to all these coins and tokens. The first Alts and forks of BTC were made with the help of BTC technology. If we see from an angle then BTC created these projects. Well, coming back to the discussion, I totally agree with you that, even if there is a child and parent relation but these children came with different characteristics which led them to an end and caused many investors a huge loss. We should also not solely depend on BTC and should diversify our funds. Just open-minded advice. Of course, bitcoineers might not agree with me but believe me, diversification is good.",

Bitcoin previously was at its top when it was above $50k, but when the time came it went less than $30km, people didn't lose hope and they thought that this would be a better time to buy bitcoin. As they already knew the bitcoin price it will never leave its Hodlers. Also, we all know that bitcoin has a specific structure that no other coin has.
