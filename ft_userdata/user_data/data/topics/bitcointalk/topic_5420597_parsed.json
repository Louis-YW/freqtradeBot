It's most likely going to get dumped by most investors and traders before it goes to have nothing in value. That's why if it's still tradable, they'll dump and sell it so at least they get a little portion of what they've bought from it. FTX has already is bankrupt already and its CEO resigned already and there's no hope for them anymore. I think that even CZ saw this happening and that's why he tried to help but it's not just enough even if he steps in with his helping hands.Quote from: Calm N Patience on November 12, 2022, 02:41:02 AMSad day for the crypto space.Sad day for those people who invested heavily on this company and its token. Even if I'm not an investor of them, it's sad because it has impacted the whole market and wiped out billions from it.",

Sad day for the crypto space.FTX is still hot to talk about right now, in fact, as hot as coffee. If I look at this event, the movement of the price value that is happening on its chart is almost the same as what happened to LUNA on Binance on the exchange, probably a few days from now it will be below 0.01$ an FTT.At first, I didn't think so, but when Binance posted on Twitter that they were going to dump FTT on their platform, I immediately thought that this is what they did to Luna when it was hot.",

FTT is the native token of FTX, once FTX goes bankrupt and ceases to exist, it means that no one will develop and use this FTT anymore, it will soon disappear on CMC.Currently, FTX has only filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which means there are 3 months left to negotiate with investors and partners to find a solution. If an agreement is reached or funded, the possibility of them coming back to life is still there, but the possibility is very low. There have been some cases of companies resurrecting after filing for bankruptcy but it has only happened with media companies, crypto companies have not had any cases yet.",

If someone agrees to buy back FTX, it means they have to pay off FTX's debt to be able to use FTX, otherwise it's gone forever. FTT is the native token of FTX, it will not exist if FTX is no more, no exchange accepts a useless token for circulation.",

The possible scenario to be the same like luna but i do remember that if FTT was not a native coin like luna and so this has more chance to be a dead token rather than luna caused by what?

Which may be valuless at some point like LUNA but it looks like it will not be delisted from any exchange.  As happened with LUNA. And is it now open for Binance Future trading as well.  Which is really incredible because many traders are making huge profits through Sell Short from here. I still don't know what to do with FTT in the coming days",
