I trade only when I see good market conditions and of course, see my mood. maybe that's what made my trading skills so bad.but I usually use 50% of the funds I set up for trading or gambling. I usually choose one of them, when I've traded, then I'm not going to the casino.I have divided my long term investment assets, of which 70% is Bitcoin. as for trading, I have my allocation, which as much as possible I will not let my long term planning be disturbed.",

Not just random trades but I am making sure that there's something positive to happen for it. For the newbies, it's okay to trade and that will serve you as a lesson and will help you gain experience but always have that good allocation on how much you're willing to learn a lesson and lose at the same time. 5% is already good enough for your whole fund.",

What do you people think about this? Out of 100% fund, what percentage can you advice a trader to use?The only thing that is important as a trader here in the crypto industry is that we will not give up on our belief in cryptocurrency, as a financial solution to our problem.Doing trading activity here can give us profit, there is a time every day and there is also a time when it is not, because of the volatility that exists in cryptocurrency. That's why if everyone only has a goal management that is called in trading, we will not notice that later we are doing DCA via percentage that we give like for example 15% for the profit we get from trading and this is what will be separated ours for long term holdings or it depends on you.",

What do you people think about this? Out of 100% fund, what percentage can you advice a trader to use? Holding means long term trading and its counterpart would be short term trading. Majority of bitcoin should be kept on holding while a minimum amount for short term, but this can vary depending on your personal reasons. Holding is safer and better in terms of mental ease that you have bought at low and you can sell at any good price. The wrong decisions are done due to lack of experience of having gone through bear-bull cycles in the past, common for newbies and impulsive decisions, commonly taken by gamblers. Lack of patience is another issue where they start with a long term goal but start panicking and sell midway.So I guess everyone has their own sweet spot, some might want to take more risks so these numbers would not be same for all.",

No matter how much you bealive in crypto, never put 100% into any single type of assets.",

Using a lower leverage can help you stay in the market longer before your stop loss is hit, it may revert you back to entry point where you regain your running loses.using only 20% of funds for trading is also a good suggestion. because traders lose too often, trade with small capital first to give experience. and saving more will help the trader to keep the investment asset. but your advice is also very good. it helps new traders.I do not know for sure what percentage I traded. maybe 30-40%. could be bigger. because every BTC I earn from the campaign, I will put into another wallet for the long term, and the less I will accumulate into trading capital.",

Newbies and Traders fall for the greed and over trade for which ultimately they make mistakes. I know sometimes holding is better and for that reason they always advise to trade in budget. As if you go over budget and trade with your savings, then at crucial times you will be forced to sell the coins when holding might be the ideal option. So act and invest accordingly.",

But to be honest, I can hardly say anything about the percentage of the amount to be traded at a loss as you say. Maybe I'd rather say there's no percentage for that, why? because basically we don't want to experience losses even if only 1% of the amount of money we have.We are in a situation where we have to take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us because the current price is worth investing in. So do your best, and we'll meet our very desired price in the future.",

If you don't like holding bitcoins for a long time, then choosing to hold fiat is safer than keeping the stablecoin on an exchange. I'm a holder, and I still have funds available to DCA every time bitcoin drops more, but I don't hold the stablecoin because it's unsafe. I hold it in fiat, and so far despite high inflation, that loss is negligible compared to buying bitcoin at its peak or holding shitcoin.",

When the market creates a huge volatility, panic spreads in the market and along with it the strategies of the traders change. But the most important thing is that you should not trade with all your funds, you should trade only with those funds that you can afford to lose.

But if we assume that everything will be so, then now we are really in the accumulation zone and our task is to accumulate or save our crypto assets.

Its true that its better to hold but we know that there are people who doesnt really like to wait up longer or more years and if we do compare out the profits for someone who do actively trade than into those holdersthen it would be much but of course it would really be having that risks.This is why it would really be depending whether you could bare up the risk or not.",
