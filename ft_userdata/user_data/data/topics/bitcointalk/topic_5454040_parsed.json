And to find that some traders have changed trading activity from stocks to crypto does not mean at all that they succeeded with one or failed with the other. This is like going from trading bitcoin to trading ripple, both of which are called trading.The difference that can be tempting for adventurous traders is that they will move to the field of crypto since prices are very volatile and fantastic profits can be achieved in a short time (they can lose imaginary losses as well), while those who prefer safer investments prefer stock exchanges and Since the prices are more stable.",

They make uses of all analysis, charts, candlestick and whatsoever, sometimes forex traders are more smarter than cryptocurrency traders because they undergo series of class and training before they could venture into it, but as a Cryptocurrency trader I think what you needed most is for you to understand the coin you are trading with whether is a reliable coin or not. Crypto seems more reliable than forex so there's no much differences it all depends on individuals how they understand it and learn from.",

While both trading has the same pattern of some technical analysis and predictions of the market direction with the help of some indicators and other trading tools, the simple difference is that in Forex trading, the user is only concerned with trading foreign currencies in pairs like EUR/USD and JYAN/USD, while in cryptocurrency trading, the user is concerned with coin/coin, coin/token, token/token, and coin/fiat or token/fiat pairs. That is to say, it's possible that one can learn the two depending on their personal capabilities. There is always risk in both types of trade, so I can't say that crypto traders make more profit than forex traders; they both encounter losses, but what matters is how experienced one is; if not, they will encounter more losses than the other.",

There are some differences between the two and that is Forex trading involves trading of fiat currencies, while crypto trading involves trading digital currencies. The markets for Forex and crypto trading operates differently, with Forex being a more established market and crypto being a newer and more volatile market. Crypto trading also involves a higher degree of risk due to the lack of regulation and the potential for extreme price fluctuations. Forex trading is generally considered to be a more stable market with less volatility and more predictable price movements.",

They tend to always talk about news, and Forex is mostly affected by news, like every day there is news in the country. It depends on what pair you are trading too, as Forex value will be affected by all types of news, like economic news, catastrophes, or anything else that involves the country. Why most forex traders do not want to move to crypto is that it is not that predictable in crypto. I think it is because they have a lot of experience in forex and are already able to easily read the chart patterns and know which is the best entry into them.",

The difference is much on the volatility, with cryptocurrency we can see a big variation whereas the forex is of very small fluctuation, which makes it low risk investment.Cryptocurrency is not easy predictable, to which the risk is high along with chance of big profiting.

Can one do both at the same time?if you are of the type of person that thinks crypto analysis is just watching the market candle sticks for trends then your knowledge base is small. if you think traders just do the same then your circle of people you know is small. actual traders dont just do trend analysis(not to be confused with technical analysis)actual traders look outside of the silly trends and find proper fundamental impactsi did do a bit of forex trading many years ago. but that game was boring and yes i made more on bitcoin than on forex. the main problems/differences in forex are these:when 2 countries currencies are traded. people dont do trend analysis, instead they look for things like:has a country changed its import/export tariffs to affect international tradehas the country doing food exports had a good growth season. where their produce has yielded and so are able to sell more thus causing an effect of forex money shuffling when they export. however when those reports come out. the big entities have already seen the reports and set their trades accordingly so by the time regular(non institutional) forex investors see the results, the market is already priced in. the hype is over before regular people get a chance to reacthowever on bitcoin there are some fundamentals that play out after results are publishedfor instance mining. when there is a hashrate rise. that means more competition for the miners. meaning less coin for them meaning when they sell(later) they will want more fiat for their less coins to break even, thus this is why there is a bitcoin market hype a year after a halving. when 2022 seen electric prices increase due to international crap happening. the price in 2022 didnt go up immediately.this is becasue miners buy equipment and pay for electric on upto a 1-2 year contract meaning their costs are priced in at the start and its only when their contracts are up do they evaluate their earnings against their costs to price in the bitcoin they need to sell at. hence the delayso forex is where when regular people get the news.. the hype is already over.. in bitcoin when people see hashrate rises and halving. they get to see upfront before the hype resultsalso another difference is institutional forex investors do not hoard and hype. they day trade on 0.00x% fee's, sniping even the smallest under1% changes to the price becasue the trade fees are so low they can do this. whereby adding up all the small percentages per hours/day results in many percent per year.bitcoin investors see that CEX trade fee's as being higher so they cant snipe under1% opportunities because the maker taker fees add up to nearly 1% or more then 1% at times. so they only act when there are more then a few % changes involved. most of which makes people not want to wait around for hours. and instead they hoard and sell on the hype",

That is why you might see some economic news that was so significant in effect with Forex but had a minimal effect on Cryptocurrency. The characteristics of the asset class also explain why Bitcoin, for example, is mostly sluggish in movement than volatile, and this could be so discouraging as it also causes me to avoid it for Forex trading many times.Quote from: alastantiger on May 25, 2023, 09:41:12 PMHave you made a move from Forex trading to crypto trading or crypto to Forex?

Both involve technical and fundamental analysis, which includes indicators, charts, and candlesticks. They make use of the same trading principles, ideologies, and strategies. The forex and crypto market works in different ways due to volatility and some other factors. The crypto market is highly volatile and it can go from 10%-30% or even higher within a single day sometimes. The forex market on the other hand is not that much volatile, the movements in that market was pretty low as compare to crypto market. The main cause of volatility of crypto market is the volume and decentralization. There isn't a single entity who can control the market while the forex market is control by centralized authorities. Although, the trading principles are basically same for both of the markets and the indicators, charts, and other factors are also same for both markets but the volatility has the difference and that's the main cause of concern. Other than volatility the crypto market is highly affected by news media and influencers while that doesn't happen in forex market.QuoteI have yet to see a forex trader who doesn't claim that they make more money than crypto traders.

There have been cases where newbies earned 1000's of dollars in crypto over night, but  they have lost even more after that. I used to be a forex trader back in 2016's but I transition to crypto-currencies in late 2016 and since then I have never done forex trading. I'm considering forex trading now, but still not doing it yet because they crypto is far more easier and is more lucrative for someone like me.",
