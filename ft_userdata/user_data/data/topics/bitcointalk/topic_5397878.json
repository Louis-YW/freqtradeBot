But I believe this is just temporary, the team behind Terra Luna is hard working and for sure they will fix it.Terra Luna isn't the only issue to bring the market down. According to me it is the time in which the market is supposed to have a bear market. The increase in the interest rates to keep control of the inflation is a major reason connected with the market crash. As said this isn't happening with cryptocurrency market. Almost every market is down and the increase of interest rates weren't happening only in the USA, everywhere similar situation prevails. In my country the value against dollar have gone high in history.",

Yes what you say is true, maybe Tera Luna is currently very heavy with the dirt of other stablecoins.So that there is a price sentiment right now but we don't have to worry about the current price decline because we also know that using a decentralized public blockchain platform for stablecoins is algorithmic and monitors asset prices, of course they are able to maintain their right price with a set of rules or software rather than  underlying assets.",

How dumb these developers are. If bitcoin will be dropping so hard and that will be the end for the foundation",

Now, we're seeing the expense of it and you're right with what you've said. As they try to maintain it through possible sell-offs as their stable coin is about to downfall, we actually are seeing its fall, and if this continues and isn't able to maintain its position as stable. Possibly that we're going to see the domino effect of it but, this isn't just all about UST and Luna. But this is an overall experience of the world market which still has an active conflict of Russia and Ukraine.",

This is the repercussions of hyping the market with huge APY while can't sustain in the long run. Of course everybody that staking on high APY will easily take profit when the market turns south just like what happening right now. I wonder if LUNA foundation will do a buy back to cover the value loss on there stablecoin or will be happy on the money they bag from traders that purchase UST in exchange for temporary high APY.",

Yes, terra was pumping its UST used bitcoin from the treasury/LFG. It seems like some bitcoins have been moving to the new wallet but this company has sold more than 500 millions USD worth of bitcoin to the market but the problem is selling in a loss was a disaster to this company. That's why terra wants to issue another 1.5 billions loan to make the UST stable. The idea by backing the stable asset with unstable asset was a very bad idea.
