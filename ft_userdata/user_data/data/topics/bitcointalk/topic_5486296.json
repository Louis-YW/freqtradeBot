This may not be very surprising for an asset that has no fair value.but bitcoin does have a fair value wholesale amount.. its just not the same as the retail market premium of CEX.. much like many things in the world..milk, bread has a hidden wholesale value price below the retail pricebut in short yes bitcoin does have a underlying value which the market then speculates aboveÂ bitcoin is based on PoW that has real world cost of production..if you look across the world at many countries electric costs. and base the PoW hashrate on cost of electric/hardware.. there becomes an underlying value..when considering the cheapest most effective locations price to mine a considerable % of the network hashpower. this cheapest considerable% becomes the base. where by no one else can effectively undercut the market to earn enough coin to affect the market. no one wants to sell below the base because that would be a loss of real world costs.. thus becomes actual real world value bottom.. which the bitcoin market then speculates above based on other countries positions of higher costs and other reasons of desire, demandEG if its $25k in Slavic/asian countries to mine. and $140k to mine in pacific island regionsall countries wont 'mine to sell' below $25k. slavic/asian countries would not want to sell @$25k as thats break even, no profit. so prefer to sell higherwhere as pacific countries are willing to buy at any price below $140k as its discount compared to mining.which if bitcoin peaks to the $140k line where even the most expensive miners on the planet can break even /profit, then majority then go on a selling sentiment which means there actually is a ceiling to market speculation..(note the foundation value and premium ceiling change over time due to advancing costs due to hashrate cost of mining.. and its been proven the case in 2021-2022 top and bottom market limits correlating with those dates top and bottom mining considerations(other times to over the decade) )..just this snippet shows how the blogger does not know much about economics and how miners are involved in economics. ..if i was the CEO of ECB running a ethical, honourable ECB for the best practices of economics. and if i then read that blog post and found out the blogger was an employee of ECB. id immediately want to investigate the bloggers credentials as it reeks of not understanding basic economics. and then fire him either way due to making statements that show he is not skilled in economics and instead just wants to display personal politics of biases",

I expect soon to see some DeFi talking about new standards, which may include KYC.yep pretty much the jist of it if your offering a service(business) that facilitates currency movement, you'll need to register as a money business/vasp.. which then entails things like prevent transfers of sanctioned/blacklisted funds, kyc and audits and reporting of suspect behaviour of customers.i seen it happen in the UK years ago, in regards to 'localbitcoins.com' which was like a craigs list of private OTC decentralised traders listingthough hard to identify at the localbitcoin site before it itself needed to KYC listers.. UK banks were watching when personal(non-business) bank accounts who were moving alot of cash back and forth to lots of new strangers (signs it wasnt just grandma getting/giving birthday money) where the banks flagged these as suspicious and then asked the account holder about his activity to inform him he needed a business bank account plus a MSB licence to continue doing what he was doing. which then entailed reporting and audits and kyc of each trade",

However, I'm concerned about the precedent set by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control when it placed \"Tornado Cash\" (code) on its \"Specially Designated Nationals\" sanctions list. This is unprecedented (code is not a 'National'!) and has serious implications for free speech and academic freedom. This action effectively prohibits anyone in the United States from \"dealing\" with Tornado Cash (code). What really gets my attention is how these actions could potentially affect freedom of speech. Government must not make choices that impact the sharing of code, academic progress, and scientific research. Two lawsuits, one brought by Coin Center and another by Coinbase, are questioning whether OFAC was authorized at all to sanction Tornado Cash and whether the sanctions order violates the Constitution. These cases could really shape our future.Plus, there's this overarching theme of (financial) privacy that keeps popping up in various ways. By the way, I know we've got some old-school veterans on this forum who probably remember the cryptography warsâwhen code was printed in books and on T-shirts as a form of protest and activism. It's a testament to how cyclical history can be. If it turns out I'm just being alarmist, I'll be the happiest to admit it. ð",

EG microsoft office word document is not a entity/person/national. visual studio code is not a servicebut if that code compiles and then operates as its own service. its treated as a service rather than just code/softwarethe court did not decide all code/software are services.. but via evidence proved tornado was operating as service and was not simply \"code\"/softwareyes this has other implications where by when code starts operating as a organisation, association, as a service.. then jurisdictions start applyingfor instance blockstreams liquid is an example(its federation), another would be LN users that offer \"routing\" would be payment facilitators/ money services",

I don't know if it's the two of them or people who think the same way that are on the way to implement legislation that equates Bitcoin transactions to banking transactions, although the last I heard they agreed to a limit of 1,000 euros below which there would be anonymity in crypto transactions. But I think that limit will be lowered or outright removed with the final legislation.",
