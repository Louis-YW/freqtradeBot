Sample you made a site and adding HTML redirect to the site of your choice under headings and then generate the QR code of your site that you can share with anyone if someone scans the QR code they will redirect to a different site.You can add malware to your site to infect the users who access your site.So be careful to scan any QR code make sure to use antivirus to scan the QR code or use the QR Kaspersky scanner or just download the Kaspersky app it has a feature to scan the QR code.",

It is good to always still assume that hack can happen.There's a possibility of getting Malware on phone through QR code scanning if the link provided after the code scanning is coded in a way that will redirect users to websites or links that are malicious.I think we just need to take extra caution when dealing with online activities because technology is advancing every day and online theft is implementing new strategies.",

In general, QR codes themselves are safe because they have no intrinsic security risks; This means that when you scan it, your device will not immediately be exposed to viruses or malware.The risk of getting a virus or malware is when you carry out a further process by clicking on a link obtained through a barcode scan, which could have been manipulated by scammers, for example, in the form of a link containing malware which is automatically downloaded or installed when you click on the link.Quote from: www.eset.com - Best Practices When Scanning and Using QR CodesBut first, are QR codes safe? In short, yes. QR’s themselves are safe as they don’t have any intrinsic security risks. However, other elements involved in the use of QR codes, such as mobile devices do. Although unlikely, there are several ways that cybercriminals can utilise QR codes to access private data. As such, it’s important to be aware that mobile devices are still at risk when they scan a QR code and there are several ways attackers can use QR codes as a ploy.Quote from: www.malwarebytes.com - Are QR codes safe?While QR codes are generally safe, they can be manipulated by scammers because they all appear similar. A malicious QR code may lead you to a spoofed website designed to drop different malware types or steal your sensitive data, like your login credentials, credit card information, or money. In one incident, scammers were using fake parking meter QR codes to steal money through phishing websites.Reference:- https://www.eset.com/za/about/newsroom/press-releases-za/blog/best-practices-when-scanning-and-using-qr-codes/- https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code",

But no link is altered through the QR code, but a link is altered by itself before generating the QR code which is a link to download malware. QR code itself is safe. About taking extra caution, anything you paste with QR code, you have to check and recheck that thing, making sure it is correct before proceeding.",

If I can avoid potential threats at a first step, I will prioritize it than jumping into a hold and try to do my research to escape from it.usually, the QR code will display the URL first before we agree to continue to the web destination. perhaps some devices are set to log in automatically after scanning the code.but if there is no contact with the phishing website such as transaction approval or wallet exchange, I don't think it will be a problem.To avoid this, we should not carelessly connect our devices with just any QR code scan. or if we access our wallet via smartphone, maybe we can use it separately from the device we use for social activities.",

There are free online QR code scanner either by camera or by uploading the QR code.
