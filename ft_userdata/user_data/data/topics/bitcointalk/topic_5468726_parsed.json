      "body": "I got this sorted out, if you ever get stuck on this stupid blockchain, get out of it altogether, don't try to swap rather get some trx (30 is safe call) first via instant exchanges (simpleswap/stealthex have very low limit, I converted $3 worth arbeth to trx, use cheaper blockchain to convert from too, examples being cheap evm chains (arbitrum, optimism, polygon)/doge), then go back to instant exchange and convert your trc20 usdt to where you please. I tried to swap and it first took above $1 for approval transaction and on actual swap transaction, it asked me for $10, ofc I would refuse. This stupid blockchain is in existence and ethereum gets blame for being expensive.",
