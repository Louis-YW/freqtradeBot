  "content": "The SEC threatened Coinbase with a lawsuit if it doesn't comply with securities laws. According to the US agency, PoS coins are unregistered securities. Coinbase decided to ignore the SEC warning and continue offering staking services to US customers stating that \"staking is handled by decentralized protocols\". It's likely there will be a lawsuit between the SEC and Coinbase soon.If the lawsuit becomes a reality, which do you think will win? The SEC or Coinbase? The US has been tightening its regulations towards the crypto industry, so a win by Coinbase could bring some \"relief\" to US-based crypto exchanges.Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

Just my opinion Only an agreement between the two parties is the best outcome. Because if the SEC loses, they will also find other reasons to continue attacking exchanges or even the entire crypto industry. Even if XRP wins, Coinbase or Binance win, they will all continue to be in trouble in the future, the SEC and CFTC will certainly not ignore it. Not only the US government but other governments will also soon do the same because what they are aiming for is money. All recent allegations are civil lawsuits, and as long as the exchanges agree and strictly comply with the fine payment, everything will be over.",

Yeah, but just the same, if you have money then you have control, and that's what the US government is trying to prevent from happening. Because this exchanges are growing big by the day, meaning fiat is flowing on exchanges, so they have to stop because they want people to put their money on banks, in which the government has control.Quote from: Abiky on April 05, 2023, 09:50:08 PMLet's hope the US government and the crypto industry work together for the benefit of all. Maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel? Just my opinion I don't think there will be like some consensus or middle ground between US government and crypto. It's either they let it flow normally, or not. The problem is that they are selectively targeting exchanges now, Binance, Coinbase and even Kraken.And so this lawsuit might set a precedence, gonna be a uphill battle for those exchanges, but if they win (chances are slim), it's going to be big for crypto industry.",

So it is possible that Coinbase even if it is a public company could potentially make them even more to face difficulties and penalties.But in my mind --it is possible that Coinbase may have had some sort of legal loophole or justification for their actions, they follow and comply with financial regulations to avoid any possible legal issues like this which I doubt they are safe as of now.",

If it is a precedent, look at how Ripple is doing quite well in its case against the SEC.The US doesn't have a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets. It needs to \"update itself\" in order to stay ahead of the game. Due to the mess caused by both the SEC and CFTC, crypto exchanges are closing up shop all across the country. All we have left is Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken as the biggest exchanges in the US. If they go away, it will be a huge loss for the country in the long run (earning taxes from crypto transactions, etc). The EU seems to be far ahead than the US in terms of crypto/Blockchain regulation, so it's likely major companies will migrate there. The SEC vs Coinbase lawsuit might be a long dilemma, so this is only the beginning. Let's hope all goes well for the sake of crypto adoption within the US. Just my thoughts",

We might witness more exchanges and services in the cryptospace join the war against Gensler. Kraken's chief legal officer has already shared that they have begun fighting behind the scenes against the regulators. Who will be next? I speculate Binance.us, however, CZ likes to use decentralization to evade regulations hehehehe.On Decrypt’s gm podcast, Marco Santori also said that the San Francisco-based firm was “fighting the fight” behind the scenes to get connected to the same FedNow network that all other big financial institutions use to settle transactions. Kraken has been in hot water with regulators this year. T—he U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hit the San Francisco-based digital asset exchange with a $30 million fine for violating securities laws back in February. The regulator alleged that Kraken failed to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.Source https://decrypt.co/138097/kraken-fighting-the-fight-behind-the-scenes-with-regulators",

Congress really needs to work on that to ensure the healthy growth of the crypto/Blockchain industry within the US. There are already pro-crypto congressmen in the country, so it should only be a matter of time before this is realized. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler could eventually be removed from office if Congress decides to do so. How will this play out for the crypto industry, is yet to be seen. But I have a feeling things will turn out well without someone who's constanly \"attacking\" crypto all of the time. All in all, Coinbase did well in stepping up to the game.

They are slowly closing down different service offerings from their business.The reason according to Coinbase's spokesperson is low demand. I do not believe this.Coinbase Borrow’s days are numbered.Customers of the U.S.-based exchange who used the program – which allowed customers to borrow fiat loans up to $1 million against as much as 30% of their bitcoin holdings, with interest – received an email on Wednesday informing them that the last day to take out new loans would be May 10.However, the closure of Coinbase Borrow seems – at least for now – to be unconnected to any enforcement action. A person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk the closure of Coinbase Borrow had nothing to do with either pending or past troubles with the SEC.Source https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/04/coinbase-to-stop-issuing-new-loans-via-coinbase-borrow/The real warning sign for their exit is when Coinbase begins layoffs of employees again in America. They have fired 950 employees on January already. This might be 20% of their workforce.",
