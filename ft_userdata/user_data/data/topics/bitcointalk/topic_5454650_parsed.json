The first two are okay but the third one which is the problem gamblers are the ones who are struggling with this addiction. So I asked myself what behaviour would suggest that an individual is a problem gambler. Did some research and found many behaviour that suggest an individual is struggling with gambling addiction. Out of those I found the following five behaviours to be most common ones in a problem gambler.  Preoccupation with gambling.The urge to increase wagers to achieve the same level of excitement.Having difficulty in controlling, cutting back, or stopping gambling despite several attempts.Lying about gambling activities.Borrowing money to gamble.As gambling addiction can be a challenging issue that can have a very harmful impact on an individual's life. it is always recommended to find a professional helpb rather struggling with it. Do you agree with those behaviours? If not then you can suggest some, that can be added to this topic.",

An addicted gambler can sell his belongings and properties just for gambling. I remembered I sold my home theatre because of gambling and I lost the money very fast to gambling.Quote from: elevates on May 31, 2023, 01:11:13 PMAs gambling addiction can be a challenging issue that can have a very harmful impact on an individual's life. it is always recommended to find a professional helpb rather struggling with it. Do you agree with those behaviours? If not then you can suggest some, that can be added to this topic. Professional help? Maybe. But I stopped addiction when I knew gambling is not meant for earning income. Gambling addiction is like madness, once someone discover that gambling can not help him or her in anyway than to make losses in addiction and seeing himself or herself to be addicted and knowing the future can not be good is enough to make such person quit the addiction. Professional help can be what could be needed for this, but not all the time. Someone close to him passing the reality to him can be helpful.",

Do you agree with those behaviours? If not then you can suggest some, that can be added to this topic. That is exactly true and I can relate to that second point when I was addicted myself in 2019-2020.I could not sleep well and I could not think about anything else except gambling and the number one reason I loved to try at that time was to start with a low bet and since winnings were not satisfactory for me I kept increasing the bet to the level that I still felt excitement when gambling.While this may look nice in the beginning when you hit a big win know that in the long run this is the most devastating of all gambling addiction problems,the fact that you need to play with a bigger bet means you need more money and means you will get more problems.I have said in other threads that setting a predefined budget and sticking to it is the way to get out of gambling addiction.",

I agree with these 3 behaviour because a gambling addict will always find a way to gamble so that they will not the enjoyment that they get on winning like an addiction to a substance. You can add the behaviour of lack of sleep due to gambling since most of gambling addict has sleep deprivation due to overthinking on profit or losses.Quote from: elevates on May 31, 2023, 01:11:13 PMThe urge to increase wagers to achieve the same level of excitement.Lying about gambling activities.I disagree with this because a normal gambler that seeks more fun is not an addiction. addiction is repetitive playing without any self-control over when to stop. Also lying about gambling is on a case-to-case basis. Gambling is not accepted in the culture of other countries, especially those in religiously inclined countries.",

But assuming you narrowed it down to let's say \"lying about their losses, so as to console themselve\" that would have been more understandable.I think IMO I agree with Op on this lying point if he means an addict would lie almost on anything concerning his gambling escapades. First a chronic gambler or an addict in gambling is known to have the characteristics of lying apart from general life activities, he does it to stay afloat with his family in guise of being innocent. Even if his wife or friends knows he is gambling but he won't disclose everything about it including how much he stake or wager with, he doesn't disclose winning and losses, he has abysmal behaviour towards the whole of the gambling. As far he is concerned, it has to be a lie, shrouded in secrecy.Quote from: elevates on May 31, 2023, 01:11:13 PMPreoccupation with gambling.Borrowing money to gamble.I agree more with these two characteristics. The thought of an addict is always on that thing that he finds pleasure in and this is about any sphere not excluding pornography. So for a gambling addict he has joy when he remembers he is going to wager some games and he focuses on that on a  daily.And to the second here,apart from borrowing, an addict can sell off a friends car in his possession only to believe he would surprise the friend the next time of returning the car with a bigger value car. Probably gambling with 2001 Jeep Cherokee compact SUV with the hope to replace it with 2022 Toyota Land Cruiser large SUV",

So, I'll just answer instead.Those points given are real especially if you find yourself lying to your family about your gambling habits. Then loans, you have loads of it from the bank to your relatives, you don't even care what they will say anymore as long as it can provide your gambling problem. Keeping secrets means you are having trouble with something and you don't want society to know about it. As for me, my wife always looks at my computer and I don't mind her having a peek, it's not like I am keeping something from her. If she sees me running a casino automated gambling she will just ask questions on how it works, maybe she will try to help me out if a cashout is needed to be done. But the point is, I never made it a secret from her, it's a start of a bad relationship with someone close to you if you keep something from them and that means you may have a gambling problem too.",

The above are indeed some of the signs of gambling addiction behavior, but many don't realize that they are started to become an addict.For me addicts are people who always chase defeat so that a lot of money is spent in games, whereas I never chase my losses because playing to spend a little money on weekends doesn't keep me curious and makes me run out of a lot of money, but actually everything comes back to me own how to control not to become a heavy addict.@elevates it's hard to cure addicts and everything comes back to oneself, I'm sure there will be no professional who can help to heal perfectly",

I believe a gambler can lie about his gambling routine if he doesn't feel confortable sharing this kind of information with strange people he doesn't have any intimacy or even with family members, if they have a very negative stance towards this kind of activity. That is not necessarily an indicative the gambler is a disfunctional one, rather it means he is a very private person who cares about his particular life.The downside here is that if an individual who acts like this develops an addiction at some point, it will be harder to support and assist him when seeking for a cure for his compulsive behavior, because close people and friends won't be aware about the difficults he is facing and once they will, it might be too late...
