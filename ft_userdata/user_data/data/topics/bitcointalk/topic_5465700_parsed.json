There is not really much on that argument so I think a topic is needed.Why it's a scam? Because they are using just some buzzword (AI, automatic investment, staking, crypto and so on...) Fixed interest earning daily (0.30% - just insane - you can double money in less than one year!).This is just a ponzi, with a fake team, just a scam. Don't waste time and money!",

I have to avoid those at any cost.",
