I read a breakdown of the project recently that highlighted how:The auditor has flagged it for being centralized (i.e., literally one of the anonymous cat people could rug pull at any time, that's in the audit they're so proud of).The project has ties to other massive exit scams (come on, people!)The whitepaper says they're going to \"save the oceans\" but doesn't say which charity lolThere's a bunch of other stupid shit in there that I won't get into, I'm just venting about how ridiculous this situation is. I checked out the Telegram group and it's full of fanatics, no surprise there, but I really do think a lot of them are sincere rather than being paid shills or bots.People are going to get screwed. What do I do, laugh? Feel bad for them? This shit keeps happening over and over again, and it's increasingly obvious every time. This one is going to be a headline news event, but if you try bringing it up, the project supporters either get upset at you or at themselves. I think people are just tossing major amounts of money into this shit without even researching it at all, I DMed a nice-seeming dude in the Telegram channel and he was dumbfounded that it even might be a scam, and scared.I don't know, man. I'm here for the tech and for the gains, but we have a looong way to go before shit like this stops happening and undermining the whole space altogether.",

But think of the upside: Altcoin season is definitely on when meme tokens like this can raise over $34 million and tokens like $pepe are making shiba-like pumps. Soon it will spread to other alts as well. Sadly these scams and memes won't ever leave us. They will only grow stronger and most likely will beat useful coins while doing that.",

I mean why would you want to start an NFT/crypto project like that in order to make more money, developers are insane to think that this is a normal way of making money.

You think jail is a good reason?Well, what you think will happen when people realize that you rug pulled them? I mean you just took their money, and assume will not achieve much else, and just claim you \"spent\" it on marketing when in fact you would be personally spending it. This is why we should be a lot more careful about these type of people.",

This is why we should be a lot more careful about these type of people.Yes, they are doing that to make money but even the old and serious projects are also here to make money except only for the founder of Bitcoin which aim is only to help people to be free from the slavery of banks and governments.Shit coin developers don't care if what others think about them but they will only do what they want to ride the hype train. They can rob a bank but that is risky as they can likely be caught while if they do scams here, they can easily get away. Thanks to the power of crypto decentralization. If people don't want to be rug pulled, they must avoid these type of tokens because rug pulls are quite rampant with them.",

The problem is still with you.We can obviously not blame the people who create those cryptocurrencies with no utility since they want to earn some money using the most hyped topics of the cryptocurrency universe and it is we who give them what they want which is hype only because we want to satisfy our greed and the dreams of becoming millionaires by doing nothing.We always forget that those who become rich by doing nothing are mostly a few out of a million and that is a very low ratio, to be honest, but who cares? It's only a few dollars for us which becomes a fortune for the creator of that token since a few dollars from a million pockets become a few million dollars.",

Everyone was sceptical of them tbh..

Because, we are talking about something that makes no sense and yet a lot of people still did it, so when a million people invest into these silly stuff, the one million one will not be weird, that person just did what the other million people did already.So, this is just a common mistake done by a huge community and as long as they keep doing it, they will keep making each other do this mistake constantly. There is no reason to do it, I think it should be focused on how much trouble it could be for people, but in the end we do not have any issues with this at all, and just let them learn by themselves.",
