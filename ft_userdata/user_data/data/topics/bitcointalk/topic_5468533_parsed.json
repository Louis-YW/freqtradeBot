With ninjastic.space you can easily see when users made all their posts within a selected time so if a campaign manager checks and see that an user just comes to the forum drops all his/her post for that day between 30 minutes they spent on the forum and if they continue with it they‚Äôll mostly be removed from the campaign because posts like that don‚Äôt actually give the exposure that the campaign manager is looking for the company that‚Äôs been promoted.Although, I haven‚Äôt checked for burst posting before so I‚Äôm not sure if it actually shows an indicator for a bursted post so the answer I gave is the way I‚Äôd check if there‚Äôs no automatic indicator.",

So the best practise is to, add value in your posts because adding value will ultimately avoid you from burst posting. You should check this thread out for the Definition of Burstposting To be honest, I didn't consider a valuable post which is made just after another and another. But I consider a post burst posting when there is no value in it. Many might not agree with me but coming back to your query. You just have to avoid making post after one another. But still, you should ask the manager because they might have different definition of burst posting.",

The users who do post bursting are those users who don't give proper time for writing of the posts and they just want to complete their minimum number of posts in order to get their weekly signature payments. Let's say a user makes so many posts of 250 characters in a short span of time in order to meet the requirements of a campaign but none of those posts are constructive and are made in a way to fulfil their campaign requirements only.

A better example of post bursting should be around 10-15 posts per hour which is also going to be a hard thing for many users. I believe that Icopress warns those users who just want to complete their 25 posts limit as soon as possible and some users may post more than 10 to 15 posts per hour in order to complete their weekly minimum posts for a campaign. I believe that Icopress can explain that better than us and if he takes part in this thread then that will be very helpful for @OP and all those members who don't really understand that warning fully.",

CM's would definitely prefer posts that are spread out, but they wouldn't mind users making many high quality posts in quick succession, especially when the participant makes posts above the number the campaign pays for.",

The quality of posts may be something that differentiates you and other people even though they post at the same distance.I fully agree with this. If someone writes in short intervals of time, you have to look at the quality of what they write to judge whether it is authentic burst posting or not. Obviously if they are too short, like on average 3 minutes for days and weeks, it's going to be burst posting.Other things to look at would be the lenght and the page they are posting on. I've sometimes posted in short time intervals but because the threads I've replied to weren't even more than a page long, so if I post in a thread that only has the OP, another that has the OP and two short replies and a third similar thread I'm likely to use less time than if I want to reply on page 3.It can also happen that if someone in a short interval writes relatively long posts, surely they have been looking at the forum when they were not logged in and already had a good part of the answer in their head. But this usually happens on an ad hoc basis. Nobody regularly writes long posts in short intervals of time and with quality. By they way, did I actually burst post between here and here?Quote from: philipma1957 on September 29, 2023, 02:20:31 PMI recently needed a bit more income for my projects and took on a signature.So for last 3 weeks I did very close to 400 posts. which is way more than i needed to get max payout .Only 120 posts were needed.I know I am a bit unusual as I am the post leader on the site.I am sure you campaign manager (which is my manager too but on another campaign) is very happy about that.",

The way and manner you post when you haven't joined any campaign would be different from when you're in a campaign. Because you post without following any rules when you haven't joined a campaign but when you're in a campaign you must follow the rules of the campaign manager, where and where not to post, so you just have to keep track of those rules of any campaign.",

You can tell who is posting strictly to get paid and who is posting because they are generally interested in the topic being discussed. Usually burst posters are also doing their posts in 1-2 days and stopping as well for the week. You obviously wouldn't fit into the category as a burst posting spammer.",

Yes there's a condition if they have any discussion locally this target can be achieved much faster but still, it will take 2 days at least. A maximum in that conversation as well you are going to be able to cover a maximum of 10 posts.In my view, Brust Posting is a kind of activity that can be directly defined as a person trying to cover 5 to 6 posts for his signature Quota in a short time period of 1 hour or a maximum of 1 hour and 20 minutes. A natural poster at least spends around 2 hours a day on the forum this is what I think if he does track his mentions and posts regularly. A person who spends around 1 hour filling out the post quota, for the signature campaign is absolutely abusing the campaign rules.",

Totally situational and in speaking about on OP question on how to check it out, then it wont really be that necessary on making use of ninjastic.space because you could directly check out users profile and see for yourself on how much time gaps that they are really that doing in every post they made.It is really just that impossible that you couldbe only be able to make constructive post on having 3-5 minutes timeframe difference on which i have some seen users to be like this.",
