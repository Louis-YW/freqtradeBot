Perhaps there are those who are interested here.You will not get much attention by just posting in different boards. If you want exposure then you need to start marketing in different platform to drive traffic to your website and to build your social channels.- Create an ANN thread and post it- Launch signature campaign if you want brand awareness- Launch bounty campaign if you want to build your social channels- Make regular update on the social channels- Hire people to do all the above unless you think you are able to do them by your own.",
