I think you should familiarize yourself with their channel in more detail, watch for a while. I think this is a serious team of traders who clearly know their business, so I decided to advise other people. In any case, we have nothing to lose if it's free",

The people behind the group first buy the low marketcap coin they want to pump2. They then announce the coin to you gullible group members.3. You (group members) rush in to buy the coin due to FOMO there by pumping its price4. The people behind the signal group then sell off their coins at a high price, dumping them on you the sheep.5. People behind the group exit with profits. You end up with losses or hold a bag of worthless shitcoin you can not sell",

Just stay away from this group, instead, making your own research will give true benefits as a trader.  Dont waste your time with this group.",

Might be sorry but I'd come to an assumption that not just most, it is the majority of the signal groups whether it was paid or free signal groups can't be trusted. Why? Because of many scam issues that have been happening, many traders, and newcomers got tricked and lose their money for following them. Now Op that you are trying to promote something and brought it here, well, to ask you what is the assurance that they can give to us? That is very important and one must know the legitimacy of this rather than to make fall into scam trick again.",

The most difficult time to trade is when Bitcoin goes dump or the market in bearish, according to your altcoins analysis when market in bearish conditions, I see you're mostly wrong with your analysis e.g. HNT, OMG, ENS, ALICE. Since you're failed giving signals during the bearish market, I don't need your signals.I wouldn't surprised if your altcoins analysis were correct during bullish market, because most altcoins will bullish too and no need to analysis.",

I left a link to a website, a link to a channel, and even a link to a screenshot.. as a result, you left a screenshot of a completely different channel here, which has nothing to do with Alpha Research. Then what else can you talk about? I don't understand 😄Again, just in case you didn't notice:Website link:https://thealpharesearch.comTelegram channel:https://t.me/TheAlphaResearchOfficialIf possible, you can share the channel with your friends.Screen: https://i.ibb.co/FbMmYdb/alpha.png",

I would even say that all free information is even more suspicious than paid information.. 😂 no matter how strange it sounds. People (especially seasoned traders) are generally very distrustful, as I have noticed. I suppose this is due to your personal bitter experience if you are trying to get to the bottom of everything you can. Some people leave their malicious comments without even bothering to take 5 minutes of their time and just look into this channel to get acquainted with the information that is there. Okay, I think it would be stupid to prove something to you. Everyone will draw their own conclusions for themselves. I just decided to share with you a free channel that did not charge a dime from me or from other people. If you are interested in what is the point of such channels, then I will say this: Not everyone is interested only in their own personal benefit.. I think many people here do not understand this.Thank you for your opinion. Have a nice day everyone 😉",

If you have been trading for a long time and you already have at least some experience, then you should understand how risky trading in highly volatile assets is. Therefore, it is not necessary to say that signals are bad. The same stop loss can prevent you from losing your deposit if it is placed correctly. People trade using the well-known cornix bot on the signals of various telegram channels and make a profit. You can not believe my words, but I would recommend reading the reviews of other people to anyone who is so afraid of trading on signals. As I said above, each person draws his own conclusions based on his experience (in most cases, unsuccessful). 😉",

It's up to you because yes it's your money. Nothing will stop you. It's just that people will tend to prevent because it has a bad impact when we rely on signals whose trading capacity is not the same as the one we trade. If only as a knowledge base, then go ahead. However, if financial benchmarks are an obligation to follow, then think realistically.",
