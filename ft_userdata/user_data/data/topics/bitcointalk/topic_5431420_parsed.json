Putin wanted to put pressure on Ukraine and wanted to set an example of aggression to the world which was the only reason why Russia started the war in the first place. They never wanted to capture the complete Ukraine. They just wanted to make it enough afraid so that it doesn't tries to join NATO and even other countries should restrain from joining it. Eventually they will settle with peace and world trade will be back on track.",

Ukraine would want Russia to leave all its territory including Crimea. And Russia wants international organizations to declare all captured territories as part of Russia. Russia would also want to guarantee that Ukraine would never be a member of NATO and Ukraine might want to join this organization because it's the only protection It has against Russian aggression.Both parties in the war underestimated each other and they have come to realize that the earlier they stop this war the better it would be for their economy and political influence. I want to deeply appreciate Vladimir Putin for putting aside pride and coming out to propose negotiations. I think the next move should be to propose and enforce a ceasefire so that negotiation can start immediately.I support this move wholeheartedly because Ukrainian have suffered so much",

As far as setting records, Russia set all kinds of world records in 'cup stuff', back in the '70s and '80s. If they ever started an internal 'cup operation', many other nations would be dying to enter.

Negotiating doesn't mean Putin has to give up the war, pull out of Ukraine, and then we will negotiate. But that is what's being required of him for negotiations to even start... and other ridiculous stuff. Negotiations means talk, right now. Zelensky is the one who won't negotiate until Putin does some things the Russians won't do, at least without negotiations.

If for example a criminal keeps shooting an innocent people and there's a long lasting man hunt but he keeps escaping from cops. Finally criminal gets tired of running and tries to negotiate with police his terms of surrendering:His terms would be that he will keep shooting far less people if cops stop chasing him and a he gets a free pass from his crimes. After cops says that are you crazy we can't do that, he would call the press saying that police don't let him quit killing.Then would that been a real \"negotiation\" in the first place?",

It worked for a while. But US interference in Ukraine that started the war is thwarting the ideals of peace that Putin was succeeding at.Is the below article a hint that Medvedev will be taking over again? It will mean a real World War if he does.Medvedev: \"World teetering on brink of World War III . . . Nuclear Catastrophe\"Quote from: https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/world/medvedev-world-teetering-on-brink-of-world-war-iii-nuclear-catastrophe\"The only thing that stops our enemies today is the understanding that Russia will be guided by [the doctrine] on nuclear deterrence. And if there is a real threat, we will act,\" Medvedev wrote in his article published on Sunday night – noting that in such a grim scenario there will be nobody left to argue about whether that was \"a retaliatory strike or a preventive one.\"\"Therefore, the Western world is balancing between a burning desire to maximally humiliate, dismember and destroy Russia, on the one hand, and the desire to avoid a nuclear apocalypse, on the other,\" he explained.Until Russia receives the security guarantees it has demanded, the world \"will continue to teeter on the brink of World War III and nuclear catastrophe,\" Medvedev wrote, noting that Moscow is doing and will continue to do \"everything we can to prevent it.\"Last December, Russia presented a list of security proposals to the US and NATO, among other things urging the West to impose a ban on Ukraine entering the military bloc, while insisting that NATO should retreat to its borders of 1997, before it began to expand.After the US and NATO flatly refused, saying they would only be interested in limited strategic arms control talks, it became obvious that Moscow has \"no one to talk to and nothing to negotiate about\" with the West, Medvedev argued. And when in February \"Ukrainian junkies announced their desire to revive their nuclear arsenal,\" Moscow had no other choice but to act, he added.\"Our world has changed, forever. And the main question remains… what kind of future begins today?\" Medvedev wrote.\"New disarmament agreements are currently unrealistic and unnecessary,\" the Russian official reiterated. \"The sooner the guarantees of maximum security that suit our country are received, the sooner the situation will normalize.\"...",
