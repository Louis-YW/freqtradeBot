Actually, they aren't even your coins if you keep them on a custodial wallet and to ove them you need permission from the exchange / real owner.Exchanges must be used only for trades not for storing and, in this uncertain times, better avoid them at all costs.BTW, ~$1b have been withdrawn from binance in the last 24 hours! source",

Not only does the verification not help one bit in securing your coins, but the exchange now holds your identity documents as well. This is valuable data that could be hacked, sold, or leaked online.   Quote from: ajiz138 on December 13, 2022, 06:45:58 PMJust now my friend panicked when he saw about the Binance news but he has realized and moved all bitcoin assets into a private wallet which he holds the key himself. So the only reason your friend moved his coins to a personal wallet is because of the negative news he read about Binance? How hard is it to create a non-custodial wallet and be the sole owner of ones crypto? If the news about Binance was positive or if positive news gets released tomorrow, will your friend move his crypto back into Binance's custody or the custody of some other CEX?

This should be done even before when there’s still no FTX drama and the likes. Because no matter, centralized exchanges will never be good for long term deposits, instead we have to move our funds into our own private trusted wallet. That way, our funds will never be compromised once centralized exchanges will break out and will be involved into another scandalous event that will steal everything we have.

As much as we want to hold our bitcoin safely and free from all hackers and scammers, then it’s a must that we should start avoiding centralized exchanges because they can’t be reliable in the long run. The previous events should have been our best reminders that centralized exchanges are still prone to hacking and scamming no matter how reputable they seem. That is why saving our funds with our own wallet is the best way not to fall for future scamming events within centralized exchanges.",
