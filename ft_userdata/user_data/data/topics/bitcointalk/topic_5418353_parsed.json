Each hardware wallet has its advantages and disadvantages. In choosing a hardware wallet, you should also look for the one that matches the asset you want to store, how to use it, or other criteria that suit your needs. For example, if you have many types of crypto assets, then look for a hardware wallet that supports those crypto assets and has enough storage space for several applications. Another example is if you need a hardware wallet for mobile purposes, look for a flexible one that can connect to a smartphone.I have a Trezor T and a Ledger Nano X for now (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5375482.msg60975015#msg60975015).",

I want to buy one for myself but I don't know which one is the best, I want the best among others, which one is your number one ranking hardware wallet? If there were the best hardware wallet on the market, everyone would want to purchase it, making its producer a wealthy monopolistic asshole who would care neither about its customer nor their privacy and safety. Such a hardware wallet would unlikely be open-source either, which directly contradicts the principles of transparency, free competition, and decentralization inherent to the bitcoin ecosystem and bitcoin itself. Diversity and transparency are preferable when it comes to hardware wallets because it enables producers to improve their product gradually by sharing ideas, implementations, libraries, etc. Constant improvement of a product makes wallets safer and their users more satisfied. Not only is it good for customers themselves and their money, but also it facilitates the global adoption of bitcoin since it shows that the whole industry is mature enough to be part of the world economy.",

I want to buy one for myself but I don't know which one is the best, I want the best among others, which one is your number one ranking hardware wallet? First of all, I will advice you to go for open source hardware wallet: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0The best I have known are Trezor, Keystone and Bitbox02. Bitbox02 is good, but I do not like it because of the AOPP it supports. For privacy reasons in the future, the reason I do not like to recommend the wallet. Trezor physical attack can lead to seed phrase generated on the hardware wallet to be revealed to the attacker, using passphrase with it is advisable to mitigate such attack as it will generate different keys for you. But if you lost the passphrase, just like the seed phrase, your coins are gone.",

You are either a complete ignoramus or you work for them if you make such a statement publicly. What you consider to be the best has already been hacked and in a very trivial way, so there is nothing good in all of this except a low level of security, suspicion, and high risk.More information in this thread -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418172.0",

All three models should have support for the same coins, at least that was the case for S and X, and I doubt that S Plus has something that the previous two models do not have in terms of additional support for some new coin. The difference is in the internal storage, which only allows you to have more coins apps at the same time on X and S Plus than on S.",

And hopefully, in the future, there will be no serious problems. I even use the Ledger Nano X more often than the Trezor T. The battery in any device has a lifespan.

I don't know if you need it for storing Bitcoin or BTC + shitcoins, but there is no one universally best hardware wallet for everyone, ideally hardware wallets should be open source, air-gapped, and constantly tested by users and security experts for bugs and flaws.It's best to stay way from closed source devices even if they are popular, like Safepal, Ellipal and Ledger, and choose something like Passport, Trezor (it's now on discount), Bitbox , etcor just make your own hardware wallet using ESP32 devices or RapsberryPi (SeedSigner).Try to buy wallets in official resellers and with cash whenever you can to avoid your information getting leaked (it happened several times already).",
