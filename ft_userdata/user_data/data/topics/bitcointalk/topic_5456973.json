AFAIK, our cookies that we allow, basically a big loophole in the website which leads hacker directly to your personal data, and i wonder how can web extension wallets can be compromised by it, because they do not have any auto fill option unless you use any third party software which in itself is harmful. Then how the hacker could extract our passwords, well after reading article i think he used our keystroke, processing power, etc information to conclude results. We have been taught by our teacher in Data security that, hackers are so smart now they can understand and easily identify the keystrokes of your keyboard and they can extract the useful data just by the information of your processor's, ram's and network's information. This is really awesome. He seems to be a legend hacker plus he is using his own encryption method to send and receive data under the nose of all firewalls and to decrypt his protocol definitely decrypter might be working and this case really excites me now.",

What's clear, however, is that it's a sophisticated threat with the potential for widespread damage.So double your effort, awareness, and education everything you've had are stake here, and make security your number one concern especially if you are involved in Cryptocurrency.",

The more one tries to upgrade security, the more they are also trying their best to bypass it and introduce more tricky ways of hijacking victims funds and information.So far, so good. I have learned to always avoid some kind of unwanted application on my gadgets, especially those that I don't need. These days, even apps from trusted sites are, to some point, also clones of the original app.We should all just be careful out there, not just for crypto theft's malware but for both our personal data and other financial-related information that could be stolen with the help of those apps.",

The rate at which they invent  malware's just to get their ways into people's privacy is something else. On several occasions I have received mails with clickbait links which are very much suspicious to be scammers and their malware's. It takes a sensitive and smart individual to see such and know what they are up to and possibly do the needful in time to save their details.I basically do download apps from google store but these days, no one can tell the original from the fake anymore as the duplicates are almost similar with no difference. Downloading apps and browser extension these days are not safe anymore if not from a recommended source. One need be careful as to what they download on their gadgets and look link they click these days in other to protect their privacy and other stuffs online or attached to them.",

However, sometimes someone accidentally clicks on an ad on a website, which in fact takes us to a dangerous website and contains a malware. Generally this happens for those who don't feel the need to use antivirus and adsblockers. For those who are hunting for airdrops, faucets, this often appears as a dangerous website from these advertisements, this can also trigger a virus.",

It is basically the people who download from unauthorized sites and cracks from the internet. You can avoid ad's by not clicking them but when you go to a scam website or download some crack software from internet you have to turn of the antivirus and that is what scammers wants. I have a habit of downloading pirated games and softwares now I am well aware of the situation and avoid doing the stuff on my main device.",

In the last couple of years I switch to Mac OS and I'm happy to do that.Because we all know how Windows OS sucks and then if we involved ourselves in crypto, we just don't know. Even if we think we are safe and practice safe hygience, there could still be some loopholes in Windows that this cyber criminals are going to take advantage to inflict malware and then target our crypto wallets.",

I agree, and every year the attack is getting bolder from this cyber criminals and it's really hard to detect this malware. That's why we really need to be vigilant in this times. I mean we don't want to lose our money just like that because we have work hard for that. Majority of us are doing DCA months after months so going to be very difficult to see that one day everything is gone because those hackers was able to install their malware on our machines. So the burden is upon us to be very careful of links or any source of malware, (like downloading from unknown and not secure sites).",

There are Trojans that are encrypted professionally, as they do not appear to anti-virus programs as viruses. We should not rely on anti-virus programs, no matter how powerful they are, as they can only protect our devices by 50%, but the remaining 50% depends on us to immunize our devices to avoid download cracks and unknown programs from YouTube and unknown sites and stores, there are a lot of scam web extensions for wallets, fake phone applications and phishing domains, they target everything that investors and traders use in the crypto space a lot, also two-factor authentication should always be activated in all our accounts and wallets and its application should be on a separate phone or computer, and we should not save passwords in any browser, credit card information, or any sensitive information because if the device is hacked, the browser data will be in the hands of the fraudster on a plate of gold.",
