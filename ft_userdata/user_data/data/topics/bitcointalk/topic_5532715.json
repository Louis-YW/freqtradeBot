  "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been experimenting with Bitcoin debit cards and wanted to share what I’ve learned. I know a lot of people here prefer to hold, but for those who like to spend BTC directly, these cards actually make it a lot easier.  Instead of manually converting Bitcoin to fiat, these cards do it at the time of purchase. I tested a few in different situations, and here’s what I found:  - Bybit Card worked perfectly at a clothing store. The transaction was instant, and I even got some cashback.  - KAST Card (though it only works with stablecoins) was super smooth for an eBay purchase. Had to convert BTC to USDC first, but once that was done, it worked without issues.  - A friend of mine in Colombia uses RedotPay all the time and says it’s great for managing expenses while spending Bitcoin.  - Crypto.com card surprisingly didn’t work on Uber. Not sure why—maybe someone here knows?  I go into more detail about the experience in a video I made:https://youtu.be/5f1-8yy0cXk . Not trying to shill anything, just sharing what worked and what didn’t.  Anyone else using a Bitcoin debit card? Have you run into any issues, or do you have a favorite?",

I tested a few in different situations, and here’s what I found:   I have never done anything like this because I believe it is better to hold than to spend something with bitcoin and perhaps in my own country the use of the card to transact with bitcoin directly is still quite limited. I think it really depends on the situation because for me bitcoin is much more ideal for storing than buying things with it. I believe bitcoin will grow in the future so it would be a shame to use it to buy things with it.The level of vulnerabilities in the usage may still need to be refined so that people can use the card for purchasing. My question is how much bitcoin do you have that spending things with it becomes something that is more important to do or maybe you are just testing a few of these cards.",

Because if it’s crypto.com then it’s on their system but if every other didn’t work as well on Uber then maybe Uber doesn’t really accept this kind of payment method or maybe it’s not compatible to crypto.comI have not much experience with bitcoin debit card but from what I know, it basically converts your crypto to fiat and works anywhere that accepts credit cards so it’s not that complicated. Or at least should not be.",

Also I want to know if the bybit card will be sent to my location directly or it is a online shopping card only? I will wait for your reply. It feels so sleek and smooth to use BTC to pay for items online, it far more comfortable especially if you are not from a dollar backed country like the United states.",

I have never used a Bitcoin debit card in my whole life. This is because my country is unfriendly to the crypto industry. We have few ATMs, maybe not more than five in the whole country. I don't also see any reason for using Bitcoin debit card for daily transactions because it is expensive and also highly centralized.

Maybe he doesn't care about the extra money he spends. It is also possible that he is doing it for research purposes, seeing that he has referred us to his videos on YouTube.",

Won't you feel regrets for wasting BTC on purchases, when the BTC price goes to the moon?For me I don’t like using bitcoin for daily transactions and my reasons aren’t because they actually would increase in price later but because of the transaction fees and I think for local transactions I see using fiat debit cards are actually cheaper and hassle free, as for cross boarder transactions which involves the change between two different fiat currencies I think bitcoin stands out. For me there is absolutely nothing wrong with using bitcoin for transactions, if you’re actually interested in using bitcoin as an investment then you will have that separate from these bitcoins which are on an hot wallet.

If you have passed the KYC of bybit and have been using the exchange for a while it is easier to get the virtual card from exchange because it is Your KYC details that will be used. I have forgotten the requirements but basically is something not that hard. As for the payment the one I have encountered is the stablecoin (USDT to be specific) but I think if you have more than one asset on the card it depends on the option you picked from the payment dashboard you’re probably paying to. If it is BTC it will be BTC that will be withdrawn, if it’s other asset they will also be withdrawn too.",
