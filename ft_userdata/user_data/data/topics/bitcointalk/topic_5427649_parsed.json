  "content": "ABAS TokenTokenized bitcoin PoW mineable with Staking on the Arbitrum One Blockchain.https://abastoken.orgLink to ABAS DiscordABAS Token is a ERC20 adaptation for the Arbitrum One Chain of the original 0xbitcoin project on Ethereum along with Vether for auctions and Synethix for Staking rewards . The reason why ABAS is born: after the DeFi massive widespread on the Ethereum mainnet, gas fees for transactions have become too high. This has a relevant and heavy impact on all the projects, and particularly if considering mined-tokens: submitting solutions and claiming rewards have become too expensive.The alternative is offered by the Layer 2 Chains: with its low gas fees, fastness and smart-contract execution capabilities, it is the most suitable environment to give rebirth to bitcoin through the tokenized minable asset ABAS.  Along with a new idea for mining called slow mining, the longer the reward takes to solve the greater the reward.  Since hashrate isn't used to secure the network, we can reward slower answers and by design uses less hash power, allowing the token to be dual mined with any other Cryptocurrency.To further penalize fast answers a Ethereum fee per mint is introduced for miners that faster they mint, the more Ethereum they pay the contract (that gets distributed to future miners(50%) and stakers(50%)ABAS token features:Arbitrum One BlockChainContract address: 0x0B549125fbEA37E52Ee05FA388a3A0a7Df792Fa7Token symbol: ABASToken decimals: 18Total supply: 52 500 000ChainID: 42161 (Arbitrum One)Start mining now (SOLO MINING!! no pools yet):You can download the Windows CPU & GPU miner hereor here on GithubDownload the Linux GPU on Github hereTarget contract address: 0x0afaF0C46B1cA13B204a516BF5c0314674f4930DYou have to use an address with some ETH on the Arbitrum One blockchain to pay the (small) gas fees.Start with MinABASPerMint: 3.5 and move it up to your prefered level.Tested both with CPU (Intel/AMD) and GPU (NVIDIA, older and newer).
