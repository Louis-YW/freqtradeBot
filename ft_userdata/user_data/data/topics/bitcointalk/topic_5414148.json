So always use the stock firmware if you don't want to get lots of issues from your miner.",

Another thing is that their website looks like Cloud mining they design it as a marketplace but don't have a physical product. About looking for most stronger or you mean has fewer issues then units from Canaan would the best choice according to this.",
