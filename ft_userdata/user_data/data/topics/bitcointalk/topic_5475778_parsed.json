The event's psychology is to give consumers greater purchasing power and encourage unnecessary spending.For example, a lot of individuals or bitcoin holders may sell significant amounts of their cryptocurrency during this time because they wish to purchase items that will affect their investments. Black Friday deals can affect your plan to hold bitcoins, and as an investor, you have to be careful and be disciplined enough to control yourself.Have you purchased any item during this time?, was it a need or a want?Did you have to use some or a significant amount of your bitcoins?",

Black Friday deals can affect your plan to hold bitcoins, and as an investor, you have to be careful and be disciplined enough to control yourself.The cardinal way to control your expenses is to have a budget and follow it diligently. If I don't have a plan to buy anything during this period, nothing can change my stand. A good investor is one who is not moved by enticing adverts because he is self-controlled. I also have my investment budget, expenses budget and emergency funds. My emergency funds might be tampered with in rare cases, but my investment is a no-go area until the projected time to liquidate the funds.    QuoteHave you purchased any item during this time?, was it a need or a want?Did you have to use some or a significant amount of your bitcoins?Black Friday is indeed a good time to buy things at a discounted price. But it depends on how important the item the person intends to buy after selling his coin. In some cases, people buy what they don't really need because of the discounted rate. Some people might decide to sell their coins because they have planned to maximize the discount offered on Black Friday. I plan to purchase a power bank and install a solar backup power source if the price is good. But I have already kept the money for the purchase, hence no need to sell any coins.",

Withdrawals sometimes take days to process depending on the exchange, so there's a possibility that selling and cashing out might not be fast enough to catch the deal on time. (But this is a non-issue if you have credit cards.)",

We are expecting a bull run and liquidating a part of your investment for black Friday deals doesn't sound smart to me no matter what the reasons may be. It only shows that the holder lacks the ability to delay gratification. QuoteHave you purchased any item during this time?, was it a need or a want?I doubt the genuineness  of these black Friday deals. I hear their discounts aren't actually any discounts.

      "body": "It can be really tempting to take advantage of the Black Friday deals and just liquidate your Bitcoin so you can purchase that one thing you've always dreamed of getting but for some reason couldn't but I don't think that's necessary. For one, before investing in Bitcoin, you must have had spare cash, right? So why touch the investment when I can use cash or better yet, wait for another Black Friday sale? I mean, one more waiting won't kill anyone right? The essence of holding these coins is so we can wait for when it's ripe so we can sell to have a greater gain but just because we want to take advantage of the cheap prices of things thanks to Black Friday doesn't have to make us sell. It then defeats the purpose of holding.  If you can just pause for a minute when you get that rush to purchase those things you feel trading your BTC is worthy for, you'd find that most times it's only a want and not a need.",

But if not, I won't buy it and will probably just keep it in my order basket. I'm still training myself to be able to save money and Bitcoin because I want to get big returns like yesterday's ATH.So it's not because of Black Friday that I buy things but because I need them. But I often miss the Black Friday moment by not buying anything. And that allows me to save some money for sudden needs. I can still stop myself from buying things I don't need. That's because I still use existing items to this day.And I also don't sell my Bitcoins for unnecessary things. I still want to buy more Bitcoin.

The feasible approach should be to prepare some cash to accumulate more bitcoin if there is any correction in the future.

Your investment funds and your monthly expenses should be managed differently. Let your asset grow in value, then with the profit do whatever you want to do or keep that asset as collateral and take a loan in fiat or stable currencies. This way you can fulfill your desires without selling any assets.",

The whole point of making money is to have a better life. A better life isn't a life of only getting what you need, it's also about getting what you want. If I want a new laptop and I can afford it without much trouble, so I shouldn't get a new one despite the fact the the one I have is old but still manageable even if it's giving me problems?

You can't keep all the coins in one wallet. You cat keep the coins you plan to HODL for a very long time together with the use you trade with (for trader) and the ones you spend often in one walletm I don't think that is wise.
