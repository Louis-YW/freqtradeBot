Try to increase the fee.\" This might be that you tried to do an RBF and you set the transaction fee low, the transaction fee for an RBF transaction needs to have a higher transaction fee than the first transaction so as to have nodes replace it base on fee Quote from: billybobjones on November 16, 2023, 09:55:38 PMAnd now my wallet balance has a Red Circle and says unconfirmed but it was literally green and confirmed 2 days ago. Any help plz. The red clock shown right next means that there is an incoming transaction and this will turn to green again when the confirmation of the incoming transactions are 6",

      "body": "Some bitcoin users do make one mistake that make them to have this type of complaint. Assuming you have 1 BTC and you want to send 0.3 BTC each to three people. Why not send it at ones? Okay, you may have a valid reason and want to send it individually. Assuming you want to send it individual, do not forget that if you first send 0.3 BTC to the first person, you will have 0.6 BTC on your change address. If the transaction you sent is not yet confirmed, sending from the remaining 0.6 BTC will become a child transaction while your first transaction will become the parent transaction. Also if you send to the third person, you will keep on building unconfirmed transactions that have parent.You can go to the first transaction and submit its txid on ViaBTC free accelerator if you meet the criteria: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ and once it is confirmed, you can do so for the second, and then the third and so forth. Each will be confirmed after ViaBTC mine a block.Or just use a very high fee on another transaction that you will just broadcast, a fee that would be able to confirm all your transactions at ones. If you can not calculate it, you can give us the txids to help you calculate the fee you will use for RBF.",

(look at the balance next to amount)Then, bump that child with a very high fee that'll make miners consider including its parent transactions to their block (basically a manual CPFP)Without the txids, only you can compute for the best fee rate to use.But based from the current state of mempools, now is not a good time to bump unless you're in a rush.",
