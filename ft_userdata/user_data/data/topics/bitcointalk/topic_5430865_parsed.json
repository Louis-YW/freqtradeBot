Why a new exchange that you do not know about and you deposit your coins on the exchange? This is one of the scam that is no more new, but people are still falling for it.Quote from: greppi13 on December 21, 2022, 01:45:02 PMIs this exchange legit?An exchange that is not even a month old yet, that brings suspicion.Quote from: greppi13 on December 21, 2022, 01:45:02 PMGoogle says nothingGoogle advertise scam as usual and no reply for your report nor taking the site down if many people do not report the site. Google breeds scam.Quote from: greppi13 on December 21, 2022, 01:45:02 PMThe reason I asked is that the exchange has disabled my withdrawals and the customer service person is demanding more deposits becouse of third party account which helped me with deposit. This brings it to clarity that the exchange is a scam. They would also have luring offers like high bonus.Quote from: greppi13 on December 21, 2022, 01:55:14 PMAre you really sure?

Let me guess, an internet stranger introduced the exchange to you? and each time you profit, you were encouraged to come back with more money? and now they have halted the withdrawals. It's a very popular scam, if you bring the money they're asking, they will just ask for more so don't give any cent or your personal documents.If you don't mind me asking how much did you end up depositing?",

It is sad for me.I deposit it about 60K USD.SO there is no way to see the money?It's not impossible but the chances are typically not favorable on your side as a lot of these scammers obfuscate their tracks. You could start an investigation but know that it doesn't guarantee answers to the questions who and where. Further, legal proceedings are also to be expected when trying to recover money. This shouldn't stop you from reporting to your local authorities tho. It's free and maybe it could be of some help someday.Another thing you could try is to look if this type of scam is tax deductible in your country, see: https://koinly.io/guides/",

Since you withdrew your funds from Crypto.com, you should have some kind of withdrawal history page where you can check the addresses you withdrew your funds to along with the transaction ID.I'm not an expert in legal matters, but if you can link that address to a centralized exchange (like Binance for example) then you can probably seek help from law enforcement. I'm not sure what they can do after getting his identity though, especially if the scammer is not from the Czech Republic.",

How can I start the investigation?Frankly, I'm unsure whether this is worth pursuing but I guess it wouldn't hurt to get a free consultation. I only know one blockchain analysis company who work for individuals, they're called coinfirm.com. If you go to their website to schedule a free consultation, there's a category called reclaim crypto that you can opt for which is pretty self-explanatory. Afaik they have also partnered with kroll.com for this.
