It follows nasdaq closely because those are mostly tech stocks and Bitcoin is obviously tech related.During Covid crash it was risk off mode and the panic of the stock market turned onto the crypto markets. Then when the stimulus hit the risk on from the stock market followed the crypto markets. Until the fed rate hikes and both stocks and crypto went down. So macro is very important right now for crypto.",

But there are other factors that will also affect the price even though it comes from outside, let's call it FUD, the collapse of several large banks, or there are major events related to the economy for example. This will more or less affect the price of bitcoin.",

If the whales decide to buy, the prices rise. If they panic, the prices fall. It is that simple. Miners have very little impact on the prices because the block rewards are pretty small now and it will even get smaller after the next halving.The central bank interest rates seems to have a considerable effect on the asset prices as well. The more the interest rates rise, the more people lose their interest in the other investment options.",

As bitcoin is stated to be 21million, once the price is achieved or almost achieved the price might increase because many will demand it.Another factor is the cost and maintenance of mining tools once this gets expensive then it can greatly influence bitcoin market.They’re also regulations or restrictions from bitcoin, economical factors like recession which when faced could prompt many to sell and could badly affect the price of bitcoin.The most common one is scams by other altcoins or exchange crashes. When altcoins falls some investors run towards bitcoin while some that lack the knowledge of bitcoin tag it as same and could go out of it. Exchange crashes affects its price when many who actually store their bitcoin on the exchange losses it.",

Positive sentiment can drive the price up, while negative sentiment can drive it down.News and events: Any significant news or events related to bitcoin, such as a major company announcing plans to accept it as a form of payment, can also affect its price.Supply and demand: The basic economic principle of supply and demand also applies to bitcoin. If demand for bitcoin increases while the supply remains the same, the price will go up.Regulation: Government regulations and legal developments related to bitcoin can also impact its price.Competition from other cryptocurrencies: As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and grow, competition from other digital currencies can also affect the price of bitcoin.Market manipulation : Unscrupulous traders and investors can use various tactics to artificially inflate or deflate the price of bitcoin.",

Also it's very obvious that potential of future earnings from that asset is also a factor in bitcoin you can say the potential of future adoption will be that factor. In the other smaller time frames, obviously it's news, new developments, whale play, legalities and all these things. In very small time frames it's generally just market makers actions.",

On the supply side, there is a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins. Despite this, it is more scarce and there millions of bitcoins that are lost. We know that some people may have lost their private keys etc While on the deman side - market sentiments is what drives it.When there is hack it affects price, when businesspeople try to make bitcoin more accessible to the public the price of bitcoin is affected. etc These are to the best of my knowledge the factors that affect bitcoins price.",

All of that will affect the interest of investors and traders which in turn has an impact on demand and supply. Basically this is very general question, so I think you can get quite number of reasons if you do keyword search [like your topic title].Next, you may ask what makes it worthless. But try to read further because basically bitcoin is a very volatile asset. Also it is relatively new currency and of course it is always possible to fail at some point such as technical failure and currency competition.",

These are some examples that we consider, fundamental analysis somehow is a good strategy for looking after the market when it comes to predicting the price.
