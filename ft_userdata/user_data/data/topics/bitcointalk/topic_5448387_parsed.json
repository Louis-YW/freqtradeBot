  "content": "The apartment complex which I am currently living at censored my very short cryptocurrency message that I posted on the bulletin board twice. Of course, this is not because I have broken the rules because HALF OF THE OTHER MESSAGES THERE ARE ALSO BREAKING THE RULES. The only reason that they are now censoring my message is that they hate what I am doing. They hate that I have obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics and have been doing the mathematical research to make sure that cryptocurrency technologies are being used to solve the most important scientific problem. I will not stand for this. This is absolutely asinine.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.-Creator of Circcash",

      "body": "My neighbors probably have a grudge against cryptocurrency technologies and innovation in general because they are boomers. Remember that the boomers grew up in the 1970's which means that they grew up in a high crime era when people did not know how to act responsibly. And don't forget how the boomers all have a lot of brain damage from the lead poisoning from all the leaded gasoline. This is why every time anyone reasonable interacts with a boomer, the boomer always comes off as very nasty and unpleasant. The people raised by boomers are also incredibly unpleasant. Now that the coronavirus pandemic has passed, people in general have been getting nastier and nastier. Now, it is nearly impossible for me to have a decent conversation with anyone.I just talked to the people at the office, and they were unwilling to give me any information about any of the rules for posting things on the bulletin board. They were instead exceedingly rude and hostile. Maybe they hate me because I posted the message twice on 3 by 5 cards just to make sure that they did not take the message down by mistake. I then posted a third message simply saying END CENSORSHIP. I will not be posting anything else on the bulletin board, but I will be letting all the neighbors know that this is not alright. And I really need to get out of Florida.Regards,-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Unfortunately, due to low demand, you cannot find Circcash on any exchanges at the moment (since people refuse to understand that reversible computing is actually important and Circcash can help with reversible computing). You can just go to circcashcore.org/downloads to download and mine Circcash on your CPU.",

Nobody would like that! Of course, that would mean that you would have to start computerizing everything - making computers out of all materials - not only standard computer or quantum computer materials.

      "body": "BADecker-That is an interesting hypothesis. I mean, there is no evidence for such a hypothesis, but at least your hypothesis gives them the benefit of the doubt. But I am not blaming my neighbors for this act, since this was clearly done by the people at the office.We have two options. We can either have a future of reversible computation, quantum computation, and artificial intelligence or we can have a future with no technology since humans go extinct. But I agree that researchers should make a good effort to make these technologies as safe as possible. One way to make AI systems safer will be to make their inner workings more understandable, interpretable, and predictable. In my research for the cryptocurrency Circcash, I have developed machine learning algorithms such as word embedding, graph embedding (even dynamic graph embedding), and dimensionality reduction algorithms that often converge to the same local maximum regardless of the initial conditions. Since the gradient ascent tends to converge to the same local maximum, we can successfully predict what would happen if we run the machine learning algorithm again. I have also developed a matrix-valued word embedding where one represents tokens as matrices instead of vectors. I believe that matrix-valued word embeddings will be safer for natural language processing than vector-valued word embeddings; vectors are good for encoding specific meanings and contexts of tokens while matrices are good for encoding a quantum superposition of all the meanings and contexts of a token. Matrix-valued word embeddings will likely be more interpretable than vector-valued word embeddings since with matrix-valued word embeddings, it is easier to see how the matrix corresponds to the specific meanings and contexts of a word. Circcash is committed to AI safety.Circcash is also committed to identifying threats and using AI and blockchain technologies to mitigate threats whenever possible. This is why I am the only entity who is outspoken about how bio-safety level 4 labs need to publicly post cryptographic timestamps of all their records. After these timestamps are public, it is easy to put them on blockchains. This will allow lab incidents to be investigable even if there are many powerful agents working hard to cover up the laboratory incident.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of Circcash,",

I was simply reminded of some of the postulating done by Nassim Haramein - https://nassimharamein.com/.Personally, I think that we are going to have to move out of the current stagnant physics theories into something much advance if we intend to keep computer operations alive.The fact of Cause and Effect in everything (when combining C&E with complexity), shows us that there is an Entity that is above all things, controlling and creating all things. Quantum computing is simply a step into the direction of realistically touching on that Entity's fields of operation... as a small child might work with its master parent.Problems will come about from scientists who are unwilling to recognize that this Entity exists, and will try to do things without the Entity's 'approval'.",

Now, it is nearly impossible for me to have a decent conversation with anyone.That means children of people who grew up in the 70s. This means our generation. The people who were born in the 80s and 90s and raised by boomers. I hope you realize that at least half of this forum falls into this category. I wasn't raised by boomers, because my parents are much older (born in the early 50s), but I'm friends with a lot of people raised by boomers and the majority of them can't find common ground with their parents when it comes to jobs, earning money, work stability and investing. I wouldn't call them unpleasant though.

But do you even understand Circcash? Do you understand reversible computation? I do not think you do because you have an extremely negative attitude against Circcash. You are not quite as bad as the chlurmcklets who love censoring me, but please learn about reversible computation. I am not willing to pay any exchange with money that has not been donated to me because I do not trust exchanges with Circcash. Exchanges refuse to trade Circcash because they are untrustworthy and unable to recognize that Circcash is the only cryptocurrency with a mining algorithm that is actually designed to solve an important scientific problem.\"When it comes to the board, maybe just change the apartment instead of moving out of state.\"-But the entire state of Florida is messed up. The USA should build a wall between Florida and the rest of the USA.I was raised by boomers as well. My parents went through a divorce when I was a kid because they lack social skills. I went to f***ed up violent public schools. I am a millennial. I have no friends. So I am perfectly content at insulting my own generation because they deserve it.

The fact that He is allowing such a thing as cryptography, shows that He is playing peoples' own games with them with the hopes that a few of them, anyway, will come to believe in Him and be saved through the crypto idea somehow.So, you won't be able to deliver, even if you really wanted to.",

God wants what people want, as long as people are faithful to Him. So, He wants crypto because some of His faithful people want it. But what He wants even more is faith in His Son, Jesus, so that they can be saved. This involves advertising such, right out in the open, which is exactly the opposite of encrypting it.Playing with the idea of a few piddly advancements in cryptography being able to hold a candle to God is simpleton talk. So, why would anyone want anyone else to develop a divine digital signature? Even the meaning of 'divine digital signature algorithm' is incomprehensible, to say nothing about impossible (probably). God allows a lot, but He as told us that as high as the Heaven are above the earth, so are His thoughts above our thoughts and His ways above our ways.",
