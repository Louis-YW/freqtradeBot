In our personal lives, we are a large number of people who can work according to routine life, the reason is that due to various problems in our life, we go out of our dreams or routine and because of not being able to solve the problems, so we cannot follow the routine.",

It is extremely hard to find a source out there for the crypto space that is really trying to give people a neutral and genuine help in order to make profit. All those influencers are just acting in order to increase their own bag, by shilling projects that they already have invested in and then dumping on their followers.So it is very much possible, that a newbie follows a crypto influencer that is shilling the 10000th useless meme-coin to him and the newbie then buys it and after 2 weeks all of his money is gone because obviously it was just another shit-coin again.",

High rewards are somewhat attractive that could influence new investors but they neglect the scam risk and could lose their money in an instant. What we need I guess is proper education, I'd see this as a very effective way to stop spreading fake news and information about Bitcoin. And this could create clear views for those who are in doubt about Bitcoin as it was too different from what we heard and read online, especially in social media platforms.",

Kidding aside, it is indeed really easy to create a scam token, as well as market it to people using social media influencers that are dumb enough to market it for some reason. If you guys want some examples, go watch some of Coffeezilla's videos about crypto scams and the like, great watch and break down the projects and why they're a scam basically. Tbf though, some real developers out there can still scam the hell out of you, so whether they are a dev with experience or not, if the project stands to be good then I reckon all is fine.

If that is so easy then that means it should be very very tough to invest into a new project, because that project could be like one I could make, or it could be a great one. I rather not invest into anything that hasn't been around for a while. When you are trying to make any type of research into any project, all the things you look in them would be obvious after 6 months, so why try to \"guess\" something when you can invest later on. If a project won't go up much after the first 6 months, then it wasn't worth it investing before that neither.",

Great one for your input in those salient information you supplied there. However, you missed the one which encompasses them all and that's \"Patience\". Anyone who's patient and takes things slowly will hardly fall prey to the modern day scam. Most of these scammers adopt almost the same format to dupe their victims. Once anyone isn't in a hurry, they will eventually discover those hidden gimmicks scammers use. So, we just have to prefix \"patience\" to all the points you listed and see how they turn; nicely, right?",
