  "content": "Original Topic: Why people should be using SegWit addressesAuthor:1miau Four years ago, the SegWit (https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Segregated_Witness) don dey  and one of the koko benefits be say the transaction fees go reduce, transactions wey dey come from SegWit addresses dey attract lower fees.The Bitcoin addresses get many different formats. If you look at the beginning of the address, you go see the prefix. This fit show you the kind of address wey e be.PrefixCategoryFormat_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________1…Legacy-AddressP2PKH (pay to public key hash)3…Multisignature-AddressP2SH (pay to script hash)_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________3…nested SegWit-AddressP2WPKH-P2SH (pay to witness public key hash - pay to script hash) / P2WSH-P2SH (pay to witness script hash - pay to script hash)_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________bc1q…native SegWit-Address (bech32)P2WPKH-bech32 (pay to witness public key hash) / P2WSH-bech32 (pay to witness script hash)bc1p…Taproot-AddressP2TR-bech32m (pay to tap root)1... the addresses wey dey start with 1 na the regular standard Bitcoin address. The addresses wey get dis prefix  no be  SegWit.3... If address start with 3, e fit be  either SegWit or multisignature address. The only way to know whether na SegWit address or multisignature address na to check the details of the outgoing transaction.bc1... The addresses wey start with bc1q na di native SegWit addresses. The ones wey start with bc1p na the Taproot addresses... The addresses na  always  SegWit.A simple explanation about how to know whether  address na SegWit address, you fit check here:  BTC addresses starting with \"3\" what are they ? simplified explanation.Native SegWit or nested SegWit? After reading wetin dey above, e go make you know wetin be the benefits of using SegWit addresses, but you fit still dey ask wetin dey different between native SegWit address (bech32, starts with bc1q...) / Taproot Address (bech32m, starts with bc1p) and nested SegWit address (P2WPKH-P2SH / P2WSH-P2SH, starts with 3....). For us, e dey important make we know say using native SegWit address or Taproot address go give us even lower fees pass using nested SegWit address.Sending from nested SegWit address (3...) compared to normal legacy address (1...) go dey 26% or more cheaper. Sending from native SegWit address (bc1q...) compared to normal legacy address (1...) go dey 38% or more cheaper. The exact amount of percentage wey you go save depend on how many inputs the address get, so if the address get many inputs, you fit save more.In November 2022 we get new type of address wey dem call Taproot-Address (bc1p...). E dey the same level with native SegWit address (bc1q...) when we talk about fee savings. If you dey use Taproot-Address send, the fee go be around 38% or more cheaper pass if you dey use normal legacy address (1...). You fit see exact details about savings wey Taproot go bring by visiting here, provided by Charles-Tim.One of the main reasons why native SegWit and Taproot dey similar na because dem both come from the same Witness Programm (bech32 / bech32m).Wetin be additional advantages for using SegWit address? In addition to the lower transaction fees wey you go get for your own transactions, you go also help the Bitcoin network when you use  SegWit address because more transactions go fit into one block so, the Bitcoin network go fit process more transactions per second, and dis go benefit every participant.Any disadvantage dey? If you don use Bitcoin for some centralized services, and you wan send am to your own bech32 SegWit address, dem fit reject am as invalid because some of the websites wey dey centralized never update. Dem no go fit recognize this new bech32 address format. However, this one only apply to bech32 addresses, but not nested SegWit address. Nested SegWit address dey compatible for everywhere. Most of the services dey go eventually fully support bech32 address format. This one na just information incase you dey confused about why some centralized services dey reject (BTC) bech32 addresses. You fit see the different address formats wey different platforms and services dey support, by visiting this link: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoptionStats wey dey interesting about SegWitAs with other aspects of Bitcoin, we get statistical data wey dey valuable about SegWit, like the information wey dey available for transactionfee.info.On top the other information, you fit find the share of Bitcoin transactions wey dey use SegWit:https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments-spending-segwit/Currently dey around 86%.https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/Note: the total numbers of native SegWit (bech32, purple and dark blue) no too high compared to nested SegWit (light blue and orange)ConclusionAs a matter of fact, choosing a bech32 SegWit address go be your best option for the long term. The advantages of using bech32 address dey important. The biggest advantage na say the fees dey lower, and e go also make the Bitcoin network dey more efficient.",

It is for translation purposes, this is a normal thing in almost every local board on this forum.As you or if you are a Nigeria and very good with the Nigerian pigin English, you are free to find important and very informative threads from the global boards, like the bitcoin discussion board, Development & Technical Discussion board, Meta board and so on.. And translate that thread and post it here in the local board, not forgetting to mention the author of the thread you translated, and also link to the original thread.I believe you understand the explanation and that this should clear every doubt you have or had.",

I really commend you for this efforts of yours to making sure that this topic is translated into our local parlance for members to see it and read. Fir the first time I am seeing this topic and I must say it is educative and expository. Anyone who wants to really understand how the segwit works should be able to see this here and to read it as well. I can attest that this would assist our members from the local board understand more about the Bitcoin segwit wallet address functionality and how to use it.",
