  "content": "Crypto projects have two options during the bear, to crash [Terra memories] or to continue building, given the data from the projects that launched on 2018, the stability and credibility from those or the ones that have ridden a bear market is normally higher. After some of the ridiculous yield platforms that we saw during the bull cycle , with impossible APYs [1000000%] , the market has settled and people are a little bit more aware about what is a serious project and I want to share with you my latest finding: Farm XYZFarm XYZ turns all the diverse yield farming opportunities into XASSETS. It makes investing in any farming instrument just like you do when investing in a token. This interface will create an ETF-like structure that emits ERC20 tokens as shares on top of a fund.https://farm.xyzTell me what you think about it and also, which are your latest findings?",
