I guess they have a few staking options; you just have to check them out for yourself, but you can't expect the rewards to be the same as those of the centralized exchanges, where you have a greater risk; the higher the risk, the higher the reward.",

It is very risky and another risk from staking which is basic in DeFi is impermanent loss.By staking, you have to lock your coins and receive staking reward gradually. Many things can happen with that project during staking time, also for the centralized exchange with its staking pool. That project can rug pull or will have high inflation. Staking basically causes inflation and it's not easy to control inflation with staking. Uniswap, Pancakeswap failed to control inflation in the last three years and their tokens lost value.",

You never know what they are hiding behind your back; maybe they are backing up your private keys and phrases in their database.Check out the list of . Open source hardware wallet  by dkbit98 so that you can choose any preferred one from there, but most of them don't support ERC-20 tokens and talk more about staking, so if you want to stake your coins as I have suggested, you can use Metamask, but desktop and online wallets are not secured to some extent because of phishing and other forms of malware penetration.",

But in reality, they do change and decrease overtime when more people take part to stake in these. Much worse is you're giving custody to the wallet where you'll be staking these altcoins you've got. That's why it's just better be set to hold it as you've got the keys.",

There's no way to verify if the smart contract is legit and has a very good security, not to mention trust wallet is a closed source wallet and no one actually know all the codes behind that.

I can't even remember the last time I heard someone mention that coin or make a reference to it.Some projects really needs to learn to be dynamic and innovative otherwise they will just be left behind and eventually be forgotten. @op staking is okay provided the exchange is trustworthy, the apr is appealing and stays that way. Also try to keep in touch with the projects latest update to be aware of what is currently happening with them.",

You can go here - https://staking.polkadot.network/?utm_source=polkadot.network#/overview and there explanation about staking here - https://polkadot.network/features/staking/and 100 Dot is a lot in my opinion to join nominee you need 250 DOT but to join pool you only need 1",
