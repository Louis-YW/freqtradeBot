  "content": "Lost fan errorI have tried to change the 4 original fans of the s17 pro by noctua 3000 rpm fans but it puts me in error, the asic doesn't start, but the fans are running. I have rebooted, reset, put back the Os (hiveon) but nothing. I put the old fans back in and still the same problem. I don't know if it's important but I'd made sure to put them in the same place.thanks",

Incidently, Bitmain fans usually spin up to 6000RPM, so these may not be a suitable replacement.I've had several compatibility issues with 17-series miners and fans (even using fans purchased directly from Bitmain). I found that I had to use custom firmware that forces 100% fan speeds to get them hashing...",

      "body": "Before you get copy and paste the kernel logs here make sure that you flash your unit with stock firmware. I don't have experience using Hiveon OS I usually use this OS only for GPU mining.Also, check the fan terminals and plug maybe it has some dirt and is full of rust try to clean it with any motherboard cleaner like Lacquer flo thinner/lighter fluid. If you have a multimeter better check terminals if it's shorted or has no resistance.",
