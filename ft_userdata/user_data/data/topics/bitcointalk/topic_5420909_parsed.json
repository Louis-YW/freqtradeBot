I also heard rumors that crypto.com is also having problems, it looks like they are intentionally rigging funds after binance released proof of reserve to show transparency. Some people have said that they cannot withdraw money on crypto.com, and the price of the crypto's native token has also dropped by 25% according to rumors. It is a sensitive time, it is best that we do not leave our money on centralized exchanges, and withdraw to a non-custodial wallet to ensure safety.",

Tbh, anyone that still had money on any CEX after what has happened with FTX is simply asking for trouble.Quote from: noorman0 on November 14, 2022, 05:43:00 AMGood if they care about security.

I hope that AAX (take note of the X too ðŸ¤”) isn't affiliated to SBF's business. This whole Luna and FTX crashes have made the market vulnerable at this time. A November that I've speculated to rally up is now digging for the southern pole. It's even looking safer to short Bitcoin than to long it now.",

They also mentioned that funds and assets are safe [is it just me, or do they seem to be making random excuses now?]!",

Your title looks like a warning that another exchange is potentially running away. You should not create a headline like that because you know that CEX halting withdrawal is hot topic now and always incorporated on potential fund lose of its user. This is just a typical scheduled maintenance and most of the exchange do this with a couple of hour.You are just adding fuel to the current fire on crypto by doing this even though the content is just the normal routine of an exchange. This exchange not a top exchange, I doubt there action is important to the community.",

This is really serious matter need to take on and we should never put any huge money on exchange even if they are so trusted or successful on their operations because what happen to FTX might happen to other and also with more smaller ones like AAX exchange.",
