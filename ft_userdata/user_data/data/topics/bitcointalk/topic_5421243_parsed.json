Thank you for sharing.I still want to stand on my request for an admin to create an official dark theme mode that doesn't rely on 3rd party software for convenience and safety purposes of accounts. This https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4423230.0 color combination for Dark mode is the best so far. Since the other theme shows the high contrast on signature and avatar color.Leaving this thread open for a while.",

      "body": "I just thought that I've seen this a couple of times ; especially, as yours doesn't correlate to the sort that an OP even had to include codes in their request to Theymos.... Then I'd be like WTF? Means Theymos doesn't code? But No!! That's wasn't it. He just wanted to make sure that his points are understood properly and that atleast -- he knows what he's doing.Back to base: The GitHub link ain't working any longer?... dark mode is something everyone would prefer just to reduce some eye strain, yeah. You don't need a third party software huh? So if you'd say the word \" convenience\" , I'd accept but how bout safety? Does anyone need to log on in, just to switch modes? That'll be an unnecessary bug in the expense of an OPs time, right?Edit: ion even think it works that way so, Maybe you should take out time to explore? That'll be great.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

In particular, non-default themes are disabled for now.Quote from: AbuBhakar on November 16, 2022, 10:59:22 AMDoes any of the old account experienced using that feature before when it's still functional?I wasn't part of this forum at that time, but \"someone mentioned its name\" on the above thread and there are a few threads about it as well [e.g. here's one]...BlackBox themeDemo",
