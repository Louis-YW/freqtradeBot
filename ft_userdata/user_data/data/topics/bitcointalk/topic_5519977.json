Though i agree with the saying,  (“not your keys, not your Bitcoin”), not everyone has the technical know-how to keep their holdings secure.

Add to that Trump’s pro-Bitcoin comments, and the future of Bitcoin looks even more appealing for those considering it as a long-term hold.",

There have been many exchange hacks in the past, yet people still keep their precious Bitcoins in exchanges. Even with this hack in the past, there was news that investigators recovered enough funds to compensate affected users. The only downside? They didn’t get reimbursed in Bitcoin, so the value was much lower compared to when the hack happened. FTX cleared to repay billions to customers after bankruptcy plan approvalSo, IMO, the main reason here, is the ETF news, especially with  BlackRock now holding over 200k bitcoins.",

It is also good that more and more people are using self-custodial options to hold Bitcoins, as Bitcoins stored in centralized exchanges are not aligned with the true philosophy of Bitcoin. The fiascos of Terra, FTX exchange, and some DeFi platforms, ventures in 2022 and 2023 actually affected people who have bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. From these fiascos, they understood more about the saying \"It's not your private key, it's not your coin\". When they more understood about the risk, they less likely want to store their coins on centralized exchanges, it's natural.Bitcoin bull run in 2024 lifts its price to a very high level and it can affect people's capital management too. With experienced investors, Bitcoin is their main investment asset, but with newbies they will ignore Bitcoin and choose altcoins. With institutional investor increase since Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals in January, more bitcoins will be hold by these entities, and less bitcoins will be floated in retail investors.",

That's why I don't believe it was the retailers that getting smarter and care with their coins safeness.You are right; investors are learning from past mistakes and scams. I also agree that institutional investors are the ones who are refraining more from using centralized exchanges to hold Bitcoins. I just like to add on that I do see people around me (retail investors) changing their attitude toward holding Bitcoins in exchanges as technical awareness around Bitcoin is increasing. People are feeling the power of truly owning money, as everyone here knows it is addictive. Quote from: Oshosondy on November 20, 2024, 06:53:39 AMThis is good but not enough. It would be good if there is more reduction in people's coin holding on exchanges. Indeed we need more reduction as you said but I believe it is a starting of a paradigm shift.Quote from: stadus on November 20, 2024, 07:16:20 AMFor those who prefer not to hold their BTC in personal wallets, ETFs offer a safer alternative compared to exchanges.

Though i agree with the saying,  (“not your keys, not your Bitcoin”), not everyone has the technical know-how to keep their holdings secure. That’s why many opt to invest in highly regulated institutions like ETFs. Nothing can match the security of owning your keys (as you mentioned). Investing in ETF is kind of the same in the sense of trusting a third party, which is the genesis of all major problems with the current fiat system. I am agreeing with you from the profit point of view, but philosophically, I prefer self-custody any day.  Quote from: Die_empty on November 20, 2024, 07:27:49 AMMany small investors are also keeping their coins hoping that the price of Bitcoin will keep increasing until they get to right time to sell. My prediction is that there will be an increase in exchange activities early next year.         I do not think so. IMO Bitcoin will shook the very foundation of centralized exchanges (as it was meant to be). We are entering in a new era of Bitcoin dominance which will open new possibilities.

It can lead to volatile price action on exchanges. Even I was expecting it to be significantly higher then 3 million.Though bankruptcy might be rare but exit scams are not so rare",

I believe that as the awareness about none custodial wallets increases, that most holders will understand that holding in exchanges is not the best option and it will further affect the volume of coins in their custody. One of the biggest lessons that I've learnt on this forum is \"if it's not your keys it's not your coins,\", if more holders knows this and abides by it, then exchanges will only be used as a third party in transactions.",

This should be came up on the mind of people that exchange is for buying and selling. But many still got caught on the idea that they can continuously earn if they trade their bitcoin that's why people choose to store their bitcoins at that platforms. People need to know that once they let their coins stored in their exchange account there's huge possibilities that they might lose it for any unwanted circumstances. That's why its really better to take out their money there and left only those funds they can afford to lose or trade. To HODL using this exchange is the dumbest idea they do since we know its so risky to do this.",

That is a good change that the investor doing with their Bitcoin and only use the capital they can afford in the exchanges to trade.

For example, Bitcoin ETFs have inflows of $950 million because of optimism about its gain in the future. With reduced exchange reserves, it signals bullish sentiment, but at the same time, liquidity tightens. That could increase volatility if leveraged traders and sudden spikes in demand join the mix.

Meanwhile, some of it will still go to hard wallets, where long-term investors prefer to store their holdings.The process of safeguarding Bitcoin through hard wallets has been around for a while, and many people already know how to do it. However, some find it complex and risky. Issues like losing the physical wallet or making user errors, such as mismanaging keys, can lead to losing funds. There’s also the risk of being hacked due to poor security practices.For many, ETFs offer a simpler alternative with fewer personal risks, even though it sacrifices the decentralized and self-sovereign principles of Bitcoin. It all boils down to what level of control and security each investor is comfortable with.",
