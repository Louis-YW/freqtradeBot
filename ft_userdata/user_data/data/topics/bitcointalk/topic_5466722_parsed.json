It is good to have a speculated amount/price in mind for your long-term Bitcoin holding,  but if the all-time high should happen you shouldn't set a target but rather take a percentage of profits that put you in the best position.",

      "body": "For now, perhaps many people's dream is to see BTC at $100k and that will be our target to sell some of our BTC holdings. But to know in detail when that will happen, of course everyone will not know. In other words, investing in BTC has a better direction to target their dream of selling BTC, whether it is passing the new ATH or approaching the new ATH and it all depends on the target of each individual's stance.Now for the second answer |  How can we say that the price of BTC has reached its peak while currently the BTC price is below a 61% decline from the highest price. So it is not appropriate for those who invest in the long term to sell their BTC holdings below the highest price. Unless they are in an urgent situation or need money quickly and have no other choice but to sell BTC and for sure they will regret that decision. So, if they trade daily, they will definitely continue to sell when profits come to them.",

If some peak prices are not gotten to, you may not be able to set a goal price. My goal price is $100000. If it fall from $100000, I will buy more and expected higher price.

In the last bull run, you remember that bitcoin got to $50000, fall back to $28900. It increased back to $50000 and reach $63500 or so and it fall again to $30000. It increased again and reach $69000 before the bear market started.",

I always wanted to keep it simple when it comes to making a profit in Bitcoin.  By doing this kind of approach, I save myself from the frustration and dissappointment when the price of BTC drops since BTC always recovers and then breaks its ATH.I do not plan on selling on the ATH, it would be hard to determine but with the target selling price, it is easy for me to decide when it hits that target price.",

As long as I'm able to sell at a higher price when I bought it or acquired it, that's already a win to me. And yes, I'd probably sell incrementally when the price keeps on going up but for a certain price, I've said that I have determined a quantity that it should be just sold on that particular price.",

However, on this occasion I will still provide a few answers regarding when is the right time to sell? then the answer is when you see the profits and feel satisfied with those profits. But for the answer to when we know a price has reached a peak, this is a little difficult to say because the guideline doesn't necessarily have to look at the ATH number that has been reached on a particular coin or cryptocurrency in the market in the past.QuoteDo you have a set \"goal\" price at which you'd be selling no matter what happens? Do you intend to sell incrementally as the price goes up? Or maybe when the price gradually drops (e.g. it goes down for X days in a row), indicating we're past the peak?My goal in selling is because there is already a profit, but if conditions are experiencing a downturn I will not immediately sell even though I have not yet made a loss and can still make a profit. I will continue to hold it until I see the next increase in the market because usually after a price decrease there will definitely be another price increase in the future and those are two things that I see very often in the market so I don't really care about the peak price because it is very it is difficult to know what peak price will occur in a coin like Bitcoin for example.",
