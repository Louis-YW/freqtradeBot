All you can do is transfer your transactions every year and you will be safe.Notice that even if someone knows the 12 words but doesn't know the order, they still need 12! possible combinations (12! = 479.001.600) this is for non repeated words.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450465.msg62160956#msg62160956https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450411.msg62158667#msg62158667Unfortunately, the same article has been discussed several times here, which indicates the importance of knowing where we learn from and not believing any information without verifying its sources.",

In the past, they have claimed (on numerous occasions) that the private key could never leave their closed source secure element. Now, they released a \"feature\" that is able to shard your key into 3 pieces and send it to 3 corporations \"for safe keeping\".At this point, i'd never promote ledger again, even if they automatically give the option of a 24 word seed... It's much better to have a 12 word seed that cannot leave the secure element (ever) than having a 24 word seed that could be extracted with (closed source!!!) firmware.Like it has already been said: there are perfectly good ways of using a 24 word seed on a trezor, or on an other trusted hardware wallet without having to resort to a company that have been caught twisting the truth...",

I would never recommend scrambling a seed phrase. The most likely outcome is not some added security, but that you are unable to recover your back up.Quote from: mocacinno on May 25, 2023, 06:29:09 AMLike it has already been said: there are perfectly good ways of using a 24 word seed on a trezor, or on an other trusted hardware wallet without having to resort to a company that have been caught twisting the truth...Seed phrases can be extracted from Trezor devices, with another exploit being demonstrated in just the last 24 hours (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50eiA-75NMY), not to mention Trezor's support of censorship and government blacklists.

I would never use either a Ledger or a Trezor device.I watched the video briefly... If i got it correctly, they required physical access to the device in order to do a flash dump which was then fed to a GPU cluster for brute forcing the pincode. IIRC, this is an old vulnerability that's just been brought up once again to show that there is no absolute safety. A hacker would need physical access to your device and access to a cluster to bruteforce your pin. I guess he'll be out of luck with my extended seed phrase tough  I do consider this to be different than the ledger attack vector which does not need physical access. As a matter of fact, ledger is actually sending 3 shards created by a  2 out of 3 ssss  scheme to 3 \"trusted\" companys. If 2 of those company's decide to work together, they can reconstruct all private keys from all clients that decided to enable this ledger \"feature\", and it also shows that if somebody is able to inject code into ledger's closed source firmware, the hardware will be capable of extracting the seed and sending it to wherever the person that injected the code wants without any physical access.Ledger just went as far as extracting the key from your hardware wallet themselves (by design) using official firmware. You only need 2 employees that have access to 2 of the 3 key shards that decide to rob all their clients and it's done... I just think the scale, complexity, risk,... are completely different between this trezor vulnerability and the ledger vulnerability.Don't get me wrong: i'm not on trezor's payroll... The vulnerability exists whilst in a best case scenario it shouldn't... If there are other vendors that are as thoroughly vetted as trezor without such a vulnerability, it would be better to use those... Or even better, use an airgapped setup with core or electrum... Or a properly generated paper wallet...",

If you are smart and don't opt in to it, then an attacker would need physical access to your device to opt in to it on your behalf, and then compromise and decrypt your shares. At this point, breaking the Trezor device as demonstrated will probably be easier.Quote from: mocacinno on May 25, 2023, 11:29:54 AMLedger just went as far as extracting the key from your hardware wallet themselves (by design) using official firmware.Also true, but again, couldn't Trezor just do the same thing on their device?The only point I am making is that swapping one flawed hardware device for another flawed hardware device isn't exactly a smart move. Either find an open source hardware wallet which is permanently airgapped and never connects to a computer, or as you say (and my personal preference) used airgapped encrypted cold storage.",

      "body": "There isn't a much difference in security between having a seed phrase containing 24 words versus 12 words. Both are highly secure and cannot be cracked or brute-forced using the current hardware available. So, going from 12 words to 24 words doesn't necessarily provide additional security. However, it's important to ensure that none of the words from your seed phrase are exposed and to store it offline. This can be done through a hardware wallet (Of course excluding Ledger) or an air-gapped device which is considered even safer.Quote from: jrrsparkles on May 24, 2023, 05:56:30 PMAs mentioned above both is secured enough and impossible to crack unless you exposes the word but the irony is the article says the one who cracked 12 words seeds got $29 worth of BTC as bounty. I've seen this article few weeks ago and It was clear that it's crack-able seeing how much the bounty is lol , exposing your 12 words in a random positions is brut-forced in a few minutes as the article mentioned, but it is generally advised not to tamper with the order of seed phrase words or engage in risky practices. Instead, it is recommended to follow proper security measures such as keeping the seed phrase private, offline, and stored in a secure location or using a trusted hardware wallet.",

It is true that you will enjoy the maximum safety, as it is very very very impossible to brute force 25 words, but on the other hand, the possibility of missing or not correct arrangement of these words is higher than 12 words.12 words are safe against bruteforce attacks and passphare is extra security vs physical attracts but24 words seed with a passphrase are complicating the recovery mechanism for no additional benefit.",
