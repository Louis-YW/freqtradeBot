Stuff like hardware wallets, coins etc.¬† Some of you may remember when KeepKey had like $6 hardware wallets on Black Friday two years ago or so, I think I ordered around 10 of them lol. So yeah, looking for deals like that.. Perhaps some of the makers in here are offering Black Friday-Cyber Monday deals for their goods/services and could share here ..",

      "body": "for me Black Friday is a farce - as most companies spend 5-6 months slowly increasing prices prior to Black Friday so they can suddenly offer items at a \"huge discount\" when in fact they are just going back to the regular prices of a few months back. While that may not hold for all, it is true for quite a few. The CryptoCloaks one is a genuine one - we did not ramp up prices just to discount",

The CryptoCloaks one is a genuine one - we did not ramp up prices just to discount Oh yeah absolutely this is the case for a decent amount of items, but not everything. There‚Äôs still plenty of companies who offer legitimate discounts. I think there‚Äôs more companies than not offering legit deals. Typically I build a buy list for stuff starting 6 months out or so from BF/CyberM. Often times buying stuff in bulk that I buy/use often. Anyways here‚Äôs another legit Black Friday deal ..Trezor has some wallets up to 40% off - https://content.trezor.io/black-friday-2023",
