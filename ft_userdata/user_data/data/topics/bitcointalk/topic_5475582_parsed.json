The forum is easy to navigate and you need to understand the terms and conditions of the local board and the general rules. And one thing you need to know and do is that you have to read more than posting. Okay, see what you will do, always read other people threads and comments and in the process of reading these threads, any one you understand, you made a comment and the ones you don't understand you leave. That is the first step to develop yourself in the forum.  You registered am last yr and u abandoned di account.

      "body": "You're welcome OP, you know what OP means?. It means original poster/postmaker. The forum might look very big and intimidating to you, everyone felt that way in the beginning. You're not very new to the forum, but you're new to engaging in the forum, I've seen that some wise members have given you the list of plenty rules to digest, but I'll try to make things simpler for you. Anywhere you find yourself, try to abide by the rules cos that determines the  duration of your comfortable stay in that place and this form is not  an exception to that theorem. Non compliance to rules here meets dire consequences which you'll not like to face and I'll not like you to be in that predicament too. There's lots of rules, but to me, there some basic rules you just need to observe to play safe and they're as follows:Plagiarism: do not copy and paste  contents from Internet without giving credit to the source. Giving credit to the source is as simple as just putting the link to the website you got the content. Failure to do this, your account will be banned and you'll loose all your hard work. I'll also mention to you that you can get image from any source  to support your post and not provide its link as such is not viewed as plagiarismSpamming: Do Not create threads that has been created before in the forum, before you create Any thread, use the search navigation, google, or Ninjastic.space to verify the existence of such topic in the respective board. If it exists, just take your idea as a reply to the post, if it doesn't exist, you can go ahead to create the thread.Burst Posting: don't  post in succession to yourself. if after replying a thread, and you've another quality reply to someone else's post when no one have posted after you, you can just edit your post and quote the person carefully in your previous reply. Yes, you can quote and reply different people at a time.Use of AI: The Forum encourages intuition and  crafting out your posts from your head. but it frowns on the use of AI to  create threads, or reply to threads as such is seen as laziness and can get your account  banned or tagged. Don't even try to be smart cos there are smarter tools to catch you. The best is to avoid it at all costs. These I've always had in mind and it has helped me to playe safe and engage more in the forum activities and it surely pays off.You also need to make quality posts and contributions and here's how to go about it:Keep reading and learning the patterns that older members adhere to while making posts in the forum and how they make points in their posting. Keep learning and you'll pick up enough experience to engage profitably in the forum. Do not chase merits, or else you'll be disappointed, chase knowledge instead and merits will flow as a reward for knowledge gained and your quality contributions to the forum.",
