But unfortunately with the rise and flexibility of DEXs, it has become extremely easy for anyone to build a meme coin and get it listed in a DEX. Innovation has definitely not stopped but with the huge amount of competition, it has become very difficult for the innovators to pitch their idea in crypto market. Unfortunately I haven't heard of any path breaking innovation in the crypto market in recent times.",

Birth of something completely new would be impossible to predict because no one had even had attempted it, researched and talked about in the forums before.

But when quantum computing goes mainstream in the future, won’t this pose a threat to the current security behind crypto?  But thanks all for your interesting point of view and links. I’ll be checking them out!  One thing that worries me about the blockchain is how it will be used by governments to track transactions and tax people. We are already seeing this in the US, where the IRS is investing billions of dollars to track profits. The ledger allows them to go back to any time in the past and go after people for any reason they choose. I see this as a vulnerability of the system. I hope someone will come up with a digital currency that doesn’t rely on a blockchain and can act more as a p2p transaction. But I know this might be impossible to solve without running into the double spending issue.",

The reason for that is pretty simple, Ethereum was the first project that introduced the smart contract functionality into the crypto space and that changed everything. Without smart contracts we would have no tokens, no NFT's and the whole concept of Defi would also not be possible. Dexes would also not be existant.I have no idea how \"the next big thing\" could look like but i am sure that if it comes, then it will come pretty much out of nowhere for us normal people.",

This new breakthrough in the world of computing could greatly improve the performance of existing blockchain networks. But I think we're decades away from seeing this becoming a reality anytime soon. Other promising tech seems to be DAGs (Directed Acrylic Graphs) which aim to make crypto faster and cheaper than ever. Bitcoin won't likely change to a DAG anytime soon (especially when there are a lot of security issues tied to DAGs), but at least we have an alternative to existing blockchain tech (with improvements, DAGs could replace blockchains in the future). I'd say it's a wild guess to tell exactly what breakthrough innovation will radically change Bitcoin for the better. The future is not set in stone, so developers have plenty of time to come up with fresh and new ideas. All I care about is decentralization and censorship-resistance. As long as Bitcoin stays decentralized, nothing else matters. Just my opinion",
