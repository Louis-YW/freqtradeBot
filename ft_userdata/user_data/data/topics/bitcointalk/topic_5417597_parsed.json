Thank you for your time guys, and much appreciation to the people that have joined our discord since this post went live. We appreciate you all.Do they have official website for this project? Because a serious platform will create one.Not all people would want to join discord or any other social media channel.Most of the time, they want to check the background of the project by checking the official site. This may not be a fake project, but what is the chance that this won't survive long just like thousands of alts that are long forgotten already?What do you think would be the use case of this coin that will give life to its trading market?",

We have a lot of plans for utility and use case in the works. We already have the ecosystem in place, we are just in the process of building it.

We at MineOnlium believe in a fairly mined coin for all, regardless of hashrate. In the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto... \"One CPU, One Vote.\", but in this case we would be using GPU's. We also plan to implement node rewards for our validators in addition to proof of work. A community voting protocol is planned. At the end of the day, a coin is nothing without its community. Regardless of bull or bear, MineOnlium is here for its miners. We will also be developing a simple GUI node setup program combined with a miner to make mining accessible for all. This is just a sneak peek of things to come.",
