  "content": "Pragmatic Play is one of the most popular slot providers. Pragmatic play or often called PP Games is famous for having good graphics and high RTP.Many people like PP Games because they can get maxwin x5000 and some even x21,000 [I've never gotten maxwin at sweat bonanza x21,000, maybe it's a myth]. Some of the games that many players play are slots that have a buy free spins featureLet's discuss anything about Pragmatic Play slot games1# What are your favorite slots on PP Games?2# Try to share your biggest wins3# Do you have any special tricks for playing PP?4# How is your experience getting the maxwin and how much money have you spent playing slots?I've got 2x maxwin on bufallo megaways and x4500 on Gates of Olympus.

The last time I only won Maxwin Fruit Party, and since then I have started to gamble less often. But I agree with you, if PP is mostly giving maxwin to their players, other games I played is rarely provide maxwin, I think PGsoft is the worse. Because while playing PGS, my biggest win was only 600x.",

I have never had good results from pragmatic slots that have a maximum win of more than 5000x bet. Do you think the level of difficulty is higher than pragmatic slots which only has a maximum win of 5000x bet? I already got maxwin twice on buffalo king megaways, I really like that slot and play there very often, but after I got the second maxwin, the slot never gave me any big wins, the freespin bonus is very bad, do you think that happens because I play that slot too often?Do you have a list of favorite games on the pragmatic provider?Quote from: masulum on September 15, 2023, 12:06:24 PM~snip~ But I agree with you, if PP is mostly giving maxwin to their players, other games I played is rarely provide maxwin, I think PGsoft is the worse. Because while playing PGS, my biggest win was only 600x.Yes, I agree too. If I look on YouTube, most of the gamblers who get Maxwin come from pragmatic slots. Oh yes, I also sometimes see maxwin from no limit city, but it is very difficult to get bigwin in no limit city",

That's an amazing win mate. I rarely play so I don't have good replays, the last time I played it only got 300x the bet and it ended badly. I'll look at my game history, hopefully I'll have some good replays to share",

But if only I could get it, the casino obviously wouldn't go bankrupt yet I've never had a maxwin, but I'm not trying to catch him. I don't know how many rounds it takes to get the maxwin. That is why you need a lot of luck if you want to get the maxwin. Not many can get it, and only those who are really very lucky can get it.Quote from: komisariatku on September 15, 2023, 04:26:35 PMQuote from: maydna on September 15, 2023, 12:46:32 PM~snip~I used to like playing the Gates of Olympus slot, but now I rarely play it.

I prefer slot games that have just been released because they provide a different experience and feel from other slot games that I have played.",

It's been a long time since I wanted to experience playing some of PP's casino games without the use of VPN as I don't want to use it in the first place to erase my worries for violating a term related to that.But just recently, or should I say, a few months ago, I was surprised that some fiat online casinos here now list Pragmatic Play as one of their game providers. I don't know the reason why they were able to get eligibility to support the PP games accessed here in the country. Unfortunately, for most crypto-casinos, PP is still not accessible here.If anyone from PH wants to have an experience of playing PP games without the use of a VPN, I can mention what online fiat casinos I'm talking about. I just don't want to share it here since that's not a crypto-gambling site and don't want to make it look like I'm promoting those.",
