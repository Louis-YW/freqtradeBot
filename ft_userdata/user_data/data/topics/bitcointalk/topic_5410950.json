Something akin to blackhatworld where many ideas are shared, but not necessarily all blackhat, just ideas in general, as long as they are reasonable.From someone that has a blog, makes YT videos, has a service, freelance coder, or even physical businesses, but all of this discussed within the Bitcoin community framework and not just on a generic forum.For instance, if you have a blog about Bitcoin and you have it monetized, and you wanted to change your tax residence, you would need to factor in several things, such as, where do I go where this activity is ok within the government, how do I change my settings on AdSense when switching countries, possible tax implications and so on. And would be interesting to see how it goes for other people doing crypto stuff in terms of keeping up with the TOS where you are hosting the content.I don't know where to ask this on the internet, maybe other than BHW itself which has a crypto board.",

Project developmentThak you very much for straightly providing the link for him. If op is talking about a sub-board that he would used to discuss different kind of skills and there the skill can be converted money making. That is a good idea but OP there are a lot of boards and sub-boards and sections for that idea now. bitmover has provided one for you, and I will provide more for you to utilize your entrepreneurial skills. Such as:  Economics  or  Services   and your  local boards. OP if you want to discuss anything concerning products and services, you can use those boards and sub-boards that have been provided to do it with ease. With those boards, I don't think, there is any need to create a similar board again. Although if I may understand you very well, you mean to create such board sell any kind of goods and render services and also display your skills and talents. Please use those ones for anything good you want to do in the forum. You can also show your skill  here  in the next episode.",

Like for example, when talking about \"making money\" i.e having a special board where people come to discuss issues about \"How to make money with Affiliate program\" or \"How to make money doing CPA\" or \"How to make money writing articles\" or \"How to make money doing cryptocurrency\" whereby experts in each of those fields come to share personal experiences, and best tips to make your journey successful. Unlike the kinds we have here on bitcointalk that is not specific, but are general boards for general discussion. You can take a look at this from blackhatworld",

The only thing with that is making things too specific makes it actually harder to find things, and then you have users questioning whether it goes into x or y because technically it covers both sections. So, you do get a bit of a dilemma that way. I'm a fan of categorisation, but not so specific that it becomes a little tedious to crawl through the forum. I think generally the forum is doing alright. I'd like to see the altcoin section get a few more dedicated sections, equivalent  to the Bitcoin section, but other than that I think we've pretty much got what we need.",

Anyway I like the idea of entrepreneur child board under the economics just to see what are the new ideas and how we evolved from the traditional thinking. But OP remember this is crypto forum so you may seek more knowledge about cryptocurrencies here not the way or free ideas to be shared to make more money in this fast moving world, nobody is going to reveal the million dollar ideas for free.",
