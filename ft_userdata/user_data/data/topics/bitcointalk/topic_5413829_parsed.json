Bitcoin has the strongest blockchain. Not affected by any attack, I mean 51% attack. The energy used to mine bitcoin are becoming cleaner which bitcoin miners are moving towards. Quote from: mk4 on September 17, 2022, 02:43:19 AMBitcoin is Bitcoin and Ethereum is Ethereum. Using PoS on Bitcoin is simply one of the dumbest ideas ever, as PoW is one of Bitcoin's main defining characteristics.You are right, bitcoin is bitcoin while ethereum is ethereum. I am surprised that ethereum PoS is still very centralized with over 40% of its PoS node controlled by only two addresses.40%+ Ethereum PoS nodes are controlled by 2 addresses says Santiment data",

I doubt that. It’s smart contract is the reason why it became successful and not it’s PoW consensus because Bitcoin starts the proof of work concept while Ethereum just copy it when they start there own Blockchain.

The merger will be the beginning of a new era for ETH, ETH will have a lot of interesting improvements after this merge. This will make ETH unrivalled in the layer1 project segment, competitors like Sol, BNB, Atom will have to struggle when ETH moves to POS like them. But to be the next bitcoin or take over bitcoin is a pretty far-fetched thing. How can a POS coin replace a fully decentralized coin with a market cap twice as large as ETH?",
