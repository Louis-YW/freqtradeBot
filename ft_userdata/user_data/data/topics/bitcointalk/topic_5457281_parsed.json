And being fast simply means higher efficiency in that goods are delivered and services are served pretty faster.These are key to the health of an economy, and in most cases, it could beat down the price as there will be more competition even as the supplies grow. This will no doubt helps the economy to be healthy, it's all positive.",

So super-fast transportation can be a good solution to provide a faster economic turnaround effect because when all goods sent via transportation can arrive on time without spending more time. Of course the payment will also be processed more quickly so as to make the economic turnover smoother and not hampered by slow transportation while on the way.",

The cost of such delivery would be way higher than other mediums of transport, and the service might be for high class customers only. However, I truly appreciate their idea for creating such a way for delivery of their pizzas. I hope soon other brands will also follow the same approach of delivery for the food and other goods. This will be very useful for fast delivery of the goods and food items, and the customers will be very satisfied with such service.I also agree that with such delivery system the economic turnover will be much faster because when customers receive their parcels faster then that would definitely increase the number of sales which would increase the amount of profit for the brand. With such fast delivery system the brand could serve more customers in short span of time which will be a good thing for the brand as they will be able to make more profit in short duration of time.",

Where isn’t accessible, it means you’re going to ispend a lot on cost to transport your goods to and fro and you would as well have to fill in the gap by increasing cost price. This in turn hinders patronage as the product won’t be readily accessible by the masses that would have been in need of such product.Transportation is highly important in the channel of distribution of a product. Then you can talk about securities and the availability of raw materials for production.",

It's better if delivery of goods and services is also cheap. We all understand that the cost of transportation are passed on to consumers. The cheaper it is then product's price are expected to lower as well. The majority of consumers are most likely to spend more money when that happens.",

I mean ordering in large quantities of course the super fast shipping method can definitely cover the transportation costs. But for the scale of shipping per individual whose value is below the cost of transportation then still use services that are affordable. We often shop on an online platform and many shipping options are provided for a certain duration. Now that's all based on the value of goods purchased far greater than the shipping costs incurred. Such is the picture or simple comparison.Regarding the fast economic turnaround due to fast transportation, it will make it easier for consumers and producers to mutually benefit one another. Customer satisfaction with fast delivery is preferred and has a high rating so increasing orders automatically increases economic turnover.",

Having fast transportation does not guarantee safety. It is crucial that anyone considering working as a delivery person for this service has proper insurance coverage because I fail to see how it can be viable in a busy urban area. While it might generate positive public relations for the business, it could also be detrimental to them. Delivery personnel face risks similar to paratroopers, with a high likelihood of experiencing musculoskeletal injuries, as well as joint and back problems due to repetitive landings and strain on their joints, knees, and ankles. This experiment should be halted. A more efficient and safer transportation model for them would involve the use of robots and unmanned drones for delivery.",

If transportation and delivery becomes faster, it will allow the business to deliver more products within the workday which will lead to higher revenue and higher profitability. So faster transportation indeed helps a lot of businesses to stay ahead of the competition. But the delivery using jetpack looks quite unrealistic. The cost of operating a jet pack is much much higher than available transportation modes. I won't go to the debate whether this video is fake or not, but sure not sustainable in terms of profitability.",

The environmental effect is also my concern, these delivery planes will contribute to the emission of harmful gases to the environment.

It's just like one World News television channel I watched last year, and then I realized that some people are really suffering in their country because of bad roads and no efficient transportation means. What bordered me most was that in some states of that country, they were producing a lot of agricultural products, like mostly vegetables and grains, but it was unfortunate for them that they could not freely ship their farm produce to the large Market where they were mostly needed. Some times, they managed to send it to the nearby market, and before they could sell off those products,a lot of it might have gone bad. That is to say, fast transportation is a key factor in the boost of the economy as well.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",
