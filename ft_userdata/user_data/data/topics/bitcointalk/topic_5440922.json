  "content": "Hi guys,I'm a total newbie who's into Bitcoin. I was in the middle of downloading Bitcoin core(78%) when my computer just freeze for hours that I have to force shutdown without closing the Bitcoin Core properly.When I rebooted and started Bitcoin Core again, it shows \"Error Reading from Database\" and close itself. I repeated the process and it's the same.Does anyone have experience with this situation? Please help me, it took me 5 days to reach this download progress, and I definitely would appreciate to not start all over again T.TThank you!!!!!",

Sorry I'm not familiar with cmd.Yep, you've to navigate directory to the folder where the wallet is installed before running the command above. I'm not a bitcoincore user, looks like it's C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\Appdata\\Roaming\\Bitcoin [1]Try to check it manually too. If it is true then the command prompt will be, cd C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\Appdata\\Roaming\\Bitcoin1. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory",
