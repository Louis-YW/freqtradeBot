Instead they are being guided by psychology - human mind feels negative emotions more strongly than the positive, and negative memories are stronger than the positive.

It is easy to be aware of volatility and crashes as you said, but it is harder to realize at the same time that for a successful asset to thrive in long term, it has to survive several crashes and bear cycles. It it something that even happens with traditional assets like stocks.Still, I expect the adoption to continue increase in the future as more people get informed and abandon their fear.",

I guess that's why bitcoin adoption and awareness  is growing massively in my area.",

They cant predict the value. But one of the reasons why people doesn't like bitcoin is volatility but even tho their gues is wrong they still get the value of bitcoin until it reaches zero right.In my opinion who know bitcoin must know at least a little knowledge and decide if they want to their money on.",

The fact is that nobody loses anything (in terms of ownership) even in a minus portfolio condition.I'm interested in quoting one of the responses in the video, \"I'm thinking more about what I lose than what I win\". How about a little fairer, changing the conditions of \"the coin will be flipped a certain number of times so it wins your choice\",  like the way holding works.",

It seems obvious all those people perfectly understand that their $10-bet versus another person's $20-bet is advantageous on their side. They just don't want it. Factors like they're not in the mood to be betting against a stranger in the streets, they're on camera, they're feeling awkward, they're conscious, and so on are involved in this social experiment. There are so many external factors involved. The environment and circumstances are not really conducive for people to be thinking of winning a bet. If in those same streets that same vlogger would call out strangers and say, \"hey, come on, take my $20; it's all yours,\" I guess a number of people still won't have it.",

It's possible the stranger flip the real coin and then he switch with his customized coin where the both side contain only number or image, depends on the situation.Bitcoin on other hand, we don't need to trust someone because we can trade it using P2P or DEX, then we can hold it on our non custodial wallet.There are a lot articles discuss about 4 year cycle and Bitcoin bullish season, I don't think people are dumb and not understand about it, they just choose to not invest in Bitcoin.",

For that, we should be able to assign an 'objective' value to bitcoin and then be able to measure the difference between the current price of bitcoin and its supposedly real and objective value. Some models such as S2F tried to do something like this, but in my opinion they failed miserably, no matter how much the author claims not to have failed and keeps reformulating the theory.It is easy to talk about expected value in gambling, for example. If the RTP is 97% and you bet 100 USD, the expected value of return is 97 USD, regardless of whether you lose it all, i.e. the return is 0, or you win more than 100.In the stock market, value investing tries to do something similar, but here we are moving in a field where there is not so much certainty, and I would say that with bitcoin even less so.",

People don't want to risk on something they don't know, fiat is the only thing they wanted. Cryptocurrency for them is like it never exist, they don't want to get out of their comfort zone. We can't blame them though, since we have our own choices in life. Those people who don't want to risk their money on Bitcoin for sure will regret it big time once it soar up high even more.",

Even if you consider the analogy of this being a stranger those people just met and then flipped it, offering them ten bucks to take a gamble, while risking nothing, people would take the bet with the said stranger. That is still a too good an offer to be true and it's still a stranger they just met, but with no apparent risk of losing, the would take the chance at winning.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on February 10, 2023, 11:35:45 PMThis is one of the reasons why Bitcoin adoption is so low.

It's more than taking a random bet, it's accepting a new way of doing things, a new way of transacting and a new form of value. It would definitely take time to be fully adopted",

He's keep on highlighting that but he could be on the wrong place where people were conversative with their 10 bucks. He chosen those people that are not into risk taking and I understand his point of explanation about gaining potentially more than the expected value that the bettor shall lose. But he should have tried to go to casinos and ask people from there and for sure, they'll take the bet.And relating this loss aversion with the bitcoin adoption is that, people might be relaying to their experiences in the past, it could possibly be that they've been a victim of sort of online scam and that's why they're no eager to know more about it. Whether it's going to be profitable as an asset or not, what's on their mind is only thing and that is they'll never be a victim again of anything that's related to online investments.They'll only be interested on it if they see people who tried it first that has became profitable and then that thought of losing might change later on.",

The primary goal for Bitcoin adopters should not be \"profit\" ..but rather the value of financial freedom. Yes, even if the reward is financial freedom, the same concept still exist, because people first need to lose their financial freedom.. before they know what it is. A simple example is this : The ATM is not working and you need money to pay for something important. Your account is blocked for some reason and your Bank only operate from 9 to 5. You want to donate money to Wikileaks, but Banks block all transactions that are linked to Wikileaks... etc. etc.",

It's volatility is the main thing which gives doubt to users. Another reason is the risk involved from doing so.

Some people just don't like gambling (regardless of the odds), and we all know that the house always wins in the end and that only a few can boast that they made money gambling, while more than 95% of gamblers lose far more than they win.Therefore, I don't think that the fear of loss is the main reason why people don't want to invest in Bitcoin, because the reason can also be that someone simply doesn't have the money to afford any kind of investment, while others think that it's all a big scam which will collapse sooner or later. It should be kept in mind that public opinion is not shaped by this forum or a few more significant sources that provide information about Bitcoin, but by the mainstream media, which is mostly owned by those who want to preserve the system that allows them absolute control at all costs.In addition, Bitcoin was never supposed to be the kind of gambling you are talking about, but something completely different that most people either don't know or deliberately ignore.",
