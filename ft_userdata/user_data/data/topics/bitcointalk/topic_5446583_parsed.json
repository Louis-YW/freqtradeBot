But you must have missed the last few years of news that miners moved out. Those that remain are under the radar.That is just called economics. You go where the cost is the cheapest. And regulations can be expensive to avoid.",

Though keep in mind that one the one hand Tokayev stated “We are ready to go further. If this financial instrument shows its further relevance and security, it will certainly receive full legal recognition”. But on the other hand this article is just 1.5 months old, stating that energy usage for mining will be limited as they grids can't cope with the load. They also want to distribute official licenses. This once more goes into the direction of coerced control, presumably to the government's financial benefit.",

Miners will always move to a country that is bitcoin friendly. We saw this in China who had the highest mining farm but after the ban on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, miners relocated to other countries that encourages mining activities like the US and Kazakhstan. Mining consumes more power and their are some countries which cheapest power supply,which will boost up mining.",

Now adding the fact that they even banned bitcoin, miners tried to move to where they can be more productive, so statistics are now equally divided amongst many big time countries in the world. Before only China could proudly show off their mining power but now? not anymore, I will no longer add more sources since there are already plenty of sources given by our fellow members, besides that's the changers over these years.",
