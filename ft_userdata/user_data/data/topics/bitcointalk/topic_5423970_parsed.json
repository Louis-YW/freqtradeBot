DCA is one of the best ways to enter into a new investment. For one;• You buy a different market periods and as such do not have to bother much about how expensive or cheap it is at a point in time,• Also, you buy consistently and can easily plan your portfolio according to your salary or earnings, so you don't end up buyi g more than you can spare.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on November 28, 2022, 04:50:15 PMyou still trust your Youtubers?People ever trusted YouTubers?",

You may say that they' have more experience than you which correct since they are already started trading before you found out about it. So, the scene I can think of is that you want to learn more which you would most likely to watch their streams but in the end, people like that also came from somewhere else where they also made mistakes but it didn't stop them. After all, mistakes are what made us experienced and also knowledgeable.",

As a ship sails towards it, it opens up and one discovers that the sea isn't in anyway near the sky let alone touch it. As someone who newly got into trading that year, I was given to understand that there are oversold positions as well as overbought positions. Now I know there's nothing like that in reality. It's the same way we think the market has bottomed out only for it to continue to dip further. Crypto bottom is a mirage. It doesn't exist in the true sense of that word.",

That's a nice piece of advise, and i totally agree with this very statement of yours, because YouTubers will always say what people wants to hear, in other to get views to earn a penny from AdSense, which is why one should never rely on them alone without Doing Your Own Research.

We always create our own predictions as to what is the best price to buy, but in reality as soon as the bear season enters the market, that’s the perfect time to buy and accumulate potential coins. No need to wait for another downturn, just do DCA if you want so you won’t miss every chance to buy bitcoin or any other potential coin.",

A few Sat's is not so small when accumulated.

You won't see a reversal coming. It depends on how you approach the market , some called it Long term traders/Holders and Short term traders/Holders, where the long term holders buy every time the market crashes they don't care sometimes regarding the value especially with bitcoin and Ethereum they just hold it as long as they want.While the short term holders/traders, are just there to gain small profit, while trading small profit and they sold, repeat the processwhen it comes to timing when to jump, there is no 100% accuracy sometimes luck, so if you are not sure of what you are doing, or you will invest and those money is for school or family I suggest you think twice cryptocurrency will make you cry, if you are not prepare,",

Who is patient can know when to accumulate bitcoin, and also not to wait until the market price of bitcoin has already increased. Some people started to buy since bitcoin got to $20000 and still buying specific amount till now which helps them keep the price they bought bitcoin in average at somewhat a lower price below $20000. A good investor should not believe in those prediction, but to have a good investment strategy. Some even predicted bitcoin is going to $100000 in 2022, but not come true.",
