At first I thought differently about Aviator but after opening the demo it didn't feel like the first time I'd seen this game. But I have never participated in this aviator game with cryptocurrencies. I created an account on a site that allowed me to play aviators for free. The game is very strange and I like it very much. Unfortunately I am not able to participate in real play in this game right now but I will participate in this game later because I like this game a lot.",

Thank you very much my man for the brief clarification cause I believe demo mode is actually to entice the gamble into thinking the whole process is very easy but believe when you switch to the real account, it's definitely sometime else and this same thing happens to newbie who creates account on some trading platform and tend to win lots of trade session on the demo but after depositing your own funds the whole situation turns sideways and nothing seems right anymore so I'd like to believe try out a real bankroll on aviator game before ranting about it because just like what cantsay said you would be surprised at how you can lose even at1.05x odd.",

Exactly mate, when I read his description of how the game is being played, it crypto parlance, we call it crash game. And yes, it's very exciting and adrenaline rush to any player because you don't know if it will continue to climb to a high multiplier without you crashing and stopping it to get the win or look for like 1000x returns.And with that, there's not much that excitement on it, I mean if you are a crypto gambling, at some point in time you will have played this game. Maybe you lean towards it because of it's thrilling design, or if most old gamblers prefer the traditional slot games and sports betting.",

It does give a good adrenaline push but that is something most games provide in gambling. Only is that the names of games are different on different casinos. The reason why most online casinos are now jumping into the crypto wagon is due to the fact that it is far easy to play games using them. With fiat you have to wait for your funds to credit for a few day but with crypto it is instant. The popularity of cryptocurrency casino proves how much the gambling industry is changing.

Just because you like how the game plays out, maybe you like aviator games but that's you, and it doesn't make it the best game, it's wiser to get involve with popular games from online gaming regulators.Crypto deposits or Fiat deposit makes no difference, any games can be available for players on a platform or casino with crypto deposits and fiat allowed or vice versa, I am not a fan of this type of game, I like sometime more adventure, I remember doge dash game in 2021 where you guide a god through different levels battling through obstacles along the way, if you finish the stages completely you win good amount of coins and they worth a lot, now this is a good game that keeps you on the edge of your sit. We all have different tastes in games and I found aviator or even any sim games a trash, and I won't be doing it for money, it's good if people can make money from such games but I won't do the same, it's all about what I prefer and like doing, skill based games are fun and this makes them different from casino games, still I advice you to be careful, some developers are ready to take advantage of everything.",

And that's when you want to feel the real tension of the game.And if you don't have good self-control, you might experience loss.

And this is not something new as others have pointed out, this is similar to crash game, maybe they just put a spin on it's name to sounds like this is new. Of course, we can try it with the demo mode, enjoy it and think that we can beat the system.However, when we play real money or crypto, it will not be the same with the demo mode. Most likely the demo mode is set to give players a win, to give them false hope in my opinion. But when you deposit, chances are going to be low playing this exciting game, go can even lost at 1.01 odds.",

Winners here are those who can discipline themselves by cashing out at their planned amount multiplier. The last time I won at this game was months ago and I never went back. It's not because I lost a heavy amount of my capital, I actually won, but it's because of the long waiting that doesn't give you any wager amount. It means this game is for those who have the patience to wait because it can take a lot of time but for those who are trying to reach a certain VIP rank, this is not the way. 1 round could take a minute if it explodes to higher numbers. Then, there's the waiting time of all the players who will place their bets. 2 to 3 minutes per game which could probably be 30 rounds in Keno and 100 balls in Plinko. The thing about Crash is you have no idea when it will crash so you can end up losing a lot of money if you won't cash out at the right time.",
