      "body": "It's a difficult one to judge, as the break of $30K was very much news driven. So more or continued positive news could see a \"up only\" scenario in the coming weeks/months, but any further ETF delays/rejections could have the opposite effect. Price has literally pumped off the $IBTC listing that occurred in August that was only discovered this month. This pump could have happened months ago is the irony.Looking at price at present and trying to ignore the news or background noise, I think price could pump considerably higher. If we get to $40K, it could consolidate and reach $50K to $60K with sellers from 2021/2022 re-entering the market. This has more or less been my prediction for this year, ie a strong dead cat bounce, which seemed out the question after summer passed, but clearly it's still on the table.ARK's final ETF deadline of Jan 2024 is going to be one to watch in the near future, with the third deadline next month. As far as I understand they have also registered their ETF ticker, so are optimistic of getting approved soon, but only time will tell. Either way it's an exciting to be a Bitcoin holder with ETF on the horizon and a halving not far away now.",

      "body": "The momentum of the recent move is really strong so I feel it has the potential of pushing price near the ATH. Two cases are possible as to what might be propelling the move. First is the expectation that Bitcoin ETF might be approved anytime before the year ends. The other being that people are jumping in to secure a spot before price gets too high knowing that halving and bull market is imminent. If the rise in price is with the expectation that Bitcoin ETF will be approved before the year ends, then we might see a bull trap if the approval did not happen. This will see price dump a little below $30k again because we have just little time before the year ends and next year is perceived as the year of Bitcoin. However, if we get the approval this year, then Bitcoin will create a new ATH before the end of the year. In general, I am of the opinion that the price will settle around $45k by the end of this year.",

My opinion is very bullish towards bitcoin at the end of 2023, although I don't know for sure the price that bitcoin will reach until the end of this year, plus we will face two FOMCs, and I think that will have a negative impact on the crypto market because of the economy. The US is still experiencing very high inflation so it is very likely that they will raise the benchmark interest rate again.",

That it is not there and that ATH's option is there before the end of the year seems like a joke. 35 k is sideways and 50k is up.  Both are there but I would like you to pick which you expect more.50k is +47% increase over todays price so thats an aspirational estimate & would be the first option vote imo.   Its not sideways and its not down so thats my logic that just one of those three directions is enough for a very rough sentiment poll.     If we get 50k year end and 70k for new ATH in Jan it'd still be in before the Chinese new year, Im not going to exclude that scenario.  Hopefully you get this isnt precise, 50k is up alot so vote up.   Im sure I can find a wiki for why polling often biases results seen.  None of us truly know what happens next, its all a degree of probability and confidence levels on those estimates.  I made it simple like a fence dividing a flock, less choices adds clarity & it makes the poll result clearer.  Simple up down, stay is all I think a few months deserves but I'll enter in any poll option if you request  presuming thats possible to do.  ATH or more is quite possible, Im going off what we did in 2017 and I didnt expect but way back at start of 2017 I knew the market was likely to be positive from how it was acting with its most negative prices of that year but to boil over and hit such a high level of froth was a surprise to everyone.   20x price lows in 2023  if we were to repeat BTC history would mean $331,000 by year end;  I really dont think so but Im not going to say never either.   I believe extremes will always be possible with BTC as supply is not expandable the contrast to dollar is wider then the grand canyon hence the price dynamics, pressure builds fast with demand.  Whats driving demand now I dont know.  Equally if someone wants to say 10k I would write it in, I'd like to know why also.",

I wouldn't say no either because something surprising could be possible. But the chances of getting that price at the end of the year are so low that many people are very hesitant to say so.Everyone will be happy if we reach a new ATH by the end of this year, but it is difficult to expect it before the halving. The history say no new ATH is reached before halving, especially when it is only a few months away from the halving. About $50k is possible, but we'll see how this market grows with the latest developments in spot bitcoin ETF issues.",

Yes, it is really unavoidable not to make out those assumptions basing up on the history or past experiences on which it do somehow creates that pattern and this is where we do really do really assume out that it would be really happening on next year. Yes, its been a long time that we are moving sideways and every that last months of a certain year then the community would really be having that impression that BER-months could really be that somewhat bullish or do make out some bullish movements.We've seen that in September, it didnt really move that much but when October kicks in then this is where movements starts to show up.For sure lots of people hadnt been able to anticipate such movement and on just because of some economic sentiment or something external then it did make out that kind of positive effect on which we are currently seeing as of this moment.",
