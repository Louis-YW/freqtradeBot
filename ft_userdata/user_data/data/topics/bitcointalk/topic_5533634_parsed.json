  "content": "Hello,I mined some Bitcoin back in 2014 and recently recovered my BTC by installing the latest Bitcoin Core.  My wallet has an old address.  I created an account on Gemini and Coinbase.  I made a hundred dollar transfer to both accounts to test them out.The Coinbase transfer was smooth and quick.The Gemini transfer has hung for over a week.  I made the mistake of setting the transaction fee to low and did not enable Replace-By-Fee.I notice that both transactions split the transfer into two output transactions.  The Coinbase transaction was for 0.00100384 BTC.  The fees were drawn from the amount transferred.Input                         Output0.00101433 BTC  --> 0.00100384 BTC                          --> 0.00184438 BTC---------------------------------------------                        Total 0.00285922 BTCThe Gemini transfer was for 0.00101433 BTC.  The fees were paid from the wallet.Input0.00101433 BTC --> 0.00918963 BTC                         --> 0.00101433 BTC---------------------------------------------                       Total 0.01020804 BTCI am not understanding why they split.  Is this typical?  Do the funds get transferred back to the wallet?Also, is it safe to post transaction numbers to better clarify the question?Is there away to cancel the Gemini transfer?Thank you in advance.",

It has to be smaller than or equal to the sum of inputs.But it is normal to see this kind of \"split\", the other output is your change. It's like when you pay cash and receive change back. When your input is for example 0.003BTC and want to only pay 0.001BTC the wallet should send the remainder which is 0.002BTC to another address from your wallet.Here is a random real example from the latest block: https://mempool.space/tx/0e508ac12d94658ed69887344f338f812f0742d0b830f99ddb2f0d32dae1e941If you check your total balance or your transaction history you should only see the amount sent + fees deducted and nothing more.Quote from: charles05663 on February 27, 2025, 05:11:19 AMAlso, is it safe to post transaction numbers to better clarify the question?There is no security risks involved in publishing your transaction ID on the internet. After all it is already public and in the mempool (or in a block if it is mined).The only concern is privacy concern when people don't want to create a link between their coins and their account.Quote from: charles05663 on February 27, 2025, 05:11:19 AMIs there away to cancel the Gemini transfer?No, bitcoin transactions can not be canceled. You have a couple of options.1. Wait for it to confirm eventually and although it depends on the fee rate you choose but considering how fees are currently 2-3 sat/vb it may not be that far https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,weight2. Try using CPFP which is where you create a new tx spending the change of your tx but pay a higher fee to cover both transactions https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/3. You can use abandontransaction command to \"purge\" the tx from your mempool and wallet and then try to respend it using higher fee and hope other peers don't reject it as a double spend https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/abandontransaction.html",

So chance of being rejected shouldn't be high. Although since i rarely use Bitcoin Core wallet feature, i wonder whether latest version have option to perform full RBF with GUI.
