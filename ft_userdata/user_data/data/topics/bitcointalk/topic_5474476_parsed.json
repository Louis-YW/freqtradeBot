      "body": "Iron Fish v1.12.0 has been released!## Notable Changes​Removing support for NodeJS v16; adding support for NodeJS v20 and beyond. The node now requires a minimum version of NodeJS v18 instead of _only_ NodeJS v18, so we can more easily support new NodeJS versions as they are released.​Block syncing speed should be improved. The node will regularly measure the connection of some peers to try to find a faster peer to sync from. The first time this occurs is 2 minutes after the node starts syncing, then 4, 8, 16.. up to a maximum of once per 60 minutes.​Nodes should be able to find peers faster and more consistently. ​Added a `keepOpenPeerSlot` config option (default false). When set to true, a node will disconnect from a peer if it is at maxPeers, so that the node will always allow an incoming connection instead of reaching the maximum number of peers and rejecting incoming connections.https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/releases/tag/v1.12.0",

Perhaps they have reconsidered their development tactics. Maybe creating a wallet on network was not a priority.

Just because someone wasted their money on this nonsense from VCs doesnt mean that others should be rushing to invest in this when this chain literally has nothing to offer. There is monero, dero, firo and dozens of other that literally have no innovation in them besides having privacy as their layer1 usage.",

Despite the fact that there is already Foxwallet mobile wallet, they want to create an official one. The work just started, no ETA provided.Ambassador program. They are going to hire ambassadors for the project. As I understand this is a step towards marketing campaign. Pretty cool.

There are some breaking changes to these RPCs, so please see the release notes below.* The `peer/addPeer` RPC now waits for the node to connect to the peer before returning.* Fixed a time-related case where snapshot downloads could unexpectedly time out.Here are the full release notes: https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/releases/tag/v1.14.0",
