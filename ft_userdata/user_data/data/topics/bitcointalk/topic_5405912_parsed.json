  "content": "Public sale in September: Kii, the utility token for digital identity from NuID & The Kii Foundation Learn more:Problem: Identity on the web today is broken because authentication is broken. The current identity model is both centralized and fragmented. Centralized by services each holding large silos of user identity data and fragmented with users having to separately create identity profiles across every service they interact with. When a silo is compromised, all of the users within are compromised and each credential theft resulting from a silo’s security breach enables the next security breach, mass credential theft, and an inevitable perpetual cycle. The current state of authentication and digital identity prohibits users from having ownership and control over their own identity online.Solution: Trusted digital identity requires a rock solid core for authentication. NuID is building a new paradigm of digital identity through trustless authentication for services and a portable, device-agnostic identity model for all users of the web. Individuals will represent their identities with their zero-knowledge authentication credentials, stored on a public blockchain; services will deploy the NuID trustless authentication solution. The interplay between individuals and services will grow a robust Nu Identity Ecosystem which will make the internet more secure, return data ownership to individuals, and release everyone from the limitations of the current model of authentication. Kii is the transactional utility token at the root of the Nu Identity Ecosystem.About Kii: -Kii is issued and supported by The Kii Foundation, in partnership with NulD. It will initially be issued as an ERC20 token, but will migrate to the identity-optimized KiiChain in the near future as a native token. -Kii is the transactional utility token at the root of NulD's Nu Identity Ecosystem and the KiiChain, which are in development.-Owning Kii grants you access to the ecosystem, where individuals own and control their online identity without trusting services with their private information.-Demand for Kii comes from paying the cost of credential registration on a public blockchain and paying for use of NulD's existing trustless authentication solution: the first of many services in the Nu Identity Ecosystem.-Kii has a restricted supply. -Request to pre-purchase and find details on public launch at https://kiichain.org.
