I believe the only that concerns me is the decreasing number of interest on other exchange which might be a cause for some exchange to go under since there will be income.The dominance of any single exchange in the crypto market, especially one as large as Binance, can potentially present risks to the broader ecosystem. Here are some potential reasons why:    Centralization of Power: Binance's overwhelming dominance in the spot crypto trading volume means that they have significant influence over the market. This could be potentially concerning if the exchange were to manipulate the market for their own benefit or if they were to experience a security breach, which could have severe consequences for the wider crypto industry.    Limited competition: With such a large market share, Binance could potentially stifle competition from smaller exchanges, which could lead to reduced innovation, fewer options for consumers, and higher trading fees.    Regulatory Risk: The concentration of market power in one exchange could attract increased regulatory scrutiny, which could lead to stricter regulations or even outright bans in some countries.Quote from: Oshosondy on February 20, 2023, 04:35:17 PMAccording to what I saw on Coingecko, I do not think Binance has up to 98% of trading volume, but we all know that it dominates all other exchanges.

Just look at SBF for example. He was known around the world for being the CEO of a possible competitor to Binance, and his platform actually did quite well on its initial days. However that did not deter him from misappropriating the funds and diverting it to another of his company. Not saying that CZ will never do this, but we never really know what's happening in the sidelines.",

No doubt that they really are dominating the market because on how they're marketing and keeping themselves up with the trend.

It is obvious the data is wrong as there is no way that binance has such dominance over the market, and if it went down it should be worrying and it will bring massive losses to a lot of traders, but on the big scheme of things it changes nothing, if binance collapsed the price of bitcoin and all the altcoins will go down for a few weeks or months, but then the market will begin to recover as it always does, so I do not see what it could be done about it other than to take steps to protect ourselves and never leave our coins at any exchange.",
