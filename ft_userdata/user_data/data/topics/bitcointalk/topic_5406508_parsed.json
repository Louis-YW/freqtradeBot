Hi,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0Please check the 4th row of this. There it's mentioned 'Gambling and all \"investments\" that are so risky they might as well be gambling (HYIPs, pyramid schemes, etc.)'. Please correct me if I'm wrong or if you have any suggestions.",

      "body": "as soon as i saw the thread i immediately realized it was a ponzi scheme but i decided to take a closer look at the site and to my shock the ponzi site has that they have legal documents. how far can a lie become ridiculous? in this case we are facing a site where the owner has simply become such a liar that I bet he believes his lies. for example:Ghana is against ponzi schemes, it's a crime, so how the hell would they give a ponzi site a certificate? I mean the guy who created the site didn't even waste time researching this?Quote from: Distinctin on July 16, 2022, 01:05:15 PMAre you sure it does belong to the gambling board? What you are offering is an investment, not gambling, and I'm not sure if this investment could attract people here given you have a red tag from one of the DT members. this cannot even be called an investment, the plans are ridiculous and unrealistic, the site has a lot of information that is false, and it is running a ponzi scheme",
