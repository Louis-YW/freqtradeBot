Nevertheless, we should also look for other mixer clones as well as there could be the next target from this criminals. And thanks to the OP for exposing this one. I also reported it.",

I also reported it to Google, unfortunately it is still showing though.So I would suggest that if others could also report it as well.

Everyone has the freedom to associate and also to make public their services. These scammers only did imitate the original but google can not deny them the right  to advertise their products which in the real sense are scammers. Any one can put up his or her business for publicity online irrespective of the identical nature of it to another but we all know google got a complaint form for scam site and fake, what is expected is to report the fake and scam site to google through the google form,This is likely the only way that scam site can be taken down. Only if the community takes this drastic measures in reporting them to google and if any one here has a link  to the form should not hesitate to drop it here.",
