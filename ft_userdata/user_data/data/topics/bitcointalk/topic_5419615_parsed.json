So basically it's a token inside of BEP-20 token standard like those tokens you are trading them with. I am assuming you have at some point sent USDT via binance smart chain to exchange because it's cheaper then for example sending it via ethereum token standard, that's basically same thing. You are operating on layer 2 of bnb. And yes, you need some BNB too (not much), to act as gas.",

But you still have to be careful with the coin you choose to trade because most of the dextool platform is shitcoins.QuoteBefore the rug-pulling happens instead of selling your coin is it possible to exchange the coin for a stablecoin or BNB? on Pancakeswap or Metamask?As long as you always remember if the network to be used is under Bep20(BSC) address wallet you will connect it to pancakeswap or metamask you can't have a BNB balance because that is needed for the gas fee whatever transaction you do dude even if it is a deposit or withdrawal.QuoteWhen it comes to trading new pairs do I copy and paste the Token address or token pair address to Pancakeswap?If you use a metamask set on the BSC network and you want to connect it to pancakeswap, you don't have to copy and paste because you just click connect to pancakeswap and after that your metamask app will appear, just click connect and sign message is just that simple dude.",

If you can trade a shitcoin to BNB, you should choose that pair and should not choose the pair with WBNB.QuoteBefore a rug pull happens instead of selling your coin is it possible to swap the coin to a stable coin or BNB? on Pancakeswap or Metamask ?When you are trading on DEX (Decentralized exchanges), you should pay attention on liquidity pools. Unfortunately, you can not know will their developer teams do rug pull or not.A safe approach is only consider to trade if that shitcoin is available for trading on both decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges. It means they can do rug pull on DEX but can not do that on CEX.",
