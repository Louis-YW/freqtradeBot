  "content": "Our project SWAPLAB has  only one official website https://swaplab.cc which was closed several years ago. However, we often stumble upon scammers who use our name, website design and / or company information. The following ones belong to scammers and are phishing websites:Code:swaplab.ioswapslab.ccswaplabs.ccsimple-swap.netWhen any of those websites are up and running we usually contact domain registrars and ask to take the scammers down. However, the scammers continue to jump from one registrar to another. Their oldest phishing website is http://swaplab.io. There were complaints about it, e.g. here and here.According to whois swaplab.io is going to switch to nicenic.net which is a well-known bullet-proof domain registrar for scammers.Don't use any websites from the list above. They will steal your crypto!--swaplab.cc Team",

However, the scammers continue to jump from one registrar to another. This is true, and you all need to do us report it again or buy the domain names too which obviously needs a financial budget. It's good to see you reporting scam phishing sites even though you already stopped your service. If you still have access to your social media sites you can just post such info for people to be aware and not become responsible when someone got scammed due to these phishing sites.",

It's just a matter of time (end of transfer period) until their website will be back online. Nicenic has a really bad reputation https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/registrars/. And it's good that the domain registrar reacted so fast your on your request, because usually as per my experience, reporting to them is really a pain because they don't react quickly that there are some individuals who fell for the scammers trick, (a) replicating the website, (b) using some form of ads to push their website on the top, higher than the original one.So yes, hopefully you and others maybe will have to work hard and see if the 3 websites are going to be up again. Just putting the scam websites inside the \"code\" though, so that no one can accidentally visit them from here,Code:swaplab.ioswapslab.ccswaplabs.cc",
