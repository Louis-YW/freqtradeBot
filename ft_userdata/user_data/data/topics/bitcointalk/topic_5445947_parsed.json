Exactly. a lot of people are misled into thinking that CBDCs are cryptocurrency because of their digital nature but at the bottom of it all, they are fiat through and through. Although I would agree with OP in a sense that this still warrants some form of discussion to be made since there's no restriction in this forum that states you can't talk about anything other than cryptocurrency gambling in the Gambling Discussion forum. But I digress. CBDCs are still a little infantile and are still with its fatal flaws that makes it unappealing to the people who it would cater towards. For example, unlike cryptocurrencies, and sometimes even unlike greenbacks, CBDCs are highly traceable and are able to be tracked down right from their minting, that wouldn't sit well with a lot of people.",

So if gambling focused countries or areas like Macau, Vegas and other popular gambling places. If their government enforces them and pushes them to be required to accept CBDCs, they can do something about it? I don't think so.And that's why, there's also a possibility that they'll just accept it but it depends to their gamblers if they'll massively adopt it or still prefers to gamble the traditional or crypto way.",

Considering the huge adoption the governments of the world are expecting them to have.Of course, while casinos are not forced to adopt those electronic FIATs and ditch Bitcoin and other cryptos, one could argue that more options are convenient, but it would be very sad and outraging if regulators pushed laws to only allow centralized coins minted by central banks to be used for gambling on internet...",

This could be big for the Chinese visiting Macau and it might not take long when it's also going to be implemented in Hongkong. It's a known fact that China is the first to have launched CBDC. Their CBDC is linked to Alipay or Wechat AFAIK so they can deposit electronically going to thier CBDC making it convenient. If they are advertising CBDC still and probably airdropping RMB is probably because of fewer users still.",

Gambling Capital of the World Macau to accept CBDC as Legal tenderIt sounds, as always, that this is in the most basic and early stages of becoming a possibility based on the information in that article. Anything connected to China is also going to be a grey area, good luck getting your money out if a company goes rogue or they simple decide not to pay you or a politician decides to change the law one day. The fact that China has banned Bitcoin shows they are clearly against the whole idea of cryptocurrency, which fits in with their theme of trying to centralize control of everything, which has been shown to fail many times throughout history. It will become an interesting story when a more free and structured government starts to allow this functionality.",

Our concern here is crypto, not fiat.True, it's just like fiat to me, and it's not to have the true definition of crypto. So in any case it will be rolled out and casinos are going to accept it, then it's not going to be surprising to us. And so by definition they should be of legal tender already as it is back up by government. They might have to developed let's say a slot machine to read QR code or something to that effect if CBDC's are going to be accepted. On the other hand, it's going to be easy for anyone to be track with their CBCD, that's already a fact so anyone whose going to used it in casino will obviously leave their footprints there. Regarding the question of it being universally accepted by casinos? sure, everything that people are willing to used in a casinos then they are going to accept it. If BTC will be the next trend for them? yeah, the same, it's business for them, so it's normal and not surprising.",

We don't yet even know what that tech is going to be.USA made the first step in raising concerns about a CBDC and banning it. But I think there is also some political reason behind it in face of the competition with China. Criticizing China politically while adopting a fiat currency system that is used there for surveillance reasons might not be a very good selling point for an administration. As for casinos, I guess they could be forced to accept it if they want to get the required licenses. But that won't make casinos disappear as decentralized prediction markets will at some point be mature enough to work at scale and in a decentralized way anyway. That's when crypto will still be the first choice for many.The problem might be when a player has to prove where winnings come from. So regulation could still be a pain in the ass.",
