Â Â Good question....hope the following answers your question...as per their website Â https://www.nevadagoldback.com/Â Â Goldbacks are a Voluntary Barter Asset Made of GoldGoldbacks are beautiful and durable and are both easily spendable and a long term store of value. Unlike paper fiat currencies, Goldbacks are made of 24K gold, which preserves their value against the ravages of inflation.Unlike traditional coins, Goldbacks are bendable and slide easily into your wallet, and contain small, precise weights of 24 karat gold laminated between thin protective sheets of plastic. Goldbacks have all the advantages of gold, because they are made of gold: Goldbacks hold their value while paper money declines in purchasing power, usually gradually but sometimes, as during an economic crisis, rather suddenly. Using Goldbacks is also a completely private and is independent of the existence of any functioning electronic systems or digital networks. With Goldbacks in your wallet, you can buy things even if the power goes out, or the internet is down, or your cellphone is out of range or its battery is dead, or if your bank or even the entire banking system is closed down.",
