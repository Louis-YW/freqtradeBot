But since in Bitcoin world, we shouldn't trust anyone and learn how to verify yourself, it's not advisable to use centralized exchange.The better option is decentralized exchange e.g. Bisq or any other non custodial zero KYC P2P platform [1][1] https://kycnot.me/",

One day I went to Tokyo then all of a sudden I travelled to Hokkaido  Island.   While walking by the snow I met a wild bear.  The bear told me by sound language that I must not jump over the fence.  Then a man appeared to me.  He welcomed me to his hut.  He told me his name is Nakamoto Satoshi. He offered me food and lovely drink made of milk. After 7 or 8 years, I was in London having fun with student in the LSE.  There then came to me a beautiful girl name Toshi.  When I met Toshi, she was intruded to me by another Japanese girl name Shimona.  Who told me about Japanese culture and koi fish. Then I remember my friend Nakamoto Satoshi. 2. I came home thinking of my friend and I give a google search but found nothing about him. It was in 2007 May. then I found a page appeared called Bitcoin@Bitcoin a twitter page.  I saw that the account is created by Satoshi Nakamoto. 3. I read the page and I become interested to know about Bitcoin.  After few months latter, I found out that my friend Nakamoto Satoshi, who created the twitter account Bitcoin@Bitcoin and publishing the Bitcoin: A Peer-2-Peer Electronic Cash System   I contacted him by email. He replied and told me that he is now in London doing an experimentation on global social economic policy. 4. After two days latter, I went to South London to meet my friend Nakamoto Satoshi, who is now known as Bitcoin and Blockchain inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. A crucial question has arisen to many - who is Satoshi Nakamoto ?  Is he Japanese ?  How he came to the idea of Bitcoin and Blockchain ?   Where is he living now ?  so many many question.  In the year 2013 when the American scientist uploaded  a video called '' I think I Know Who is Satoshi Nakamoto !'' it has intrigued many people, there after so many story has published over the last 10 years. Now, no body knows who is Satoshi Nakamoto ?  I am the friend of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto or Nakamoto Satoshi is a wild bear who used to lived in the island Hokkaido.  Now lives in London.  I know him more tan 22 years. [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

You are correct, Bitcoin is likely to rise now and may hit 25k before the end of January. This morning the opening price of Bitcoin was around 23.200 on Binance exchange which is above its pivot point on day chart and next resistance is at 23,767 which is important to break before it can reaches 25K. I think Bitcoin will continue moving sideways until inflation report is announced on 31st January. Based on the trend of previous months, inflation is likely to decrease further, which would be positive for market.",

I know some people will still wait for Bitcoin to continue to gain in price before they even consider buying in because they fear it is still not time to buy. BTC was at $15k+ back in November and has gained +$7k from that time and some will say now is a good time to buy, well you are right and I also believe anytime is a good time depending on how long you are willing to hold but buying when the market is more bloody and fearful is better and with regards to Exchanges, also depends on what type of person you are, are you willing to do kyc or not? so DEXs and CEXs are there to choose from as @mk4 also mentioned.",

Nice try, but this sound like many of the hundreds of bullshit stories about Satoshi. April 1st is still some months away, can't you be patient enough? I suggest you use the skill to write up a fantasy novel. Maybe it could end up being one of those books in The New York Times Best Seller list and no, am not kidding",

You know some international exchanges are currently experiencing problems, whether internal or external, but everyone now has their own principles for buying, trade, invest and so on, trust will ask you to think about which exchange is worth using and buying Bitcoins.For me personally, definitely i will choose exchange in my locale.The reason:• I know the local exchange office.• I know several local exchange teams.• and for other reasons, such as legal entities and so on.Broadly speaking, each country has exchanges that officially operate in their respective territories, the decision is yours.",
