  "content": "Good morning folks, I would like to up my security and did a little digging. Electrum seems to offer a good \"base\" for a 2 out of 3.- Downloaded the latest 4.3.2 DMG from their website, checked the signature- start the app, choose multisig- choose 2of 3- create new wallet (double check the 12 words seed...)- the public general key is created and displayed- I've scanned it with two different mobile iOS apps to add this to their multi sig wallet: both GREEN and BITPAY claim \"assertion failure\" and won't accept the key from electrum- Doublechecked the resolution of the QR code. The apps read the code rightly. And yes, I've chosen the wright menu options on both apps (add xpub)- GREEN: create multi sig wallet, add new account, choose 2of3, use a public key- BITPAY: add account, Multisig, add to a shared wallet=> To double down I've created another new multisig wallet on Electrum to be sure. Same procedure, same result.Can someone please explain to me what I might be doing wrong?",

      "body": "The latest Electrum versions only generates Native SegWit electrum seed by default, that includes the format of the master keys.For example, the master public key that you're getting starts with \"Zpub\" intead of \"xpub\".There's a workaround to convert the Zpub key but there must be a way indicate that the HD MultiSig wallet that you'll create in Green/Bitpay is Native SegWit.To convert the Zpub key, go to \"Console\" tab (View-Show Console), then type:Code:convert_xkey(xkey=\"ZprvAWgYBB.....wCND7HYcZr\",xtype=\"standard\")Replace \"ZprvAWgYBB.....wCND7HYcZr\" with your master public key.However, Bitpay is using an exclusive \"Invitation Code\" instead of xpub so it may not work.Green on the other hand, doesn't have such option only their \"MultiSig Shield\" or it's only available in the IOS version which I do not have.",

After you use Electrum's seed phrase for the first signer, if you then try to import xpubs for the other two signers you will be met with an error telling you the key type is incorrect (Their key type is 'standard', we are 'p2wsh'). If you instead import the xpub you generated from your Zpub rather than a seed phrase, then you will end up with a watch-only multi-sig wallet without any private keys.",

If you want to create a multisig setup all persons/devices have to be using electrum software.First of all: THANK YOU! This was on point and very helpful.May I kindly ask what setup matches my requirements?Am using Nano Ledgers. Multisig for Bitcoin, ideally an app, a ledger plus a Mac OSX wallet. Can you recommend something, because all I know is CASA, but there must be an alternative?!",

      "body": "Ledger Live is available on iOS iirc, while Electrum is not. You can probably use other apps if you only plan to monitor your wallet on your phone. As an alternative, you can use Green exclusively to generate and manage your setup if an iOS app is required, but you need 2FA app and more or less trust them because you effectively only control one key.
