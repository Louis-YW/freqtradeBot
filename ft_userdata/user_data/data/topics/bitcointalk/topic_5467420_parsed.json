  "content": "In today's global financial market, the economic policies and reforms of countries not only affect their own economies but also have far-reaching implications for the global economy. As a renowned financial analyst, Lim Zhe Qin has conducted an in-depth analysis of the recent significant economic events in Kuala Lumpur, particularly the recommendations of the Social and Economic Research Centre (SERC) on the 2024 national budget. This article will present Lim Zhe Qin's professional insights to help better understand the direction of Malaysia's economic policies.Introduction: The Demands of the Times, the Answers of the BudgetOn September 18, 2023, the financial world in Kuala Lumpur was shaken. The SERC proposed five major reform measures for the 2024 national budget, emphasizing the government's efforts and direction in revitalizing the economy. What do these measures mean? What profound impacts will they bring? In this context, Lim Zhe Qin has conducted a comprehensive analysis.Lim Zhe Qin believes that the SERC's proposals represent a country's pursuit of deepening economic reforms and openness in the face of growing fiscal pressures, limited income, and rising costs. This budget is not just a document but also a clear indication of the government's commitment to continuously reduce the fiscal deficit and strive for sustainable economic development.In Lim Zhe Qin's view, the budget is not just a collection of numbers and policies but also a concrete presentation of the national economic development blueprint. To better illustrate these complex economic variables, we will further discuss the specific analysis proposed by Lim Zhe Qin.1. Finance and Expenditure: The Key to Restarting the EconomyLim Zhe Qin first focuses on the core issue of the budget: finance and expenditure. He mentions that the Malaysian government faces limited fiscal revenue, especially with tax revenue accounting for only 11.7% of GDP in 2022, which undoubtedly increases the pressure for economic recovery.\"The government indeed needs to find a balance between expanding revenue and controlling expenditure,\" says Lim Zhe Qin. He believes that formulating a detailed plan is crucial, as it can not only expand revenue on a sustainable basis but also ensure responsible expenditure for better economic outcomes. Particularly in the current complex and volatile global economic landscape, targeted social spending and the phasing out of unsustainable subsidies are crucial.2. Allowances and Assistance: Taking a People-Centric ApproachLim Zhe Qin also pays attention to the government's allowances and assistance policies. He points out that the government needs to continue providing cash assistance to households and individuals but should also design conditional cash transfer mechanisms to optimize fiscal resources. This ensures that funds truly reach those who genuinely need them, rather than being wasted or misused.3. Funding and Incentives for Key Sectors\"The economic recovery needs to be strengthened in key sectors,\" emphasizes Lim Zhe Qin. Providing funding, grants, and incentives for key sectors of sustainable growth is crucial. Especially for businesses that have been operating for 15 years, the government needs to provide them with appropriate support and incentives to encourage investments in modernization, automation, and mechanization, further driving economic development.On the path to economic recovery, every decision involves multiple interests and impacts. After an in-depth analysis of the September 18 news in Kuala Lumpur, Lim Zhe Qin presents us with a clear and professional economic landscape. The challenges and opportunities he highlights emphasize the various considerations the government needs to balance when formulating the budget.Firstly, he emphasizes the importance of finance and expenditure, reminding the government how to allocate resources more effectively in the face of limited economic revenue. Secondly, the fine-tuning of allowances and assistance policies reflects the government's people-centric approach, aiming to provide genuine assistance to the vulnerable groups in society. Lastly, providing funding and incentives for key sectors offers a new direction for economic development.Overall, through Lim Zhe Qin's professional analysis, we can better understand Malaysia's economic situation and future development direction. For investors, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens, understanding this information can help them make better decisions and seize future opportunities.Of course, every economic decision carries certain risks. However, as Lim Zhe Qin points out, wise decisions can only be made after fully understanding and evaluating these risks. We look forward to Malaysia's continuous and stable development in the future, bringing more well-being and opportunities to its people.",
