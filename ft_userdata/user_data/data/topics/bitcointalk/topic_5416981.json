      "body": "Split the prize, though big prize for one person is more exciting but I'd consider it would be fair for both people who win the give away. It's too selfish if there's a person who force to reroll to get a single winner, I think get 0.05 is also worthy since we're not doing anything except choose the number.I ever win a give away on the other social media about Bitcoin price prediction, I give 10% of the winning amount to lucky players who selecting 1-100 numbers and I will pick randomly for 10 users.",

If, according to the conditions of the giveaway, it is necessary to guess the number, and not the number as close as possible to some other number, then you need to make a reroll.In general, I think that everything should be discussed in advance - sometimes after the draw there are nuances and everyone interprets them in their favor, this leads to unnecessary disputes and insults.",

But, if the participants paid some sort of fee then i'll go with the prize split knowing it's better to secure some money than to walk away with nothing at the end.",

For me, it would depend very much on the living conditions. 0.05 BTC is already a year's salary for many people worldwide, but many in Western countries would hardly notice 0.05 BTC. These people then probably play other games of chance with much higher amounts \"just for fun\". So if I were dependent on the money I would accept the price splitting, if not I would probably take the risk and hope for the full profit. If I were personally in the situation I would take the 0.05 BTC and donate it.",

People will surely pick split if the reward is considered huge for them personally while choose reroll if they think that the prize is too small for them to split.For me, that 0.1BTC is already a huge amount so definitely I will choose split the prize unless the organizer will offer to double down the price for the reroll.",

That is, the first participant makes a bet of 0.05 BTC and the second participant makes a bet of 0.05 BTC. From this it follows that it is not rational to take away each of the bets and it is necessary to make a roll until the winner is determined.If the participants do not make any bets, it is better to divide the winnings.",

Most re-roll is a loss, based on my experience. I do this on slots too like the one I tested before where there's a chance to increase the winning amount by challenging the bot with a card game system or just take whatever the amount was given. I tried it like 10 times and I won 2/10 only. I decided to just avoid the card game every time it pops out.",

I mean, why would they split the price when none of them chose the winning number? wouldn't they have to do a reroll by default since no one won? was there a rule stating that if no one picked the winning number then whichever number is closest to the winning number will win? then, if so, picking to split the prize is a great choice but if the participants cannot change the number they have picked then, I'd go for a reroll since I picked 7 and have more chance of winning than the other guy who picked 9.",

I will choose the part of being wise to split the stake money because there is no guarantee that second roll will be my favour, although it is suppose to be a game of luck but if it turns out like this is better to split. For a chronic addict player I believe splitting won't be an option. I have experience this kind of dilemma in a snooker game where two players came into tie on the bet they went and one player suggested to split and each will take back their stake money to go their way and the other refused, they continued on the next round of betting and it happened that the guy who earlier suggested a split happen to be favoured to win and the other guy that refused the split lost out but he didn't regret his decision because he is a chronic addict gambler. Just like I said a chronic gambler may likely not want a split in the situation.",

If he doesn't want to be greedy and just wanted to have the prize then the individual should go for a split. But in any case he wanted the full prize and as a single winner, then reroll to hat that 0.1 BTC. You can call it greedy, but sometimes the mindset of a gambler is very different, I mean they won't be a gambler if they won't take that risk, go big or go bust attitude.",
