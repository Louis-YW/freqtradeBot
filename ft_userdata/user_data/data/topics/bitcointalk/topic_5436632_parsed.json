  "content": "Username: Olien_17 Likely alt accounts: Suma1978, Alik2001, Adam1898 (and possibly more, I have not looked too far outside of the examples that seemed blatant to me (explained below).While browsing the latest posts in Is Blockchain a Good Career? yesterday, I first found Suma1978 and Olien_17 posting oddly similarly:Quote from: Suma1978 on January 23, 2023, 02:37:00 PMIt seems to me that this is a good career, since this is the futureQuote from: Olien_17 on January 23, 2023, 02:55:57 PMit seems to me that this career is going into the future and people who understand it are already standing for their futureI made a joke about the oddness in a post and moved on. Then today I found Olien_17 and two other newbies with very similar weightless posts one after the other in a rather quick succession:Quote from: Adam1898 on January 24, 2023, 03:01:17 PMIt is always necessary to develop, this topic is not only interesting, but can also bring a very good profitQuote from: Alik2001 on January 24, 2023, 03:05:22 PMthe topic is interesting, and can bring very useful knowledge, which in turn will bring you money.Quote from: Olien_17 on January 24, 2023, 04:07:09 PMYes, but you need to understand this topic very wellThe odd similarity is the short effortless post content and the punctuation. It is slightly less obvious than the first example though in my eyes it is was enough to conclude at least that Olien_17 is spamming and using more than one account. I won't say for sure that the other mentioned users are him or involved though I do think it is a pretty safe assumption.",

Also in the future, do these matters get handled without a thread entirely if you just use the report button or do the posts just get removed?",
