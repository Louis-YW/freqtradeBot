Taking the stand in the closely-watched trail over alleged fraud by Sam Bankman-Fried and collapsed crypto exchange FTX, former Alameda CEO and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison made several dramatic accusations about crimes committed by the disgraced crypto mogul and the wider team under his watch.“She said Sam conspired with her (on) a plan to keep the bitcoin price under $20,000, literal price manipulation,” Aaron Arnold said, referring to part of the testimony in which Ellison produced a document that read “Keep selling BTC if it’s over $20k.”I was reading through some news article today and saw this headline that caught my attention which brought about this thought (the title of the thread; Can centralized exchanges, institutional investors or whales, hinder or halt the growth of Bitcoin?) If what Caroline Ellison said is true then how successful was Sam Bankman-Fried in keeping the price below $20,000? I believe we have to ask ourselves this question because if SBF was successful at doing this it means others might want to try it for their selfish benefits in the future and again that's my problem with centralized services, they want to manipulate everything so they can make the most profits from the market. We shouldn't be trusting or patronizing centralized service because we're giving them more power when we do this. If FTX was able to manipulate the price of Bitcoin, only God knows what Cz is doing over there at Binance Exchange.",

If FTX was able to manipulate the price of Bitcoin, only God knows what Cz is doing over there at Binance Exchange. It seems to me that one of the biggest threats to bitcoin from centralized institutions is the fractional reserve system (that's where FTX failed). I'm talking about a situation in which there will be 21 million bitcoins in the network, but in \"circulation\" there will be 121 million, because 10 million will be kept by people on CEX, banks, centralized wallets, with a hiden fractional reserve of 10%.My thread warning about this from 2019 (3 ​​years before the collapse of FTX)Money creation system - is bitcoin creation resistant?",

      "body": "The answer to the question is were they able to manipulate it? NO, because the price of bitcoin around the time FTX was still a functioning exchange doesn’t look like what was manipulated, we only saw a heavy fall when the FTX exchange fell and it wasn’t only the cause as at the end of the year, they were crises like high cost of energy for mining due to Russian- Ukraine heated war then, bankruptcy of certain banks like Silvergate and so on. Yes I believe centralized exchanges or big whales will (or would have) definitely be having thoughts of how they will manipulate the bitcoin market to their favor. But the only thing that can manipulate it heavy Selling at a very low price and this is not much possible because for central body to keep the price at certain level they need to be selling off their millions of bitcoin in their holdings at such or lower price. And that leads to the question how many of this bitcoin do they have that they can spare to sell off to keep the price down? But just as you said if they can habour this kind of thoughts it will be scary to know what they’ve been doing to the users funds in their possessions. I’m beginning to like all this SBF and FTX saga at least it will open the eyes of those trusting centralized exchanges with their funds",

By the way, price manipulation is nothing to be concerned about as it cannot be sustained for a long time, and the people who are moved by it are the weak hands.",

I believe that no one can manipulate the price of bitcoin for long, but only for a short time. If SBF tried to manipulate the market price by keeping bitcoin below $20k, this was the reason of FTX crash because it is impossible for someone that is not in custody of all the bitcoin to do such. He can only think and try but he will never succeed and this is what makes bitcoin decentralized. Whatever Cz is trying to do on how to manipulate the price of bitcoin wouldn't work out because he wasn't the one that created bitcoin, they will only try and keep failing. More people are adopting bitcoin and the number of people moving their bitcoin from exchanges to their noncustodial wallet is also increasing.",

They've already earned money from the services they provide, yet greed continues to haunt them until they're driven to pursue wealth relentlessly. When they gain the power to manipulate the market and exploit it for personal gain or the benefit of a group, they're not hesitant to do so, even if it means disregarding existing norms.As for the activities of FTX, aiming to hold the price of Bitcoin, this constitutes a serious violation. In the world of stocks, holding the price of a stock is essentially a breach of stock regulations. It can be misused for short selling. In the cryptocurrency realm, it's not much different; by holding the price at 20k, it can yield distinct profits for market manipulators.",

I guess COVID & China ban (again) could have played a part but FTX were selling customer bitcoin so if you think about it they were selling the same bitcoin’s over & over again to prop up FTT coin & apparently LUNA also.

No you don't need to hold the whole Bitcoin to manipulate the price. You just have to hold enough quantity to be able to detect how the price move and FTX had alot of users funds. The market can be easily influenced, it's full of inexperienced traders, they'll always follow the market trends that's why when Bitcoin starts dumping the market react by been bearish. People starts panicking and selling and that's where whales take advantage of the market by manipulation it. They can decide to sell a large quantities of Bitcoin to trigger the price declining.

The wouldn't have direct impact on other exchange but if they were able to keep Bitcoin under $20k on FTX it'll influence the price on other exchange as FTX was the second largest volume for trading. The investigation is still going, I'm pretty sure more secrets will be exposed as they betray each other.

Not all cex has time manipulating their users funds like FTX didWhat causes fear in the market, isn't it the decline in the price of Bitcoin so if an exchange can make the price of Bitcoin to stay below a particular price it'll cause fear among traders and they start selling to secure their profits. CEX manipulate the price on their exchange by either creating false sell others and it trigger stop loss of traders. We can't verify her statement but this puts more merit on the saying that CEX are manipulating the price of the coins listed on the exchange, maybe with Bitcoin it's very hard but with altcoins it's a piece of cake.",
