I was in the university then and I was in my year two. On this fateful day, I asked him to accompany me to the salon to get my hair done. Trust me it was a quick updo hairstyle and wouldn't take so much time but I just wanted him there with me. He declined, and said he had something else to do and also he would be spending the night at his apartment and not mine. I didn't try to persuade him to go with me and just left. When I returned from the salon I texted him to let him know I was back home and asked if he's eventually going to come spend the night at my place. He said nope, he was watching a movie bla bla bla. Next day he returned and headed straight to my bathroom to have his bath. I'm not really a nosy person and I respect boundaries a lot but that day my instinct told me to unlock his phone. I tried to shrug it off but my instinct got stronger and then I gave in. Immediately I unlocked his phone, a text came in from a girl he once introduced to me as his friend asking him if he c**me inside of her. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Man was busy with his side chick all night and told me he was seeing a movie when I asked what he was up to. I didn't know how best to react and I bursted out laughing so hard that he began to wonder why I was laughing. When he came out of the bathroom he inquired to know what was funny and boom ðŸ’¥ I showed him the message he got and he was dumbfounded ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ you all can guess the rest of the story. I broke up with him. Oh I didn't get upset until he started apologising ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I mean...why would you apologize for something you did intentionally?",

      "body": "I once had a bad breakup with this beautiful girl named Cynthia. We start dating because we had courses together and thought because we were pursuing the future that we would end of being married. We had been dating now for about 10 months and really thought we had established good communication and trust between us. I took her to a party I got invited by a friend of mine. At the party, I did not realize my ex-girlfriend would end up being there too. I had some drinks I do not know why I saw her and gave her a kiss as if I have not seen her in years. Cynthia saw me and was shocked that I had embarrassed her in front of other people. I followed her to her car and tried asking her for forgiveness. She told me she never wanted to be with me anymore.I was devasted because how could I have allowed that to happen when we were having such a good time? But instead, the person that truly matter to me and loved me walked away and left crushed because of my mistake.",
