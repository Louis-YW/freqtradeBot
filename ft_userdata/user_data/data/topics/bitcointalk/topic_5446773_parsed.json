      "body": "Usually Biowaste is made available for everyone but since low standard of our country they can't afford paying those who will be moving from door to door carrying thoss waste products home various home rather it was made available for you dump your waste and then after when is filled you could carry it directly to the waste site to evacuate them inside and then come take home back your biowaste., But now our people refused to adhere to those rules rather they decided wasting it along the roadside and even without being sealed with a bag for easier waste, instead they will decides to use those things to messed up the whole roadside and streets which is seriously causing air and land pollution.",

It was a brief show of the steam and e no been bad shah.If you are to follow that statement, then that means nothing go ever work for this country, because even the insecurity challenges wey we dey face for some parts of this country are all sponsored by some high-profile government officials, of which even if government adopts the use of this biowaste whereby a certain group of persons are employed to dispose this waste, na so so another set of politicians go use this method dey scam people when the time for payment reach just like our current NEPA people dey do am, wey dem go issue you bill even when you no see light..So for anything to work wella, omo, we just need to tackle corruption first.",
