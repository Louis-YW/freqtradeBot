  "content": "ADENA is a 'M2E' game set in the European Middle Ages between 11C and 13C. There are four classes in the world of THE ADENA.You can participate in the ecosystem of the game and contribute to keeping the world of ADENA busy and in constant development. If you are not fond of the tax and management methods of other castelans, it's possible to establish a powerful guild and seize the castle with a siege battle(Phase4).https://the-adena.com/",

      "body": "Web3 Game (PC)The gaming and working environment with computers indoors. This account is linMining map (PC)The M2E game we think of is one that players participate directly to gain something. Especially in ADENA, there are some ingredients that all players need. The ingredients are produced but disappear as players exploit them. Players need to keep on mining to replenish.Players need to prepare a character for mining. Each character is allowed to mine only below the level of ore that matches the character. Here, the characters have pickaxes that match their rank.Characters can mine iron , silver, gold, and diamonds. They will help immensely in enjoying the Training map. Ores needed for training can be mined on training map. Iron, Silver, Gold, and Diamond will come out probabilistically and Sword Box can be gained with a very low probability. The higher the level, the more ores and the higher grade is needed. A user can invite up to 4 people, and inviting more people allows users to earn a nice NFT (ERC1155, ERC721).*Only one character per account will be mining.Hunting(Training) map (PC)Generally in M2E after playing outside once a certain amount of energy is consumed, movement outside becomes meaningless. However in ADENA, after the outside activity is done, a user can go back home, link their account using a PC, and can continue with their activity on the Training Map. Once energy is recharged, head outside.A user can participate in training with the ores earned from the Mining Map, increase the experience points and level by hunting monsters, and earn Sword Box and Spell Book with low probability. The ability in Training Map does not depend on Sword NFT but solely depends on level, and every one has the same sword for training. The repair of the sword depends on ores so mining in the Mining map is important and the experience points and level is linked to outdoor activities.Indoors, not just outdoors, users can play the game using a PC and unfold the story as if they are training indoors and fighting outside. On the Training map, monsters and boss monsters will appear according to their probability.",

      "body": "Move To EarnIt is possible to play the location-based game using Adventure mode by installing Sword NFT after downloading the app. Users can gain $AKT depending on the STR stat of Sword NFT, and the higher the stat, the more one can gain. If a user has a high DEX, they can expect to earth $ADENA in the future. Users need stamina to hunt monsters(Adventure Mode). There’s a fixed amount of stamina per day, and once all stamina is used, it is impossible to earn $AKT through hunting.HPWhen users hunt with Swords, it is impossible to hunt with Swords when they don’t have HP even if they have enough stamina. In ADENA, users need both stamina and HP and users can gain HP by increasing steps while walking.Boss MonsterBoss monsters appear at a low rate of probability ADVENTURE mode at night. Randomly drop a Sword box or Spellbook. If you have a high STR sword, it will make hunting easier. Enchantit is possible to enchant the Sword from +1 to +10. It is possible to enchant using the Spellbook item. Enchant can be forced up to +4, but from +4 to +5, probability is applied. It is possible to enchant up to +10 with a very low probability, but in case of failure, the Sword will disappear so a user should make a careful decision. Earn SpellbookIt is possible to purchase the Spellbook from the shop with fixed price, and it can also be gained from the boss monster with a low probability in the Training (PC) map or Outdoor Adventure (Mobile App). This can be traded in the Marketplace or through Transfer function of Wallet.Sword GambleThis is the shop of the ADENA server, where users can purchase the Sword of Epic or Legendary with $AKT or $ADENA. The price is extremely high. The products have fixed prices, but can also get failed, epic, or legendary randomly. The probability is very low. *$AKT or $ADENA used here will all be burned.Siege Warfare (Phase6)To play ADENA, users should choose between team A and B. One castle exists in the city area on the map, and the team who possesses the castle can earn more ADENA and AKT. The fight between the two teams will be held on the time that will be counted down. Users can participate/book and stake Sword for 24 hours and the virtual results would come out.*Enjoying Adventure Mode in the winning team’s camp will allow users to gain more $AKT Ex)Common Sword Lv.1 (A team Winner) -> 1.5 AKT + 20%Common Sword Lv.1 (B team) -> 1.5 AKTBetting (Phase6)It is possible to bet on which of the two camp will win. The magnification will automatically be added.Minecraft (GPS)In the future, it will be possible to mix more ores than just ores used in ADENA GAME - PC into items. These ores will be found on the map using Adventure Mode. These ores can be used to mix items or level up. The ores used here are different from Mining Map - PC Ores.Rental System (Phase5)Users can borrow or lend the Sword they own with AKT per hour. Users can borrow the Sword to hunt to earn AKT, but it is impossible to borrow other users’ characters. Logical calculation is needed. When a user has a great sword and is done with the day’s hunt, they can earn AKT by lending other users their sword. For example, other users will borrow the Sword to hunt boss monsters or Siege Warfare. Having a great sword allows you to make profit anytime you want. Users with lower levels can rent Sword with AKT to hunt higher monsters. The amount of AKT one can earn will significantly decrease when they hunt with a rented Sword compared to hunting with their own Sword. *Legendary can only be used for the owner, or it can be sold or bought. *Each team can change settings to not allow lending nice Swords to the other team.
