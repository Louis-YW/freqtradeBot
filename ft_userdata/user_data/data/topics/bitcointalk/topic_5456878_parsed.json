Itâ€™s easy to moderate on board that has a very low activity but this job is hard on board that has a very active members like Russia, Nigeria, Indonesia and others. The title needs to add the moderating job since this is a combo volunteer work.I recommend @mindtrust suggestion because that group of translators are the most active here in the forum.

However, we can take care of some bonuses (PM for details).In the Alliance of Bitcointalk Translators we propose to translate for free those topics which are of general interest to the forum, like for example Education topics like this one or free services created by its members and for its members.In the case of AgoraDesk, taking into account that it is a for-profit project, I can't propose it at first as a suitable project for our pro bono translations as I don't think it meets said criteria:Quote from: https://agoradesk.com/fee(...) AgoraDesk users who create advertisements are charged a 1% arbitration protection fee for every completed trade (...)If you are interested, we can still negotiate the terms for paid translations, or you can try to convince other members of the Alliance to do it for free by posting in our ANN, since each of us is free to accept or reject any offer, paid or voluntary.",

At first I thought that this service was similar to other P2P crypto exchanges, but perhaps I have overlooked some relevant differential characteristic that makes it worth reconsidering volunteering.There is nothing particularly special about this platform and it provides peer-to-peer services like other well-known platforms. But I had good reason to volunteer to translate:I know several Arabic users who were using Paxful and LocalBitcoins. And after the closure of both platforms, they no longer have alternatives to Binance P2P. When I discovered the AgoraDesk platform through the signature campaign that they had launched since last April, I noticed that none of its participants were members from my local (Arabic) board, and that the site did not provide a good version in Arabic. And after making sure of the integrity of the service, I asked for permission to translate the official announcement and publish it in my local board after i promised to maintain it with frequent updates. After doing so, I found satisfaction from the members in my local.",
