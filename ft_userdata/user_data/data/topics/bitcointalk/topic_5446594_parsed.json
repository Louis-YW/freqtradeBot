  "content": "Project Details:Under The Table CoinA faster, cheaper fork of Monero designed to power scalable, anonymous DeFi platforms.Name: Under The Table CoinTicker: UTTCMax Supply: 18,000,000Decimals of Precision: 12Network Difficulty Target: 1 minuteConfirmation Time: 3 minutes (3 blocks)Confirmation Time for Mining: 3 minutes (3 blocks)Emission Factor: 23Tail Emission: 0.3 UTTCConsensus Mechanism: Proof of WorkAlgorithm: RandomXGenesis Block: Brand New (chain not copied)UTTC is forked from Monero v0.18.UTTCexUTTCex is a DeFi platform built on UTTC.Our platform is designed to make transactions instantaneous and avoid network fees by using off-chainmethods after a user or business deposits cryptocurrency. This means that you can move your assets fromperson to person or account to account across different cryptocurrencies seamlessly, without the need for anyintermediaries or additional fees.NFT's can be transferred instantly as well!A majority of transactions occur off-chain within the UTTCex network,therefore reducing foreign-network load across all supported chains.How does UTTCex sustain itself?By providing P2P services like trading cryptocurrencies, loans, and in the future, in-person ATMs that willsupport cash deposits and withdrawals for a minor fee. A significant portion of the fee goes backinto the network and ATM itself, and a small fraction to the UTTC team.How is our CEX able to support DeFi?By providing the capacity for anyone to build their own applications on the network.Wait, loans?Yes, the tokenomics of our loan system can be found on our whitepaper.https://www.uttcex.net/whitepaper.phpJoin our Discord!What's the goal?The world's banking systems from all governments are planning to centralize, incorporating FinTech + CBDC.In America they plan to release SB 686 known as the Restriction Act, which has the potential to cripplethis project since it's based in the US and is not globally decentralized yet.We launch the mainnet in June, after that there is 1 month for us to grow large enough to havea sense of financial standing in the world with this chain and escape restriction.Why are we just hearing about this now?I am currently the only developer and I'm also pretty poor compared to the average American and I do not havethe personal funds to pay for advertising and marketing agencies.",
