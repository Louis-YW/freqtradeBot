In fact, it will be an opportunity to increase the number of Bitcoin holdings in your wallet.What is regrettable is that altcoin voters are against this game of manipulation.",

The sheep got sheared and I can only hope you weren't among them. If you were, learn that trading with leverage on crypto casinos like Bitmex is gambling.

You must be prepared for all the consequences that occur in the market and may have to be prepared to lose everything after you consider the risks. In fact futures trading should be avoided as much as possible by anyone who cannot accept the risks, not just low-budget investors.Many people are so greedy about futures trading, it seems like they can make them rich faster. If you really don't want to lose your money, then stay away from futures trading even with low leverage. Start investing even though I may never be worthy of advising you.",

The sort of bad reputation of Bitcoin comes from the bull/bear cycles, because some people win big and those who buy at the top lose big. Such unpredictable volatility goes against the principles of investing that investing should be a calculated and known risk. With Bitcoin no one knows when a bull market starts or when it ends.",

Perhaps, he does not understand how market react to news (fundamental). Manipulation is actually possible and do happen but the event of yesterday was not what I know manipulation to be; the market was just responding to a supposed positive news. If it was a manipulation, the price would have dumped so hard, far below where it started the rise. The few times I have seen something that look like market manipulation, it dumped so hard against the initial direction the impulse happened. By this, those who jumped into the initial move will be in deep red with little to no motivation to cut the huge loss.",
