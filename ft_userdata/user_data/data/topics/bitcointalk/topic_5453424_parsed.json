Would it be regarded as a component of the casino's responsible gambling policy or as interfering in someone else's affairs it they lock the  gambler's account? I think maximum bet should be changed to maximum bankroll to be used for a day because a maximum number of bet could literally have differences. For example if you're into dice, slots, crash etc., that has huge amount of bets being taken even in just an hour of continuous betting you could really get a vast number of bets. I don't think casinos will do that unless it's a suspicious one and they shouldn't lock it as well just because the user got a maximum bet for the day and I've never seen one tbh.",

Maybe there are rules set now, but I remember when I was still gambling, that I was gambling like 14 hours out of 24 hours daily, and both weekdays and weekends, I have not seen any gambling site that stopped me from continuing gambling even if I continue to lose that day. But on some gambling sites, you can check some helpful articles for addicts and anyone that gambling is becoming a problem to. No gambling site or operator can make this kind of law because the more punters lose the more their gain. Only the government can make it in a way it can be effective. But what most government in most countries are looking for in gambling is how to effectively tax punters. I do not know of other countries, but in my country, you can gamble as many and as long as you can. Some countries may have gambling laws that limit punters but I have not seen such before, and what punters in such country would say is that they do not have freedom over their own money.",

There’s no such thing as maximum number of bet as long you place a normal bet then you are good to go. Casino don’t care how many bets you place and they don’t have any business to stop someone since that’s the nature of their business. I think the only time casino might step in when you have this kind of huge quantity of bets is if you are winning big time on most of it since they might accused you of doing shady things to increase your winning percentage. Casino will not gonna stop you if you are losing big time. Actually, Responsible gambling policy is a policy for players to read to avoid losses not the other way around. It’s a warning to prevent harm but still it’s up to the consumer on how they will handle there gambling. This user only chance of winning if his account is hacked and not under his control during that bet spike.",

Otherwise, it was just a person fully aware of 'cause and consequence' law risking his money in an attempt to make fast profit over it.The problem nowadays is that people can't take responsabilities for their own acts anymore, because it's easier and acceptable by the society to blame someone else or to victimize yourself to prevent suffering the consequences for your own mistakes.

Again, any gambling activity is NOT mandatory- it is upon the discretion of the person if he/she wants to gamble in the first place. Before you also delve into this kind of activity, there is that expected win/loss due to the nature of the activity itself.I doubt that the case will proceed and the gambler would win this. Blaming others for \"failing to stop you\" upon a discretionary act is just plainly a last attempt which is obviously futile in the end. I just find it hilarious that people would go into lengths and blame others for their losses.",

Casinos are still looking to profit from these people, so they won't impose such rules, some may even throw out that \"gambling addiction awareness articles and campaigns\" to absolve themselves of the guilt, or the crime thereof if they base in places where gambling over a certain threshold requires the casino to stop or intervene the gambler. I don't see this ever changing, cause there's no profit to be made in this act of kindness. So with every gambler here, the only way you can surely save yourself from gambling addiction is to actually impose and practice self-control. Can't expect other people to do it for you.",

Would it be regarded as a component of the casino's responsible gambling policy or as interfering in someone else's affairs it they lock the  gambler's account?Honestly, to this day I don't know of any case where a given company was forced to regulate the consumption of exaggerated products or services by customers.With the exception of bars or similar, where the excessive consumption of alcohol by a customer can lead to problems of depredation or bad image on the part of the customer.So, as long as the customer is paying regularly, there's no point in banning it.But, I do agree that this really should change when it comes to gambling. It depends on each country, obviously, to create a law that tracks the gaming habits and average spending of a player, and at least alerts the player when a certain limit is reached or even limits its operations in stricter cases.But for that, there needs to be a law, otherwise, I doubt that casinos, like any establishment, will prevent customers from consuming their services.",

These systems are typically part of the casino's responsible gambling policy, aimed at detecting signs of problem gambling or potentially fraudulent activity. If unusual betting patterns are detected, the casino may take actions such as notifying the user, restricting their account, or implementing additional responsible gambling measures, this commonly happens especially if you are in a winning position.",
