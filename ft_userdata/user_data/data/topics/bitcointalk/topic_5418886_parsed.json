We're currently on bear market and you wouldn't mine that's much if you only have few ASIC miner. While Doge the price only increase when there's a news about Elon Musk (which I don't know why the reason is), if not the price will continue to decrease.",

My budget is 7k-8k.I want to start from mining ETH/ETC. Anyone can give me any advice?My advice is - Don't do it.It's not profitable currently and it's a big gamble to bet on some shitcoin mining right now, Ethereum moved to PoS and all forks are not doing good. If you really want to invest in something your 7k-8k it is better to just buy Bitcoin and hold it in some cold wallet for few years.There is no guarantees this will pay off in future, with currently crazy situation we have in world, but you can diversify with other assets like gold and silver.",

Anyone can give me any advice?7-8k is a lot of money right now, you are better off buying BTC and ETH with the money and hold for a while, you will make money this way without having to waste your grid power, even altcoins like Doge coin and few others have bring up to 40% for investors in just few days.",

Anyone can give me any advice?I would suggest you build a 4K rig and with that money,right now that everything is in red you would be creating a great rig for the money.The rest of the money you buy coins.In this time I think we should experiment in mining coins otherwise normally not mineable and I do this with my rig,I mine Litecoin,Shiba Inu and a couple of other coins normally not mineable with a GPU but I use unmineable miner,that pool gives you a bit less than other pools but that is because it offers to mine such coins.For example with 300 Mhsh at using ETHW as an algorithm I am making near 65.000 SHIB per day,anyone is free to experiment at this time where nothing is profitable.",
