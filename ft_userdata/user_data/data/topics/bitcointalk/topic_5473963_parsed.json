Now everyone has a view of what they see bitcoin as like:a way of being free from government and banks, fast and secure transaction and others but the view of being a means is still included to the other views because nobody will wants to turn down a chance of making more money.Quote from: bittraffic on November 13, 2023, 07:33:37 PMIf you mean peer-to-peer in a decentralized way where 2 people make transactions with no platform in between, humanity has lost trust in each other.   That's what's happening.

A speculative asset - that's what most newbies and traders use it as.A digital gold - in the eyes of the hodlers. IMO all these uses are great and you should use bitcoin the way you choose to, yet not all these uses are equal. Transacting in bitcoin is a far better use than trading it on a centralized exchange. At least that's how I see it.",

      "body": "To be honest, Satoshi created Bitcoin in intention to get rid of centralized system or at least make a new space where a group of people can send money from one to other without involvement of any third party. His main intention was to create a currency that anyone can use and transfer via p2p route, and surely Satoshi got success with his innovation. But, later on investors found it a good investment due to its 21 million supply limit and that's why they started accumulating Bitcoin and holding it for longer terms in order to have better returns with their investment. Due to the creative thinking of Satoshi and the investors, Bitcoin has now become a currency as well as an asset which people can invest in and get profits if they hold their investment.One of the initial testers or you can say inner members of the initial team behind Bitcoin was late Hal Finney(RIP) who speculated that Bitcoin can grow in price and maybe in future a single Bitcoin may reach $10M in value. If we keep those views in picture then surely from the initial days people were sure that Bitcoin can grow in value and it can cross $10k or beyond.",

And only a few percent of them hodl bitcoin in form of an investment. Those who do hodl for long are quite the investors of bitcoin and those who hodl for few days should be seen as the peer to peer traders. Aside those trading bitcoin on exchanges the peer to peer market still boom everyday. Most people due to the volatility of bitcoin use it as a form of investment, for profit purposes. And because people hear the massive gains they make through bitcoin, using it as an investment goes viral than trading it peer to peer. They're multiple methods of trading bitcoin peer to peer; swapping bitcoin to other coins, merchants offering products for bitcoin, and selling bitcoin to vendors for fiat. Each and everyone of us who are into bitcoin may have done such transaction, but only a few amongst us have held or have the intention to hold bitcoin for 5 to 10 years without selling. You see why those who hodl for few days or months still fall in the categories of bitcoin peer to peer trade I mentioned above. Given a specific period of loss or profit, they'll go back to sell their coin. Which is not a good functionalities or attributes of an investor. No doubt when bitcoin is mentioned most people would see it, in their perspective, as an investment. Yet practically, the ongoing peer to peer bitcoin transactions is on the increase. Just that it's not fully discussed or popular like when an investor shows the profits they've made from holding bitcoin for 5 years. That's why people are being told to hodl their coin.",

Investors happened to find it more beneficial as an asset because of its profit potential and volatile market value. There’s nothing wrong with it and we cannot force other people to follow its ‘purpose’. We are just simply taking advantage of its characteristic more than its usage and that’s just fine ‘coz it is still having progressive growth over years. Bitcoin became more popular and acknowledged by more people and companies. With countries’ approval, we cannot do about it other than to wait for things to be better. For now, since it is more helpful as an asset due to high transaction fees, then let us allow ourselves on how would we be able to use it as long as it won’t cause any harm to other investors and to ourselves. Adjustments were done on its usage and I cannot see anything wrong from it.",

But you have to understand that when Bitcoin was traded initially, The New Liberty Standard Exchange, and then we have the Mt. Gox exchange the whole game play has change. And more than a decade, we have hit $69k as our last all time high. So it has evolved, not that it's bad, but it now become an asset that can be traded in many exchange now. But we can still go back to it's grassroots if you can. You can send anyone for anywhere as bitcoin is borderless. And then there are groups who saw it as money, so they spend as regular fiat. And when the pandemic happens, Bitcoin become a hedge and store of value. So it's really up to you on how you are going to treat and use BTC.",

Not to mention, Created more uses than satoshi anticipated.OP, Bitcoin has fulfilled so many purposes for which it was created, and it has also fulfilled the purpose that was not mentioned when it was created, and that purpose is Bitcoin as a means of investment. Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer transaction process without third-party involvement is what I have used Bitcoin for and am still doing. I have paid different kinds of people in Bitcoin, and that's a peer-to-peer transaction. I have also bought and paid for something in Bitcoin, and that's still p2p. So what more has Bitcoin not fulfilled? Bitcoin is not centralized; you don't need the authority of anyone to withdraw and deposit some bitcoin into your wallet.Bitcoin has made some people millionaires and billionaires today because they bought it at an early stage and held it until the price skyrocketed. Bitcoin is a store of value, and the value and price increase over time, and that's why people invest in it. Our currencies (local currencies) are losing value, and Bitcoin has become a cool asset to invest in because the value of our investment will always appreciate during the bull season of Bitcoin. It's not a bad idea at all.",
