But still the warning message from the US DOJ was overwhelming.Reference : bitcoin news",

If you are a trader then, you should not have to ask questions like above.some novice investors and traders have more concerns about the assets they own. especially when market conditions are not very friendly. they look at a market that has fallen sharply and then sees a move that makes them happy. Of course, there is a sense of wanting to take advantage of seeing the correction happen again.Some people predict prices, though they can't guarantee their accuracy, that's how many of them do business.I think prices will likely stabilize at $20k. even if a small pump occurs later it will still be followed by a correction. those wishing to enter at the current price, better think carefully.",

If there is a lot of positive news, it may trigger the bitcoin price to increase and vice versa.But whatever is going on with bitcoin, you have to have a lot of bitcoin these days because if the price can go higher, you can already start to see how much profit you'd make if you sold it. And the amount of profit will be even greater if the bitcoin price can increase quickly to a high price. But maybe the price of bitcoin will stabilize at its current price or rise or fall slightly as a correction before starting to gain again. So be patient.",

What many of us are agreeing in here is that as the halving approaches, we're about to get some bump after that.And that's going to give you the idea that every halving, the bull run's are made.

As to our awareness, the market prices are more likely to increase continuously in 2024 because of the anticipated Bitcoin halving. Reason? Previous Bitcoin fork wherein it broke people's expectation. Which is why I doubt the increase at this moment wherein there is no concrete reason for what we are currently seeing. All I know is that it is good to see a recovery even if there's no certainty that it will continuously increase. The market suffered for months because of different factors. This simply shows hope for this industry, proving that it will always (at the present) be able to recover in every market dump.",

The thing that I want to point out is that, Bitcoin follows the policy of supply and demand. So if the demand of the coin increases, then due to the limited supply of coin, the price will be forced to increase. So Bitcoins will only increase, if we buy more coins than we sell. You can easily see the application in a particular exchange. If the exchange has more buy orders than sell orders, then you will notice that the price of Bitcoins will increase simultaneously.",

As you said and I would like to agree with you is we might see an upsurge to 50k but that is most likely to happen at last quarter of the year. This first quarter might be mixed and the second could possibly see it falling but I don’t agree with you on coming down as low as 10k. The lowest I think it could come is 16k because the end of last year bear period made bitcoin to look to have gain stability at that price. Even when the FTX saga occured and it went to 14k you could see it coming back to 16k mark easily and quickly so I think it has gain stability there. The next stability point could be 20k if it stays there for the next few weeks.Quote from: 8rch7 on January 23, 2023, 08:24:46 AM but according to my predictions the price of bitcoin will continue to increase, because now the issue of war has subsided, post-covid 19 issues and crismon has subsided, even now there are clear and firm regulations against thousands of micin coins that have spread too much and are at risk of scams.All your stated factors have actually impacted the rise of bitcoin but one scary thing that was left and could affect it rise is the recession lurking around and the much talked about inflation hike. Should any of these suffice within the year it could greatly alter the price. Also we could be faced again with another saga like a big exchange been hack which could have its impact on it too",
