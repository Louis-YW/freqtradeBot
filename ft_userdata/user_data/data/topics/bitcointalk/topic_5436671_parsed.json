Four unknown words is very difficult, and would require renting hardware at a cost in order to do this, so the value in the wallet needs to be worth it. With 5 or more unknown words there is no point in even trying.",

However, it is still worth trying, as there is a chance that the recovery tool can successfully guess the missing seed words based on the words you have.As for locking your seed in the script, you could use encryption to protect the seed from unauthorized access. This way, only someone with the decryption key would be able to access the seed. It's important to use a strong encryption method and to store the decryption key in a secure location.Additionally, it is recommended to use a hardware wallet to store your private keys, which are considered the most secure way to hold your crypto assets. Hardware wallets are designed to protect your private keys and seed words from theft, hacking and other types of attacks.Also, it's crucial to note that attempting to recover a lost passphrase or private key through hacking or guessing is not only a bad practice but also illegal in many jurisdictions, it's highly recommended to use official or well-vetted libraries or tools to access or manage the private keys and never share your seed words or private keys with anyone.",

Try all possible means to look for your seed phrase is my advice.Or put seed-phrases aside for many years and wait for the moment when computing power increases and prices for them fall. Then, perhaps, with other technologies, it will be possible to pick up the rest of the words.Or pass these 5 words to your descendants so that they can access btc with future technologies.In any case, you do not lose anything, because you have already lost, but at least there is a chance that someday you or your relatives ones will have access to bitcoin.
