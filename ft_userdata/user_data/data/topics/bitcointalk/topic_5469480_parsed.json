I do not know of MacOS, but I do not think that is necessary anymore on Windows OS.Opening Electrum Testnet on Windows OS will be easier because, by default, a shortcut is provided in the start menu.What I mentioned above is another alternative way to access the Electrum Testnet on Windows OS.For MacOS, by default, you will not find Electrum testnet shortcuts, unlike Electrum for mainnet networks. To access it using the command line, as I mentioned before.Meanwhile, Electrum testnet on Linux (Ubuntu), you can use the following guide (I haven't tried this myself):https://bitzuma.com/posts/a-beginners-guide-to-the-electrum-bitcoin-wallet/#testnet-on-ubuntu",
