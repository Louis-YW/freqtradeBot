It became the first bank in German to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services for financial institutions and asset managers.And $15 million for a bank is dirt cheap if you ask me.  I wonder if their crypto business somehow got them into trouble financially.  Interesting, but the title of this thread is pure clickbait.",

Maybe it's already been decided and whoever are the executives and board members of that bank doesn't have any other solution but just to sell it to the group with the said amount.But isn't that low if the price is $15M and that's a long running bank?",

Bitcoin is not an institution to buy anything - and I will not click on your link, because I have nothing smart to read.I am 100% sure that banks do buy bitcoin. Well to be honest I know at least one bank in my nation that does, and they are not just buying bitcoin neither, they have a digital currency fund, which means they do buy bunch of everything.Considering how small we are still compared to banking world, if all the banks in the world spent just 1% of their investments on bitcoin, then bitcoin would have been 1+ million dollars already. The marketcap may look big, but the buyer amount is not that big usually, and that means if we have that much more buyers all of a sudden, in trillions of dollars really (banking world) then we would be a lot higher.",

I guess that tells that it was a legit news and not fake. The company called Bitcoin Group won't be called like that for no reason but they must be related to BTC and it seems I am right because again I did a research and found out this link: https://bitcoingroup.com/de/ this must be their official site because there is also post there about their plans of acquiring the oldest bank.It's already a big deal if some groups related to crypto are going buy a normal bank, but how much more if it's the oldest bank? But we aren't sure if that bank will agree with the offer. @boyptc is right that $15m seems small for this.",

This is the most mind-blowing news of the yearInterestingly enough, FTX had also bought a bank.QuoteWhy did FTX buy into a U.S. bank owned by a co-creator of ‘Inspector Gadget’?Before FTX collapsed spectacularly last month, the exchange operated like most other cryptocurrency exchanges: in the dark, outside the banking system, and offshore. Cryptocurrency exchanges often struggle to access the U.S. banking system, and so they look for alternate routes to cash their checks: shell companies that hop from bank to bank before vanishing into thin air, dollar-denominated assets that can be cashed out abroad, or, in this case, simply buying a bank.“Buying a bank often has been a holy grail” for companies that have trouble establishing traditional banking relationships, says Carol Van Cleef, who chairs Washington law firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings’s blockchain practice. If an exchange owns a piece of the bank of which it is also a customer, “getting debanked is going to be a little more difficult,” she says..Crypto firms are hardly the only ones to try to avoid this fate by buying a bank of their own. SunFirst Bank, for instance, banked semi-legal poker sites from 2009 to 2010 after a $10 million investment from a dodgy payment processing firm before the FDIC shut it down in 2011.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-ftx-buy-u-150330319.htmlThat news article is a good read. There is also a link in it to a story about binance considering buying up a bank of their own.",
