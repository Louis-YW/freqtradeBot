  "content": "What I know is that these gambling companies that accept Bitcoin as one of their accepted currencies are registered and licensed from Cyprus and Curacao (an island located in South America and a part of the Netherlands). We all know that there are only two nations that lawfully accept Bitcoin as a legal currency, El Salvador and Central African Republic. So how come that these gambling companies are allowed to put to use Bitcoin as one of their accepted currencies when neither Netherlands and Cyprus aren't legalizing Bitcoin as a currency? Are the authorities of these nations turning a blind eye on the Bitcoin use? Or is it possible that gambling companies are allowed to accept any forms of tangible or non-tangible objects so long as they deem it valuable to their operations? Take for instance, casino chips and tokens are used to play games in the tables and on slot machines. So is this the case of Bitcoin too?",

There license is for E-gambling and not for the currency besides there’s no strict law regarding forbidding of Bitcoin and altcoin on most of the country except China, Russia and other country that has strict regulations against crypto but the rest has no defined law in regards crypto that’s why this online gambling company can freely operate if they an e-gaming license coming from Curacao.",

Just look at payment processors that accept bitcoin and give to the shop, by its choice, bitcoin or fiat. I think it's the same situation.How they do it? I don't know. It may be something similar to what the crypto exchanges are allowed to do (they also accept both fiat and crypto for deposits and withdrawals), or it may be something similar to what pawn shops are allowed to do (accept anything they consider valuable).So while it may look strange, I think that they're OK on this. I think that their strange residency is related to the gambling license, not the handling of the coins.",

Actually the fact is that, they don’t use the license for using Bitcoins at site, rather those are gambling licenses issued by those companies.Now the casinos who take the licenses, completely have the control to whether they want Bitcoins or FIAT to be integrated at the site.Nevertheless the law in those nations are also not so strict regarding cryptos.",

It only has to be legal (regardless of what the government calls it) for the centralized regulated companies to accept bitcoin payments.Basically if it is legal tender they would have to accept it but If it is a legal currency they can accept it if they want to. Google tells me that there is no regulations that prohibits getting paid in bitcoin in Netherlands and I couldn't find anything about Cyprus. Which means bitcoin is legal in these two countries and anybody can use it as payment.",

Online casino's are accessible to people in different locations, and the casino you play with may not be bound or affected by very strict laws of your country. On the other hand, Most governments do not worry too much about their citizens owning bitcoins as digital assets and making use of it for things like trading and say gambling, they just don't want it mixing up with their banking sector, just like the central bank in my country Nigeria recently clarified. So long you have a way to profit and get your money without going through the banks, you are good to go.",

The Curacao or Cyprus gaming license provider probably doesnt care whether the casino accepts BTC or only fiat as long as they receive pay from these casinos.If they are to regulate, most likely they could only approve a few crypto casinos. Unfortunately they are not regulators of online casinos.",

In many countries Bitcoin and other cryptos are neither legal not illegal. They aren't explicitly forbidden, their usage isn't regulated, and thus a legal maxim that what isn't forbidden is allowed is relevant. So unless there's an explicit ban of using Bitcoin for gambling, there's no problem with gambling websites accepting Bitcoin. Also, I think you raised a good point that casinos often use chips, tokens, which are not any form of money but are allowed in casinos around the world, so yeah, cryptos can be viewed like that in case of gambling, I guess.",

OP gave a good example with gambling chips.Legal tender in UK law is defined as what the courts will accept to be paid in, I'm fairly certain the courts are then able to convert that into a currency the claimant asks for it in, and if not the bank of England will because they have a legal obligation to convert legal tender without fees.",

About Netherlands, there are activities of crypto industry there, companies, exchanges so they have yet officially banned Bitcoin.In addition, don't forget about Web3 casinos that would give you more freedom. With Web3 casinos, you can connect your wallet and bet. Of course, it is more easily with tokens (ERC20, BEP20, etc.) but if it is Bitcoin, there would be other solutions as no direct way to connect Metamask wallet, example, and use Bitcoin to bet. The wallet is for tokens, not for Bitcoin.",

Bith are not widely accepted in short, but if we would be looking on a bigger perspective, both of these things could really work. Since gambling in some countries, is prohibited, anonymity because of block chain could be an aid for the gambles to continue their 'hobby'. Gambling on the other hand could boost the use of cryptocurrencies with online transactions. From this picture, it could be an example of a domino effect and direct exchange of benefits from one another.",
