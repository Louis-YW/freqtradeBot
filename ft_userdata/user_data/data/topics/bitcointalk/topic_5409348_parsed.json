In that thread i don`t see the posts with the problems and the manager answers rather fast. I can`t say anything good or bad about this casino - they are too young.",

So, use their ANN thread or contact support directly to solve your issue.Also, you haven't written how much you have to withdraw, and what you've played, so, before to call to a \"scam\" you should prove that.EDIT: considering your post history, everything is a scam for you; you've already accused other well reputable casino like Trustdice.win and Duelbits.com",
