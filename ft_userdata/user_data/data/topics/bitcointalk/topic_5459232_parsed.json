I don't know how I was able to post this Â Edit again- Strange behavior. I was trying to post on the local thread but failed (for some selected text only)Final edit-This is really strange!I can post everything else but not the below text. Whenever I tried to post this, it says, \"500 Internal server error\"I didn't smoke, and I'm not drunk. Guess what? I can't attach the text here lol. It's some Bengali text btw.",

      "body": "I faced the same problem. 500 error appears when a message is big. If shorten it then it will be posted. I don't know exact length of a post to be passed without this error, but when I faced this error today twice each time I cut a post or quotes in the post and my post passed. If not to make it shorter there always will stay 500 error.Hope the situation will be resolved as it is inconvenient to write short posts only.",

They are posted with the same problems as other users have, but at least posted.But when I try to post some long enough Cyrillic post (non Latin letters require more bytes than Latin) I get 500 error and blank page each time I tap Post button. So any long post of mine has just not been posted today. I shortened both I tried.",

One user was on this trap and I see he made 5 to 6 posts of the same response LOLWhen you click the Post button, the response posts but the page you are in keeps loading until it shows the error.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on July 09, 2023, 06:40:57 PMI am having fun LOL.Honestly speaking the browsing experience seems faster than other days. May be not many people are logged in today because of the error ðŸ˜‰",

But that 500 error is different, it didn't give any opportunity to post anything long enough at all, it throwned to blank page with 500 error each time I tried to post a long post. When I shortened it I got that problem as you mentioned but the post was published. Two different kinds of problems.",

And this whole issue of the website behaviour started since yesterday evening. But my message was not 500 error but verification page. It was written \"checking if the site connection is secure\". And the page was restarting again and again, so I could not post. And from the beginning I know that the issue is from forum and not from my side. I thank God that it is working now. It's like some people are still facing it now.",
