But according to the recent news:Quote from: https://punchng.com/breaking-marketers-adjust-pumps-as-fuel-price-hits-n617-litreThe pump price of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, was raised from N537/litre to N617/litre at some filling stations operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited in Abuja on Tuesday.Quote from: https://punchng.com/breaking-marketers-adjust-pumps-as-fuel-price-hits-n617-litreRecall that President Bola Tinubu had during his inaugural address on May 29, announced that subsidy on petrol had ended, a development that led to the jump in the price of the commodity from N198/litre to over N500/litre on May 30, 2023.Quote from: https://punchng.com/breaking-marketers-adjust-pumps-as-fuel-price-hits-n617-litreSince the withdrawal of subsidy on petrol and the floating of the naira against the dollar, marketers had continued to explain that the cost of PMS could rise to as high as N700/litre.Quote from: https://punchng.com/breaking-marketers-adjust-pumps-as-fuel-price-hits-n617-litreSimilarly, the rise in the cost of crude oil in the international market has also triggered further hike in petrol price, as crude is the product from which PMS and other refined petroleum products are produced from.Or you can read the news in full: https://punchng.com/breaking-marketers-adjust-pumps-as-fuel-price-hits-n617-litreThis is no more about fuel subsidy.",

I was not shocked after seeing this hike in fuel price. After the fuel subsidy removal it was clear that the marketers will be the ones to be regulating the prices of fuel henceforth. The price might go up at anytime and can still go down, so further hike in price shouldn’t still be a surprise to Nigerians. The recent hike in price could be as a cause of the increase in Naira to Dollar rate in the parallel market. Nigerians still take crude oil out of the country to refine and still import back, so since Naira is depreciating against Dollar, the PMS price have to adjust to suit in that price.",

Just now now I read it from daily trust wey costumer dey confirm am say him buy one litre of petrol for ₦617.The moment fuel subsidy was removed, it was expected that the price of a liter of fuel should be heading to 1k per liter so I wasn't surprised to see this coming into manifestation. You know say anything wey rise for Nigeria no dey come down. Nobi dollars dey trade above #800 so. This country na just frustration be the government job, e just belike any government wey enter office na to bring frustration from where the pass government stop. I dun talk my own if tinubu no get better plans for this subsidy wey him remove so make him bring am back make we dey managed am like that even though we dey feed Cameroon and other neighboring countries abi we no be giant of Africa again?I been dey expect say I go see some news on wetin be dey plan so after them commot the fuel subsidy but wetin I see na palliative of 8k per household. Belike tinubu no ready to rule Nigeria self because which cam joke be dat. Wetin 8k go do person in this country wey we dey so as everything dun cost like say we kill person for the country. The president has done nothin to address the issue of fuel prices rising since he took over office and at this rate e dun dey clear say Tinubu no sabi wetin him dey do and I wish he can prove me wrong because I been dey expect the country to better small because of him government.",

Cause of living now for naija as increased people are finding it difficult to survive the poverty and hunger strike. I Wonder why Nigeria that has crude oil are now suffering for scarcity of fuel.
