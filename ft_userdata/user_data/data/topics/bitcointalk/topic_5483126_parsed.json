You may consider looking into the pattern in the past bull runs and it's gonna be like several months to even more than a year before you finally see the impact of it for the price.

If you miss this time then wait for the next cycle on 2028's halving. That's all for someone who might miss this bull run and haven't bought because of being conscious and doubting whether it's good to buy now or not.",

Bitcoin price starts to rally hard above 20K right after the filing of Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF which gives confidence that for this approval which really comes true. The effect happened before the approval and not on the day during the approval. It’s common on trading to buy the rumor and sell the news to play smart.Quotebut question is how long does it take for halving to impact price and are we in that period called \"last buying chance before bull run?\"Same with Bitcoin ETF approval. Don’t expect that price fluctuations will happened during the day of the event or on a single day because it’s effect will be distributed for a period of time because confidence on buying is not built on a short period of time. Accumulation happens in long time frame either months or years. Bitcoin mining difficulty will be doubled so Bitcoin price will surely grow in the long run after halving.",

That price increase was also fueled by optimistic news about the ETF approval. It's just that many people were too greedy to want bitcoin to continue to rise higher when ETFs were officially approved and ignored the warnings of many people to \"buy rumors, sell news\".I think from now until the halving there will be no more price drops, the market will continue to recover and increase prices until the halving takes place. But I agree with you that after the halving we will have an correction and will even be the last major correction to officially enter the 2025 bull season.",

Bitcoin spot ETF already had influence in the market even before its approval and that was because of the fake news that was released about its approval, those price impact then already proved it, so when it was finally approved, there was nothing to impact the market about it again. Although, I still believe in some market change before the halving as a result of the bitcoin spot ETF approval, but until then, taking advantage of the last dip before the bull run is the best thing to do now. Bitcoin halving is close by and no one will want to afford to miss not stocking up their holdings in the portfolio. The impact of the halving cannot be said to how much it can have effect on the market but overall, during that period after the halving, try not to sell until the bull run season when a new all time-high of bitcoin will be reached.",

      "body": "The price didn't grow immediately after the ETF approvals for a couple of reasons. One is that a lot of BTC got sold as a consequence, including, allegedly, billions of dollars worth of BTC by Grayscale. Another reason is that the news was overhyped well in advance because a potential ETF approval was a major theme of Q4, 2023. In October, the price was below $27k, and now we're at over $40k. That's the ETF approval growth, basically, and it's massive.As for a proper bull run and full price recovery, I just think it's too early for that, and no events like adoption news can change that. Halving doesn't equal a bull market either, but many expect the price to rise eventually after halving.",

Current prices of cryptocurrencies can be the least one might get in this dip.ETF approvals undoubtedly didn't perform up to the expectations of most people in the market, even the rumors regarding the approvals had more positive effect on the market than the actual news.",

So Bitcoin should get its ATH point in April 2025, where from April 2024 there will be a price increase for 1 year. But this is not an exact science, because this kind of speculation is very easy to debunk. As long as the market is still volatile, that means we still have the possibility of being wrong in estimating future prices.If you are looking for timing to buy a good one, now is clearly the right time. Even if prices continue to decline, DCA is the best way to anticipate high average purchasing prices.You can look at historical bitcoin halving price charts on Google and that will at least give you an idea of when is the best time to buy and sell. And once again I remind you, the future cannot be predicted accurately.",

This question you just asked is present right in front of you unless you don't have access to a Bitcoin trading chart, this will give you the needed history of the last halving and how they also behaved. Nonetheless what I know from my last reading is that the effects of halving are two, you will see some pre-halving effects just like how it happened last year, a simple ETF news was aggravated due to that, that is my opinion though. But it doesn't end there, there will be some other dramas shortly before the halving time, it could be either bullish or bearish, just be careful at that time.Also, we have the post-halving effect, and in this, we have the main bull run that people often wait for. This time, I think the effect will happen faster than before, this will be aggravated by the too much expectation of people due to more popularity of the halving tradition. It will not surprise me if people are investing in Bitcoin faster than it happened in the past. However, if it has to move the way it did in the last halving effect, we might be waiting till October before a huge bullish movement would be seen in the market, even though some small-sized effect would have happened, but that would look like usual market movements before the huge one will finally come in play.",

Doesn't really matter though, it will eventually come. The thing is that the accumulation phase could have been done maybe in the last year or so. At least you have save during that time when the price is below <$40k.However, there is a speculation that the price could go as high as $180k. So if you can invest as this time, maybe you can still profit. It might not be as huge though, but still if there is profit to be made then that might be good already.",

As we can see through BTC's history, each new halving brings lower increasements in price, so probably we aren't going to see something like 11,000$ to 69,000$, taking the last bull season cycle from 2021 as example. Then I guess something around 100,000$ for this current cycle seem solid. It's not a x6 profit opportunity anymore, but it's still possible to expect doubling your investment, what seems quite interesting from a realistic perspective. We have to be aware the early days of Bitcoin, when prices skyrocketed and millionaires were made in a matter of days, are gone. Now the industry is large enough to be more competitive and opportunities tend to get more scarce as the time, regulations and adoption go by... But of course, I would like to see Bitcoin doing much better than that, and if it's possible to happen yet, I will be joyful!",
