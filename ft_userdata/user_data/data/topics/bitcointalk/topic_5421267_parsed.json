To the forum account. Only the admin can answer what it is used for appropriately, but let me guess it is used for the forum maintenance and ongoing.Bitcoin transaction fee is still cheap even as the mempool is slightly congested.",

This makes the transactions made from yesterday to the next few days have bigger transaction fees.Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on November 16, 2022, 11:30:09 AMBecause i've experince when send bitcoin need atleast 5-10 minutes to confirm on blockchain. If without confirmation, the new user must know to do not seting the fee more than 1 satoshi. You can look into https://mempool.space and compare block times with the moment you've sent the transaction. Sometimes blocks come faster, sometimes slower. The 10 minutes is an average.Plus, the time is counted from a previous block, not from the moment you send transaction, so you can get lucky now and then.Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on November 16, 2022, 11:30:09 AM1. I am curious, is there need a blockchain confirmation?A transaction without confirmation doesn't matter; so I'd guess that at least 1 confirmation is needed.Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on November 16, 2022, 11:30:09 AM2. Where a 740 sat go?, to treasure forum? I have no experience with that fee, but probably it's going to forum's treasury, in a way or another.",

It doesn't explicitly mention the need for a confirmed TX (as opposed to when you pay for a Copper Membership), so it either accepts 0 confirmation TXs on the hypothesis that the amount is small (and that cheating the payment with a double spend can easily be dealt with by reverting the proxyban), or it is omitted in the text.I presume it’s the former. You could check the date/time of the TX you paid, to see it the first confirmation was later than when you started to post without issues.",

The fees are very small and do not exceed a dollar in the worst cases, and they are often less than the minimum dust amount imposed by some wallets.Generally, if you cannot afford to pay the fee, you can PM me and I will decide if you deserve a free whitelist without pay fees.",

Whenever the address is filled with the minimum/higher amount of evil IP fee, you will be automatically able to post. Usually, if a transaction is small and don't have RBF enabled, most services take it granted as confirmed. While RBF enabled txs will not be granted as confirm without at least one on chain confirmation.",

To atone, you must pay a total of 0.0000xxxx bitcoins (0.0xxxx mBTC; xxxx satoshi). Pay to the address <BTC addy>. Once you have paid the full amount, wait a few seconds and then reload this page. If the fee is so small that your wallet is unable to send it, you can send any larger amount, though you will not be refunded the difference.So it didn't have any information about how much information is required and usually the proxy ban pay is very low so it doesn't need confirmation and that is why the users paid can use the forum straight away irrespective of confirmation.",
