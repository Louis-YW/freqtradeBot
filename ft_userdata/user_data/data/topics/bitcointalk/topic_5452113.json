  "content": "Hello, I just finished my three-year degree in History, discussing the following thesis: Blockchain: decentralization of currency, power and the state.The idea that prompted me to choose this topic was to analyze the blockchain phenomenon from a historical or social science perspective, trying to complicate what we already know and trying to make this subject simple for those who are not technicians.I am not sure if I have succeeded, but it is definitely a start, and those who start are halfway there. Now I would like to gather feedbacks and then publish it as an e-book.If you would like to read it and let me know what you think, you can write to me publicly or privately.As I said, I would like to keep updating it (or rewriting it) and then make it an e-book.

I thought our professor would think of it as a joke but he'd agreed to our research title as long as we could provide informations for it. And we'd defended it since we have knowledge about crypto and it might help students to learn from it.",

Your topic is not will restructured to suit the table of content. Okay let me ask you a simple question if really a project of yours. From the Topical Sentence, which part is the Dependent Variable and independent Variable? He coming to the table where are chapters analysis? After the Introduction, it should be preface, and acknowledge, Then summary, you just start from introduction to no where. This your project is a very big lie.

I downloaded the book and it is well-organised and easy to read. I will read it when I go on vacation next week. It is great to see scholars research novel topics that have not been over-researched. I like such a topic because you can defend your thesis easily since most supervisors or professors don't know much about the topic. They might be confused about most concepts and will give you good grades if you present them very well. You finished the thesis in 2022, I would like to know your score/grade in your thesis.",

I actually don't know which grade they assigned specifically to the thesis, but I know that it was not the maximum.

Meaning that the history of Bitcoin, although it is recent, is not well documented and perhaps a large part of it is this forum, so is it not suitable as a reference for such theses?In general, congratulations on completing the study of historyThanks! At the end of the thesis, there are the sources, but I must admit that they could be improved significantly. My hope is that, with suggestions from the community, I can identify areas for improvement and potentially transform it into a \"collective book.\"It's true that Bitcoin is very recent; however, the thesis is not about the history of Bitcoin. Instead, it focuses on how this technology (specifically blockchain technology) can change political paradigms and how this phenomenon can be studied using \"old\" frameworks as well.By the way, if you have problem at downloading it, I've also uploaded it here.https://mega.nz/folder/4QhgQD6Z#4oI_RE6Q7N_E2vd3yp4paQ",
