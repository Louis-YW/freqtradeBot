Look for some other platforms like social media and other crypto groups in your locale to place this ad. This will certainly get the attention for those that have been finding a way to spend their ETH and wanting to buy a house. Anyway, I hope you find the buyer and this sale proceeds with someone who is able to take it with your asking price.",
