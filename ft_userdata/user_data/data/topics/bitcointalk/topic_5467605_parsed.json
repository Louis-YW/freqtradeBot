  "content": "A lot of people talk about steps to becoming a good Bitcoin investor or tech bro in the crypto space. The point is how really can this be achieved?.well achieving this is not a very simple task , however there is a simple point to note.To become successful in the crypto space you have to first understand the idea behind the crypto space (emphasis on Bitcoin).The first question is what is the idea behind bitcoin. It may seem vague but it was this idea that prompted the pseudonymous entity Satoshi to create Bitcoin.¬†This idea was;¬†1. Creating a currency that was not controlled by any entity especially the government.This can be summarized as Decentralization in other words you are in total control of your assets.¬†2. Creating a currency that would not require any means of identification.Making it quite impossible to totally track a user still making it possible to notice transactions by that user.This can be summed up as Anonymity. 3.Creating a currency as secure as possible. With these being said,logically the main idea behind bitcoin is Anonymity,Decentralization ¬†and Security.Come to think of it ,understanding the reason something was created gives you the best sense of use and therefore an edge over others in the same space which in this case is the crypto space.And most importantly Don't forget to keep your keys safe üòÅ",

Bitcoin was created as a global currency and anyone in the world could use it without any restrictions. It was a tiring work to convert fiat currency of one country to another country's fiat but Bitcoin made that thing easier for us because we can use same Bitcoin in any country we want and we don't even need to carry the burden of any extra fees. The Bitcoin is simply the best solution for most of our financial problems and that's why people recommend others to invest in it because the Bitcoin investors are free from the trap of inflation and they can have peace of mind even in times when inflation rises to very high levels.",

Creating a currency that was not controlled by any entity especially the government.This can be summarized as Decentralization in other words you are in total control of your assets.But that can only be possible when you use a non-custodial wallet, and avoid hodling your BTC on an exchange whereby you own the private key to your funds.Quote 2. Creating a currency that would not require any means of identification.Making it quite impossible to totally track a user still making it possible to notice transactions by that user.This can be summed up as Anonymity. And that can also be possible when you don't use an exchange where KYC is compulsory, as you may be force to do kyc, and as such your identity is reviewed.",

Because to be a user of decentralization, you should use the decentralized platforms to trade in BTC and to benefit from the anonymity factor, you should prefer to take measures like don't trade on CEXs and trying to obfuscate as much as you can. Try to hide IP etc. The point is, that you have created a good topic, but it still needs more words for an explanation. And the main idea was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized platform that could be used as a payment method between two entities. There must be no intermediary to deduct huge fees and ask for A to Z documentation.I also created a relevant topic in which I shed light on the same question which is to teach others why BTC is better than fiat or banking system. Topic named as --> To Understand the Potential of BTC, What we Must Know?",

Most people do not want to learn the basics of crypto instead they just want to earn money in the first night and they want to become rich overnight. And they don't care about the decentralization or security factors. They just want money, even if they have to scan their faces to earn free satoshies. Actually, I have come to that about an app named as satoshi where the person has to scan their face. People now don't care about centralization, decentralization, or security or anonymity and what benefits are there in using the BTC. I was reading a topic that says BTC has performed more than what Satoshi might have expected and he is totally right about it because BTC is now being used as an asset to store the value, people are not holding BTC instead of using as p2p which Satoshi has expected and made BTC for but people are now using it beyond the expected limits.",

There were plenty of projects since early 90s that tried the same thing, there are plenty of examples of it at all times. However, what wasn't accepted today, is vastly accepted today; centralization. Bitcoin was the first one that created the blockchain behind it, none of the others had it, and that trustless peer to peer currency idea was finally created with a software that backs it up, which was just an idea before, but bitcoin managed to make it a reality. What we had in the 90s was things like the tokens we have today, where you pay a person to create a token, and they may steal it, or they may make it, which wasn't accepted back then.",

Anonymity is also the idea behind the creation of Bitcoin, although not absolutely but this will be enough to protect the security and privacy of Bitcoin or crypto users. and Bitcoin also has a limited supply of only 21 million Bitcoins and it still hasn't been mined at all.
