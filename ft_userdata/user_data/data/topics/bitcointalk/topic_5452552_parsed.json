The site seems ok and i checked it on dextools and it's not honeypot. What do you guys think?This is the BSCscan adress: https://bscscan.com/address/0x2b71ca064cb80e848bc76f67d6d4ed70a670f14c",

What do you guys think?This is the BSCscan adress: That is a big if, and the same could be said about almost any other coin in existence today, it is true that if you were to invest in a coin with a small market cap and then it skyrockets the amount of money you can make could be insane, but how likely is it that everything is going to happen according to your needs? Not high at all, so if you want to follow through with this plan then no one can stop you, just do not forget that this plan has a low chance of actually happening.",
