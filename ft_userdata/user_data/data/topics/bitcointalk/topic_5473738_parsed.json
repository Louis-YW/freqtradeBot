Anything can happen through pump and dump, just like what happened to the doge, which only happens through pump and dump.It's a pity that I didn't buy SOL last year to save it; it was still a bit difficult for me to establish a profit during those times. Now, in FTT, it is not my priority right now; maybe if I have more allocation budget for that thing, I can buy it.",

All I knew is they were short of around $7B, and that's all. I am curious how non-customers (organizations) were giving them money for operating a business that is not even worth that much. Look at the amount dude! But as far as I understand, those amounts were never verified and were all based on assumptions. So, should we take this chart seriously? I don't know. I am not a customer of FTX. $9.2 Billion assumed to be invalid? What about the IRS? If this chart is legit and those claims legitimacy were verified, then f***.",

I don't know what good news make SOL and FTT coin up drastically exactly with SOL success raised drastically from current dropped price $10 and last day up until $60. Its difficult SOL can up drastically if FTX exchange still hold this coin, actually after raising up few percent they will sell and make SOL get correction drastically.Looks FTX have sold out SOL and FTT coins, latest moment when both coins drop drastically its effect with  FTX sold with much coins current in their exchange account.

It claims, which the IRS estimated at that value, there is no way they will manage to get all the money from FTX with that claim, the funny thing is that it even considered failed capital gains taxes on the sums that were deposited on FTX, there is no way in hell any judge will agree with that.It's IRS tactic as always, they file claims to every possible thing to have what to cut back when they are denied one after the other.Besides, even that is nothing compared to the 1.7 trillion Blockfolio is asking for  Every single one of those including the claims between Ftx and Alameda will be dismissed one by one, contract claims, litigation claims, they will be lucky to get 5% of that value.Quote from: mk4 on November 12, 2023, 01:19:12 AMLol it's going to take a lot more than $60 SOL (and whatever FTT's price is right now) for FTX to be solvent again — and take note, the SOL might've been slowly but surely being sold already.

That was why SBF was always biased towards Solana projects and even launched a few sub projects like project serum. At the time the bankruptcy was announced, FTX still had plenty of sol on its balance sheet so you should get an idea of how much FTX was on the affairs of solana.FTX is not solvent yet. It would take more than $60 sol or even $100 — but they're planning a reboot so it sol price appreciating only gives the new team plenty of room to recover fast.",
