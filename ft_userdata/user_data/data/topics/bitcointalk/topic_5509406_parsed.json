The way I see it, halving decreases the amount of bitcoin being sold by miners and increases the price at which they have to sell, which impacts the total price, but it doesn't happen immediately. New coins have to be mined first. No US president has ever done anything good for bitcoin and I doubt this one will, yet we always had a bull market.",

If Trump wins then it will be the complete opposite.Yes the presidents in the past had little to do with bitcoins performance, however we need less regulation and not more. If we get more regulation then less people will want to get involved with crypto. Look at how difficult it is to make a exchange account due to all these regulations, people will just skip crypto all together unless the rules are relaxed and that will only happen under a Trump administration.",

Hmmm, this is quite interesting because I have never really seen the movement of Bitcoin from this angle but now that you pointed it out, I think November, December and January will certainly be a promising month regardless of who gets the seat of the president. Bitcoin has continued to show it's strength and prove to the many doubters that it has truly come to stay and am just suprised why other countries don't look at it the way the El Salvadoran president see Bitcoin.",

Unfortunately, the sample size of all US presidents since the invention of bitcoin is too small (N = 3 or 4 if you count the second terms) to draw any meaningful conclusions. Nevertheless, with a high degree of certainty, I can predict that bitcoin will outlive the US... and its last president.",

This is why I am not even commenting for now with those election related threads that are connecting with Bitcoin prices. Because whoever wins there and whoever sits on the White House, Bitcoin doesn't care at all and it doesn't matter who wins it. The charts speak for itself, Bitcoin will get to the top no matter what happens. It's more concerning about the situation of the world like what the pandemic has came and the wars that has triggered than of the election but I know that these global economical issues and wars that are happening has something to do with the US election's.",

The issue is not that people are scared that if a bitcoin unfriendly president emerges, that it will be the end of bitcoin. No!People are just scared of the temporary price change that it will bring to the market. Whether we like it or not, the US election result will surely impact the market, so it is that short period of impact in the market that people are scared of.Mostly, majority of the speculators believe that if a pro bitcoin candidates emerges, it will facilitate 2025 bull run, but if otherwise, we might return to the bear market from here.",

There are other things to channel attentions to, rather than debating on the effect of the coming forth coming United State presidential election on Bitcoin. Truth is, Bitcoin will still survive no matter the outcome of the election.Yesterday, someone created a thread on my local board. And the thread was about crypto adoption(in general) in different regions of the world. The research was conducted by chain analysis, and surprisingly, my country retain its position as number 2 in terms of crypto adoption in the world. A country that crypto usable has been banned by the government, still compete with others. It clearly proves that the government and Bitcoin are two different things that might not need each other, even if the government decides to turn against it.Bitcoin adoption will continue to grow, no matter the result of the forth coming election, so we shouldn't be tied up with it.",
