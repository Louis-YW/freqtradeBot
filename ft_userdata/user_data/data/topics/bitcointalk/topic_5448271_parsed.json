  "content": "I am talking about how sony re releases their playstation console with the same specs but will smaller nm tech and consuming less power.Why cant Bitmain or others create S9 antminer which is based on 5nm and lets say consume 1/3 of energy compare to the original 16nm s9?Watching this interview buy saifedean ammos is very insightful on what the future of mining will be like. Decentralized mining by the avg joe using asic miners which dont take 1K-3KW power https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2Znc5zkIhkRight now the manufacturers are catering towards the big boys who can operate farms. To make BTC more decentralised, the old mining hardware should be released with smallertech node.10T\\hash @ 700W would be a start.Apollo and merch have 1-3T\\HASH mining hardware but the hardware is not upto the mark and after sales is not that good.Imagine having a S9i @ 13.5T/hash @ 5nm which only consumes 400W backed by a solar power system.EDIT: My prayers have been answered!https://heatbit.com/",

Personally, I have always been able to find solutions to my problems, with all the Gekkoscience products I have had.If it's a really desperate case, there is also the Kano server on discord, there is a Gekko section where you can find help for almost all models, it's very reactive.QuoteImagine having a S9i @ 13.5T/hash @ 5nm which only consumes 400W backed by a solar power system.Yeah we all agree, but that's not the goal of Bitmain IMO.",

Not outright threatening them or something, but binding these manufacturers in strict contracts that could include a clause that basically says \"we will buy all your miners, so don't sell it to anyone\" much like what apple is doing with spare iPhone parts and accessories. Bitmain if this was proven true and is found to be the case as to why manufacturers are not selling older models of miners, are effectively monopolizing a decentralized industry in order to take the profits for their own. No news as of yet of whether they'd start selling older mining rigs with smaller nodes so your best bet is to find a second-hand rig off of eBay or something.",

With free electricity, according to whattomine.com: S9 E 17Th/s generates $2.14 profit. S9 SE 16Th/s generates $2.02.S9j 14.5Th/s generates $1.84.S9k 13.5Th/s generates $1.72.I mean, if we keep in mind that someone pays 9 cents per kWh and with 5nm cheap we get that price down to 3 cents, the profit is still very low, isn't it? On aliexpress, S9 models worth briefly $200. If we keep in mind that in order to produce new S9 miners with new 5nm chip, then they have to build and test it, which we can include in expenses. But another problem here is that materials for old S9 and new antminer will cost almost the same while the difference in their price will be huge. They may make more pure profit from new antminer than from old S9.Quote from: ajaxtempest on April 10, 2023, 04:32:04 PMRight now the manufacturers are catering towards the big boys who can operate farms.

While some people may really want it to be as decentralized as possible, there are some people who want to use this situation for their own benefit, they'll always exist.",

When spending several million$ per layer it make zero sense to use older designs.Now, using the fewer of the current chips to make a <1kw miner - certainly doable but as others have pointed out mfgrs wound have to tack on a hefty 'limited market' $/THs penalty because the of making the housing, controller, etc would be almost the same as it is for the big miners.Frankly, Sidehack is covering that limited market quite well using BM's s17 chips. I have no doubt that once s19 chips become available in suitable quantities his R909 will be followed by a new version using them",

Who would have the power to prevent them from refreshing their older hardware? If I follow your analogy, Bitmain is Apple, while its distributors are Apple's official resellers. I doubt their resellers have a say as to what they should make or sell. Not to mention people have been reselling their ASIC miners on marketplaces for ages. CMIIW.",

Bottom line, it's not just a turnkey solution that can be repurposed over night, while the ASIC minter manufcatures don't have that kind of resources at hand to take an endeavor like this one.",
