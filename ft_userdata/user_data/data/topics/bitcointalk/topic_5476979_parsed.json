But if you want to know about derivation path which is not what you are asking on this thread, these are the standard derivation paths:BIP 32: m/0'/0 is the path to HD wallet.BIP 44: m/44'/0'/0' for legacy addresses (addresses that start from 1)BIP 49: m/49'/0'/0' for nested segwit addresses (addresses that start from 3)BIP 84: m/84'/0'/0' for native segwit addresses (addresses that start from bc1q)BIP 86: m/86'/0'/0' for taproot (addresses that start from bc1p)But what I most likely guess is that people that are using ImToken wallet are most likely using it for altcoins. For bitcoin, I will recommend you to use wallet like Electrum, Sparrow or Bluewallet.Assuming you are importing on a different wallet, then you can think of knowing about the derivation path of the addresses that you are using on your old wallet.",

You can actual have change paths from the advance option in the wallet. But since you didn’t Temper with it, then my guess is you actually created the wallet on a different blockchain like it wasn’t a multi coin chain. What I will say is import your seed into either trustwallet this time around when choosing the network go for multicoin and then import the seed if it doesn’t works then go for bitcoin only on trustwallet. You can use metamask also Quote from: Charles-Tim on December 08, 2023, 05:41:26 AMBut I am surprised that there is still a wallet that do not support native segwit.Yes surprisingly they only support two address format the Legacy address format and the nested segwit format",

Hv read several complains about trust wallet whereby people coins goes missing..Yes electrum is one of the best software wallets around and I would recommend it to you. The reason why I recommended trustwallet to import your seed from imtoken was because it is also a multi coin wallet like it so after you are able to recover your wallet and gotten your coins I will advice you create another wallet on electrum and then transfer (not importing your current seed phrase) all your bitcoin to that wallet. It is worth mentioning that electrum is bitcoin only wallet, so for Altcoins I will recommend unstoppable wallet. Follow this guide on how to safely download and verify electrum wallet",
