But with BTC hitting the spotlight again due to a new ATH, things could change. Is there some sort of statistics/data/analytics regarding gender adoption of BTC? I'm curious to know.Quote42% of men ages 18 to 29 say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 17% of women in the same age range.36% of men ages 30 to 49 have done this, compared with 15% of women in this age group.https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/24/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/Note that this is just from the US. But it seems to be the most recent one and itâ€™s always important to check the dates of these statistics to accurately reflect the current situation. I mean for sure there are people who use crypto that werenâ€™t part of this survey but I think itâ€™s safe to assume that men do indeed use crypto a lot more than women.QuoteBy the way, I'd like to know what do women find attractive in Bitcoin (compared to men)?Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any difference. Crypto is crypto. What men sees is what women sees and thatâ€™s the chance to earn and invest in our future. But I think that back then a lot of women were avoiding crypto because they lack trust and they are more likely to want to avoid any kind of risks compared to men. But now times have changed and crypto is no longer the mysterious little thing no one is sure about. Itâ€™s almost becoming a mainstream phenomenon and is well known by almost everyone. Both genders and of all ages.",

      "body": "I've encountered a few of those statistics/data/analytics in the past. I'm not interested in looking for them, though. For one, I highly doubt their accuracy. Second, and more importantly, this is one of those things in which gender doesn't, or shouldn't, really matter. I'm speaking from a free country, though. From here, access to Bitcoin doesn't discriminate gender. It's certainly a different story, however, if you're under Taliban rule, for example, or living in a strictly Islamic country like Iran or Saudi where gender biases are prevalent. It's probably safe to assume that, at this point in time, both women and men are attracted to Bitcoin because of its price. Both among men and women, there are of course some who are truly interested in the technology.

In others, however, it's the other way around. Although, yeah, studies are generally saying women are more risk-averse than men when it comes to financial decisions.",

Take Maya Parbhoe, for example. Sheâ€™s running for president with a platform packed with pro-Bitcoin policies.  Meet Maya Parbhoe: The Pro-Bitcoin Presidential Candidate Who Wants to Save Suriname Maya Parbhoe Vows to Make Bitcoin Legal TenderIf she manages to become president and make Bitcoin a legal tender in her country, thatâ€™s a huge win, not just for Bitcoin but for inspiring more women to trust, use, and invest in it. Sure, women may still be a smaller group in the crypto space, but their numbers can grow over time. That said, it's still undeniable that men will probably always have the bigger share in this space, but that doesnâ€™t mean women canâ€™t make a major impact.",

In the past few weeks I have been contacted by a few female friends and they started asking about bitcoin and strangely they didn't like bitcoin at first but after seeing bitcoin hit its all time high they started to get interested in discussing it. I didn't try to explain anything because I think they need to understand investment based on observation so that any risks that occur don't make them panic and have problems.What I am saying is that there is an increase in women involvement in the industry and there are even more women involved in trading now in my area especially.",

Can you identify those moments in which it is not typical for a woman to learn something new, invest, or even run her own business? What can a man see and understand that a woman cannot?

Thanks.  women are not good at taking risk and I guess because of that, the ratio of women in the crypto space is still relatively small compared to the male counterpart. usage of bitcoin is a totally different thing and even though there might be a handful of them that might have made use of bitcoin at some point in time, you can't really see them being actively involved in bitcoin related conversation and their number on the forum clearly shows it more evidently.even without doing any serious research, its normal to observe that any technical niche you will normally think of always lack women maybe because they are not wired that way. the fact that bitcoin is an all-inclusive currency doesn't mean that users across the gender cycle views it potential the same way. women are very calculated of how much they will want to be exposed to risk most especially as it relates to the issue that's bothering on finance.",
