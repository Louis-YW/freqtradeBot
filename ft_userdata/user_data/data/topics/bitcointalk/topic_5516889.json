Do you think such like mixers, exchanges , and others related to bitcoin will also benefit in terms of regulation?Pressure from MAGA and Trump propaganda many months before the Election forced SEC to change and approve Bitcoin Spot ETFs, then Ethereum Spot ETFs in the USA.In last months of his Presidential Election Campaign, Trump shown his stronger support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market and there are good signals that he will keep up his sayings and promising policies for this industry and market. In addition to his win in Presidential Election, there is another win, Republic Party won the Senate, and there is another possible win is on the way The House. It will very possibly win in majority by Republic Party too.This Election is like 3 wins in one election for Republic Party and it means they will have many advantages for the next 4 years with Trump administration or at least next 2 years.",

Based on his statements at the last bitcoin conference, we're definitely going to see everything bitcoin related benefit, whether it's conservative or not. But if it goes to the mixers, i can't say much, it's a tool that has a lot of potential for illegal activity, so i don't see it coming back even if Trump wins the election.",

If yes, that will be a big surprise to us because Bitcoin finally can start increase and break every high price.But if not and still the same as before where the price will be ups and down, then we need to have more patience and not panic because we will see many correction later. It is a good moment to see Bitcoin make a new ATH after the last one so the investors can be more confident to hodl and wait for the next new ATH.",

Do you think such like mixers, exchanges , and others related to bitcoin will also benefit in terms of regulation?Every government will want to control the affairs of citizens. They will always want to know about the financial transactions that happen within their jurisdictions and outside the US. I don't see Donald Trump promoting privacy tools and decentralized exchanges. Centralized crypto firms might benefit from him because his policies might favor them. The token he once promoted; World Liberty Financial has increased massively. He later clarified that he is not affiliated with the project but Trump and his children are all beneficiaries. As a businessman he might also want to make money from the crypto industry, thereby making favorable laws.  QuoteThe live World Liberty Financial (wlfi.club) price today is $2.77e-12 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $30,968.56 USD. We update our WLFI to USD price in real-time. World Liberty Financial (wlfi.club) is up 41.42% in the last 24 hours.   https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/world-liberty-financial/",

Governments want taxation, money and Trump has his own casinos to run in the Vegas strip. Becomes the president means only relaxation for those casinos and more money for his family.Very little advantage for the bitcoin users, but yet it is better than nothing.I dont mean to say that a opposing candidate would have been better, but whoever get elected, the bitcoin users must stick together instead of choosing sides, because nobody will actually help us.",

And that Trump will focus not so much on Bitcoin as on his family token project and trying to (ab)use his power to get his family even richer by getting US into tokenisation. That being said, I don't think he will succeed with that. I also don't think he will go against Bitcoin either. For now, the excitement over Trump's victory is obvious in the crypto market, with Bitcoin up by 7% over 24 hours. Overall, I just don't think Bitcoin will be high on Trump's current agenda, so I don't think we'll see much change for Bitcoin under Trump. Also, let's not forget that his presidency will start in late January 2025.",
