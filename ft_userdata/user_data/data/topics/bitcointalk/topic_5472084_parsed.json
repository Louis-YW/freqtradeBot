If someone playing shitcoin then the first thing they need to secure is the contract is safe and solid. Use tools to check first cause if ever theres a pump and many bots rushes to buy it if you cant sell it then you arent gaining at all. Ive seen a lot of projects like this with a huge pump but cant sell so its worthless at all.",

Buy the first meme coin you find out of 1000's that are created every day (and 999 goes to zero next day). You'll lose your wallet anyway. At least you'll save time on \"research\".",

And, if you are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme then I doubt there's anything in existence. Why do you think that you can achieve that in cryptocurrencies? It's all just fake news.Manipulating the market has happened before, someone will fake buy a token and then make it in the trend but I tell you it won't last long because only those who are manipulating it will end up rich and not you. They want you to invest in it to take your money and not give you anything in return. Don't be fooled by those types of tokens because it already happened before during the ICO days. Look for a legitimate, reputable, and trusted project instead of this. You will just waste your time, effort, and money by being fooled by them. Try to think again, who will give you such a huge amount in such a short time? It cannot happen or this world's financial industry will be doomed.",

Crypto market is very risky and we need to understand some of the precautions we need to take that will prevent us from getting scammed or investing in a project that would end up to become a rug pull. There are projects that had crashed and made investors to lose there hard earned money because they were not able to see the risks attached to altcoins investments.",

I already heard some meme coins who have their own exchange and their token can function something like a BNB inside it. This must be another example of utility. All meme coins might still be the same, in a way that they are tagged like this (a meme coin).So, even if some has a utility, many people might still not be convinced on them.
