With the way I dey see bitcoin move lately, I think the season na good one. Bitcoin price early this year na very big shock to all Crypto investors, when the pricw been fall dip to $15k, but before the year don dey end like this, we don nearly reach $40k dollars. so na better achivement because person wey been dey received $40 for campegn, at the rate of $15k per Bitcoin and $40 at $38k per bitcoin now. You go see say the price convention that time and now no be thesame.",

Living long on the face of the earth is not something that any of us have control over since we can’t account for the amount of breathe with take on this life. That alone is enough to make us humble and grateful for life. The month of December is the close of every year where January is the beginning of every year. It is a month of reflection for me where I sit to think about and recount for all the deeds and misdeeds I have done, that is, all the good, bad and the ugly side of my life are caused as a result of one incident or the other.It is a thing of joy and happiness to remain life and healthy and to be able to carry out your daily activities here. There are 365 days in a week, in every 24 hours, there are people who lose their lives trying to fend for themselves and family, just like we do, and they never wronged anyone for death to visit them, which means, we don’t really have the power to dictate our stay here , therefore, we can only be grateful.I have already started my diary for the year and it is going to contain some hard and soft decisions but the buttomline is; I am going to leave an open-minded year through thereby opening my minds into accepting failure but failing forward and ahead.",
