Are you someone who bought Bitcoin in 2009 or 2010 and tell me your story about the buy?Nobody bought bitcoins in 2009 afaik. Bitcoin was not sold by that time It was basically mined, and traded for pizza.The earlier price I saw in coinmarketcap.com  is about 6usd in 2011.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/Here it says that the price started climbing in 2010 from 0.0008 $.QuoteIn July 2010, Bitcoin began trading at US$0.0008, climbing to US$0.08 by month’s end. The cryptocurrency then performed relatively flatly, slowly rising into the US$10 range until it spiked to US$250 in April 2013.https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/blockchain-investing/bitcoin-price-history/If you or anyone bought it by that time, that persons would have sold most of it already by now. And yes, many people become rich with bitcoin and there are plenty of stories here in the forum",

It depends on whether he sold his coins and when he did so.

Are you someone who bought Bitcoin in 2009 or 2010 and tell me your story about the buy?There was no price attached to bitcoin back in the early days when it was first launched, it’s something that’s traceable or can be exchanged for service or goods that have value attached to it. So when it comes to any one who was opportune to have bitcoin from the 2009 either through mining it or as a reward for any form of service, if the person is still holding it till now and did not sell off when bitcoin first had value attached to it, then probably the person will be a very wealthy investor and can even be consider a whale right now because their holdings will be worth fortune.",

But to clear it's a simple answer though because no one not even Satoshi nakamoto himself could have predicted that Bitcoin will fly so high in terms of the price when its actually first creation but thats the beauty of uncertainty.",

Obviously very rich, especially when Bitcoin made an ATH in 2021 with its price exceeding $65K. And now you can see for yourself how the price is no longer even half of the ATH price that happened on Bitcoin, but the current price is also not a very bad thing because everyone can take advantage of this condition to have more Bitcoin before the next ATH occurs again on Bitcoin. You can see all the data here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?end=20191130QuoteBitcoin now stands at 26,893 and was it lower in 2009? Actually, a question like this is not quite logical, but I can understand it because you are still a newbie. I very rarely find a higher price on something that is just born and that also happened with Bitcoin where Bitcoin at that time was still very cheap because it didn't have as many fans as it does now. So now you need to look at and read every history of Bitcoin so that you can ask better questions in the future, although questions like this are not wrong for you to ask here.",

The exchange rate history is available at two archived pages: first, second. Their last known exchange rate is $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC, using the daily volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin exchange, BitcoinMarket.com (PayPal USD trades). The owner, dwdollar, actually started operating it on 2010-03-17, however trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not available.After 2010-07-18 the exchange rate is from the CoinDesk BPI v1 API (https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json?start=2010-07-18&end=2022-05-17).After 2022-05-18 the exchange rate is from the CoinDesk BPI v3 API (https://www.coindesk.com/pf/api/v3/content/fetch/chart-api?query=...) because v1 has gaps in the data starting on that date.",

A lot of people got Bitcoin in the early years and are not billionaires. They just sold at peaks or had pressing needs for money, and when Bitcoin was trading at pennies, that getting to $1 seemed like an unattainable milestone, whereupon a lot of people sold when they got to that figure, and when it got to $10, and to $100.Those who took a longer view and were able to hold a good amount for a couple of cycles today are multi-millionaires but those are a few.",
