Exactly, and they could even turn out to be very shady like Safepal hardware wallet that is closed source but they still used bunch of open source code and they breached original license they used.Both of this wallets (safepal and trust wallet) are supported by binance exchange, so you can understand why I don't trust both of them with their lame excuses. I am sure they didn't built anything from scratch, they cloned and forked other code, made few changes and than made it closed source so they could hide all the bugs in code from public.",

      "body": "That's a fallacy.Closed-source software is nowhere close to better than reputable open-source software in terms of security. Being open-source doesn't mean more vulnerable than closed-source. Most attacks, from dynamic which work as a black-box (push inputs, observe outputs) to static which use pattern matches against binaries require no source code. Even if source code is necessary for an attacker, they can use disassemblers to reverse engineer part of the source code they want.All in all, even if the entire source code is required, and the attacker can't reverse engineer the entire thing, revealing the source code, if reputable, can attract more defenders than attackers. If the software is not open-source, there can't be defenders. Only the centralized entity of developers that are responsible for it. So, if somebody ever tells you this:Quote from: Tamedbeast on September 26, 2022, 05:26:06 PMwe don't want you to see how we run the codes, you can target us or somethingYou should respond them that if they rely on closed-sourceness for their security, they are benighted.

      "body": "A closed-source wallet does more harm than good on many levels. Being a free and open source wallet invites those who can comprehend the code and the ones who are interested in the wallet itself, to collectively monitor how the codebase behaves. It gives them more eyes, rather than a fixated number of people that work on the closed source wallet, whose solely controlled by a centralized entity. It gives complete freedom to the users, in which it does not make sense if the underlying system(Bitcoin) itself is free and open-sourced.And I bet a closed source wallet adds an unnecessary burden of a closed system where it is also designed for surveillance/tracking in mind. How can we be sure that the wallet key generation process is secure? What we do within the application isn't being tracked identifiably? or simply we just don't want the generated address being \"processed\" as what Trust Wallet does[1].If we take an example of the recent aftermath of closed source Slope Wallet hacks, it is not so conceivable. It seems closed source wallets add their own unnecessary complexities and even the true root causes of the vulnerability can't be conclusively identified, after conducting an audit with 2 security firms.[1] https://trustwallet.com/privacy-policy",

It's possible, but it's guesswork. That could be the reason why the wallets are closed-source or because there is something there they don't want you to know about. Close-source is saying trust me it's good. I promise. Open-source is saying take a look and make up your own mind. Don't trust me just because I am telling you it's good. Quote from: Tamedbeast on September 26, 2022, 05:26:06 PMIf you can't see how things are running (coding) wouldn't that make it harder to attack such code or network? Yes, but the coin has two sides. You mentioned one. The other is if someone is a security expert who understands coding, they could tell the developers what to improve based on what they see in the codebase. If there is nothing to see, no one can make corrections. And attacks could still happen with or without a public codebase.     Quote from: Tamedbeast on September 26, 2022, 05:26:06 PMClosed source says > we don't want you to see how we run the codes, you can target us or something Again, it's guesswork. It can also say we don't want you to see our code because we are targeting you.

Everyone sees \"how things are run\" and they are still secure. Open-source does not mean secure by default. Although after years of testing, improving, and probably being thoroughly put under the microscope by those with bad motives, it's pretty safe to say that the brands you mentioned are all secure. But we have also seen some open-source Ethereum smart contracts being breached and hacked for reasons that could be bad code, exit scams, lack of knowledge how to secure them properly, etc. It's very important who looks at the code and tags it as verified. If I am not wrong, some hacks occurred even though the projects were called audited and secure.",

No one knows what happens with closed-source wallets except what they tell us.I found a GitHub research report from December 2020. It is not directly related to Bitcoin but open-source projects in general. The report claims that the average detection of vulnerabilities is not that good and that over 4 years can pass (on average) before certain code vulnerabilities are detected. But once they are, they are fixed in a month or so. Another interesting find is that over 80% of the bugs aren't malicious in nature, they are mostly mistakes made by the developers.QuoteOn average, vulnerabilities can go undetected for over four years in open source projects before disclosure. A fix is then usually available in just over a month, which GitHub says \"indicates clear opportunities to improve vulnerability detection.\"However, the majority of bugs in open source software are not malicious. Instead, 83% of the CVE alerts issued by GitHub have been caused by mistakes and human error -- although threat actors can still take advantage of them for malicious purposes. In total, 17% of vulnerabilities are considered malicious -- such as backdoor variants -- but these triggered only 0.2% of alerts, as they are most often found in abandoned or rarely-used packages.",
