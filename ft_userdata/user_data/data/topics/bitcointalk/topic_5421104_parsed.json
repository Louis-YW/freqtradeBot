  "content": "Although I've taken a quick look, this doesn't seem to be discussed, and I think it should.It looks like Binance has decided to consolidate their wallets/transactions last night. It's something they do now and then, but the current timing could not be worse.And from CZ I do expect to be a deliberate move (usually in his favor, not ours), but I don't understand the reasons. Spamming mempool now means more panic to the average Joe in these days he's overly panicked. Does he want to make people change their minds about withdrawing from exchanges? Or does he try to cover some exchanges that can now claim withdrawing issues? I don't know.For better info on the context, it worth looking on this tweet and the subsequent ones and also the images:https://nitter.it/OwenKemeys/status/1592223269310328833",

In the end it costs them more or less the same, but it lets him screw over more people that way.Either way, it's Tuesday AM where I am and it will still probably clear by the weekend so at worst it's a few days.-Dave",

Because yesterday, mempool is very clear and we can move bitcoin with 3 satoshis to 5 satoshishttps://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weightBinance (if it is real) did choose a good time to create panic on newbies. They will feel more panic when their transactions need too long time to get a first confirmation. Taking this congestion, I remind people to use an opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF) for their transaction. So if their transactions stucked, they can bump the fee.Quote from: Wind_FURY on November 15, 2022, 12:39:21 PMIt's either prevention for mass withdrawals, or the community became more paranoid after the second biggest exchange has scammed the community.

Their fees are fixed and expensive because they over charge users.Binance did not reduce or increase their withdrawal fee on Bitcoin. https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee",

We cannot blame them because they are just being realistic and the result will be a disaster if Binance will become like that's why let's not assume the worse rather we just hope all goods for them.",

Perhaps that is what they were planning to do in the future, but are now in the midst of their own liquidity issues and are scrambling to consolidate everything they can to keep processing withdrawals.Meanwhile, they bump their withdrawal fee to absolutely ridiculous levels - 100,000 sats! - to encourage people either not to withdraw at all, or to \"withdraw\" on one of their centralized scam IOU chains which are not back by real bitcoin at all. I've spoken many times in the past about how Binance's withdrawal fees are literal robbery, and now they've doubled them!Honestly, if you still have coins on Binance thinking they are \"too big to fail\" or some other such nonsense, not only are you wrong and risking everything, but you are also being massively ripped off by these charlatans.",
