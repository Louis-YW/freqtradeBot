      "body": "Is this a paid advertisement, or are you the representative of the Ghost privacy projects? because this post looks like shilling to me. You could have dropped detailed information regarding the project because not everyone might have the time to go through an entire blog or even trust a link posted by a newbie enough to open it. If you are not part of the project, I will really advise you to stay off such projects. Read a few lines of their content; they look interesting since they are all about privacy protection, hiding the user's identity, etc. The project looks pretty old, and they have come a long way. But looking at their few listed exchanges, I will advise you to stay off buying such coins or tokens because you never know what will happen next in the coming days: no active trade, low volume, orders very weak, etc.",

The price for the $GHOST token is also very volatile, you can see it on the chart at CMC. The exchange that listed $GHOST is also not a top exchange like TradeOgre and StakeCube. If it continues like this, it will be very difficult to increase its market capitalization.",

I don't blame you for doing that since you're a holder. It sucks when your money is stuck and this is probably your way of getting out at break even. You could get lucky since there are times when crypto goes crazy and some unknown coin or token unexpectedly pumps.",

If there is, then the OP should continue his shilling of it in their ANN thread because he/she didn't offer something new here. Just the normal \"I'm a bag holder\" promotion and everyone should get on board because it's a promising project.Sorry to burst the bubble, usually this kind of shilling might back fire hard on the project itself. No need to hype if the project is real or if it has potential to be big in the future, just saying.",

Such as crack downs on them, regulations and it being exposed. Also as an investment they see far more bigger gains elsewhere with far less risk. Monero is the way to go, even John Mcafee was a Monero fan, only reason I sat that is because of what you put in your original post. True privacy that is tried and tested is Monero.",

They are focused to use and utilize project who are verifiably secure and private, and the community itself are thriving for privacy-enabled/enhancing technologies, instead sole focusing on user acquisition by luring users to come to make money.",

Unfortunately he passed away.Further I still think it is a great coin with anon and public transactions. I can only see the community, the fundamentals and how the blockchain works which I think are all very good.But I would love if someone with coding knowledge could check the tech side. This is the github: https://github.com/ghost-coinThere is a new folder created for the polygon bridge and bitcore message (what is this?)Also the new wallet, it is a progressive web app (PWA), what do you think about it?https://ghostbymcafee.medium.com/sheltr-the-ultimate-self-custody-wallet-for-ghost-c83f2adb60e2Thanks for all the feedback.",

And now Ghost is still trying to ride with the John Mcafee name (or his ghost if you will), most likely because Ghost has nothing else to offer. Only dead man's promise of a pump that never happened.
