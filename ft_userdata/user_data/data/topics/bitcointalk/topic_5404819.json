  "content": "So thanks to stablecoins btc not needed to correlate with real economy the stock markets and even real estate markets can be down since central banks rate hikes but btc dont have to follow to stock market gold or oil or other real life prices.Even the whole economy can be down and everything bearish but whales got a lot stablecoins so they can just push up price of btc to parabolic even if world is short of liquitity and money the stablecoins and btc are whole different area.Its not strange if we see whole world economic down even housing market fall but btc is going up like rocket.The btc and stablecoins are different and they dont have to follow to real time economy and a lot printed money pf real fiat currency went in stable coins so we will might get situation when everybidody expecting crypto to go down but its going just more up thanks to buyers who got a lot stable coins also many traders are in stablecoins now waiting for crypto market going more down to step in.also big whales waiting and even the real economy is really down crypto can still go ATH becouse stable coins not correlated with real fiat so much....if fed hikes rates will tje stable coins will be burned equal ammount ? I dont think so in other words by holding the crypto and stablecoins you get advancheses of other players the game called: Our life and economy and wealth and capital.Be careful to think that matkets will go down and stay down off course stock market and gold can fall they are correlated witj real fiat currency.But crypto have stable coins so even when all other legacy markets down crypto can do rally like one light in the dark room and then everybody will start buying it again when btc start moving up to 30k-40k+ price range so they will be buying the top of the crypto with highest price in bad economic times making all them even more poor they are and whales can drop prices down...remember stable coins are oil for crypto engine and by the time stable coins reserves been going bigger and bigger so whales got infinity power to use stable coins as bullets to shoot prices up.",

USDT has also been dragged in the past with Bitfinex market manipulation.There is nothing special about stablecoins, just a preserve of value which you can get serve what you don't expect like depeg from dollar value because they are not fully backed, USDC and BUSD haven't had any issue but still, there is nothing special about them than just a Fiat value.",

      "body": "Bitcoins was never needed to be correlated with the real economy, at the end of the day we all know that 'During the wake of the pandemic when the market declined and the price fell down the price of Bitcoins was definitely not on the bottom and declining' there were people who were even able to make some profits along the way and ended up using bitcoins as a secure investment source. Therefore we cannot corelate the market condition with Bitcoins at all and we all know what happened with USDT, it was definately sad how it came down so fast, stable coin are definately an asset for trading. I do think the economy you talk about with Bitcoins is very different from what you see in the world of cryptocurrencies. If you love stable coins so much you might as well keep usual coins like usd or GBP.",

Idk, if you are just going to live in the crypto space then no one would care about the btc to USD conversion at all since in that rim 1 btc = 1btc formula and everything costs from few Satoshi to million or something. I mean the day it gets labelled in terms of satoshi would be the day you will find it worth nothing converting into fiat currency.",

That's not how you permanently increase the price, you do it through scarcity and continuous buying - you can't make a crypto scarce so that it reaches $40K from $10K, and then expect it to go back to $10K after falling to $20K.",

From his post, his perspective is of a no-coiner's viewpoint that Bitcoin should be the same as regular fiat-currencies. Quote\"thanks to stablecoins btc not needed to correlate with real economy\"Actually wrong, OP. Bitcoin is needed not to correlate with the \"real economy\". It's actually needed to be a fall-back/back-up in case the cabal breaks the financial system.",

Most stablecoin deaths happened as a result of real economy crashes.Yes, deaths, not crashes.Not only are they not very different from each other (stablecoin and fiat), I would say stablecoins are far less inferior in terms of trust (which is the only thing providing value to the currencies of either fiat or stablecoin).Much as I distrust states' benevolence, I have more faith in the promise of the US government or EU than in Circle or Tether.Quote from: mk4 on July 01, 2022, 05:27:06 PMQuote from: 325btc on July 01, 2022, 05:10:32 PMIt is fiat and its not more likely been created by wall street and whales to have infinity all most infinity ammount of fiat kind of currency.Guess what dude, USDC is ran by Circle(a company), and USDT is ran by Tether/Bitfinex(a company).
