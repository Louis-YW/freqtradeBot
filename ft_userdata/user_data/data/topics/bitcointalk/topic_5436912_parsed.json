      "body": "I'm getting 404s for a lot, possibly all things coming from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ in general at the moment.Didn't check everything I have used recently but thigs I know worked came back 404.Could be a local caching server / front end issue for them or they broke something big.Edit: see below, they are not supposed to be there. BUT my comment is still valid. This IS working from some places (home) but not others (office). https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/1.16.0/stable/stretch/DockerfileHowever, I didn't notice it's not a 404 but 400 error that I am getting from the work PC. So 2 different issues that with a quick glance look the same.-Dave",

Wonder how to do the same (get the gpg keys) in the master branch.The keys in the 24.x branch should also work for the master branch because the binaries made from it are signed with the same set of keys as v24.So if any of the checksums fail to verify with a particular developer's key, then that means you can summarily distrust the changes made by that developer.",

You need to verify a signed message of a Bitcoin Core developer you trust, saying that this specific list is the right one.
