Bitcoin exchange Binance has begun laying off staff. Presumably, the percentage of laid-off staff will be 20%, reported reporter Colin Wu, citing his own sources.- The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has lost a quarter of its market share in the past three months as a U.S. regulator prosecutes it for allegedly violating U.S. federal laws. In February, New York regulators shut down Binance-branded Stablecoin issuance.- The SEC has sued Binance and Changpeng Zhao. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued bitcoin exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao.The U.S. regulator brought 13 charges, including unregistered offers and sales of BNB and BUSD tokens, Simple Earn and BNB Vault products and stacking.The suit also alleges that Binance failed to register its Binance.com platform as an exchange, broker-dealer or clearing agency, as did the U.S. unit. Zhao was sued as a \"controlling person.\"These and many other negative news stories, about the world's largest exchange, have been in the air for months. Question:- In your opinion, is this a consequence of increased pressure on China by the U.S.? - What will the problems of Binance lead to for crypto market and crypto users?",

Question:- In your opinion, is this a consequence of increased pressure on China by the U.S.? I don't know if there is something to do with it. US has been known to be too strict with their ruling regards to these exchanges and isn't that Binance already expressed their disinterest to operate with their US market?Quote from: DrBeer on June 06, 2023, 08:56:17 AM- What will the problems of Binance lead to for crypto market and crypto users?I guess more with the market manipulation. Because with such news we have already seen how quick the market has reacted. Other than that, it's more with their exchange and trust issues whether their users will be quick to withdraw their funds just as seeing the news that CZ/binance has been sued.",

If they think they can do and go scot-free as they do with their global branch, then they are jokers.Quote from: DrBeer on June 06, 2023, 08:56:17 AM- In your opinion, is this a consequence of increased pressure on China by the U.S.?There can't be any consequence in my opinion. The question is whether they are guilty or not. China will not come out and support illegality on another country's soil. Besides, China seems to pretend they are not in support of cryptocurrency, so they are expected to be mute in this regard.Quote from: DrBeer on June 06, 2023, 08:56:17 AM- What will the problems of Binance lead to for crypto market and crypto users?First, cryptocurrencies must fall due to this ugly news, yet Binance.US is just a branch, a branch smaller than the global brand. This makes me believe that the effect will quickly subside over time, and I don't see it crashing Bitcoin below $20,000, at least, before the court's verdict as we don't know yet how severe the penalty could be.",

It's not good for crypto to be monopolized by one exchange or one country. The accusations are very serious. If these accusations are true, the market will be negatively affected and it may take a long time for the market to recover. But if the news and the lawsuit are intended to manipulate the market, it will undermine the trust that crypto is trying to build. This will always cause a delay. I hope we see crypto in a better situation as a result of this news and the lawsuit.",

The crypto market survived FTX, I'm sure that it will survive any turbulence caused by the lawsuits against CZ and/or Binance. The BTC price recovered pretty fast after the FTX drama(around three months), I'm sure that Bitcoin is still capable of getting thru a bullish phase by the end of 2023(even though I expect the real bull run to hit somewhere around the second half of 2024).",

The matter between SEC and CZ and binance, I think it will take time for things to clear up, and over time I will also lean towards the possibility that things will calm down, the problem is we are looking at how The SEC's behavior in recent years towards this crypto space is harsh, the legal corridor is not really clear between the parties causing problems to arise, and users are easily moved by news and reactions about the crypto space. The price was clearly shown after the statements were made. But to be honest with me this is just one of many different events in the space, and it doesn't stop the evolution of crypto over time.",

Binance exchange have enough fund to pay for any losses, so why don't you trust binance now? Lol, it's funny. What will happen will still happen and it will eventually pass too, there is no reason to be in worries because of this news, what I will advise someone like CZ is to go hidden and build a decentralized exchange, we need people like him in crypto space, enough of this centralized exchange problems, SEC target Binance exchange because of FTX collapse, it's my own believe because Kevin came out in the open, promising CZ that Binance exchange will pay for all he did with FTX, I believe this war is still ongoing. There is no cause for panic, in every bear market, things always feel like we are in a bigger mess that we aren't going to come out of, but in time, things gets better, I believe that same thing will unfold soon.",

Even though Chang Peng Zhao was born in China, things like that cannot be related to the issue of US pressure on China, because it has nothing to do with the problems being faced by Changpeng Zhao at the moment. Besides, Changpeng Zhao is currently not living in China, but is currently living in Singapore. So basically changpeng zhao has a problem about this binance, it's all because of the problem of the accusations leveled against changpeng zhao, about accusations of violating securities laws.Quote- What will the problems of Binance lead to for crypto market and crypto users?If the problem facing Binance doesn't clear up in the near future, it will definitely affect users who trade crypto on Binance. Because it is certain that it will more or less cause worry among Binance users over the incident that is happening to Changpang Zhao as the founder of Binance. For the crypto market, it will definitely have a little effect, but I don't think it will have a big impact for now, because the current state of the crypto market still feels normal as usual. But if the Binance case continues, maybe there will be changes in the crypto market. Because there will probably be a lot of users on binance, who will withdraw their crypto assets for safekeeping, and to guard against when the worst happens.",

      "body": "As a result, we can see that the price is falling and will likely continue until Binance and the SEC agree with each other. The problem here is that the SEC's actions always attract quite a lot of attention, considering that there will be a lot of speculation about ATH, especially when it comes to dropping the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos on the market. Since the existence of the SEC, almost all exchanges have experienced uproar and still for the same reasons, namely related to registration. So I wouldn't be surprised if an exchange the size of Binance is an ideal top target. Regardless of the impact on the current price, I think the solution is securing assets to each other's wallets to be the right choice, until this case really subsides or is resolved.If you're keeping up with the latest developments besides Binance, the SEC has also sent a letter to Coinbase:source PDF https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf",

Bitcoin exchange Binance has begun laying off staff. Presumably, the percentage of laid-off staff will be 20%, reported reporter Colin Wu, citing his own sources.The effect of COVID-19 and the impact of Russian invasion of Ukraine had so much negative impact on most businesses. Most businesses had to downsize to cut costs. Apart from some leading pharmaceutical companies that made so much gain from the sales and distribution of vaccines and some Oil and Gas firms that benefited from the high price of crude and gas, many firms underperformed. Also, the introduction of artificial intelligence is changing the workspace. Some companies are laying off staff because these AI tools can replace humans. Laying off of workers is not a cardinal sign that Binance was facing business problems.Quote- In your opinion, is this a consequence of increased pressure on China by the U.S.? From the surface view of Binance, it looks more American than Chinese. It indeed has a high number of Chinese staff but most of the top executives are American and European. And it pays its tax in the US, which means it contributes financially to the economy of the US. Except the US is seeing what I am not and feels that Binance is having secret ties with China. It is also possible that the US government wants to promote more American exchanges to take some market shares from Binance.Quote- What will the problems of Binance lead to for crypto market and crypto users?We are already experiencing the impact of this court case. The result is always FUD which will affect the price of most cryptocurrencies. The sector will become volatile and this will discourage people from investing.",
