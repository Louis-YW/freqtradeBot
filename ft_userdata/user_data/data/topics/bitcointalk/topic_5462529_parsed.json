From what I saw, usually low quality websites which publish lot of fakes or conspiracy theories is getting blocked. IMO, that's not right way to fight against fake news, especially when mainstream media isn't much better in terms of quality and reliability.I doubt that any Western country is going to turn on full China mode anytime soon, but trends doesn't looks good.",

I don't know. But many conspiracy websites are not censored and it's really big shit. Normally, conspiracy and Nazi sites should be censored but it's still up in EU while many normal sites are censored in EU. I'm always copying link into 12ft.io and it works to circumvent censorship. Censoring unproven conspiracy sites would be fine but normal sites should not be censored. We need some sort of verification certificate for any site. Should be voted publicly, which sites are censored and which not - democratic vote - do it like Switzerland and we will have democratic decision, which sites will be censored. Recently, Elon Must censored Twitter as well. First, he only censored small parts, where we could still get around it and read Twitter but recently, Elon Musk went full blown censorship and it's almost impossible to read Twitter right now. Elon Musk is full of shit - don't trust him. He's liar. Well, no loss, Elon's Twitter is just a conspiracytard sinkhole.  We can all hope, Elon Musk will get a big backlash.",

Anyone else experiencing the effects of Canada going full China on internet censorship?This is really and happening in many countries.  Few years ago Twitter was banned in Nigeria for more than a year before it was restored. Same in Nigeria, the media is banned fom reporting the activities of terrorist who have killed people in thousands for the past few years. Those who go against this directives are made to pay huge fines. If you are outside USA, you will think everyone there is rich and life there is so perfect because the government censors the Internet cum the media. It took social media for us to know that there are poor and homeless people in US and the number is alarming! So this issue of censorship is deeper than we can imagine and come in various forms across different jurisdictions.",

The media houses are the culprits of this, most times during media interview like television or radio shows, guest are restricted from the things they say about government. So you see some media stationed being levied or fined for the interview they granted to a guest or the public. The frustration of the media by the government is alarming because government don't want the negative narratives to be in the public.",

The main reason might be because of a controversial bill called C-11 that aims to regulate online streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ and Spotify, and require them to contribute to the creation and promotion of Canadian content. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/c11-online-streaming-1.6824314The bill doesn't directly censor or block any news websites, but it gives new powers to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada’s broadcast regulator, to impose financial penalties for violations of the act.",

It may not seem like a big deal at first because the government will censor stuff that needs to be censored but as time goes on they begin to expand. They start censoring stuff to fuel their agenda. When a government starts censoring, it means there's is something they either don't want their citizens to know or something they don't want people outside to know. Because of things like this, people outside can never know exactly how things on the ground are. A good example is North Korea. Even in many African countries, all people outside the country truly know is what the government lets them. There was a time when a country banned X (fka Twitter). This is a characteristic of a country that would happily censor the internet if they don't already do it.A government censoring the internet should be a thing to be worried about. It's scary because there is this powerful institution trying to hide the news from going out or from coming into the country.",

That may explain some of the censorship, honestly. If history has shown us anything about authoritarian leaders is that they feel cornered and without option but to censor media which is unfavorable to them. I dont really see the point on rewarding a military member who participated in the massive killing of people. If anything, only helps Russia to justify the far right leaning of the allies of Ukraine and Ukraine herself. Pretty wacky stuff seems to be going in Canada.",
