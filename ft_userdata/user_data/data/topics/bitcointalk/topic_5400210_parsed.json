Not a lot right, also the amount is not something that is too much around 7$ in LTC therefore people might participate but again when they are participating the probability would not really be on your side, I personally stay away from the lottery even if it's fair and as you say innovative and in general affordable because I do not trust on my luck at all. Other than that I do think if you are advertising the lottery you can do a bit better, some images and banners would do good, the site is too simple and at the same time less descriptive, does not look professional at all.",

You need to explain the concept better or create a functioning service which proves how fair, reliable and secure it is.

It might be true if the theory of quantum retrocausality pans out. There already is a physics experiment which supports it.https://phys.org/news/2017-07-physicists-retrocausal-quantum-theory-future.html#:~:text=Instead%2C%20retrocausality%20means%20that%2C%20when,the%20experimenter%20made%20their%20choice.So yes, it would appear that the past effects the future and the future effects the past. We are in between that dynamic action. retrocausality may be one of the missing pieces that makes quantum theory complete. Exciting. Scary to think that our memories could be dynamically changing to \"accomodate\" the current present, so even though we think the past is really the past it isn't. Our memories just change of what the past is because the future changed.But as talented as a physicist I consider myself to be, his 15 minute idea is still an unfeasible project that needs no advertising due to how bad it is.",

This a trick many have used to win this lotto game in time passed that I know off... I personally consider this as some form of time travel.",

Why not just go for a few games where you know what is going to happen. It seems much more profitable to use your knowledge of the future than try to win at a casino game. There are so many possibilities if you would know how the world looks like in next month or next year. For example, if you know the exact winning score of the Champions League finale tomorrow, you could just bet all your money on that game. Predicting games with the winnings score already gives a nice multipler. And if you know the outcome with 100% certainity you can also go and borrow all the money you can get from friends and family, max out your credit cards and if maybe even get a mortgage on your own house. All it takes would be one game with some time to prepare and we would be rich. Using enough leverage on a sure bet would be the best money printing technique, unfortunately we haven't solved the time travel problem yet. And even if we ever manage to invent time travel, it would probably be a government secret and only very rich individuals or companies could afford it.",

Even if you have said that most of the players lose it is still a proof that when you gamble either in casino, sports betting or even lottery is that your winning chance is very low.

But don't let my comment discourage you. There are many ways to fix this and improve the idea.For example, instead of the ltc transaction hash you can use the hash of the block in which the transaction is included. This way you ensure the ticket number is completely random. You can also combine the block hash with the transaction hash to ensure each player gets a unique ticket number (in case more than one transaction are included in the same block).",
