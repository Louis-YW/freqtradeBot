  "content": "The Luna Red Classic Protocol is based on a token with passive yield mechanics that do not stem from transfer taxes. The passive yields on the protocol come from supply expansion from new buy orders (which represent organic demand for the token). As a Luna Red Classic holder, you passively earn more tokens for every new buy order placed for $LRC. Your rewards are instantly “delivered” into your wallet after each new buy. There is no staking, no delegating, and you earn rewards even when you’re offline.The $LRC token being a native token of the Luna Red Classic Protocol is an BEP20 token with a few key differences:– It has a built-in yield mechanism that rewards holders with new tokens for every buy order placed on the protocol.– It has a hard maximum supply of 100,000,000 tokens.– It has a 4% initial circulating supply (4,000,000 $LRC).Are you Wondering About how 0% Tax Works?The LRC/USD token is taxed on the secondary market, whereas Luna red classic (Luna Red) is not. The passive yields in this case come from new purchase orders (which signify organic demand for the currency), rather than transfer taxes.
