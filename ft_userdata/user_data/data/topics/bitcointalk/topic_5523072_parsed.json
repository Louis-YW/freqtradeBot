But the reason some people called bitcoin a digital gold is because there is no asset adopted like gold. Gold is the number one asset in the world. As gold has the highest adoption, it means more people prefer to invest in gold and also it means those people that invested in it (gold) know what it (gold) is which is the reason they are buying it (gold). So these people can easily know that bitcoin is something that its price will increase if more people are buying it as it has limited supply which might encourage some people to learn about what bitcoin is and be encouraged to buy bitcoin. People look more into adoption perspectives and called bitcoin a digital gold. Not gold exactly, but something that is digital and has appreciative value.",

Both of them derive their value from that metric, in a way.And in the future - there will be more cases for people to use BTC, in my opinion. Because for now - it's used mainly as a store of value by all the parties, small and big.",

No better place to change the narrative than Bitcointalk.Its just called as that and I don't think there's something to get bothered with what other people call it. Much better focus on what you are currently doing and don't pay much attention on other narratives of people since you are just entertaining some unwanted thought's made by other people.If they call it as digital gold then its fine since there are some people which is over exaggerated on things and call Bitcoins in different names. So let them think about that and continue to believe what you want on Bitcoin.Also maybe people just value Bitcoin much that's why they made that statement.",

We can't prevent this in any way, but if it happens, I think the perception of BTC will change even more, and not in a positive way.",

In other words, gold is considered the king of assets in the world. And people call bitcoin digital gold because they think bitcoin is as great as gold, bitcoin should be recognized and treated by humanity the way they treat gold.What we should care about is how people treat it, people's need for it, it doesn't matter what they call it because they can't change the fact that it's bitcoin.",

No better place to change the narrative than Bitcointalk. We cannot take the Gold narrative which is surrounding Bitcoin semantically, but let's think about it pragmatically. The easiest way of how people have tried to build the hype and spread the news about Bitcoin and how valuable it would become is by trying to explain it to people who barely know about it with analogy to the closest valuable thing that we all know, which is Gold. Although, I understand that it could be hyperbolic somehow. The only thing that Bitcoin could serve as Digital Gold is its store of value, besides that, ofcourse they are nothing alike, I found one comment that could explain it very well. Moreover, the Digital Gold Narrative have became a characteristic of Bitcoin and stick to people's head is because how mainstream medias try to frame it on their news platform for the sake of having interesting news.",
