  "content": "Good afternoon. I immediately apologize for my poor knowledge of English. I have a 2fa wallet in electrum. I have everything from him - seed, password, authenticator. It so happened that I transferred money to a wallet whose xpub is exactly the same as the first xpub from my 2fa wallet. Yes, I'm not very smart. When you enter the 2fa wallet data, there are three public keys, one with a key, and two with eyes (android application). So I transferred it to the xpub wallet with a key. I think that in my seed phrase two seeds from wallets in a 2fa wallet are encrypted? Can I somehow get the seed from the first wallet?xpub691VHxoqUo1R55UxmKYTpapjmPehz3ZvJVVrSWUpRx8U7DqxYKHLikanSFZ5nk4xsurnoVNueMo C5Y1xi4VDP8JNvkz8gu6exMTu6KqRRLMPhoto 2fa wallet & second wallethttps://ibb.co/RpsMT7sTransaction: 4c25bfa42400ae87e786680960c48ee3db300a19cea8e53434e0f17b374097ba",

      "body": "You can get your master private key and gain access to the fund. Just note that you need to use the desktop version of electrum.1. Go for creating a new wallet and select \"Wallet with two-factor authentication.\" 2. Select \"I already have a seed\" and enter your seed phrase. 3. Select \"disable\".4. Leave the password field empty and click \"Next\". 5. Find your wallet file in your hard drive and open it with a text editor application. (You can see the default electrum directory in electrum FAQs.)6. Copy the first master private key. That's in front of \"xprv\": and above the first xpub. 7. Create a new wallet and select \"Standard wallet\".8. Select \"Use a master key\".9. Enter the master private key you copied in step 6 and click \"Next\".Now, you should be able to spend your fund.",

      "body": "2FA wallet is a certain type of multisig wallet. The master public key supposed to start from capital letter. Like this: Zpub6zJQpdE6jvy74HAeC7UFJ3imqyw...Not small letter. If you import that your master public key like yours on another wallet for single sig, it will not be recognized. Like on Electrum, it will bring this error:Code:Error: invalid master key. How come you come up with such master public key. If you have the correct master public key, you can get the master private key of the first address. But you have to do it on desktop Electrum by decrypting the wallet for backup, you can not do that on mobile Electrum.On desktop Electrum GUI, click on wallet-> password and enter your present password, leaving the new and confirm password blank and click on OK.On the GUI, click on file -> save back up -> OK.Go to the file backup and use test editor to open it, scroll down and you will see your public keys, you will see the first public key with its private key.@hosseinimr93 is also correct, if you want to see the first and the second private key. If it is the first private key that you want, you do not need to disable the 2FA, but if you need the second private key, you will need to disable the 2FA so that you will see the first and the second private key.",

You don't get that error when using the master public key generated on a legacy 2fa wallet. As you can see in the image shared by OP, he/she has used a xpub, not a zpub.",

We don't know how computer savvy you are. When you enter your mnemonic recovery words on a digital device, you need to be sure it is secure and free of malware. If you're not sure about that, you might consider to boot from a well known Linux Live OS and perform the actions there. A TAILS boot stick is OK, too.",

      "body": "Oh, gentlemen and ladies (if any), thank you very much. I'll try everything tomorrow. It's just my salary for a month + work.«How come you come up with such master public key»It was a year ago. It was necessary to transfer the electrum to a new phone. I didn't find the seed. More precisely, I did not know that in the electrum it is shown once. I saw a public key with a key picture and created a new wallet using it. But I saw that he was somehow not like that and didn’t do it anymore. And forgot about it. And then the war, work abroad, payment in bitcoins. I transferred to an old phone, but decided to transfer to a new one. Translated 1mbtc for verification and he came. Well, I transferred the entire amount. But now I know a lot more about different types of wallets. Heh.",
