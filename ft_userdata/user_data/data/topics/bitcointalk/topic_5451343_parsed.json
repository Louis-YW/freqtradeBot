  "content": "Greetings cryptomaniacs...Before entering the topic I will tell you a little about me. I used to work at Media Crypto and had some income from there. The salary is very decent, from this job I also have many relationships who are experts in their field, of course. Traders and influencers are no exception. # Trading Cryptocurrency (Spot/Futures/Margin)At first I only used my salary to make ends meet, but over time I was tempted by trader friends who posted their trading results, and started playing trading on the Bittrex platform at that time. With a passion for multiplying money, I am, who at that time was lazy to learn about trading, charts, doji and all kinds of things related to trading, my capital money ran out in 2 nights.In the following month I was crazy. Full of revenge, I thought of all the ways how to make my capital money that was lost at that time come back through the next trade. I found group pumping in the telegram application. I follow and I pay attention on it.After payday I immediately made a deposit. In the first execution when participating in group pumping, I got a profit, even though it was 25 percent. The second and third executions went according to plan and pocketed a profit.Enter the next executable. Because in all three executions I made a profit I decided to go all in. Unexpectedly, pumping didn't go according to plan and only happened in a matter of seconds. My money was stuck and I lost 75 percent.I'm Frustrated. And I decided not to trade crypto in 4 Months.In those four months I gradually learned about trading self-taught on the internet. I started with money trading management, self control, DCA, charts and several indicators. Even though there are some, until now I don't understand either.The point I made here I want to take a red warning to new traders or someone who is tempted to trade with the aim of quick money and so on to learn and understand what you are about to do.Don't rush, Enjoy the process. And if it's steady and ready to trade. Do it carefully, use SL and TP, be grateful for the profit, even if it's small, rather than a big loss. Don't be Greedy!Loud of warning! Don't use your salary money let alone get into debt for trading. Just use money that is really free, afford to lose. Because if we force ourselves our mental health will be disrupted. If the mental is broken Trading will turn into a Gambling game!And in my opinion, an effective way to trade spot and futures, DCA is the one way a healthy and good. But I'm sure there are some other good ways out there that I'm not familiar with.# Trading Forex and StockApart from trading crypto, I also tried forex and stocks. It's the same with crypto, my basic in trading is still 0. I did all of this because I was purely tempted by the advertisements that appeared that trading provides easy profits where money will work for us. But it's not as beautiful as the reality, in practice I was destroyed and my money ran out. Random use of lots, entered without research, blind to news.Nearly 2 years of salary from my work wasted. Fortunately, at that time I was not married.I fell that trading in stocks and forex was very slow and not as comfortable as trading in crypto so I only stayed there for a while then moved back to CryptoIn short I started to get married and build small businesses such as selling children's clothes and kebabs. I am grateful that even though my business is small, it is able to meet basic needs and have leftovers to save.Here I have also done various trials and errors, where I will not use the money from my small business to trade crypto. I made this decision because I have a basis where I also have to maintain the health of my business.Avoid unwanted things. I am currently trading crypto using money from my side jobs such as campaigns on Bitcointalk and some of the leftovers from the 2017 crypto party.What I want to convey here from my experience is Be good at self-management and strategy. Don't be tempted by what we see. What we see is not necessarily easy when we do it. Classify your investment type. Don't mix it up. If one is destroyed then it cannot affect your other investments/businesses.Well, are there any additional tips on trading and managing finances from the salary we get or experience similar to mine? Please share here. thank you..This story is only limited to my experience. And it is not meant to be solicitation or patronizing.",

      "body": "Trading is not easy,especially when you first try it. I am sure that almost all traders who exist today must have had a dark experience when trading. But by experiencing this dark experience, traders can learn more from their mistakes. So the dark experience that occurred when trading in crypto, can be a very extraordinary lesson for the future, so that it is even more powerful in trading.When it comes to the capital that must be used for trading in crypto, it is not recommended to use the salary money fully worked, especially those who still have a lot of needs through the salary money. So basically when you want to start trading in crypto, you have to use really cold money/capital. Because if you use money that is still hot, most traders will complain of worry and eventually lose control, because their mentality has fallen. AndI personally, when I want to buy crypto assets, always use money/capital from the money left over from the cost of my basic needs and from the savings I have, so I feel calmer and less stressed.",

It's just what happens when tech businesses who reinvest in the themselves and therefore on paper don't have a profit respond to rising interest rates. A massive number of the Nasdaq companies are down the same amount as crypto. Why? because they are responding to the same circumstantial changes in the economy. When the money printer gets turned back on you'll see growth stocks and crypto off the races again.",

Do you think the market cares about your emotions? No OP. Nothing cares about your emotions, and that's the hard truth. When you're trading, try to be emotionless. When you're trading, set aside your emotions. Your emotions lead you to follow some telegram pump and dump groups that obviously is a scam because the moment that they will tell you the coin that they will pump, when you try to trade on it, the coin already pumped. Well, I just hope that you've learned a lesson from this one. Just to share as well that like you, I've also tried to join these pump and dump groups because I thought that it was a shortcut in trading because I'm a bit lazy at that time. Cut the story short, I ended up losing money following them, and from that I tried to learn trading. Spent time watching videos, applying it, and building the best strategy that works for me.Quote from: lombok on May 05, 2023, 12:45:23 PMI'm Frustrated.

I hope that these people will wake up one day, and realize that it wasn't that easy to gain profit in trading. If it's that easy to make profit thru trading then all of us must've been rich by now.

Being emotionless in trading is hard especially when you're starting, but as you gain experience, you will gradually learn how to control your emotion, and eventually set it aside. I'm too emotional as well when I started trading, and because of that I lost more than half of my initial capital. My losses taught me to set aside emotion, and as I trade, I learned to be emotionless.",

Because when entering trading, we cannot fully control our own minds and emotions even though we have prepared thoroughly beforehand. The market is nothing more than a matrix that will mess our minds up if we are momentarily negligent.

When you hear about other people's successes, it may sound simpler or appear to be a path to wealth, but this is a false assessment of the situation. We often risk everything we have because we have the false impression that we can profit from it easily, which typically leads to significant losses. Trading requires a lot of learning, and even experienced traders suffered a lot of losses in the beginning. Although it is profitable, trying it without deeper knowledge will just leave you frustrated. If you truly want to pursue it, however, you must make sure that you are aware of potential challenges that you can encounter while doing it. You should only risk the amount of money that you can afford to lose, and as much as possible, allocate only a percentage of your salary.",

Besides, you'll really have to spend a lot of money for those lessons.If someone isn't profitable with trading, never lose hope but HODL.",
