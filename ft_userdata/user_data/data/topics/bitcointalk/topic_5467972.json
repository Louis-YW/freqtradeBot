How do you configure Bitcoin to automatically run on boot? By ticking optionIIRC it shouldn't happen if you change folder path by editing bitcoin.conf.I guess he did check \"Start Bitcoin on system startup\" in the options menu.The only problem is what exactly he is trying to target.@OP would you mind to tell us if you already have Bitcoin data in drive D:If you already have a copy in drive D: then you can edit the bitcoin.conf file then add thisCode:datadir=D:\\BitcoinReplace Bitcoin to the folder name where you move the Bitcoin data.",

If you are still battling with same issue I would also suggest that you do this, especially on a windows PC.Firstly, I will advise you to shut down your windows PC completely, although it doesn't matter, but to refresh your PC memory. Then, Close Bitcoin core if it's in anyway running in the background, then find your bitcoin.conf file, and change the datadir setting. e.g.Code:# [core]# Specify a non-default location to store blockchain and other data.datadir=D:\\BitcoinThen re-open core. It should pick up where your wallet last synced to the drive D:.I hope this helps!",

For example, the OS might forcefully kill Bitcoin Core process which lead to data corruption. When you close Bitcoin Core GUI, it shows message \"Do not shut down the computer until this window closes\".Agree with you.It takes only a few seconds to completely close a Bitcoin Core wallet so it is not painful experience.Having problems when reopening a Bitcoin Core wallet after a sudden electricity, power supply loss, which you can not control, is acceptable. But if it is intentionally shut down, it is not smart action.I read some users came to Bitcointalk and asked issues with their Bitcoin Core wallet. Some issues are because of abruptly shutdown the computer before a wallet compelely closes.",
