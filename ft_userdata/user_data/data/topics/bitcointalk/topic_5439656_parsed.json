  "content": "What happened:: I have received emails from Namecheap. The title of the heading was \"MetaMask: Your wallet is about to be suspended\" So, I became confused why Namecheap will tell me about MetaMask and also I have not used MetaMask anywhere. So tried to go into the details. On the body of the email, there is another title \"Your wallet is about to be suspendedApply for KYC Verification\". They have provided one link directlyCode:https://verification.metamask.io/KYC?id=000#64841111326And linked with another link Code:https://links.namecheap.com/u/click?_t=9a766a4fa5294d089b01463bac20344b&_m=1b699bc2cc4b4443902acbf08579a8e9&_e=GOqzxdKCe2yW5ALNwMNlGKI8mnal2JOhGtG8doDaX3WEay2S3F4qmqHdO8E4ivO0lKLmmsQcNBewiwSLFbECbIJvCC7stwH9d7a1GGV6Pxko-wt9k98db1QEf9EVT2vvc6-F3K4MyOXeca5R5oubY1yy7gTewyXzoZXjRAfopUxccBmpUEZ3PZhExySQVC-iOGTMW7T9xQ9dmd0sBMtVtOHCVS7CwdCT_O2yZajAssk%3DAdditional Notes: I have tried to check on google whether MetaMask requires any KYC document or not.

They've stopped using Sendgrid according to the latest update, but it is unclear if the hacker also hacks other providers/services so better be careful. On the other hand, Twilio/Sendgrid claims there is no security incident in their system, so the exact reason is hard to figure out. Either one of them is lying, or both of them are at fault.

But the scammers sent spam messages by hacking into the email service provider's systems, and Namecheap blamed the upstream system, which is probably \"SendGrid,\" according to the CEO of Namecheap on Twitter.We all should not take any of our emails seriously and do our research before we submit our documents or send our private keys or recovery phrases even if the sender's email is official and belongs to MetaMask or others because scammers do not stop developing their methods.",

There are million and one person's here that have no idea about this email circulating every where  but if they see this just as I have seen it now, they too would have the knowledge of what is happening and would be very cautious about such email if they eventually receive it. Hackers and scammers are now very  wise and smart that e will be thinking what they sent you is real and from the original source but unknown to you, they are hackers wanting to get your details so as to access your privacy and steal away your information. Every one must be careful the kind of mails they open and click on their system so as not to be victim of hackers",
