If all you need is Polish IP, why don't you simply use VPN instead? That looks to me like a much easier solution than finding someone from Poland to do that for you (unless you need Polish ID as well, which is entirely different thing and should be mentioned).",

There would phishing sites can damage anything that will connect. Who will take the risk? Rather than buy a dedicated IP address or find some alternative if you can't share site publicly. How can a site hurt you unless you share credentials? It doesn't make sense and seems quite suspicious to me.",

At the moment it simply looks dodgy to me, and judging by other comments I am not the only one who has that opinion.Btw, you might have more luck asking in Polish local board.",

Maybe they will show up if you can escrow your payment to them.  Or why not buy an AWS account run 1 RPC instance and choose a region that Poland is included? I guess it's a paid one you don't need to find someone to do it for you. Or use VPN that supports dedicated IP and can able to choose where you live on the map or GPS spoofing you can check IPvanish it's cheap and you can use it for other activities. You don't need to look for someone living in Poland you can use IPvanish that you look living in Poland.",

Iirc (haven't used ExpressVPN for some time) they don't even have a large amount of Polish servers so that's another reason why its so easy to for a gambling site to track those.Quote from: ps34 on October 02, 2022, 12:30:00 AMbut for this to happen someone needs to contact me offcourse The biggest obstacle for that to happen is your trust score and reputation (or lack of) so I am not too optimistic about that.",

Most of these sites follow IDS/IPS detection activity, and if they found an unusual change in the login pattern, the red indicators will increase, and therefore they will ask you for more data such as a phone number, bank account, passport, or invoice.",

That website definitely has a record of the data they get from you, apart from just IP addresses. This could include the device ID, timezone, browser version and type or user agent, operating system etc. Just check the privacy policy of the site to confirm this.If you assign someone with a completely different computer from yours to sign in. That will still be a red flag to them, and they probably won't unblock your account.",
