  "content": "Economic discussions related to inflation, recession, food crisis, labor crisis, agricultural crisis, war crisis are enough to make our heads hot and we need a little relaxation in this discussion.so let me bring this discussion a little to one thing that will be fun to discuss and talk about. That is about Financial Freedom.Well I'm not going to ask whether you already have financial freedom or not. But I'm here to bring our minds to try to imagine ourselves when one day we succeed in achieving Financial Freedom.Consider yourself already have financial freedom at this time. That is, you already have passive income that continues to flow into your account and into your wallet without the hassle of managing your business. because your business and all your companies are managed by someone you trust to manage it. So you just need to sit back or take a vacation every day while enjoying the flow of money that continues to enter your pocket.Now my question in such a situation is when you already have financial freedom. then what are you going to do to enjoy your life and enjoy that financial freedom?---------------Edited: I haven't been active in the forums in a few days and was quite surprised that a thread I had created had 6 pages to load. i love to see this thread grow. and I'm glad everyone started pouring out their thoughts regarding their desires when they achieve financial freedom.Sometimes we have to think about the beauty that we can feel when we one day get the welfare of life, such as having financial freedom. And actually by recalling what we will do in the future when we become successful, it will actually stimulate our spirits and minds to become more active and more enthusiastic to be able to reach our goals more quickly. and this is actually the point of this thread.Remembering the ultimate goal can trigger a strong desire within us which can make our productivity increase as well.",

      "body": "I will continue to invest!!!By \"financial freedom,\" I believe that I can get what I want so long it's what money can buy. But this is limited if an investment is not persistent, so I will rather continue investing and get to find other means to invest more even if the ones I tried are successful.Mind you, you don't have to do this yourself, that's what all these rich people do. They only communicate, meet, give instructions and make their employees accountable for what they are being paid for.Furthermore, nothing should stop you from exploring further. What you need most are your resources (money and employees) and your brain (to locate ideas) and how to use them to continuously do the work for you through the right coordination.",

And what I mentioned above is the main thing that I do and is for my provision when I die because the rewards will continue to flow.and apart from going on holiday to some beautiful places, enjoying good food, and bicycling or jogging twice a week to stay healthy and also resting in a luxurious and comfortable home with real safety there is so much more i want to do especially in things to my kindness and the kindness of many people, and may it be granted.",

You will never have a level where you can earn enough money so that you would be happy ever after. There is one catch, this does not apply to those who are millionaires and above with continuous income from couple of businesses or may be more. That’s another level of plateau which doesn’t apply here. Assuming we are talking normal people like me who is yet to earn my first million or even less. Lolz. Guy like me would reach those levels only after 3-4 decades of time and would realise I just need peace and not the money. That’s my thought on it.",

And this will definitely be done by everyone when they have reached their goals in life, so enjoying it is the main thing. Some other additions by investing in all types of existing investment assets so that the income continues to accumulate.But, but, but is it enough to fantasize and then come back to realizing that real life must go on as it should. I don't like to fantasize a lot, because what needs to be done right now is to describe what can be done, and most importantly enjoy what we can still enjoy today. Someone's version of financial freedom is definitely different, not only about the money that keeps flowing, because while that person can enjoy life from day to day, be grateful for the life that can still be lived and do it within the limits of his own ability then that is true financial freedom.",

Because once someone has that amount of money and businesses, they only think of expanding business to different areas and that is why we see top businesses men who are already topping the richest peoples chart competing to get hold of new technology. So if at least I get to this point I would organize some days in a year to have a large family vacation. But I still I am of the opinion that there is hardly total financial freedom, Infact the richest people sleepless because of the constant pressure to expand. Financial freedom lies on contentment",

My personal opinion, financial freedom is not from the level of achievement, but how I enjoy that achievement. I mean, passive income cannot ensure that someone does not pursue higher financial levels as long as they feel they have sufficient capabilities. That is, there is no opportunity to enjoy the achievements that exist.",
