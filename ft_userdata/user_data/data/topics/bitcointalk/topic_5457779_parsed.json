  "content": "Content WritingI am a content writer and I have been writing content since 2014. I have worked with many clients on Fiverr and other freelancing platforms. In this service I will write content for the clients who need high quality content for their websites, blogs, social media posts etc. I can write content for various niches that include but are not limited to, crypto-currencies especially Bitcoin, games, diet & nutrition, technology, gambling sites, and so many other niches. If you need any type of content for your website, blog, or social media platforms, send me a massage in my inbox. I assure you that whatever content I write for you will be free from plagiarism, grammatical errors, and other serious issues. The content will be 100% unique and it will be free from errors. Review WritingIn my review writing service I will write a comprehensive and detailed review for your website, digital product, application etc. My review will be detailed because I will give enough time to test the platform, digital product, or application before writing my review. If you want me to write a review for your platform, send me an inbox message.I write reviews that are 1000-2500 words long, however if you want a simple review I can write that as well. The length of the review depends on the complexity and features of a platform, digital product, or application. The well known platforms offer so many features, and it would be unfair to write 500-800 words review for such platforms. A detailed review can help users a lot about such platforms because they will learn most of the features of a platform by reading that comprehensive review. Feel free to inbox me. Note: I can write 1000-3000 words per day, and if you want a permanent writer at your service then feel free to contact me.",
