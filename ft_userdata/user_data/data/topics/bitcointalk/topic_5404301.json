This helps the network a lot. Also you can think about becoming a lightning channel to even earn some Bitcoin without the need of wasting large amounts of power.I already run the full node, I just wanted to know if I can mine too. I will search about lightning channel.

I'd recommend to check Non-specialized hardware comparison and Mining hardware comparison to see the vast difference.Quote from: dragospirvu75 on June 28, 2022, 03:58:51 AMI found somewhere on internet that the command for mining is setgenerate true (1), but it doesn't work.It's likely you found outdated article, setgenerate command removed on Bitcoin Core 0.13.0.Too technical for me to understand the difference, thank you for your info!",

It means you don't need to compare them.If you don't want to buy an ASIC machine, running a full node is enough to help the network by validating transactions and blocks.Or you can try a USB ASIC miner like newpac price is around $25/$50 and it's not power-hungry like Antminer.",

I'd recommend to check Non-specialized hardware comparison and Mining hardware comparison to see the vast difference.Too technical for me to understand the difference, thank you for your info!What i wanted to show is basically hashrate difference between CPU/GPU and ASIC. For example, \"Intel Core i5 2600K\" (released on 2011) has 17.3 MH/s while AntMiner S1 (released on 2013) has 180000.0 MH/s.If you are trying to find out *why* ASIC's are so much faster the simple answer is: Because a CPU/GPU it a general purpose device they spend a lot of clock cycles just moving data around inside their registers as they execute the various math code operations including however many cycles the OS running the PC consumes. Data input and output is just a tiny part of the time being spent.ASIC's don't do they that, they pipeline the data through hard-coded logic elements. When new work is presented to the chip 1-2 clock cycles are all that is needed to load the work into the pipeline and from there it is 1 cycle to read in new data AND output the result from previous calculation then 1 cycle for process the hash function for a whopping total of only 2 clock cycles needed for each increment of the work presented to the chips. Throw in the fact that even the ancient S1 had 256 cores in each chip and the reason for their speed should be obvious. These days a miner chip will have over 4k cores in it sooo...",
