If they did, they would have never gotten the Covid vaxx. why would anyone not care about health talk, when it's for their own good.Health talk can have several benefits, including:<snip>Health talk is only good when there is health think along with it.I talked to a nurse in a popular hospital about the Covid vaxx. She didn't get the vaxx. I asked her why not. She told me that she had never seen a vaccine appear out of nowhere as fast as the Covid vaxx... and without reliable testing. It didn't make sense to her. So, she didn't get it... and she was the only nurse in her hospital that didn't get it... and she is the only nurse in her hospital who didn't get Covid.Yet, you can see all the health talk all over the place that says that the Covid vaxx is good. Yet it is the only, Only, ONLY vaccine that VAERS has recorded anything like the number of deaths from a vaccine - https://openvaers.com/covid-data. On top of this, the number of deaths reported is under 1% - https://openvaers.com/faq/what-is-underreporting-and-why-it-matters. This means that millions have died from the vaxx worldwide... to say nothing about all the rest of the health issues.The point is, if the medical can mess with you on this by sweet talking you, THINK of the thousands of other ways they are messing with you... ALL OF IT BY HEALTH TALK ON THEIR PART... and little of it by HEALTH THINK on your part. Look at how long it took for people to ask for a second or third opinion about their health. For years people simply trusted their doctor.",

Covid may have been a hoax in Nigeria but believe me people still cares about being safe with drugs.Almost all medical drugs are forms of concentrated poison. Why would the medical give poison to people, even in tiny amounts? Because when the body tries to fight the poison, it automatically fights off a disease or malady that is bothering the person. It's just that the body somehow wasn't sensitive enough to the malady to fight it off without the drug poison.The drug stimulates the body into action. But when doing this, it also tires the body in certain ways. That's why a medication becomes ineffective after a long time of usage. The body doesn't have any more strength in the area that the particular medicine was stimulating it. It got run down by this particular form of stimulation. A different drug stimulant might be needed to get the body to fight in a different way.The point is this. Drugs slowly weaken the body. This includes all the pain medicines that are out there... if they are used on a regular basis. People of 100 years ago, who did not have as many drug medicines, where a lot healthier in some great ways. Test results on people showed that they did not pass many of the modern diseases on to each other simply by being in the same room with a sick person, except if their bodies were weakened first... weakened by drugs, or weakened simply by working too hard and becoming overtired.Constant medical drug usage by a whole country has weakened the whole country. That's what is making Covid and the flu so dangerous. Neither are dangerous for a healthy person who is well rested and who has had little or no drug use.All drugs are dangerous.",

But after several months of it, you will start to feel really good. Sugar is a drug. Sugar is the most popular drug there is. The obesity rate is indicative of an endemic problem. It's not that fructose is any different in a fruit than it is in processed foods, though. It's only that the food manufactures add endless amounts of fructose corn syrups to things you wouldn't normally expect which makes the food slightly addictive.Sugar isn't methamphetamine or heroin but it kills more people than hard drugs. How many lives could have been saved by telling people to loose a bit of weight instead of taking an ineffective COVID vax that no longer works? Makes you wonder.",

When someone is taken to court by the government (in the US, that is), the man or woman hires or is appointed an attorney. This makes him an infant, a ward of the court, like an insane person, or one who can't handle things on his own. In other words, he has given himself over to whatever the court decides, and essentially can't even speak except that the court lets him.See https://www.youarelaw.org/Download/CorpusJurisSecundum-AttorneyClient.pdf.",

Adequate rest or drinking enough water might be far better than taking these chemically formulated drugs. But the truth is that people don't care about the effects of the drugs, they just want quick or instant healing which is why they go for medical drugs.There are approximately four reasons why people take medical drugs:1. The media talks them into it;2. They aren't eating healthily, so they get sick;3. They have been poisoned, often by the drugs and pesticides and herbicides being used on them, and they think that further drug-taking will heal them;4. Standard old-age and its causes seem to affect everybody; the causes are a whole load of things in an imperfect nature around us.",
