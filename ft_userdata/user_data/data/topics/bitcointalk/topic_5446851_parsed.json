Twitter, tg, DC, ... is the place of strong activity of market airdrop search groups, you can start with the keyword airdrop on twitter to search for results, hope it is useful to you.",

LOL. I don't think we have a single platform that provides specific information regarding airdrops, but if you want to find out potential airdrops, you can use the website mentioned by @FrozenBit above, or at Airdrops.io. But for Airdrops like Arbitrum, you won't get any information, because usually their airdrops are not accompanied by an initial announcement.",

Like website/platform that got information like these?I am personally not an airdrop hunter and even though i knew that there might be a possible arbitrum airdrop and that most likely the people would get an airdrop that were using the arbitrum blockchain before a certain deadline i did not do any trades or swaps on Arbitrum and therefore i obviously also did not get any Arb tokens.Still i know a few twitter channels that are providing lists of possible airdrops and even instructions on what to do and sometimes even video tutorials how to do it. At the moment it seems like zksync is the next big target for airdrop farmers, but to be honest i don't think that this airdrop will have a value that is even close to the one of Arb, because there are just too many airdrop hunters now.Link to the channel: https://twitter.com/CryptoStreamHub",

I don't think you are ready with airdrop like arbitrum indeed need waiting for longer time and they not update will sent airdrop coins for user have active swap or trade on their platform.I don't have enough fees for participating on airdrop like arbitrum, not only about longer time distribution but also many kinds or swap or add liquidity airdrop not worth yet due they not launching their coin. Have some airdrop like Elitswap for user active swap on their platform but now worth with price drop and higher than fees for claiming this coins. Based on your lucky and need to participants for all airdrop kinds if you want earn one potential airdrop later.",

In my place there’s a group in social media where you can see a lot of info about airdrop tasks, this is a big help for me. The question is, is it worth it to build such a site that provides airdrop information because most of those airdrop project teams never distribute to members and even if they do what will be the possible percentage that the token will get listed and at what price? -A few tokens that pay airdrop participants have not been really profitable because some of the coins when listed could not gain value not even to pay for transaction fees, so how do you expect airdrop participants to test the project platform when the airdrop reward can even pay fees.",

Huge airdrop is one of a kind, if you’re luck enough you might qualify for this but better not to expect that much in airdrop. Stay consistent on looking for a good airdrop, there might be no assurance but there’s a chance for you to get money here so keep working.",

Even I'm not sure there is an app with an airdrop tracker because it is random for us unknown.Actually there are many who provide this, such as telegram channels, twitter, discord just need to analyze whether the airdrop is potential or not because we don't know, recently it was about ardrop that did a bridge that has great value maybe you can also try it even on twitter there has been a lot of influence doing this how to enter for the airdrop criteria.Airdrops are volatile, so don't get your hopes up.",
