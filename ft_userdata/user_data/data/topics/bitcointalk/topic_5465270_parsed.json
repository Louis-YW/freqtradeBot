When you do things like this, there is a chance that you leak your keys!As for the website you shared, it doesn't seem to be using a deterministic algorithm to generate the ephemeral key needed for creating an ECDSA signature which could be a source of some possible vulnerabilities. For example if it uses a weak key, after you share the signed message + signature your private key could be leaked.This is why you should always try to stick to popular wallets that are well tested and reviewed not any random tool you find on the internet.",

I think I should use the blue wallet since it is available on mobile.Because you input your seed phrase on incoleman already, if your first attempt was online and you have sent coins to the addresses of the seed phrase, I will advice you to send your coins to another wallet which you will newly create now. Do not trust anything online.I see no point in using iancoleman at all when there are wallets that support segwit address message signing. You can use Bluewallet instead. Trustwallwt is a close source wallet, I have mentioned some wallets up which are recommended for your bitcoin. Generate a new seed seed phrase, keys and addresses on such wallets (Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Sparrow, Specter or Bluewallet) and send your coins there. For high amount of coins, you can go for an open source airgapped wallet like Electrum cold storage which you can be able to setup using other reputed wallets as well . https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlOr you can go for open source wallet like Passport (bitcoin-only wallet) or Trezor for multicoins. Avoid Trezor coinjoin, it is from Wasabi. If you need coinjoin, go for Whirlpool on Sparrow or Samourai wallet.",

If someone knows your master public key (which can happen if you don't run your own node and use a software which sends xpubs to SPV servers), and just one private key from your wallet can allow them work out every private key from your wallet due to the nature of extended private keys.Move to a new wallet.",

Every time your wallet receives bitcoins it will generate a new address. Your wallet may eventually generate thousands of addresses, so it is wrong to think of one of them as \"my address\". It is better to think of an address as something more like an invoice number.However, when you want to use an address to sign messages, you are choosing that address to be associated with your identity and it becomes your \"signing address\". And for privacy reasons, it is better if your signing address is never used to send or receive bitcoins. You may be asked to sign a message with an address to prove that you control the address. That's different.Pick a wallet that allows you to reserve an address for signing messages. Use that wallet to sign messages and don't mess around with private keys. The wallet can also hold your bitcoins, but it is not required.",
