Its invention is attributed to Felix Falguiere aka Falguierein who initially named the game \"Baccara\".Baccara, stands for zero in Italian and this has to do with the way you play the game as many cards have the value of 0. It later evolved to have three different versions known as \"punto banco, chemmy and baccarat banque\". From Italy the game is said to have been brought to France where it conquered the joy of King Charles VIII and since then it was adopted by the French aristocracy.

Today, Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world.According to legend, the first bet in the card game \"Baccarat\" was not money, but the fate of a beautiful golden-haired Frenchwoman.  In the event of a loss in a gambling game, the girl was supposed to die - they planned to stuff her into a leather bag and drown her in the sea.  However, the girl managed to escape .... In general, many legends are associated with baccarat .... They say that initially this game was played with the help of magic tarot cards, and not with the help of ordinary playing cards (they were invented much later during the hundred-year war between  England and France). It was rumored that Baccarat was invented by the Celtic priests, the Druids, although there is nothing mystical about modern Baccarat....",

And you can clearly that there will be a lot of people in certain table, like $10 minimum table or $20. And you will hear them shouting when they won big or something like pairs/tie/draw or super 6 anything on the side bet.",

They say the game is very popular in Singapore and Macau, and overall in Southeast Asia, and it would be interesting to hear from people living there about the extent of its popularity.",

Nevertheless it's really very simply, chances to win are high as compare to other games.Again, this is just me, I find it funny though when players look at certain pattern as who is going to win next, for me this is just gamblers fallacy.Really? I always thought that all card games are based on skill and there are also people who claim themselves as a pro baccarat player but they are seem to be legit because they have proofs. What about poker and blackjack? What do you think about these two card games? Do you think they are skill-based or luck based? But, I can agree that baccarat is more enjoyable than in blackjack. I think that's because baccarat is played by more than two cards. I am not familiar on the pic that you share but why there is only three letters on it? And those letters are not found on the deck of a card but there must be a special explanation with it from those who are really pro in this game.Maybe you are talking about poker or blackjack  that needed skills, black jack for example, you can take advantage by card counting.But in baccarat, there's no such thing, it's based on pure luck, and there are no trends or whatsoever, there result of the next card whether or banker or player is independent of the previous result. And if those who think otherwise, I will say that it's a gamblers fallacy.I'm send a lot of patterns, jumping, successive runs on getting the player or bank, but still you don't know the next result, could be either or draw.They can claim as professional baccarat player, definitely, you can win big, but then again, still based on pure luck for me.",
