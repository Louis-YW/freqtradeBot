As for the merit earning, there's no pattern or should I say a tutorial on how one should go about if they wish to earn merit but you should consider contributing to the forum and also in discussions that you engage in, and for you to do that you'll have to acquire knowledge about Bitcoin or crypto as a whole. You can still check my signature space for Ratimov's encyclopedia link.",

The forum is filled with so much knowledge that you can tap from by reading and learning about bitcoin. Also make your own research to gain more knowledge. Start by reading every pinned thread in the various boards to learn about the forum and have more knowledge about the discussions on that board.

However you only have 14 activities and that is barely two weeks of being here and why the rush. Take time to read and study the platform before searching for ways to jump at merit.

I think I should ask you this question, why do you want your merits to grow? I believe if you are on the forum and all what you are after is merits, then you won’t get the merits and you might end up going against the forum rules maybe by plagiarizing and you get banned or maybe by spamming.If you want your merits to keep on increasing, then just make sure you start making positive contribution to the forum, make quality posts and make useful comments, anyhow that think your posts is useful to him and worth meriting will merit you and your merits will be growing gradually but don’t be desperate.Don’t plagiarize because you want to make quality posts, if you are making a post and you know the post is not yours, just make sure you quote the part you copied and make sure you add source link and you are safe, you won’t punished if you add source link and you quote where you copied and you will be given merits if anybody thinks it worth it.",

You won't grow anything writing in capital letters.First, try to understand what exactly merit means. The forum and the ranking on the forum did not arise because of merit, but the opposite. It is necessary to relax and enjoy the forum, and the merits will come by themselves.\"Meaning of merit in English - the quality of being good and deserving praise:\" https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/merit",

Don't focus on increasing rank but focus on increasing knowledge as a means for you to make it easier for you to understand what other people are saying, merit will come to you if you make a reply or post that deserves to be given merit by other users.Good posts do not mean quality, everyone can make good posts according to themselves but not necessarily from other users, right? Good and quality posts in the view of other users, for example, like me when judging other people's posts, I see whether they are useful or not for me and your posting forum.Keep the spirit and fear to explore the forum and continue to contribute, there are many opportunities to earn merit.Like here, Ratimov, Fillippone and many more, so don't be lazy to explore the forums and contribute to the forum..",

Many times we want to say that don't give priority to thoughts like that because it will become an obstacle for you and other beginners to develop.Just do things that make you grow personally by reading a lot, discussing so that it will bring new ideas and solutions that are useful for all people.This advice may have been repeatedly reminded by members who are very experienced for members like you who raise topics like this.What is very important in our opinion is the goal and being consistent with the goal itself. If the goal is only to pursue merit, change your thoughts in a better direction for self-development.",

This is one of the funny questions I always laugh at because it is out of desperation to rank up so you can join signature campaign without even trying as much to calm down or make an impact in this community. Asking this question is not bad but it should how concerned you are in getting ranked so can start earning from the community with just few activities. You need to make an impact in the community so you can be relevant not being desperate to each the next level without any input. You need to keep writing good posts that are of advantage to the community. Getting merited depends on the merit source that will find your post relevant and worthy of having merits.",
