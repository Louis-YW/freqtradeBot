For my opion, aidrops is bad, not all of them are worthless but can't expect from them as well to have a huge value in the market. Earning $45 from airdrop is already a big gift for you OP while some are just valued $0 where it only stuck on our wallet and no idea when it become tradable in the market.",

I wasn't following Sui at all.Honestly I did tried their testnet on their app sui wallet however the criteria for the sui sale I did eligible is due to joining discord only. The slot though for the token sale was raffle. Just lucky to be pick. You got a nice arb airdrops. Honestly I am aiming for the zksync hopefully those sybil got caught.

Funny how that worked out  1K USD for joining Discord and trying out testnet was surely nice too. What activity are you doing in zkSync now? I think using Arbitrum eligibility criteria, e.g. bridging, making regular trx with decent volume, could be a good benchmark.Quote from: $crypto$ on May 20, 2023, 03:06:15 PMthere are also many other projects that say this has great potential although it is still difficult to predict when it will provide the airdrop.Yeah we're probably still months or even years away from zkSync airdrop. What other projects are you looking at? Tbh there are so many upcoming L1/L2 projects now I can't keep up anymore. Also not sure how these upcoming chains will gain any traction and usage, especially if they don't have any competitive advantage compared to existing popular chains.",

Well congrats to getting those tokens for basically free. I did not get the Arbitrum airdrop even though i have read a couple of times in different telegram channels that there might be an Arbitrum airdrop many weeks or even months before the airdrop actually happened but i still did not make any actions on the Arbitrum chains because i was to lazy so that was completely my own decision.At Sui it was different though. I interacted with the testnet a bit also minted an NFT and stuff like that, but what i did not do was to join their Discord and this was a necessary step in  order to be eligible to join the allowlist. I also did not take part in the public ale on KuCoin because i thought 0,1 per coin was way to much given the fact that the allowlist could buy for 0,03$.",

To get 1,500 tokens, you still had to invest in transactions or providing liquidity in the Arbitrum network. According to different estimates it was necessary to spend $20-50 in commissions to get that amount of tokens. If you provide more liquidity, the amounts were much larger, the address could send 7,500 tokens and even more than 10,000 I saw.In January there was a testnet, called ipor, there you could get 100 tokens and sell them for $ 2.5, that is about $ 250 for each account.",

I think it is considered free since I am bridging and trading on arbitrum on purpose with some tokens on their network before. Buying and selling so i expected to incurred some fees. I think every thing has fees now. But I didnt think of the criteria for the drop. Didnt even do some task for it. Just exactly doing degen trades on that. Some gains some lose.
