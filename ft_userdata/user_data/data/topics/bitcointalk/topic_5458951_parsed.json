But how about crypto regulation in Nigeria? Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-crypto-tax-move-is-premature-local-stakeholdersThe president of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN), Obinna Iwunna, has commented on the implementation of the Finance Act, 2023, which was signed into law on May 28. According to Iwunna, the successful execution of the law will be challenging due to its premature introduction.Continue to read on this link there are more to read: https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-crypto-tax-move-is-premature-local-stakeholdersWe have people of wisdom in Nigeria, but why the process to do something correctly is hard in the country. Nigeria need to be fast on regulating cryptocurrencies. The suspended CBN president failed to see how Nigeria government will earn from regulating cryptocurrencies, how cryptocurrencies will increase Nigeria economic growth and development and how it will increase employment. Even without regulation, employment increased and many Nigerians depends on crypto job as of today.The SEC regulates securities and commodities in Nigeria, no doubt they are the best for this and work with law makers. I have not seen any law maker that is directly interested in crypto regulation. Also nothing about it coming from the president or the ministry of finance. SEC needs to be fast about this and work with ministry of Finance and the law makers. Or any of them should be fast about this.In Africa, Namibia has passed a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies. South Africa will finally have a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies by the end of this year. When is Nigeria crypto regulation coming?https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-crypto-tax-move-is-premature-local-stakeholdershttps://cryptonews.com/news/namibia-passes-bill-for-licensing-regulating-virtual-asset-service-providers.htmhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end",

OP, I don't think we need to worry too much about this regulation of cryptocurrencies because, those guys in the administration really show interest on BTC and crypto in the country which they will do everything possible within their skills to make sure regulation of BTC and crypto stand in the land, and to improve the citizens financially and also improve the government economy.",

Even in developed nations with better infrastructures, they are still going to find it difficult to get most of the individual users to pay tax, is it Nigeria that's going to be able to do it? Wey everything dey jaga jaga? Maybe e go just end up as audio talk. I totally agree with what the SIBAN president said that the crypto tax is premature. Even if they decide to follow the Belarusian government proposed approach, it's still not going work. Regulation of cryptocurrency would have been the first step. Sidon look na dog name. If we wan cement ourselves as giant of Africa, we better get up join bodi follow wetin our sister countries dey do like Namibia and South Africa.",

Anytime they are ready adopt bitcoin and if the regulations are favourable then I follow suit. It is still premature because they are looking for way to tighten the regulation so they can control the system very but they are forgetting that they coming a system that is decentralized so the total control of the system is not possible. Nigerian leaders have never made anything good thing in the country matured but always premature.

I believe so because our colonial master, UK, has gone ahead to regulate and endorse the use of cryptocurrencies for business or individual purposes. The former CBN governor and the government may have battled hard to discourage cryptocurrencies, hence the case of taxing it if it must be used, but the fear may have been a repercussion of the MMM saga that struck the nation and saw people loose loads of funds. Also, the FTX saga too.I also think the snail paced movement by FG on this issue might be a way to punish the youths mostly, because of the EndSars protest that caused quite an uproar and how it was in the news that crypto holders sponsored the match.",

Although I believe this present government will actually look into cryptocurrency because from their few policies it looks like they bent on taxing everything. But just like other top countries the first thing is to provide an enabling environment for some of these exchanges trying to get into Africa and then make Nigeria a hub for cryptocurrency in the continent. Then they can regulate this exchanges and if done successfully translate it to individuals.",

Since 2020, I have known about crypto tax in United States. It even went up in percentage some months ago (I may not be correct about the increment). 10 - 37% capital gain tax for holding bitcoin or any other crypto within a year. 0 - 20% for holding crypto longer than 1 year. No centralized crypto platform that can offer bitcoin and other crypto services to United States without having license given by them. And before the license, the organization has no option than to establish itself in United States and employ United States people along. Also the organization has to fully comply with regulations and pay taxes.Nigeria regulators just need something to be done, especially about making those exchanges to register in Nigeria and be taxed.",
