Many will turn up their noses, but this is also a peculiarity that distinguishes the work. The power of Bitcoin is still underestimated today. However, despite the numerous criticisms received in recent years, we are all aware that it is the road to change, we do not know where it will lead us, but we have indeed arrived here with many good intentions.    History of “Teste di Moro” https://emozioni-di-sicilia.com/en/blogs/news/teste-di-moro-una-storia-di-amore-eterno  FRONT of Banknote - On the right, next to the number 1 there is the word.  Each banknote bears a different word. It is possible to feel it by touch, this is done with a “burin”.-  Generally, where a distinctive sign has been added, it is possible to feel them physically.  - Above there is the phrase \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for bank\" (quite iconic, that in our sector we all know \"what it means\").  - It is possible to see the author's signature \"ARTIKANDO\" inside the circle on the right (next to the \"Moor's head\")- The hash code you find below is the abstract text of the Satoshi Nakamoto paper converted to SHA256 https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html Quote Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.834477a7041eb94488adf0dea7d3ef319761ffd6be6d30fdb75dc856ad0e9382   BACK of Banknote   - At the top there is a phrase that is \"inspirational\" for everyone “Change the world by thinking differently”. After all, bitcoin helps us to think differently about many aspects of our life, compared to what we have done in the past or compared to what the rest of the \"no coiner\" population does.  - At the bottom, on the back of the banknote is inserted in morse code  “Bitcoin is the best “  .- It is possible to see the author's signature \"ARTIKANDO\" inside the circle on the right (next to the globe).This is my first auction. Please be merciful if I made any mistakes and copied  the design for this topic  EDITThe last 10 banknotes are available at the basic auction price. Contact me here or privately;)",

So I made these \"banknotes\" in a limited series (strictly by hand), subsequently printed on a 90 gr paper individually, 21 banknotes (only 21) symbolically as the 21 million of bitcoin, each banknote has an \"hr\" indicated by a code that identifies the precise position of the manufacturing \"defect\".The technique used is BIC pen, yes, just a pen and fantasy!They will then be individually numbered by hand, with an embossed stamp (unique identifier code of the banknote).It contains numerous details, for example, the morse code indicated on the back of the banknote and the hash of a pleasant bitcoin transaction (it's up to you to find out). I also tried to \"create\" a fake watermark using only the colours and overlays to make it a particular note.The project was born for fun, a challenge that I wanted to launch to try new drawing techniques, and for love I feel for bitcoins!I think the character represented is known to most people, made as a Moor's head (Sicilian) because the idea was born in this wonderful place that is Sicily. Many will turn up their noses, but this is also a peculiarity that distinguishes the work.....:::snip:::....@bitbollo - are you auctioning these on behalf of Artikando?",
