  "content": "Hello All,I found a diagram, which explains in an excellent way how to convert a public key to a P2PKH address here(1). Â In fact, the schema from that doc is the best element. Also, I found a good map of types of addresses/keys here(2) and a list of all possible address prefixes here(3).I'd like to understand how exactly private keys are converted into pub keys and addresses - like in (1) but for all elements (well, except testnet), starting from the private key. In other words, I need a doc, as clear as (1), that describes all way from random 256bit to other formats.Is there any documentation on that, ideally - as clear as (1)? Thank you.(1) https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses(2) https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Invoice_address(3) https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes",

      "body": "You might want to start your journey here https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/private-key and walk your way down the rabbit hole. A private key is basically some random number of size 256 bits within certain bounds (details behind the links). Some elliptic curve magic transforms such a private key into a public key, the reverse is not possible without exhausting likely all or more energy available in our solar system or maybe even the Milky Way galaxy. From public key to public address you take two one-way hash functions RIPEMD160(SHA256(public key)) and encode the result into the Base58 representation of the public address.It's worth the effort to work through almost all pages of above website by Greg Walker. I like his style of presentation and interactivity here and there on his website and it helped me understand Bitcoin better.",

The rest are the same.",
