  "content": "Hello guys, I know there are many newbies who are still afraid based on what they heard about the community that caused them fear, which I will like to encourage them not to listen to what they hear than to follow some cryptocurrency rules and regulations to get to were potential members are in the community. First of all, what is fear?  Fear is an unpleasant emotion or thought that you have when you are frightened or worried by something dangerous, painful or bad that is happening or might happen. Here are three types of fear you need to know:1) Fear of failure: fear of failur is among some of the things that made some people give up easily in the community, because they lack personal research to know if what they heard is true or not before carry out their operation. Fear of failur can be articulated in being afraid of never having what it is that we want, or attaining what we want and not being satisfied, not knowing how to accept what we have asked for, and move into that place.2) Fear of now: Now that we are experiencing bear season in the community, it will be favourable to remove the spirit of fear, and take a good bold to invest the little money you have in cryptocurrency, and wait to see what you will become in five years time in the community. you don't allow yourself to take the next step because on the subconscious level you believe you are not enough. You can make it like the way other people are making it in the community, if only you can follow the due process and be bold in your steps in the community.3) Fear of pain: There are some people waiting for the price of cryptocurrency to decrease to $15k before they can buy and hold for future purpose, because they heard that the people that bought at $16k or $20k last year 2021 made it, that the same thing will happen to the price to decrease to the same amount before they can buy that will cause them pain, because cryptocurrency market is unpredictable.  My advice to newbies is to do everything possible within their power to remove the spirit of fear and wear the spirit of boldness in this bear season so that they will be part of those that will celebrate when the price increase higher in the market. What is your opinion?",

      "body": "You may also have to know a certain fear called FOMO. This is especially used in cryptocurrency or business environment/investment. It is abbreviated as FOMO but the full words are Fear Of Missing Out and like I said it is used in business environment. As it implies it could be in a way that an investor want to quickly grab some profit and doesn't want to stay out side for the deed to be done, so he could decide to jump in right in. Jumping in may be at the right time for him or at the wrong time, the result justifies his fear. You can get other ways to explain FOMO.",

So how are they failing? it is less fear and more of inferiority complex that I think is the issue here. A confident individual will have no issues settling down here and becoming a part of discussions.",

Whom do you urge not to listen to?Yeah actually there are different discussion on the forum if we say specifically about our forum as there are not some investment promotions here and it's on you to choose your investment decision and it's must be based on your research and if you are believing in rumours then it's your mistake as your investment decision should not be influenced by anyone.Actually what @OP has said is not true if we are classifying different types of fear because Pain one is basically FOMO when you see that this coin will pump and invest fast as you don't want to miss the boat but the pumps are say temporary so there is difference in what you have to say.You are connecting forum with investment approach and I wonder what link up they have in them? You are member of discussion forum where only knowledge about different things can be gained and use it for your benefit rather then spreading rumours yourself because it will not help you this way.",

This forum even provides all the solutions so that beginners can adapt well in everything, in investing, trading and some problems that may be experienced.The scary stuff in this forum seems to always be exaggerated, maybe this is because the forum uses a merit system and it's impossible to rank up, and some risk issues are generated in this forum.This forum is the best place to learn cryptocurrency, learn investment and other knowledge.",

I sold my UNI too early, I paid a huge price for trying to be smart on the market, I sold 1600 cakes too early, and I paid a price too, when I held some cakes at ATH, I was punished and was punished again for holding some coins and the dump came like a thief in the night.

As the saying goes, go down 9 times, go up ten times. That's sum it up, if we lose in our trading, then we shouldn't be deter and come back strong in the next. Don't let this whole \"losing\" discourage us, but let that be a lesson for us not to repeat the same mistakes and that will make us a good trader and investor or speculator in this market.",

What is your opinion?In this paragraph you just explained \"buy low and sell high\" and everyone wants to do that, right?I disagree with your statement that \"the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable\". In my experience, all markets are predictable whether on exchanges, crypto, and others. of course with certain elements such as news sentiment, technical analysis, economic developments, and many more. Moreover, many experts reorder and analyze what will happen in the next one to two years or the next one to four years, isn't that their prediction with all their knowledge and experience?I suggest, don't start if you only rely on \"possibility\" without reset and knowledge, how will you become a strong holder or trader in this world if you only rely on possibilities without a knowledge base?",

They can regulate their emotions very well, but if they lose a lot of money or all of their money, their emotions will be out of control, and they will inevitably do something.Therefore, it is recommended to invest rationally and not to invest all your funds.",
