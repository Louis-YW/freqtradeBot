Most of my sports betting choices then i dont go usually below 1.5 oddswhich i do mainly stick into those favorite ones but on the time that i have seen lesser then it would really be giving me some idea on betting into the opposite which is on that underdog which usually it will really be having some nasty odds. There are times which i do really make out some consideration on putting up some bucks whenever i do see some slight chance of winning.In overall it would really be just that depending on you since not all would really be having that kind of intuition and analysis on every match.",

Risky, everything we do here tends to be really risky, so it's not always advisable to place our minds on gambling, or going as far as making gambling as streams of income. Gambling comes with different results, we have no options than to expects the very best from the system, but when the results doesn't go according to plans, we relaxed and gets ready to strive again another day because everyday, we wake up to new opportunities, which we ensured to make good use these opportunities.",

I know the full match prediction pay out is very low but I usually do it because the movement of matches says that which team going to win or loss. I don't do predict in risky matches those type of match to understand who will going to win or loss. The winning money of this type of prediction is small amount but they are there is no that much high risk to lost your predict money. I usually bet big amount of money to get a minimum amount of profit. And I am okay with the small amount winning at the end of month small amount create huge amount of money in the cricket world cup season. I don't know any kind of gambling strategy and I don't following kind of strategy because this type of prediction is not that much hard on watching a match movement that's why I don't follow any kind of strategy.I think because not following any kind of strategy sometime my faces loss but it's okay.",

Sports can be thrilling, not until the last whistle is blown, your ass will be trapped at the edge of the sit, but I like the idea of securing your win when the game is going your way, because not until final whistle is blown anything can still happen. In any game I always prefer to lower my chances of losing my money, and increase the chance of winning, this is why makes sports bet better than others, unless you are blindly betting on matches you have no idea about, my advice is to stick to a particular amount, because at the end of everything, you still need luck to make money from gambling. I don't care about what or which odds you decide to use, you will sometimes lose money and you will some times win money, but make sure you gamble with what you can afford to lose, every gamblers are powerless when it comes to game of luck, do not use gamble as a way to earn a living.",

If the government is benefiting from the people for been poor and deep in poverty then what will they benefit if majority of people are rich? Yet they still allow casinos to run and function in their country, it shows they are smarter than you, people acts like zombies all the time, this is what they believe, they knew that the chances of you getting rich in gambling is super slim, and they start regulating casinos to make money off them too, to the government, gambling is a win win situation for them. It's like what Kiyosaki used to say, keep them poor, start selling them their fantasies, they are making millions off the poor and pretending to give hope onto them if they can take the risk, it's like running a circus, wise the up people, risk only what you can afford.",

Although one advantage is that as we go and watch the game, you can sense as a fans how the games might turn out, if you see the underdog somewhat might pull an upset then you should bet on them.However, as the OP said, it's also not 100% sure win because there's none, even at a bet of 1.05 odds, anything can happen and turn the game around. So I guess knowing the team that you want to bet and seeing that they have the heart to win the game then I will definitely go with them. Again, specially if they are the underdog, it's great to bet on them live and then just watch it and see if your hunch is true or not.",

Like what kind of other bets are worth looking into?Not sure if there is a strategy in live betting, you just have to let's say watch the first half of the game and see who is the better team. Maybe in the pre-game betting team A is the favorite, but when they are playing, it seems that they are struggling and they have a hard time against the underdog team. If that is the case, then betting on the underdog is the best choice.But if the game is very close that the favorite will not have an easy win, I might go and bet on the underdog, not on the ML but as least in the handicap, + side, at least you are shooting two birds with one stone, for example, the underdog didn't win by the favorite wasn't able to cover the handicap, or the underdog pull a upset, so it's a win-win situation for you.",

For instance, as I've been trying to make predictions before matches start in my Greek 2023–24 Super League Predictions & Discussion thread. And you'll see that for example yesterday I made a prediction that a stronger team would naturally win against a weaker opponent (PAOK being stronger against Panetolikos). But if I was playing live I would have been anxious because the first goal was by the weaker team! But of course the result was turned around. So sometimes LIVE betting can turn you more compulsive and reduce your winnings. I think it's harder to utilize it for increased profits instead of betting on common sense before a match begins. It's probably more likely to reduce winnings unless you're extremely calculated and principled.",
