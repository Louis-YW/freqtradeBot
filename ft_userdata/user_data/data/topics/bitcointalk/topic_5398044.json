  "content": "Hey Guys,I am interested in partaking in the \"trade up challenge\"! have seen this done before on the forum, I'm not sure who did it but It was inspiring to me. I am and have always been obsessed with trade and barter. Off the forum its my preferred method of acquiring new interesting things w/ my IG coin page, mainly because its just so much fun and I like using what I have to expand my collection further. I want to trade and trade and trade again and work my way up to something really awesome. That is sort of the idea. When I saw somebody did it with a bitcoin sticker and traded his way up to some Casacious graded coin or something like that it was pretty cool! I got one of these patches from the Guns N Bitcoin conference, and this sealed Arculus card box from the BTC2022 Miami conf that should do well as an initial trade offering. (ITO? lol).       If any of you are interested in making the first trade with me please let me know what you have and feel free to post pics and barter directly on this thread! Or you can PM me directly with your offer but I will be posting all results of trades back in here anyhow (I am completely fine if you wish to remain anonymous). I want everything to be public and in sight so that everyone can see what I end up with. When I saw this done it was just so cool to see how they went from a sticker to a crazy awesome crypto collectible. My intent is not to sell for profit but to add to my collection that I will one day pass on to my children. They have no idea what fun they are in for!Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. Please feel free to forward this over to anyone who may be interested  I'm looking forward to seeing what you all have to trade. Happy HODLING!Cheers, TREAD93Update/FYI: I have 5 sets of these available for trade btw! So I will be accepting 5 different offers for 5 sealed Arculus wallets and 5 of the patches and posting pics of each of the trades once completed. P.s. The retail value (shown on the box) states $99 for the Arculus crypto wallet. They sell at this price on amazon and on their website, however I see them going around the $40-55 and up range on Ebay sealed. The patch I would say like $10 or $15 so maybe like $70 value give or take $10 or 15 bucks. There are really no rules for the trading I will just start off by accepting the best offer I get initially, and I would love to see some options! Ideally some kind of cool crypto note or coin or something along these lines. It could also be non-crypto related too as long as it is something of value and interesting/curious to some extent. So please make any offer you personally would deem fit based on this info. Thanks again.",

I'm already sending you two of those and one of these patches among some other swag just because you were the one who told me about this forum in the first place and since you helped me with that pokemon auction. You should open one for the collection and use the other to trade for something else. I'm pumped for that Alpen coin btw!!",

No worries. I'm the guy who got one of those Bitcoin ATMs and we chatted about that a little bit like a year or so ago. I am here and there on the forum but mostly just keeping an eye. I am hoping to be more involved now and in the future.  Hope you've been well! The Arculus wallets are indeed a crypto storage wallet and they are pretty cool! This one is Bright orangeish gold colored and very appealing to the eye with the Spartan. I feel like these guys have a good shot at sticking around given their wallet handouts at the bitcoin convention and getting their name out there pretty well. They are newer I think but nonetheless a cool collectible to have. I am actually a big fan of junk silver so I would definitely be up for something like that ! I'm sure some other folks would love trading for those too. Perhaps you can trade the junk silver and one other thing crypto related? No matter how small! Just to keep some of the trade crypto related. Lmk if you would like to make an offer =DQuote from: tread93 on May 11, 2022, 01:29:39 PMThat's awesome.
