Any changes to Account Related Settings require password when you want to save changes.

There must be a way to save him.",

You are mean to back up your passwords, so you can always access your account. You can also use a throwaway email provider when creating your account.You can safely create a new account since you were not banned (presumably) and learn how to properly secure your account.",

The OP also registered his account with random email for whatever reason, and of course I don't think he really wants to use this account on regular basis. Then I can say that 3 to 4 months (the bare minimum of active state changes) is long time not to forget random password or any combination password, that's because the OP didn't backup or save them in the browser (probably they should).",

Try go on the settings>save password and check for Bitcointalk.org account info. There’s no way to recover it using bitcointalk feature because it needs password to do any changes on your account settings. Your best chance is to check your browser if you save the data of your account when you login since browser always ask to save password the moment you login using the account that is still not saved.It’s very unusual to forget the password right after you login but I do understand you if you are using too complex password.",

Indeed, this step will make it easier for users to login, but of course it is not safe in the long term, especially if the device is easily accessible by other users.So far I've tried several ways to see how it works to get the OP to get the password, but all of them seem to be useless since normally the browser only asks once at login to save the password or not. So there's no other way, but what's the point of getting the newbie account password since basically the OP could just make more other accounts and leave this one without fuss.",
