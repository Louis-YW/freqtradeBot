If you plan on investing in some crypto HYIP I suggest not doing it. the risk of losing all of your investment to an HYIP scheme is too high just for a chance of \"earning\" profit.Quote from: Heyui67 on April 27, 2023, 07:52:08 PMAnd trustedthis made me laugh, where are you gonna find something that is obviously a scam \"trusted\"?",

I read your post history here in this forum. I assume you have some balance and you want to make an investment for a fixed profit every day. So you may become greedy and fall into the hype / Ponzi scheme. I am warning you don't do this. You will lose everything you have if you do this. Better do trading or invest in the potential high-ranked coin for the long term. Like BTC, ETH, etc. QuoteAnd trustedThere is nothing trusted in HYIP/PONZI SCHEME.",

Be profitable if i choose project with good rateAnd trustedHYIP was never trusted and still isn't. So I am warning everyone not to invest in hyip website. After I came to the crypto world, I saw a lot of hyip websites coming into the market and robbing the investors and running away with their money. The amount of money that the scammers have scammed from the investors by creating the Hyip website will be a huge amount of money. So never invest in such website, rather spend time on your skill development which will be useful in future.",

Be profitable if i choose project with good rateAnd trustedI recommend you to never invest in HYIP ever in your life. All of those are fakes, scams, and frauds and you'll lose everything that you invest in those programs. They are just Ponzi schemes created to loot the money from innocent investors who have less knowledge about investment. They always find such targets who are not tech savvy and who aren't mentally so intelligent. Then they trap those individuals and rob their money without any effort.Their model works in a way that the ones who join them first will get funds as long as they are able to trap new users. Because those scammers pay the old users from the investments of the new users and make them believe that they will earn forever. Once they are out of new users, they will start making excuses. And, suddenly they'll flew away with the money of all the investors. There have been many DAO projects built on that model in previous bull run. The investors thought that they will huge returns from their investments, but the reality was different. Most of the investors have lost their life savings by investing in those projects. That's why I recommend you to keep distance from those HYIP schemes, and if you have money then invest it on good projects only. It's somewhat hard to find good projects in start, but with some efforts you'll be able to dig out all those valuable projects that could multiply your investment safely.",

      "body": "@OP and for everyone who's curious to think that if they'll invest on the \"right\" HYIP will they be okay? There is no right \"HYIP\" and all of them are likely a scam. So, what you're trying to say is if you invest on them there's a chance that you'll get good rate and you'll be safe from the scam ones. Remember of what everyone is saying that most of them are likely scam and the ones that are enticing with good rates are even scarier than what you think because they're there to trick everyone and people like you who's in the middle of thinking of investing on them. Honestly, it's a good thing that you've come to ask about this last month and it's still applicable as many newbies come in here asking for suggestion into this matter. And hopefully that you're reading and those that are gullible, everyone's opinion about the topic. Because if you haven't asked it, there is a possibility that you've followed your heart without thinking and you probably fell for an HYIP already and will cry out soon that you've been scammed.",

So, these investments are worse than gambling, never waste money on these sites. Instead, consider spending that money on your favorite games, and you will enjoy those few minutes.These are pure scam services.
