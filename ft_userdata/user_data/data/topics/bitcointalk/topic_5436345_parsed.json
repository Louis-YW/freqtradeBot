  "content": "I have been observing a certain key lock symbol on some posts or thread created. It appears after some days on a post before such a post disappears. I have been bearing it in my heart to ask for sometime now, as I do think in my opinion that it means the post is either old, that such posts or thread have stayed more than a day or two or longer, it is getting boring comments, it is not forum worthy or for another reason I may have not thought out. So, my question really is, why does a post or thread get locked in this forum?What are some criteria(do's or don'ts), that makes a posts or thread get locked?Is it a good thing to have some posts or thread locked?",

This is usually combined with it being stickied.Can be locked by the creator if they have gotten their answer.Can be locked by the user if the discussion has become extensive and run out its relevance.Can be locked by scammers who does not want other members to point out their scam attempt.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on January 22, 2023, 10:46:58 AMWhat are some criteria(do's or don'ts), that makes a posts or thread get locked?Do not create a spam megathread. If you have gotten your answer, lock the thread yourself, or it would be reported to the moderators.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on January 22, 2023, 10:46:58 AMIs it a good thing to have some posts or thread locked?Yes if it fits any of point 1 above.

      "body": "I will add. A topic can be locked, even with multiple posts. This often occurs when the same news is distributed throughout the forum at almost the same time. The one with the most comprehensive coverage and the earliest creation will have the advantage.Furthermore, you, the OP, can request that the moderators report it to them and close the topic for a reason. Often, topics are closed when some spammers decide to resurrect old and uninteresting topics.",

Having said that, when moderators lock threads, we know it is because the thread is now redundant and being used to spam posts, but when a user locks a thread, it might be for a reason we wouldn't be able to decipher.",

I also don't get a reason why you should leave it open once you've got what you want, i.e the answers you need.Some duplicate topics can be removed, while some are locked by OP or mod. You can lock your thread because you want to prevent spam, and that's some good advice when you create a thread. Case in point: Once you've got all the answers you need in this thread, then it's also recommended that you lock the thread.",
