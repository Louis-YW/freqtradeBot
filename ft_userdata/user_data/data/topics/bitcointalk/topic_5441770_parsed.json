Also i'm wondering how many scammers theymos has banned over the years i know the answer i'm afraid other people telling and \"warning\" others  by telling them this user is a scammer is NOT enough i feel  and they should be banned if it's clear as day  that  this person is a scammer however this doesn't happen here it seems shame",

How would you repay it?You are looking for a loan for almost 1 year now. In that time , if you had worked, you would have made at least 20x that money.How can any lender seriously expect their money back. You obviously don't work, otherwise you would not say \"really need the money\" . Even a kid with a summer job would have made that amount easy, so what's your excuse?",
