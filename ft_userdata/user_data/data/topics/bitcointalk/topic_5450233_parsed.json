Even in esport betting (football) you didn't just start a day before jumping into it, at least you developed time for it by constantly watching football and matches before you know some popular teams to bet or not to bet, my best advise is that you should get DStv dish installed and subscribe to those channels, maybe within just 3 to 9 months you would understand how it works because even though you being told how to bet it i don't think all things would be capture since is not something you started from the onset. I think there are other threads that says about boxing you can develop interest by reading them here.",

This sports is physical and the result can be overturned in a split second with one lucky punch/kick.I only bet on fighter that I know very the fighting skills. It’s very hard to become updated to all the fighters. Concentrating on your favorite fighter will make analysis easier for you. You can bet on your fighter or bet on the opponent if you knew exactly his skills. You can easily predict if he is in advantage or disadvantage. Just bet using your brain and by your heart. Being biased will give you a problem on choosing the right pick since this is a physical sports.",

Although not that necessary if you really want to like it, start from checking odds, lowers odds are given to better boxers and be consistent in checking the winners in the gambling site which I think is enough if you are consistent with that.After some times have passed, you will have experience and you will be able to know the better boxer to bet on.Very important to be checking some site statistics and analysis and predictiona too, it will help.",

So with interest, little information from different research source on the internet you can ask your relatives and friends on more knowledge. You also have to visit game houses, keep friends with gamblers. They say \" birds of a feather flock together\"",

I think yes!Depending on how he takes it serious, actually I wasn't good in sports most especially football but sometimes I began to develop interest  what do I do at this point?I noticed I can't be going out of my house to seat out there watching matches and learning how those matches are being played all I did was to go get Gotv and install in my house thinking that would be the best, after few months a friend of mine came in and said you need to upgrade to DStv for me to be carrying all matches along that gotv only Carry's some highlights and few matches. At this point what do I do, I went out go get a DStv dish and installed presently now I watches most of the live matches and I understand more better than the way it was. I can bet and place my favorite team to win or not.",

It is funny because DSTV is only available to African countries.What I know is that it is what you know that you will want to gamble with, gamblers have that mentality. But actually it is not like that because gamblers that do not use to watch certain sport may still be able to learn from gambling site and prediction sites. I think a year of checking the gambling sites and predictions sites and using only the money you can afford to learn with and not bothering about losing will all be exciting.Use just little amount of money to gamble and have the fun. Avoid addiction.",

In your case if you had not developed interest you wouldn't have moved out to better your viewing experience and knowledge on the games to better your gambling. Most gamblers I know don't have any of the luxury of staying at home to watch and bet whether soccer or boxing matches, they go out to gambling houses, hangout at bars or drinking places and visit sites to get a better analysis from even other people, I'm talking about real and chronic gamblers and not spontaneous gambling.So interest is important because it is what sustains a gambler to continue after losing and of course the reason a gambler continues to play apart from chasing his losses is interest.",

Just watch, and keep watching. If you think you've seen enough, go watch some more. Interest in sports come from seeing it once, knowledge of it comes from watching it a LOT of times imo. You don't even need to be able to participate or play it, just watching should be more than enough, just that it's going to take a LOT of watching imo. As for news about a specific sport, well, that comes from where you really want to get to know about them, I'd say find your own really so that it can suite your actual needs. You don't need a satellite dish to be able to get latest news, having access to the internet is more than good enough imo.",

They are always giving updates regarding news related to most of the sports. Also, if it is boxing, you may follow your biased foghters to know more of them if you really want to be that updated 'coz for sure you won't be betting to all foghts, you'd be choosing only those you would want to. In terms of basketball, NBA is now on playoffs therefore teams would be limited only to a specific number wherein you can follow as well their page franchise to be updated. Bottomline is, social media platform is a wide space and is providing more updates than with the TV nowadays. Only choose those who has credentials to acoid misinformations.",
