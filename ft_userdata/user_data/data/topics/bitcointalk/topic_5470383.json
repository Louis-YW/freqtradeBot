  "content": "This report did not only mention a base case price target of $682,800 on 2030 for bitcoin, it also mentioned a bearish case target of $258,500 and a bullish case price target of $1.48 million.This prediction might be more closer to occur in reality than Michael Saylor's prediction, I reckon. However, Ark Invest's bullish case price target should be backed by eating a human organ on national television by the CEO hehehehe.CEO of Ark Invest Cathie WoodSource https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Big_Ideas/ARK%20Invest_Presentation_Big%20Ideas%202023_FINAL_V2.pdf",

      "body": "Very nice and I hope so, if possible the bullish scenario of 1.48 million but the truth is that Cathie has no fucking idea what bitcoin will be worth in 2030, so I take this prediction as any other. The price of bitcoin will continue to grow both because it will be increasingly appreciated and because fiat currencies will continue to devalue, but getting the exact figures right 7 years out is very difficult no matter what data you analyse or what predictive model you use.",

In addition, when I see that someone is speculating about the price of BTC and also gives a specific price that is not rounded for some reason, it convinces me even more that they are pulling these numbers out of a hat, and not from some serious analysis.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422764.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5389589.0",

Of course this prediction is still too far away, we are now looking from one side for the next cycle in 2024 and in 2025 which will be more speculation said with their expectations maybe they will tell the truth, while some readers seeing this news will think it is a little wild.",

Sure, it would be great for them if Bitcoin saw such massive price increases and I think part of the reason they make these statements is to try and get other fund managers to join them and help fulfill the prophecy. Will they be successful? We will find out in the near future.",

Yes you can estimate that the coin will go up in price in future, but thinking of 2030 is still a lot. We might see 2 bull runs in the between if I am not wrong. And many things can happen in these. We might see Bitcoins crossing more than the amount mentioned above or Bitcoins collapsing. So consider and predict for 2024 first. Let’s hope for the best.",

We would have seen a halving of the expected price before it was reached, but it is still not persuasive enough to make this prediction real or even close to it. I'll just assume that this is one of many predictions analysts make regarding bitcoin prices in the years to come.",

It's just that it hasn't reached the target they predicted.However, the fantastic predictions of experts are able to motivate investors, especially new investors. Because fantastic price predictions in the future or the next few years make them tempted to jump into Bitcoin, and they must know that Bitcoin is a very promising long-term investment, not because of expert predictions.",

If it gets there I would be more than happy. If it goes to the v bullish side prediction I would be over the moon.I was kind of thinking do we pick more conservative numbers/goals/results so when they get smashed the physiological feeling of accomplishment is greater/easily attained. \"Oh i totally got a D in that exam. Gets results and got a B\"",

When it comes to numbers then sky is the limit, everyone could really make out their own predictions without minding neither its already that unrealistic.We've seen couple of peronsalities,institutions,companies sharing up their $1M insight towards price.https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-1000000-timeline/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-prediction/https://cryptoticker.io/en/michael-saylor-bitcoin-prediction-btc-price-will-reach-10-million/#google_vignetteAnd adding this one which these predictions are indeed that non realistic. For newbies out there then it would not really be that right on making yourself thatgetting fomo with these predictions. Always stick on something which is realistic and something attainable because if you do make yourself that anticipating with those highnumbers but you've been able to face up way too far then this is where frustation and disappointment would really be kicking in.",

This is the FOMO that crypto officials or activists continue to do, the FOMO that continues to appear indicates that Bitcoin will be bullish. But this still doesn't make sense.We'll take another look at some of the wild predictions that have emerged from important figures in crypto.Is this just the beginning of the Big Bullish that will happen to Bitcoin?

I wonder how many people will sell between 69k - 88k proclaiming profit but in actuality losing money",
