Both meat and cheese are animal products that take quite some time to produce. You need to feed the chicken, pig or cow before you can take the eggs, milk or slaughter them. That is why environmental friendly diets limit the consumption of meat to 1-2 per week. It would be much easier if people eat more plant based diets and less animal products. Having some cereals in the morning, rice with vegetables for lunch and only bread or a salad for dinner would make it easier for the world to produce enough food for everybody. However, we can't force people what to eat, it's not realistic and shouldn't be the focus of politics. Instead it would help to teach people how much work and energy is needed to make certain type of food. The world should have no problem to produce enough food for everybody, it just might not be steaks and burgers for everybody.",

Is it available in the market for sale? People make money to eat and survive. If you don't make money, you won't be able to buy food. Food is essential for the human body to keep it powered. Or you may say vitamins that are available in foods. If we can eat vitamins and we can live without eating foods, then be it. This is not like that. Those medicines cost huge, and you cannot afford them every day. That's why you eat food to keep yourself alive. Sometimes we eat food for good taste and treat ourselves. But, you cannot enjoy it with medicines.",

There is up to millions of foods to choose from in this world, I think it would be insane to go through one by one. Just look at the typical Chinese cruisine, and it is jaw droppingly full of variations.Quote...However, we can't force people what to eat, it's not realistic and shouldn't be the focus of politics...no comments... it is up to readers to decide.Quote...Instead it would help to teach people how much work and energy is needed to make certain type of food...Again, they are too complex indeed, there isn't one size fit all answer to the issues. Some food has very high CO2 footprint, some has very low CO2 footprint, it is absurd to completely go for the best one out of two options.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on July 29, 2023, 02:01:25 PM...how much those pills cost? Is it available in the market for sale? It cost ten grand to make just enough for a person!! Joke aside, the pill is typically a compressed form of diet found on the food table, they are highly dehydrated to reduce the total weight massively, however you won't find anything such as gold or diamond in the pill itself which is super rare and high priced commodity, they are typically  proteins, fats, some soluble fibers, mostly starch, and a bit tad of multi-vitamins. It can be very cheap to manufacture in a big volume, but expensive in very small volume.Quote...People make money to eat and survive...we must eat to our heart content!Quote...This is not like that. Those medicines cost huge, and you cannot afford them every day.yup, it is not only unaffordable, a longterm side effect would be very ugly too, many astronaut after return to the earth have all sort of healthy issues due to exposing to cosmic radiations.",

Yes, they take some vitamins and minerals as a supplement in pill form, but that is not all they eat. Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, eat three meals a day, and it is pretty much the same food they would have on Earth, just tweaked a bit for practicality and safety reasons. (You know, it is not easy slurping chicken soup with a spoon in a zero-gravity environment.)",

People who do little to no work need little food. If they eat more than they need the foods will be passed out from the rear end or/and stored in the body as fat.* Note that Work equals (=) Solving problems. The more problems you solve the more food you need. And working isn't necessarily physical activities even though it is very important. Maybe excersing should compensate for lack of that. And exercising is also working, though abit selfish because it solves problem for self",
