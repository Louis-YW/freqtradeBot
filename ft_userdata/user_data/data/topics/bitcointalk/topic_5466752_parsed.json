  "content": "Hi everyone!I have a problem with duckdice.io. They asked for KYC through a 3d party when I asked to take out from them my 237 usdt. They sent me a link where I had to fill my passport details, take a photo of the passport and then a selfie of myself. I did this with 100% accuracy (I checked them very well) but even if my passport and selfie was ok (so the program would acknowledge that I'm genuine) it says that do not match with the details I put (why I had to put wrong details ?!). I had once the same problem with the same 3d party system on the site Cazinozer, but they told me to send my passport and other documents and they approved them. I'm asking duckdice.io to do the same, manually check my documents but they are refusing to do that and they are not even responding to my emails anymore. For me i'ts 100% scam practice. And when responding they are not very welcoming on their customer service.https://imgur.com/a/8JjxQzW",

If so, I am glad it is solved and appreciate you mark it as solved. If you don't mind, please also lock this thread to close it for good and avoid unnecessary bumping and spamming post.
