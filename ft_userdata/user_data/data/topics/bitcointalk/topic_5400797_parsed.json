There are a lot of tokens on the market that have a higher price than you mentioned above. Please write more details, so we may check more details. Keep in mind, even if that token or coin is not worth it to you but is worth it to other investors that are the reason why this price reflects. People still buy or sell at that price.",

Even more, since Bitcoin price goes up, some altcoins (most) will also go up.This topic may be more appropriate for Altcoins section.",

A thing having a lower price tag doesn't automatically mean it's cheap and that it's going to reach dollar levels. Also take note of the total supply.",

The truth is that the price of a coin is the last thing you must watch, you need to at first take a very deep look on its fundamentals, and only once you are convinced that the coin in which you want to invest is any good then you can consider if the price you are seeing right now is a good entry point for you.",

Bitcoin is an appreciating asset in the long term, so whatever you invest today should be worth more in the long term. That's assuming you believe in the long term appreciation of Bitcoin.Any other altcoin is basically gambling your money away.Also, don't be fooled by a cheap price. You can buy fractions of Bitcoin.Have a look at this chart to give you a better idea of how divisible Bitcoin is:https://usdsat.comOne Bitcoin is 100 million sats.

Similar to how cents and dollars refer to the same currency, but in different quantities.This is correct, newbies see what kind of increase in price bitcoin had through its history and they come to two conclusions, that even if bitcoin grew at an incredible pace such a pace cannot be had anymore, and since this is the case they may as well invest in altcoins as the they believe an altcoin can achieve the same kind of growth, however what they do not see are the incredible risks this decisions carries, so at least at the beginning all newbies should start their journey with bitcoin, as a way to protect themselves from those risks until they understand what they are doing.",

If you want to invest in a currency, the current price is only the smallest detail of what you have to consider when deciding whether to buy or not. I would go on and on giving you explanations but it seems to me that I am going to waste my time. Just search the internet for 'how to invest' or something like that and refine your search.Current price in isolation from everything else doesn't indicate anything.",

Don't invest based on hype, check its whitepaper first if it has real developers and roadmap for their project.It has a real developer because the coin was already created. If what you mean is about identity, it is easy for projects with anonymous and fake teams to scam because they won't be traced out easily but there are also projects that are proudly presented their real names and pictures though some of them still didn't succeed but that was fine as long as they didn't scam anyone and they are honest about their intentions.People will already understand and accept that it was their fault on trusting that project. We cant say that a coin will have a high appreciation rate because they keeps on fluctuating unless if he is talking about something like staking where you can earn stable returns but I will still be careful on this one.",
