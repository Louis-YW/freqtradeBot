I will download the wallet and test the coin later.Well the Pepe coin was nice...Im always looking for coins what can make gains.Im interested to see how high this price will If this one following to real btc price then Im interested to know how fast and how it can go.If people see first 5000$ 15000$ price then start getting interested not before most of people never buy coins when they are cheap it's like the hunan nature before they choose something they wait like validation or confirmation from the other people.It's human nature to move together with masses.My method to invest will be not when everything is expensive i'll choose low prices.If i invest like 5$ in some cheap coins to 50 of them Even If one those Will go high ....Im winner.As always the case here Same thing the bitcoinbrother token is just not that expensive that most of people want it.",
