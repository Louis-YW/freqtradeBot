  "content": "Bull RunI have been hearing Bull run in Cryptocurrency and I have been trying to equip myself so as to profit from the market. The Last Crypto Bull run started around May 2020 and continued to early 2021 which ended with Bitcoin price doubling in all time high at $69,000. If you have been around you will notice the 4-year cycle series (From the bottom of the previous cycle to the bottom of the next). A crypto bull run may be on the rising or super far away still so you may not want to be cut unaware. The bear market is already in and stabilizing it found a support around $15,000 (Nov. 2022). From that point there is upward prize trajectory on long term chart. It is unlikely but not impossible to see a drop back down to those bear market low levels of $15,000. If it drops it also creates opportunity for investors. Here are some Essential steps to take;Get equip with knowledge: Educating oneself will help make inform decision. Here I will like to use this medium to appeal to those that have solid knowledge to share with us and provide us with useful information and link.Stay Up to Date: You need to know the optics of crypto regulations this days and how it will affect the crypto market globally.

If ever you would be finding some selling opportunity then you could really easily make out such outright decision and same goes on buying opportunity too.Always recommendable on setting out goals and targets in regards to your investment on which selling point or level should be set out and since we know that not allare really that willing to hold like forever then its always recommended that you should be setting one.Quote from: Medusah on October 12, 2023, 08:35:41 PMCannot believe it has been more than 3 years since the time we broke the $10,000 for the second time.  Time flies.  Which strong hands have left?  Raise your hand and join the next ride.   Lots had been shaked but ended up on buying on higher price considering that the price is starting to climb up now.",

Please do well to contribute and share your knowledge on this subject of discuss. My contribution to the discussion topic is to start applying a DCA strategy to your bitcoin investments or to start amassing bitcoin at a cheap price as bitcoin's price declines while you continue to wait for the bull run to occur within the next year or so. Avoid trying to wait until it drops much before you begin to consider investing in bitcoin. The longer you wait, the green candlelight might pick up and you may be forced to buy bitcoin at a high price due to FOMO. Since there are less than 200 days until the halving season, you and I have no idea when bitcoin's price will increase or drop, let alone by how much. Instead of waiting for the significant decline in the price of Bitcoin, use the opportunity to invest what little money you have.",

The advice has always been that investors should invest what they think they can risk, but despite this advice, I would love to add that any Bitcoin investor who only puts in a small amount of capital into a Bitcoin investment should only expect a little profit too. A bitcoin investment is like other investments, in which the value of your profit will depend on the volume of your capital.",

Have a target length of investment so that you will not be affected whatever the price action since you already have a goal to focus.We already have a clear pattern which bull run always come at some point of the cycle. I think it’s better capitalized on it by loading a lot of Bitcoin until we reach the long term target. Let’s ignore small price action and focus on long term price. There’s nothing to be prepared if you are a long term holder. The living proof on this strategy are those who bought Bitcoin 10 years ago and just recently sold their holdings. We can do that too since we are still on the early phase of the real Bitcoin cycle.",

A crypto bull run may be on the rising or super far away still so you may not want to be cut unaware.  That is the journey that Bitcoin will continue to experience, where there will be times for correction and after that it will experience gradual recovery. The four-year cycle is a series that makes people believe that the price of bitcoin will increase significantly. For some people who have been investing in bitcoin for a long time, conditions that can influence the market to experience correction or conditions that can influence the market towards the green line cannot always be predicted accurately.Quote from: RioBlemz on October 12, 2023, 07:44:12 PMDetermine your investment Objective: Setting clear goals will definitely affect your portfolio decision. Clear objectives are necessary. Someone who doesn't have a plan definitely doesn't have a concept and target to achieve. It is necessary to set clear goals in order to influence the impact of the portfolio and if someone does not have a plan it will definitely be difficult to achieve all of them.Quote from: RioBlemz on October 12, 2023, 07:44:12 PMSet Your Risk Tolerance: Are you looking for short term or long term opportunities. The potential rewards in the crypto market are high so as the risk factor. Never invest what you cannot loose but for Bitcoin leaving it for a longer period will earn you profit.  Risks can be minimized when someone is involved in Bitcoin and how to do this by knowing the correct investment concepts. Long term and short term are two good things to apply, but long term is one of the investment targets that many people apply to produce maximum profits and most importantly, invest according to what you can be responsible for because life is not just about investment.",

That's not a problem as long as they're able to sell at profit and no need to reach the peak because that's the hardest part to determine.And this is the same when someone panic sells, they're out of their minds because what they're following is not their minds but their hearts with fear. We can't blame them for that because it's either that will be the first time that they're into the market.Because those that have been here for a long time won't do the same mistake that they've done before and that includes me.",

And each year things significantly change so we can't use the past to speculate about the future like before.For example by all speculation bitcoin price should have been in 6 digits by now but we are still stuck below $30k simply because of the very wild global economy that is experiencing lots of disruptions while struggling with both inflation and recession at the same time.",

And hopefully, you can have a lot of Bitcoin from now on so that you are ready if the price of Bitcoin suddenly starts to increase.If not, you should keep trying to be able to buy more Bitcoin. Otherwise, you may miss out on making profits during a bull market. And many altcoins will increase drastically too but unfortunately, we don't have a clear clue which altcoins will increase.Only Bitcoin that we predict can increase very high and exceed its last ATH price before the halving or even after the halving. So you focus more on collecting Bitcoins from now on. And if the market declines significantly again later, you get the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a lower price. So use that time.",

So I just think that continuing to buy is a viable option and it's not bad for everyone rather than hoping for something that is still less certain to happen in the near future. Although actually I still quite believe in the bulls, just not this year because everyone has seen how slow price movements in Bitcoin are so the possibility of a bull in the near future is more or less unlikely to happen.",
