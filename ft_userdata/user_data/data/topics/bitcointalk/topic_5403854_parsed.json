The two domains mentioned in the article looks very very Similar.Nothing can beat human brain. Trading bots can make couple of profitable trades based on certain market conditions but there's no guarantee that it will work under every situation. So it is always better to stay out of such shady websites and platforms claiming unrealistic outcomes.",

I hope you never deposit anything to such a site. If they can give me one sample where a crypto trading bot made 250 USD to 1 Million dollar and I will take everything back but I am 100 % you they can't  give that example. Also I don't see the point in this giant picture that you posted",

A bot can certainly make profit from trading some particular asset but overtime they always end up as just another scam. $250 to $1M is very unrealistic to even consider investing with such investment platform.",

Nowadays there are youtube giveaways where Vitalik or Elon are giving you free coins, you just have to send them some of your coins and you'll get more back. Let's not forget about those sites that mine for you or generate passive income, but you have to buy upgrades for the site to do it faster.

I do not equate all tools when the main problem is the user, and they have the right to choose them.

Because by simple logic if the company would be making so much money with the bot itself why will it need to sell the bot to make money? Or maybe it will go to a bigger institution to sell them the same bot and get big price for that. So it's a clear rule for life that such a thing will always be a scam.",

Nothing new here, the same scam strategy and technique though it is not adding AI to the mix so it can fool more.

Three categories of persons still fall victim to these sort of scams;- the naïve persons who happen to just be very enthusiastic about crypto and how they can profit from it.These set of persons already have a developed interest in bitcoin maybe due to positive testimonials they have heard about crypto, as a result, if they lack proper guidance they make themselves vulnerable. Some of this persons go as afar as sending a message to the so called customer care asking how they can join and hoping to know it is legit. The scammers knowing that this person is naïve will capitalize on that and just have to convince them enough for them to get started.- the set of person who underestimate how far scammers can go to achieve their aim.Some people never believe that scammers are very intelligent people that are devising new means daily, when they see some sophistication, they assume that ''scammers can't do this\", they can't come this far, and that mindset usually always cost them a lot. As a matter of fact some individuals are currently invested in some such ponzi website without them knowing because they have the ideology that scammers do not have the organization to put such together.- the greedy.These category do not think well when they see or hear the promise of money/profit. They do not consider the ridiculous gains promised by these scammers, they are all about their personal interest/profit and that blocks rational thinking.",
