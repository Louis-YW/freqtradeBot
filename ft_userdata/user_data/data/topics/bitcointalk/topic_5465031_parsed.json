But they're completely passive on social media, in fact the last time they published a weekly report was on June 16 referring to their Twitter account. Not only you having problems with this project, I even saw someone having a problem but Lang Yu (Bytom CEO) didn't give any response regarding the problem he was facing, you can see it in this Telegram chat.",

I know sometimes to sync via wallets is really slow, and most the time we just download the block and add it to the wallet file.The only problem, they're not provided the data right now. Maybe, asking from user on (Reddits) they can provided some.",

So, the coin still live because most of exchange (in-case there has some mined block problem/ wallet update) they will put the coin into hold.Reddits always a good place to ask these things.",
