  "content": "I have been following the trending story of Brazilian footballer's involvement in alleged sexual assault. with no disrespect, we all know that with the level of fame attached to football as a career one can get any class of woman, local and international. It now brings about the question why then do they get involved in such act? I know we all have individual differences, morally, mentally, socially, and otherwise. But exposure should teach us what's morally wrong or right. The case of Dani Alves, the most decorated men's footballer now takes a wrong twist in history, as he's been sentenced to 18years  in jail for Rape.",

It doesn’t matter if it’s a footballer, a music star or a mail man. There are sadly just bad people in many parts of life.I hope victims of any crimes like this can recover physically & mentally. I hope the offenders get suitable jail time & karma gets them.",
