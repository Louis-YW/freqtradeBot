I wasn't even certain by then so I'd just make enquiries. I'm willing now as i have reached him via pm few minutes ago and I'm just hoping for his response tomorrow.Cheers,Sandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

I'm sure whomever decides to loan you would have the same question.No, you shouldn't be curious. I have a reputation to protect (believe that if you want) unless yunno the better. I can't waste a whole year growing an account just to ruin it for some neg tags as a defaulter.I made it explicit that anyone would understand; I'm not planning to acquire a loan because I joined a campaign ( you can see the quote above, that I had an intention about a month ago) I only used that method cus I knew people have trust issues and it'll be a bit, more clear and easy to trust that process.I could acquire a loan without actively being in a sig campaign.Please, if you don't want to, then you don't have to. it's all your choice, after all, no one would build a bunch of trust on anyone without certifying their trustworthiness which is ascertained by a trail.Look, trust isn't meant to be compelled. I'd leave a day or two for anyone to decide wether or not to cut a deal but, if no one does, I'll simply lock the thread and stay cool.ThanksSandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

I can't waste a whole year growing an account just to ruin it for some neg tags as a defaulter.In my country, in a rural area, small loans are given by many small organizations, banks, etc. When they give a loan, they always consider whether the borrower has any source of income to pay back the loan. They provide loans who have a job in most cases.You have shared Signature Campaign income to pay back the loan. yahoo62278 was pointing out that if you get removed from the signature campaign, how would you pay back the loan? This is a very simple point of view from all the lenders of course.",
