  "content": "Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency, which first released as an open-source software in 2009 but didn't reach public attention. Now, crypto education becomes a priority for world-class education institutions such as University of the Cumberlands (United Kingdom), University of the West of England (United Kingdom), University of Toronto (Canada), University of Warwick (United Kingdom), University of Waterloo (Canada), University of Westminster (United Kingdom), etc. Learning cryptocurrency will attract you towards the digital world and internet technology. It will prepare you for the future, since digital world is here to stay, and technology is progressing and evolving rapidly.Is it time for the whole world to embrace, adapt, add it in educational curriculum and teach cryptocurrency to the youth?",

Open up a college or institute to crypto and the neighbors don't even know there is something called BTC.Dude agreed youth need be educated for the Crypto...ButAwareness is the First step and Education second step.",

Cryptocurrency is now spread like a net across the globe. You notice that people are more opportunistic towards cryptocurrencies nowadays than in the past. Because more and more people are trying to learn something modern, cryptocurrency has come to a stage now which is just attracting people. People will slowly come to the technology dependent stage where Only technical work will be done. Finally I would like to say that Bitcoin is now spread like a net around the world.",

After he dotcom bubble the big macro investors were already seeking where the development of technology will head and they were speculating AI and robotics will be developed further where we can see flying cars but surprisingly the rise of Blockchain technology made them wrong.Yup. Cryptocurrency is always linked to Blockchain and can be in taught in school universities for new innovators to explore.",

But is there a program there or in any of the universities the op listed that it specifically dedicated to cryptos, Blockchain or Bitcoin? Can you major in it or get a degree in it? If not, then I wouldn't call crypto education a priority of these institutions, as a course (or even several courses) is a very small thing if we consider how many courses there are per program, how many faculties there are etc. But there are bits of crypto education that are becoming available at the level of higher education in various countries around the world, I'd agree with that.",

I think the idea of crypto is somehow related to Economics, I agree to that. Yet I think the point is to make a separate academic education about it so that the specific idea of crypto might discuss and introduce. And yes, one of the most thing needed is the material. We all know that Crypto is under the idea of modern technology, so we think that it is best to learn under modern technology but I think the point also is to have a very unique and effective way of teaching crypto and have a lot of different ways of teaching it so that people might have a lot of ways to learn depends on what suits them. Crypto have a such big impact to us right now. And I knew a lot of people who have at least make their own life good because of it.",
