As long as you are not banning what is right/good, or banning the shows for showing what is right. For example it's right to stop TV shows for promoting false god(small letter g for false god) but wrong to stop them from promoting True GOD who actually exists and created you and the Earth you live in.Besides, many people do not realize that leader/president are regularly punished(both divinely & by people) for erring in judgement or breaking a just law. They can't just do whatever they want else they are punished.If you really love your country/people you will be very careful not to do things that bring problems to the country, due to the head being corrupt or weak.",

This is absolutely disgusting and shouldn’t be allowed anywhere in the world. I do not believed this whole thing about being reformed when it comes to this behavior. There are so many sex offenders in our neighbors who are not registered. Oh here’s one that I find heinous, the ones that get away and do not get prosecuted. I truly believe sex offenders should not be in the human society.",
