  "content": "the company, led by twitter founder Jack Dorsey, has been working on the product for two years. Right from the start, it chose a community-based approach and asked for feedback several times via twitter, among other things. the development also follows an open-source approach and thus illustrates the transparency of the project.Block has now informed the community about the progress of its planned hardware wallet in a blog post. the company is working on an open source hardware wallet and is now looking for new partners for the further steps of the project.https://wallet.build/helping-customers-move-between-fiat-and-bitcoin-how-well-build-with-partners-to-bring-more-people-to-self-custody/thus, according to the blog post, the goal is \"to build a Bitcoin wallet that will enable the next 100 million people to truly own and manage their own money with Bitcoin.\" at the same time, the new product aims to make self-storage easier than ever before. prerequisites for the partnership are that the companies have global and regional reach, product experience and transparency. Block opted for a quality-before-quantity approach. this means that only the best regional partners are considered for the company.so far, there is no official release date for the hardware wallet. however, since Block regularly informs the community about the project's progress, it can be assumed that the release date will also be announced sufficiently in advance.and that was my intention to create this thread to allow various discussions about this new hw-wallet",
