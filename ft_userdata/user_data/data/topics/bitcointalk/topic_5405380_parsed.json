  "content": "The Avalanche price could range between $15 and $20 in the upcoming weeks. The Avalanche could reach $30 if the bulls gain control of the market. However, the price could increase due to the numerous Avalanche developments. The cost of Avalanche could increase if the team adds more products to the network.How far Avalanche deviates from its current $17 stability point will depend on a variety of factors. Avalanche is still a very strong coin to watch this year despite this. On the other hand, the Avalanche's price performance is very reliant on the level of inflation. The price of the avalanche could decrease even further if the FED increases interest rates. This is because the bearish market has overwhelmed the Avalanche ecosystem.As a result, the price of Avalanche continues to fluctuate.In the event of a crypto broker default, AVAX's price would immediately drop to $9.29. Investors will quickly withdraw their funds, but they will have trouble getting cash because there is less buy-volume because households have less disposable income to invest in that asset class. In order to fill their sell orders, investors will therefore start to sell below the current price, setting off a spiral move that could easily break below the monthly S1 and even enter the danger zone near $0.source :- coingabbar . com",

      "body": "If ever Avalanche will fall to $16 we should also consider Bitcoin for it, for sure if Avalanche will fall to that, Bitcoin for sure is trading below $19,000.But I am not hoping for it. Seems most of the top altcoins these days are following the Bitcoin move. If you can see that the Bitcoin dominance is becoming stable which for me is very choppy and expect more sideways to the market.",

It looks like it is not going to be that much of a weird questions to ask when we are considering the fact that the market looks a bit more lively these days. If the market goes this lively then it is going to be fine and we are not going to be super shocked when the prices hit bigger levels.Do not pick the coins individually and wonder where they will go, because the coins do not go individually, they do not move up or down without the market. If the whole market goes up, then \"the whole market\" goes up, if they go down then they go down. This means that we shouldn't really be worried about avax or sol to move here and there, it will be together with all.",

AVAX has many strong supporters and a good ecosystem, so this project will not die easily.Just based it on the technical support and resistance. It still far from that price range and also avax has a lot og supporters and whale holders. Its not gonna fall down like what luna did with such issue. Regarding 3ac maybe they did dumped their avax but even so, it was replaced by some new players and retailers. The more the merrier and its good one of the vc unload their bags now and more people could accumulate and used the supply than simply whales hoarding.",

AVAX has many strong supporters and a good ecosystem, so this project will not die easily.Nothing is simple in here. Even btc which is popular already are also struggling hard to recover so how much more the other coins? No one knows if avax can go that low but if ever it did then maybe what you are saying can occur because we can not deny that avax is also making a name in this industry like its other competitors like solana and polkadot.In the event, it further drops to 5 usd then maybe more buying volume is going to be seen because that price is already a bargain for one of the top coins on this market. Investing is gambling but not like when you invest in meme coins and other more riskier coins. They are the real definition of gambling.",

I hope that in November the AVAX coin returns to the ATH price again and along with other altcoinsI think it has something to do with Bitcoin being bullish in the last couple of weeks, and the Ethereum testnet was very successful, the snowball effect has been felt, and every other coins are very much bullish in the short term.And it seems that this will continue up to the next month, when the full merger of Ethereum will be rolled out and be successful. Avax might be the recipient and could go above $30++. If you will have to check the price right now, it's close to $30 already, so very good for investors.",

The last time I check it just below that price, and now to be just $28.17 as per coinmarketcap.Although bitcoin and ethereum is somewhat down, bitcoin can't reach $25k and then ethereum $2k.If this prime movers gets over their respective resistance, for sure majority of the altcoin will follow that price movement including Avax.",
