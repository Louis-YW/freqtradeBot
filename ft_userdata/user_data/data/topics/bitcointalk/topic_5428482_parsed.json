Sometimes it's hard to understand what he means and his short-worded tweets can lead to confusion among readers. In the end, Musk is a shrewd investor who knows how to play the game. He's smart enough to realize when he needs to make a few sacrifices for the greater good. At the same time, this Twitter incident has given us some great insight into how Musk's mind works. That alone might make it worth it.",

I can understand that if the stock dropping for Tesla since Twitter is in the hands of musk. Musk is not like by everyone especially the bitcoiners so they don't know what he will use Twitter for or against bitcoin. The way that musk is sacking old workers also can bring more people to dislike and withdraw stocks they have in Tesla. It is a lot of reasons we think about for that. It is a challenge he need to go on that but if he stable Twitter with good policy he will gain confidence back and Tesla share will start appreciating.",

A month ago I also had time to read a bit of news in the local media where Elon Musk said that he was not disclosing more information about Tesla's future. But regarding cheap cars, Musk said it was thinking about it. \"I can't talk about Tesla's future. But we do think about making more vehicles for less money than we do,\" Musk said. [Reference]",

      "body": "The Tesla stock price dropping has little to do with the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk.Tesla is viewed as a high tech company by the investors, rather than an automobile company. The big tech companies are facing big decline in their market cap. A recession is coming and many people won't be able to afford expensive Electric Vehicles. The revenue of Tesla will go down.I'm still perplexed by the fact that many people consider Elon Musk to be a genius. He's not a genius and he isn't even a good businessman.Tesla and SpaceX weren't successful because of Musk. They were successful because of the engineering teams and the government support. Paypal wasn't successful because of Musk. His weird side projects, like \"The Boring Company\" are turning into a failure. I still don't know why this guy has become the richest person on the planet. He is basically the biggest oligarch in the USA.",

You just don't expect everyone to like you especially if you're a person with that huge of a following.In what way are you measuring it? Because i can tell you why i said his pr could be better: I've never encountered Hate against tesla or elon so much before this. He was doing just fine. He was even written jokes in SNL that made him look very symphatic.In where i live, there were ton of public people in selling their Teslas in because of Elon's views and actions. Companies in twitter / pr accounts of cities were wondering if they would stay in twitter. So those were individual haters? How many individual haters you need to still have good PR?Sure, Elon has fanbois, there's no question about that, at some point even i thought he might be just misunderstood before the whole pedo-tweet incident. That day i started to look more closely what kind of man is Elon. And those fanbois are not his advertisers that left the twitter, fanbois are not the ones dumping his stocks either.So tell me how is his PR great? If you are talking about followers in twitter, then did Trump also have good pr? And if he was, then what was he complaining in the first place?End Elon has very much similar follower base to trump, people who love trolling and some mystical \"sticking it to elite\".And this clown is richest man in the country that loves draconian work culture... This union is just plain weirdly masochistic.Rest of people always want to see a dumpster fire, especially when that dumpster is worth $181.3 billion",

That, and Tesla has always been tremendously overpriced in the first place.In my opinion, this makes more sense. Investors may be right. They are worried that Tesla will not be managed properly by Elon Musk because he is focused on managing Twitter. Since the beginning of buying Twitter, Elon has always been preoccupied with this company.I think not only that but this is also caused by the news of the threat of recession. I can't avoid it, because companies and investors are very afraid of the recession. Of course, it has a big impact on the world of stocks and the business ecosystem. If you pay attention, not only Tesla has fallen, but Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and others have all seen their declines over the last year. I think this is a normal event in the current economic situation.",

According to Electrek, the customer, Ian Jordan, bought a new Model 3 a few years ago with the understanding it had FSD hardware. It did, but not the upgraded version.https://carbuzz.com/news/judge-orders-tesla-to-upgrade-customers-self-driving-computer-for-free-on-his-model-3I'm not certain if this will translate to other cases. if tesla will be forced to follow similar legal precedents in other cities and states. Maybe it won't amount to more than a single isolated incident? Tesla's decline in stock price could represent the worst case scenario. Traders tend to assume the worst. Which could imply tesla's current stock price is a little undervalued at the moment. But there could also be declines in overall sales revenue which could be stacked on top of this, looming on the horizon. Recession generally correlates with declines in revenue. Tesla is said to have a long waiting list of buyers waiting for delivery of vehicles, which should guarantee demand. But there is also supply chain impact on revenue to consider.",

No doubt that if that is the case, the stock price will continue to fall. On the bright side, Tesla investors should be grateful they did not invest on Nikola instead, this dump is nothing in comparison to what happened to Nikola's stock.",

Tesla's stocking crashing is not just beause of Elon's mismanagement on Twitter but more about the market demand for electric cars decreasing due to the high energy cost for electricity or other fuels. This is far more logical than judging a person or a company from an isolated perspective. You'll see a lot more consequences to come in the future.",

He really is addicted to publicity and fans adoring him and bootlickers kissing his ass. The only person who tweeted and loved adoration this way was Trump, so perhaps they’ve got more in common than we all thought. His handling of twitter and his ramblings on there isn’t entirely to blame for his Telsa stocks crashing, although it’s a huge factor. Some people just can’t afford to buy cars from him anymore.",
