      "body": "Thank you for your answer nc50lc!I have a few more perhaps stupid beginner's questions:I only have one wallet.dat file, so not several wallets. I use this as long-term storage for my coins.I have passphrase encrypted my wallet and always make backups of the wallet.dat if I generate a new address.If I now convert my wallet into an HD wallet or a Descriptor wallet and something goes wrong, can I still use my old wallet.dat file again if I copy it to the wallet.dat location via linux termial?Should I update my wallet.dat at all? I hardly ever generate new addresses. Or do I have a disadvantage if I leave everything as it is?What would you recommend?Thx a lotMichael",
