Because I believe with that alone, you might not get more users as people would  think your app is an investment  site that uses bitcoin  and people wouldn't wan to dare to try that not from a user with just two post.Nevertheless,  I want to welcome you to forum and also encourage you not to get disappointed  by responses you might get but to be on the safer side and if you also want to gain more users or feedback to grow  your app, then you should possible consider running a review  campaign  and also run a signature campaign  for publicity  on how to get more users.There are several  reputable managers in the forum and if you need anyone you can as well contact @Royse777 as he is good at what he does.",

Because it is an app related to cryptocurrency you have to make the app source public so that users can know it is safe to use.",

Anyhow, as others have said, it this is closed source then it might sway investors to download it, just a precautionary measures.But in any case goodluck to the OP if you are the developer of the said apps, and I saw that it has been downloadedQuote1,000+ downloads",

By the way, that's a good initiative on spreading awareness, all you've to do now is to show the legitimacy of the app.Especially when they ask permission before we can use all the feature of the app this really bring huge risk for anyone tying to use that. Also we cannot assure if we can get accurate reviews since they don't have any reputation built yet. And for sure when starting up the owner will seek for more revenues then might grab the offers of scam to give them good reviews in exchange of payments. This is why its hood to have this forum since from here we can ask for real reviews and know the sentiments given by people about something we ask here.",

      "body": "It is nice having more apps that would promote Crypto currency and bitcoin in general. As I see, your app seems to be incoperated into investment which is not a bad one but a welcomed development and hence would need your app to be more sophisticated security otherwise. Since it has to do with one investing his or her funds, it would be more convenient that one keeps track of their own investment on the app So as to keep abreast of activities and monitoring.I would like to ask you this question OP; what is the guarantee that this app is well secured to prevent hackers from accessing our details, funds and assets?",

Common!or\"A hardware wallet can be used for storing large amounts of bitcoin for the long term, while a mobile or desktop wallet is typically used for moving bitcoin between exchanges.\"Not to mention that LocalBitcoins is a recommended exchange, lol!In short, not so much of an \"app\" and you could probably have found all that info by just opening bitcoin.org in your browser.Quote from: squadus2 on May 17, 2023, 07:26:45 PMSmart Bitcoin Investments is designed to keep you informed and up to date on the subject of investing in bitcoin today.
