Dem don send me 4 token wey no get name than \"bep 20 and phishing , be careful on how you relate with this token \"No be only you they receive all those kind of tokens on your bsc address, and am sure you can stop it as far as you dey post your wallet for public places, maybe you dey use the wallet do bounty. The only thing wey you fit do na to leave those coins their, no even try swap am. I don receive one before, if I dey try swap am, they go commot gas fee but e go fail, I no go see am swap, the more you keep on trying, na so dem go dey commot gas fee and the transaction go dey fail, like say na d developer side the gas fee dey go, I don’t know how dem take dey don am.Some projects go send their coin to random people so that people go reason say dem get plenty holders just to encourage people to invest in their coin, which na lie, they no get any plenty holders na set up. So all those kind of coins if u receive them no reason say u done get free money, just leave them for their like that.I notice say you dey use ur account do bounty, no try send d coin to random wallet ooo, make dem no come talk say your account dey connected with the person own.",
