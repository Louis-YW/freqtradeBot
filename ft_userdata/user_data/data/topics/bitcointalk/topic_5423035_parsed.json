  "content": "I recently tried to reset my 2FA on Binance and verified the selfie which gives me 48 hours to review but it's almost 3 days since I didn't get a response from Binance.All my backup is on my PC but currently, it's broken it keeps auto shut down in Windows loading and sometimes it stuck to black screen.I usually use Binance on my phone and I accidentally cleared the Binance data because I noticed that the Binance app eating so much data above 2GB I thought Binance would let me log in again without Google authenticator and I thought email and phone number would be enough to log in again on the same device. Does anyone here have the same issue resetting 2FA on Binance? I didn't receive any response yet and I can't log in.",

To escalate your case, you would need to reach out to support. Note that the bot will try to suggest related articles first and if that doesn't solve it, you'll have the option to be redirected to a support agent, see: https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-use-binance-support-7b0fd3ccb821483a99ff8f5cda374ee9",

      "body": "@BitMaxz. You have contacted support already, you can only presently wait. However, if it has been more than 5 days, you can also go to social media and tell them in public about your issue. Binance support has an account on Twitter. You can use that and pressure them there. Many of their users also do this and it appears to work hehehe.https://mobile.twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk",

      "body": "Even if you use the same device, all the exchanges I am using including Binance do request for 2FA when you just want to login in using the same or different devices and they always indicate that you are login in with a different IP address, maybe the IP address do differ after a long period of time. The only way to make this easy is to login in with the QR code which they provided you. But always expect 2FA for new login everytime without it.I hate Binance for that bot of a thing, but when I tried it last on OKX, it was also a bot, but when bot couldn't give me the answer that I want, I was later directed to one of their  customer cares which helped me out, I do not know if Binance worked like that, but I think it should be like that also on Binance. If that does not work, you can easily rich them out through social media which has been mentioned above.",

According to what I read to restore 2FA on reddit, it includes recording a video and not just a selfie because it is easy to do Photoshop for such pictures.Through these comments, shortening a period of 9 days and some cases took more than that. So 3 days is just the beginning",

I just tried running the app on my phone and I can't find online support, but when I use the app running on my phone, I see online support. I think you try using another computer to access binance and have them handle it. I've also reset 2FA before, but I've never had a case that lasted more than 48 hours as you mentioned, maybe it's just a partial system error. Online support can easily help you.",

      "body": "The above suggestion of Ayers is the only way to contact the real live support. You to send the details of your case on chat and let the bot reply then click the not relevant option below the reply of the both. The “Yes,Transfer to customer service” will appear on chat that will transfer you to live support with 5 minutes waiting time. This is the fastest way to follow up your concerns rather wait for the email because there’s a lot emails per day on binance and there’s a chance that your request is flooded already.",

If op weren't able to connect with the live customer support, the bot will just assume one of the auto-responses solved their query. It would be best to get a confirmation from binance itself that the case has been escalated (or whatever solution they route op to).",
