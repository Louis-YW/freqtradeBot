      "body": "Joe Biden should have set fire to his testicles long before he fathered his ill-begotten son.  If the right people are in charge of his funeral they will launch his casket into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean.  He is a swine of a man and jabbering doddered of a president. He is so crooked he needs servants to help him screw his pants on every morning.  Till he is dead he should be beaten like a mad dog with mange at every opportunity. Nobody trusts him -- except maybe the Stalinist Chinese and honest historians will remember him mainly as a rat who kept scrambling to get back on the ship.",

      "body": "Joe's health is failing. He'll probably die before he can be punished for his crimes, even though his son might be luckier and get punishment before he dies.Why do I think it is better to get punishment than die without punishment? Because the punishment will come either way. Any punishment done here by men will be far less than the punishment that God will do in the judgment. If Joe would simply take his punishment here, God would accept what punishment the people gave Joe. But if he doesn't get his punishment here, it will have to be meted out in the resurrection by God... just to balance things and make them even.So, actually we should pray that Joe gets his punishment here, so that it won't be so bad for him in the resurrection.",
