  "content": "Hi All -This is unfortunate to be writing this - on 8 September, I made the switch from Stake to Duelbits after getting another measly level up reward and decided to give Duelbits a go. My Duelbits username is ImPoor.On 10 September, I won some money (after losing thousands) and previously was able to withdrawal 2x without issue (see screenshots below). After a long session, I was in the green and attempted to withdrawal $4.5k across 2x transactions but they were stuck in Processing... to which I immediately contacted support who stated my withdrawal was being investigated but Support continues to refuse to give me any reason or ETA.I did not break any rules, TOS, cheat, or do anything wrong. My winnings are legitimate and it seems to me it's no problem to lose money to Duelbits, winning ANY money and attempting to cash out seems to be a problem.It has been 36 hours since I've attempted to withdrawal from Duelbits and I still don't have any ETA or explanation as to what is going on. There is no transparency into what caused this, nor what the process is and how long until I'll have access to my winnings. $4.5k is a drop in the bucket for Duelbits and I don't know why they would be willing to risk their reputation on such a small amount. Consequently - I work in cybersecurity as a blue-teamer - anomaly detections and technical investigations are my bread and butter. I get it - new account with winnings, it might've triggered an alert (this is the only likely scenario I can think of as to what would cause this chain of events). I understand that this may happen from time to time to ensure the integrity of the platform but to go 36+ hours without access to my funds without an explanation or ETA is absurd. I've even offered to KYC but was told that KYC was not required.I have included screenshots below. Any assistance anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.Withdrawal: https://imgur.com/a/Q3VP1AgScreenshot from help.duelbits.com: https://imgur.com/a/jFXAyCAConvo1: https://imgur.com/a/7k3I9YAConvo2: https://imgur.com/a/oJKaCBSConvo3: https://imgur.com/a/PJHkSH9",

His withdrawal is of good amount, due to which he may not be able to keep patience. I asked Op to contact Dulebits representative, although that representative is offline since 09 September 2022. I don't see any problem with Dulebits here, as they told the OP to wait while the team is working on his problem.",

I look at most scam accusations with skepticism when made against The primary concern I have is I will not want to associate my reputation with any scam and since I am wearing a Duelbits signature I have a duty both moral and ethical to take an interest in any scam accusation against Duelbits. Apart from this scam accusation there have been two others that I can recall.If memory serves correct, Duelbits were in contact with the OP yet he opened a scam accusation after 7 or 8 days of his contact with them. They completed their checks and released the funds to the OP: [SOLVED] Duelbits Casino does not want to confirm my KYC - withdrawal not paidAnd this case, he admitted stealing from Duelbits and he admitted he had no case against them and even went as far as to lie about family members having cancer. After being caught out he aplogised but he did not return the amount close to $20,000 he stole from Duelbitsduelbits.com (solved)In this case, I think the OP decided to open a scam accusation after around 36 hours of not being able to withdraw. Since his screenshots have not been posted here to make them visible to everybody, I am posting here:======================================================================================================The OP created his account on 11th September 2022 and last posted on 12th September 2022. Maybe this has been resolved, we do not know and we have heard one side of the story. It would have been better if the Duelbits forum representative had posted here but either way as the situation currently stands in my opinion calling this a scam accusation at this stage seems premature.",
