  "content": "Again, El Salvador has made waves as they become the first country in the world to  launch a Bitcoin mining pool that's being powered by a geothermal energy from a volcano.It seems the Central American country delights in keeping the world on their tippy toes with his daring acts where Bitcoin is concerned as in 2021, they became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender and now this. The project, dubbed \"Bitcoin Volcano\" aims to utilize the abundant and renewable energy source to generate clean and cheap electricity for mining crytocurrencies. Bitcoin Volcano will be tapping into Luxor's experience in providing Bitcoin mining software and services. This project is ripe with promise as it will also make use of Luxor's Hashrate Forward Marketplace; This works two ways as on the one hand, it mitigates market volatility through automated risk management strategies and on the other, creates jobs, income and development while reducing the environmental impact of mining. This video highlights more about the project https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-first-bitcoin-mining-pool-volcano-energy-luxor&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiKg6yl4uOBAxUKOuwKHTxIDVgQFnoECAMQBg&usg=AOvVaw38bfpjw896uJB-C7e-k6O_",

Using renewable energy to power Bitcoin mining is a much more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach than using traditional fossil fuels. This is indeed a promising venture that could potentially revolutionize the way we mine cryptocurrencies. It’s fascinating to see how El Salvador is leveraging its natural resources in such an innovative way. The project could help to reduce the cost of Bitcoin mining, which could make it more profitable for miners and more affordable for users.",

We need to keep it in mind as much as we possibly could and be happy about these things.Well, I personally might not agree with your input stating that $600 per day for a nation like El Salvador is too small, and besides, Franky didn't say $600 per day, he said $2100 per day, but even if the nation is making $600 per day as pure profit from mining bitcoin, it is still something considering that the mining is not the only source of income for the country.At least, we know for a fact that the nation, El Salvador have existed far before bitcoin came into existence, so this simply means that they have been making money through and from other sources which they run the country with, so right now, if with bitcoin, they now have the ability to make up to $600 per day, combining it with their several other source of income, it is something for sure.Overall, i must commend the effort of the El Salvador in bitcoin adoption, they have proven and shown the world that their mind is made up in their quest for bitcoin adoption, i hope that one day, they can be counted among the richest countries in the world with the help of bitcoin.",

Tom Swift and his Atomic Earth BlasterThe Atomic Earth Blaster is an automated tunneling machine. Tom builds a prototype version that uses mechanical cutters to grind up rocks and dirt before progressing to the final model that uses atomic energy to vaporize rock. The Atomic Earth Blaster is used to drill down to a molten layer of iron deep beneath the earthís crust. Years later Russia copied the idea.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole",

Geothermal energy is a stable energy that doesn't depend on wind or sun, it has low visual impact and doesn't generate emissions,it doesn't take up too much land. And with a country with a total land area of 21,040km², it's something worth considering. And El Salvador are the ones first harness these benefits. I feel Bukele's efforts at putting them on the world map is gradually yielding results if you ask me.",
