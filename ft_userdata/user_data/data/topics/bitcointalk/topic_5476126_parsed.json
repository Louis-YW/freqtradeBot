  "content": "Today, I was scrolling the digital goods board I found something strange. A scammer who was promising to sell 1 Bitcoin for $1000 and when I opened that thread I have found that the scammer is also running a promotion where he claimed to sell a whooping 12000 BTC for just $8000 USD. I think that I have found the world's stupidest scammer and I believe that the ones who get scammed by this scammer will have no brain in their head. The guy says that he's selling Bitcoin at old price of $1000 and the worst thing I found is that the guy posted a promotion on 30th of November where he offered that 12000 Bitcoin for $8000.Here's the profile of the scammer: humerh3I have found that some users have left negative tags on profile of that scammer but still he posted that update on 30th of November which lead me to think that do people still get scammed by such scammers? If yes then how could we better guide them to be aware of such scammers? I know that awareness and education will work but it's going to be a hard thing to educate everyone.",

If yes then how could we better guide them to be aware of such scammers? I know that awareness and education will work but it's going to be a hard thing to educate everyone.I don't think we can say much from that. It is possible that OP is just doing that because he doesn't care about his tags, and hopes that a newbie falls for their trick, just like I did when I was a newbie. After all, he doesn't need a lot of time to log in and post.I think the tags are good enough to deter newbies or someone to make a deal with him. Nothing we can do further if people deliberately ignore it for some reason since it was not hidden on that board or his profile. I don't think you need to overstress yourself with your goal of educating people. I'm sure most of them will at least get curious about what the negative tag means and then search for a bit. There are tons of threads related to P2P scams too.",

I wouldn't classify that person as a professional scammer with the way that he didn't even bother to change the names that he's using to scam people and to evade the people who guards against him and his scheme, I'd say that he's more of a dumbass lazy but patient scammer because no way that anyone will take the bait of this kind of scam everyday, it might take time before even one gullible user would even take this stupid bait or maybe not at all, that's why I added the patience virtue to the way that he scams.",

Some advertise Bitcoin as magic money, but only the most naive can believe that it can produce so much magic This person is irrational and perhaps influenced by the story of Aladdin and the magic lamp.  He is offering a promotional offer to sell 1200 bitcoins worth $46M for $8,000.Anyone with an ounce of common sense would avoid such illogical offers from the outset. Selling Bitcoin at a steep discount or buying Bitcoin and paying a significant amount of interest is a scam attempt to lure greedy and inexperienced people. They might see this as a golden opportunity for a limited period. How can someone gain 0.02% of the Bitcoin value by selling it for $1000? Or someone buying Bitcoin at an increase of 12% to 20% higher than its market price! I will support this scammer's flag now, and I hope everyone follows OP's approach in exposing scammers and warning the community.",

It's baffling how scammers continue to operate even though their offers are very obvious. We don't know if there are still people falling victim to these tactics, but since it has already been tagged with negative labels, all we can do is support it. It's not our fault if there are still potential prey who may not be as well-informed about these schemes. At least, we've done our part and encouraged others to do the same.",

Some advertise Bitcoin as magic money, but only the most naive can believe that it can produce so much magic Only newbies who aren't aware of such scammers or who aren't familiar with the Bitcointalk's trust system may get scammed by such scammers but the point isn't that I mean it would be better to create a rule where such people who are known as scammers or do something that shows their scam related intentions to be banned. I know that it doesn't make sense to ban every scammer but such people who are directly doing something like this may get a temporary or permanent ban so they might stop doing something like this. I know that such scammers can create many accounts without worries but at least the known accounts can be banned.I also agree with you that someone who's totally out of his/her mind would trust someone who's selling Bitcoin for $1000 per Bitcoin or $8000 for 12000 Bitcoin. Ah, 12000 Bitcoin for $8000 sounds like the craziest thing that anyone can offer and that's why I believe that this scammer should get a life instead of scamming.",
