I prefer regional government, but even if there is regional government, there is nothing that can end tribalism.

      "body": "You are talking about tribalism more than you ever thought of it because if you know what tribalism has done in Nigeria so far, you go cry tyre. Did you know that tribalism is one of the main causes of poverty in Nigeria? Tribalism is the main source of corruption, selfishness, self-interest, and many more things that have destroyed the hearts of all Nigerians. I can’t say half or some percent, but all Nigerians, no, no, no, you must have a bit of tribalism in your mind, and the main cause of it, I think, is the too many tribes that we have living in Nigeria.Quote from: Kara3 on October 09, 2023, 07:21:32 PMTrue true for this country we dy go back because we we know people we dy capable to do most of the jobs for we country, but base on say him no from my place, we no go give am the job, we go come give less qualify person we go do nonsense wrk, or person wey no know anything about the job base on say na ur brother.AmThis has caused a lot of unemployment in Nigeria. Many graduates out there without jobs are mostly affected by tribalism. I had a friend back then when I was studying for my diploma course. This friend of mine told me that after we graduate, there is already a well-paid job waiting for him. I asked him, \"How comes when you have not achieved your certificate? He said to me that his father friend is the MD (managing director) of the organisation. The worst part of it is that someone who studied health courses getting a job in a construction organisation is so sad. Though Nigeria has tribalism in their blood, all we can say is, My God, deliver us all in this country.",

Na only two tribe they get for Nigeria which are rich people and poor people.",

A situation where we allow just selected parties and individual to recycle themselves in our political system is a strong indication that we are not ready for any change anytime soon.Another serious issue of concern about our fellow Nigerian is how they get carried away with small peanut that comes during election and will vote anyone that is willing to pay them small cash on the day of the election.I was at akwa ibom in the just concluded election and in my compound my neighbours were bragging about how they won't vote a particular candidate for reasons best known to them, when the day of election came, the same party offered to give them just 4k and they shamelessly gave out there vote. Later they will still be the ones to talk about bad leaders.",
