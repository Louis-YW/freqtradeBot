If not how low can we realistically go before the start of the bull run?Just to add, I am going to go with yes the bottom is in. I do think we will crash again however to similar levels just not as low as the low we saw on the 21st November last year. [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

The bitcoin recovery is moving on smoothly but we can’t be all optimistic, because there are economical factors that still affects it. Should there be recession talks again it would affect it. But the most important thing to note is that any saga like the FTX could be disastrous like the late November crash, possibly any top exchange been hacked or something of such.Visit the speculation board and to read about these. There multiples of similar threads there",

If not how low can we realistically go before the start of the bull run?Two answers maybe need to consider and here are my takes.Maybe yes since bitcoin is showing good signs of recovery so maybe at this time we might see a continuous slow progress until we see the pump like those crazy ones the same happen on the past.Also maybe not since not all the time we see the bullish trend continue to exist and provably after some sort of pump happen the pull back came so you need to be more careful on your expectation especially when you decide to buy and the market dump since this is the start of how people lose their money. So better take precautions and always careful on decisions especially on buying on what price you like.",

But if indeed Bitcoin will experience an increase in price due to being driven by more buying volume this year, I don't think there will be another crash for Bitcoin this year although it cannot be accurately confirmed for Bitcoin this year either.QuoteIs the bottom in? If not how low can we realistically go before the start of the bull run?It all still always depends on the amount of demand and supply that often occurs in the market because increases and decreases cannot be regulated by our own minds. But it can happen through changes in demand and supply in the market, so expect that there will be more demand for Bitcoin so that the increase can occur more quickly this year.",

We still need to beat that resistance again in the next week if we want to see higher numbers for March. The btc community is very positive atm and I think we will do it but no one knows when the bottom or the tops are in and it is speculation and a little risk taking if you have invested into btc. My target number is a long time away so I am not too concerned about beating the resistance this week and I think increasing gradually will be better overall.",

The thing is that some people would very much like to extend the bear market because they want to accumulate more at lower prices, but from what we see now, it seems that we have already touched the absolute bottom.Waiting for another crash is always an option, but I wonder how realistic it is after all the negative things that happened last year? I'm not saying that something bad can't happen again, but realistically speaking, we are on the road to recovery, not only when it comes to Bitcoin, but also the global markets.",

For the time being, it looks like price has failed to break $25K and has been rejected on Weekly time-frame from this level for second consecutive week. There is a lot of support around $20K however which I believe will hold and will be the real test of whether the bottom is in or not if it gets there.Personally I'm not concerned about the double top scenario at $25K that is currently playing out, as long as a higher low is formed around the $20K levels which would confirm price remains bullish.",

We had a golden cross which doesn't have to mean a rally but it usually means the worst is over. While it doesn't say what the price will be in the coming months it definitely says the tide is turning into a much less bearish. Timeline also shows we're very close to a bull market if not already in it because we've been in the bear market since November of last year so 16 months in.

We're getting close to the season of halving again and that's why every after the latest bull run, comes next with a great bear market and that was for last year.It's why bitcoin is just playing around from $23k-$25k and the lowest that we've seen at this point was $16k. Many are still speculating about $10k-$13k and that's for them to decide if they think that bitcoin will reach that certain low but for me, I don't think that we'll see those points again.This is just IMHO but as usual, this is a volatile market and anything for its price has the possibility.",

While market cycles still operate fairly similarly, there is a difference in how far we drop and the response from holders to crashes. This means that we cannot put off the possibility of a bull run to beyond the halving; it's very possible the price starts appreciating before then and tops out after the event.Also, there doesn't have to be another drop leading up to a bull run.I expect that the bottom is in and we would have more sideways movement before a spike.",

An exchange bankruptcy is one of those events and it drags the price down despite TA and cycles. A positive thing in all of this is the price goes back to the mean soon after such event. I remember when they busted Ross and the news came out the price dropped 10% in a day. It was a good example of such instant trigger. If we were at the bottom of the bear market when the news came out, we'd have a lower low, despite TA saying otherwise. That said, the bottom should be in.
