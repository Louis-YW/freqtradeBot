  "content": "The 2022-2023 Euroleague season continues with quality matches. At the end of this season, the final four will be hosted by the Lithuanian City of Kaunas for the first time in its history.We can say that the last champion Anadolu Efes started this year very badly. We can say that the important factor of this bad start is the injury problem of a star like Shane Larkin. Ephesus slowly began to find its rhythm. Fenerbahce Beko, which has been restructured and signed strong transfers this year, has been losing the field for the last 2 matches despite starting the league very well.",

      "body": "There was a surprising result in the matches played yesterday in the Euroleague. Leader Fenerbahce lost to Partizan in the match played at home. There were emotional moments before the match. Because Partizan coach Zeljko Obradovic worked as the head coach of Fenerbah√ße Beko between 2013-2020. Fenerbahce regressed to 3rd place with this defeat. Cazoo Baskonia, on the other hand, continues to rise and managed to beat Bologna at home yesterday. There are 4 more matches today and the most important match will be between Milan and Monaco.",
