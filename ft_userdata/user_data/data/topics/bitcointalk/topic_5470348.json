  "content": "Microsoft raises security concerns over \"Chinese\" Bitcoin mining company. Although, later in the article it's explained that the enterprise has an \"opaque web of ownership\" and is only \"linked\" to at least one Chinese company. The only potential attack vector stated is the ability to cause a power disruption.Legit concerns or a witch hunt? Judge yourself.Chinese Bitcoin mine in Wyoming sparks security fears over proximity to nuclear missile base and Microsoft data center - as defense experts warn of threat to power grid from similar operations across the UShttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12627791/Chinese-Bitcoin-Wyoming-Cheyenne-energy-security.htmlQuoteA China-linked Bitcoin mine in Wyoming is drawing security concerns due to its close proximity to a Microsoft data center and an Air Force base that controls nuclear missiles.In a confidential August 2022 report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, Microsoft warned that the mine could allow the Chinese to 'pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations,' the New York Times reported on Friday.The Bitcoin operation, which has an opaque web of ownership but is linked to at least one Chinese company, is directly across the street from a secure Microsoft data center that supports the Pentagon, and about a mile away from F.E. Warren Air Force Base, home to the 90th Missile Wing.(...)",

If the problem is constant they may request help from the electrical provider but that is not the motive to randomly point to an unknown miner.",

      "body": "Yes, the Chinese Bitcoin mine is a security concern. It is located near a Microsoft data center and an Air Force base that controls nuclear missiles. Defense experts have warned that the mine could be used for spying or to disrupt the power grid.However, the article also states that the mine is owned by a company with an \"opaque web of ownership\" and is only \"linked\" to at least one Chinese company. This suggests that it may be difficult to track down the true owners of the mine and to hold them accountable if anything goes wrong.Ultimately, whether or not the Chinese Bitcoin mine is a legitimate security concern is a matter of opinion. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with this type of operation.",

      "body": "I think they are grabbing at straws here.... and this is once again some fear monger tactic to make \"Bitcoin\" the bad boy.    They surely have control over the power grid and they can shutdown individual businesses, if they are perceived as a threat. Also, strategic targets like this have redundancy measures like inverters and UPS's and backup generators that will kick in, if there are a power failure and then the utility companies will investigate... while these backup measures protect these systems.",

      "body": "I mean this is Bitcoin mining right what are they gonna do to spark the security of the Microsoft data center and the nuclear site and what is going on here why the microsoft data center near the nuclear launch sites? That is dangerous right since the customer data is stored in it. Since Microsoft is there I don't think there gonna be an issue because the data center itself also need a huge power. In the other hand I think the \"Chinese\" company are using by the miner to buy ASIC just opinion",
