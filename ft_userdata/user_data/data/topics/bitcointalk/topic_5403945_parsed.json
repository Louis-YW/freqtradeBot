  "content": "A new business model called Learn-to-Earn appeared in the crypto market some time ago. So far, there are not many projects on the market and most of them are not represented anywhere at all, I mean some large platforms. A quick glance at the concept again invites unpleasant comparisons with pyramid schemes, where the project lives only from new users.

Some look like a legit project but it the end, the so called project is a scam that will only make their investors lose money. I have something to ask, would you buy the token when you are not sure if it's legit or a scam?. Well, that's your own conclusion and as what I read about op's explaination is it feels like it is another pyramid scheme type of token. \"You need to buy something first before you can start earning. Is it that kind of suspicious?.",

If you ask me I think it is better to not attract that negative karma if you can avoid it.First, these are tokens, not coins. But here is my thoughts about karma. If you sold a \"non-scam\" token(or coin) at ATH and someone else bought it hoping to get more profit, but instead he/she lost money later, would you consider that you still have a good karma? Remember, not all \"non-scam\" tokens/coins regained their value or gained only a fraction of it because, for example, the team does not care about price anymore, they only care about project development. So you left someone with that \"non-scam\" tokens/coins in the wallet awaiting to get their money back but they could never get it back.Some people call crypto a \"scam\" but only time can tell if a project is a complete scam. It could be that \"learn-to-earn\" model will turn into a complete scam. Or it could still bring some values to the community by educating people who want to learn English (or other subjects). Time will tell. Right now I would just observe these projects without recommending to invest into them/ or invest only a small portion of your portfolio, at your own risk.   Personally, I might recommend to invest only after doing a good research and my personal preference is projects focused on a good technology where the teams consistently deliver results without asking you to pay you anything upfront. I am not excluding the possibility that some of these \"learn-to-earn\" projects will be worth of investment, like I said, time will tell.",

Thanks you for your clarification. BTW, I have checked, LSTAR does not have a requirement to pay in order to learn English, you can do it for free. BUT you cant earn $ if you dont pay upfront.So I dont think that LSTAR falls under \"ponzi\" scheme definition which does not mean whether it will turn into a scam project/ or not. Now OTHER \"learn-to-earn\" projects may or may not follow this model (not to pay anything upfront) and this may raise a red flag. This is why I stated that its too early to call the \"learn-to-earn\" model a scam because projects may differ in terms of their approach. Responding to wxa7115:Also, if I may suggest, since many of us here hope to make some profit and some of us have concerns about karma... I found that if profit is made, share some of your profit with people in need... Would it work for karma? (Somewhat a rhetorical question...)",

Just look at how inflation was happening not only for the slp token but NFT was also being inflated as well. People are generating this more and more everday, this is also destroying the price of NFTThe new users are the key point why this model can a big sustain for long term.
