I Dorian Nakamoto will believe in Him first. Because, he has enjoyed free lunch and a good amounts free Bitcoins. For Craig Wright, it will be a night mare, he might think thatb BitcoinJesus is playing the Joke. How about you as Bitcoin Talk Forum member ? Will you believe it is the real Satoshi Nakamoto ? Let's bet about it. I bet 22 Bitcoin from Genesis Block which came from transaction fees and some from some people. As I said, if Satoshi move 50 BTC from Genesis Address then there will another 22 Bitcoin there, so I must bet this 22 Bitcoin. Those who will believe in him, he will distribute the 22 Bitcoin to them under riddle for them to win the whole 22 BTC. Please make your comments wisely. No body believe that I am Satoshi Nakamoto. Even though, I am saying I am Satoshi Nakamoto. \" Blessed are those who has not seen me but believe in me\" - Jesus. \"Don't believe, but verify\"- Nakamoto Satoshi",

      "body": "This is an epic scenario and in this point, satoshi should sign from multiple addresses and not only one. Because any user running a brute force program could find a satoshi's private key with the right luck. So, I don't think a message and a transaction from satoshis address would be enough to claim his identity nowadays.And if someone finds a private key from satoshi he could make much more money selling that key to Faketoshi than by claiming the 50btc on that address. It make since for all right?",

Quoted post is my evidence.ðŸ¤£ Â Let us keep the blocked genesis coins from discussion, I accept a simple signed message, but why would Satoshi do that? Why would he break loose chaos onto his life by coming out as the inventor?",

He already made a lot of money off of bitcoin theoretically so revealing that he's still in control of those coins would just make the world and governments look for him. If anything, he wouldn't get something from the genesis block and instead get some coins from some inconspicuous address that he has that still has some money on it. The attention he will get from doing such a move will be something that will never be beneficial to him, that's for sure.",

As you think, you know for sure that the numbers from Genesis Bitcoin Block Address can't be moved. Now can educate the people and explain it details why the numbers can't move from first Bitcoin Address ? Â You are the only one who has plenty of time to encourage and teach about bitcoin to many Newbies. Who told you that the numbers from first Bitcoin address cannot be spent ? Â Can Theymose move the numbers from his Signatory Bitcoin address ? How about second Bitcoin address ? Â Which is btc address no. 1, where the is Block mining reward 50 Bitcoin. I told, many times, if you want teach me something regarding bitcoin or blockchain or something else what I do not know, I have no problem to learn from you.",
