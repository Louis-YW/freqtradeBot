Regarding the funds, its up to your budget actually whether how much you can spare on the project. Also depends which one you are going to use such as btc paid or pay in altcoins of your project or any other tokens.",

You would be the campaign manager2. Hire someone, experienced campaign managerBuilding a decision,if your answer is 1, then you need to buy Copper Member here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promoteif your answer is 2, then you need to hire a bounty manager here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0#1 To become a campaign manager you don't need to buy Copper membership, yes a newbie rank can't attach an image, but actually you don't need to have a good ANN in signature campaign. What you need is know how to judge the quality post and how you can make the project become successful.#2 It's not a list of campaign manager, just look at the above user which already gave a good list of campaign manager.",
