Many people said we can't compare the Hashrate with the price because this is all about the ecosystem, the more people mining that will be stronger the ecosystem (bitcoin network). but my feeling sure this situation is very related to the price, I can't tell you the reason,  so if you have to, don't hesitate to start shopping bitcoin now, hurry up, so what are your feeling?",

Could this be a mining firm testing miners work before selling them whenever the next halving/price spike is (particularly a large producer of hardware).It's possible some people have invested in producing their own electricity and powering miners with it to generate more profit than they'd get from the grid (but I think this number will be very small).",

The hashrate is good news because it gives security to the network, but I don't expect a real bull run until after the next halving, unless the OP wants to consider a bull run going up to $30k. The normal will be that at some point we will start to move up and leave the level of above $20k, but beating $69k and then $100k, which I think will take several tries, will only happen after the next halving.",

Was there a bull run? Is right now a bull run happening cause those red numbers sure don't look like it.Seriously, why do we keep mentioning these those two things, if an increase in hashrate would trigger a bull run all we would have to do is buy each a miner, and there you have it, magically once we plug those into the power socket the price will skyrocket, because, that's how things work ...in fiction!In reality, this is gear that was ordered months ago by people who right now are probably hitting their heads against the wall realizing they bought stuff that will OI in 3 years instead of one and that the electricity price is twice as much as the time of the order and companies that went in debt to purchase those overpriced machines.

There's probably a lot of explanations for it though (like excess electricity production that can't be stored might have made some rates lower in countries - such as nuclear power during the night).Summer ending in the southern US with lower stress on the grid, Bitmain delivering new gear, some data centers clearing ETH miners and having extra room for sha miners, it's probably one hell of a mix of reasons.Quote from: dansus021 on October 13, 2022, 02:09:27 AMand based on your picture its only touch new ATH and then fall again to around 250 EH, to be honest if the hashrate like the price of coin it looks like double top  Daily hash rate, it's a useless chart as it depends a lot on luck, today 140 blocks can be mined tomorrow 148, still 144 on average but the graph will show a 6% difference and a new spike, one chart that runs on PST can show 150 blocks on that uses GMT can show 145, pretty unreliable stuff.",

      "body": "Bitcoin reaching hash rate ATH after another means Bitcoin is on top of its health. Security isn't a problem. More miners are interested to join in spite of the boring and relatively low Bitcoin price. This must mean something, of course. This is one reason to celebrate and be more bullish about, especially with regard to Bitcoin's future. It's probably a strong statement of rebuttal, a slap on the face of those who think Bitcoin is dying. But does this signal a price rally in the immediate future? I don't think so. Well, here's a chart of Bitcoin's hash rate versus its price. Can you spot a pattern? As for me, I didn't find anything. Perhaps if we zoom in? Well, you can look back weeks and months earlier and probably find nothing either. The price has always been volatile and yet the hash rate has consistently been rising. https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/stats/hashrate/",

To support the price rise, it also needs buyers. If the demand goes beyond the available supply in the market, it would certainly trigger a price rise. However, it may be possible that the price rise is temporary. It will give some investors a chance to cash in the opportunity. But it's likely not to stay for longer. Let's hope for the best!",

Well congratulations to ETH \"environmentalists\" for instantly creating several megatons of technological waste overnight (ASICs)!I'll end the satire here since this thread is not about ETH.Mining difficulty does not influence the price at all, only when some external event happens and people rush to exchanges to buy more BTC on exchanges will the price go back up. Because exchanges set the price. That's why each exchange has a slightly different BTC price. Most people just follow Coinbase or Bitstamp's price though.",

The thing that some people say and is wrong is claiming that price follows the hashrate. In other words it is wrong to say that if hashrate goes up price goes up later or if hashrate drops, price drops later following that.It is wrong because the exact opposite is true meaning when price goes up, hashrate goes up too and vice versa.But it doesn't happen immediately. There is a delay because you can't just flip a switch and start mining bitcoin with what you find at home. You have to buy ASICs (which is special hardware that you don't have at home like a PC or graphics cards) and have it delivered to start mining, this takes time.There is also hardware technology that is improving meaning new ASICs come along that are more efficient and produce higher hashrate so when miners buy these new ones and have them delivered the hashrate increases.",

All those who for some reason think that a bull run is possible in the next month or in the next 6 months or maybe even a year in the future obviously do not think that something can be learned from the past. Unless something super spectacular happens, I don't see that a new bull run can happen before Q3 2024 for more than obvious reasons.",
