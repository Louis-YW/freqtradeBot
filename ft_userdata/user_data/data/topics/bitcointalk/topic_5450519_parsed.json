Also, attacking a Bitcoin node doesn't equate to attacking the Bitcoin network. Peer-to-peer, decentralized and robust networks like this don't get down with just a DDoS attack, unless there's a 0-day exploit found.",

But what I don't know is bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is a decentralized blockchain. The tracking process might not be possible but I am not sure for that. Bitcoin will be hard to hack because the addresses are not channeled to one server. It is not possible to know the total number of people who are attacking the blockchain. And I know that hackers are trying to attack the system every day.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and the blockchain is stored by thousands of nodes all around the world and for performing an attack, the attacker needs to own a very big hashrate which is practically impossible. True that, but it does not need that huge amount to attack Bitcoin, any attempt regardless of how big or small to control the network is considered an attack.  So definitely it does not need that huge hash rate or whatever to attack the network, but obviously, if it cannot outpower the network, the attack will fail.  It is one beautiful feature of Bitcoin network security.  To perform the 51% attack, it really needs a huge sum of money which most attackers cannot afford.",

The nodes that purposefully try to spread invalid data or otherwise behave maliciously. You can also look at mempool and consider certain low-fee transactions a part of spam attack. You can look at mined blocks and see if reorgs are happening, which can be a sign of 51% attack.But I don't think anyone made a site for tracking attacks, because it's not very useful -  it's impossible to track most of the attacks, and such attacks are mostly theoretical because they don't cause much harm to the network.",

      "body": "Another problem with cataloging attacks on Bitcoin is that some of the attacks are not actually categorized well to be able to be \"counted\". For example one form of attack that has been studied for years is the spam attack. It has many forms and methods that some researchers tried naming and categorizing but the categories are not famously known despite all the work. Like \"Fan Out\" and \"Fan In\" attack types that I happen to remember from a study I read a couple of years ago.Some people don't even consider some of these as \"attacks\" like the Ordinals Attack.The other problem is that detecting some forms of attacks are not easy. For example if someone attacks a full node, it is not going to be publicly recorded. The individual running that node has to report it and we have to take their words for it.",

That's not possible cause it is something that's handled by miners i.e. BTC miners execute two things that are transaction confirmation and securing the network.It isn't handled by the miners in and of themselves, it is the pow or consensus mechanism that ensures security of the network, and anyone in the community can parkate in this without being a miner, they just have to run the full BTC client and they are a part of it.",

If they both combined, it's over 51% hashrate they own, but it's not mean Foundry USA and AntPool will do 51% attack because they both are have been mine Bitcoin since the beginning and they're earn more money for selling their hardware.
