  "content": "Hey crypto enthusiasts  I recently came across the platform https://crydis.com, which is an AI-driven crypto prediction service. It provides real-time market data analysis and delivers insights directly to your email daily. I've been using it for several weeks now and I must say, the results have been accurate and immensely helpful!Navigating the crypto waters can be a daunting task, especially given the market's inherent volatility. But with Crydis, I feel I've been able to make more informed decisions based on their short-term predictions. It's been a game-changer for my trading strategy, helping me stay ahead in this crypto market.However, as someone always looking to diversify my toolkit, I'm curious about other platforms you all might be using. Has anyone here tried Crydis? And if so, how does it compare to other platforms you've experienced?Thanks!",

If you want to oppose it that you are not misleading people, let us see your orders on an exchange future market and see if you are actually making profit or not. Some exchanges can also tell you your winning days, add it along too. Also you can let us know your 6 months PnL. Mention the exchange if it is not a common exchange. If the exchange is among the first 20 exchanges with the highest 24 hours daily volume, no need to mention its name. We would know. As to what I know, you want to only mislead people and using this means to advertise a signal group. People should avoid this. Signal providers only care about their pockets.Anyone that wants to know how to trade should learn about trading and have the necessary knowledge and experience about how to make profit from trading.",

Has anyone here tried Crydis? And if so, how does it compare to other platforms you've experienced?I've never tried any of them since I don't believe they work. The market is volatile; how can an AI prediction tool made by humans predict where the market is headed or provide positive feedback on what I'm anticipating? I don't utilise any of them since I don't trust them. To prevent letdown from these tools, I prefer to make decisions based on my market analysis and understanding.",

Signal providers only care about their pockets.You are 100% right, this platform is nothing but a way to lure people into their groups where they could charge people for signals which might also not based on AI algorithms. And who know what type of AI algorithms they are using because I have seen many platforms saying we have better AI algorithmic bots but at the end they all end up some API of existing bots like GPT. This is also another type of auch scams. Dear op, if you really want people to use your platform then be open and transparent to them. Fooling them is not going to get you hell lot of traffic. Instead it will only bring you temporary success. If your main aim is to ask people to buy signals by paying money then provide the details in the post. Or, also provide some reviews too like if you have any clients or customers who are happy with your results then provide their reviews to us so we could get an idea about your platform. Also try to elaborate more, like how you guys are going to use AI to bring more profits on the table while your AI will not be different from others.",

No one falls for this except for other newbies like you do OP. Advertising a platform that you rarely even know is like trying to form an image like a scammer. You get to say the positive points about it and when people start trusting and then losing after, then you act like as if you never encourage them to do so. And take note, AI will never be reliable in trading. At times it may seem working but in the long run, its predictions will end up as pointless. No one is capable to read or predict correctly what’s ahead in trading, and if there’s any, you are likely believing in a scam.",
