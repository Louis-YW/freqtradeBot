  "content": "$ELONONE - Launching Multiplayer P2E Game - Launching Gasless NFT Marketplace - 13800 Holders - Project is Over 1 Year Strong and Products Launching Shortly**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!* Liquidity locked for 100 years.* 13800 holders and rising.* Low market cap.**Gasless NFT Marketplace**Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming  gasless NFT     marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring  immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount  of users and transactions        expected.AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial      barrier that many NFT artists face when trying  to sell their work.We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being     hindered by insane gas fees and the  extortionate transaction fees that other NFT   marketplaces charge.There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve     their lives, the lives of their families, and also to     improve the communities around them.Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists  but  it will also attract a large user base that     wants to get real value for their money.We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT  marketplace as quickly as possible.**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?*** Zero gas fees.* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other      marketplace like it.* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to    10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are  gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to    host their drop on AstroZero, or their own     website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make      AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the   majority of NFT artists and investors alike.* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This   will bring mass exposure and users  from their     large fanbases.* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed    Run.In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race their rocket against the competition for prize   money and users will also be able to bet on the     outcome of races.Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think  of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should  expect to see similar here.Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from       having its own crypto game. Having the game   linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply*** On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the    token deflationary.* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.**Liquidity locked for 100 years**The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He  will never be able to access the liquidity he    provided in his lifetime.He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be   and you should never settle for anything less.**13800 holders and rising**Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.With the project we are building it is easy to see why.**Low market cap**We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins. Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.**Tokenomics**2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.**Info*** AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released imminently* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap and Hotbit* Liquidity locked for 100 years* Listed on CG + CMC* Strong community rising daily* Whitepaper released and available on the website* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2Website: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)",

Because they are expecting that if they will include Elon Musk to their project, it will be a successful one? Because they believe that just adding Musk to their project will attract other investors?As to the project, it's early to say that it is a scam because a project will not turn into a scam until it turns out to be one but we've seen many shitcoins and meme coins with the name \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" on it so there is a high chance that this might be one as well. As for the investors, be vigilant as always and don't invest into new projects just because you've seen name or picture of Elon Musk on it.",

I am sure that Elon Musk does not know about the existence of the ALONE coin at all, and also that it is being used by you to promote your coin. There is no point in dealing with such a project, which initially violates the law.",

There have been many suits against parody accounts of many celebs, and the defendants have won. Please cite the sources of federal and international law you claim that this project is violating and I would be glad to discuss with our core team. Thank you.",
