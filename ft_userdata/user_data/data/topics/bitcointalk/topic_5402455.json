It's not exactly 50/50 as it still there is zero as a separate color, but the odds don't change much. Roulette is available at most casinos, so just pick your favorite platform or the one that gives you the biggest welcome bonus.",

There is always some margin, as it is not a pure 50/50, but changing odds you may decide about your chances.",

That is huge op. It all depends on how you want it but I think you can divide the fund into 3 places or more so you can conviniently paly what you want to play without much restrictions. Well I don't think there could be any available platform where you could bet 50 btc in a single game. This is too daily for me mate and to the gambling platform.",

Let's say there is a casino site that allows you to bet 50 BTC in one bet, and if you win, how much BTC can you earn? And can the casino pay out your winnings all at once?

I don't know exactly what he is try to do on creating this thread and announcing everyone he still has a lot of Bitcoin from the previous investment scam.",

Personally I absolutely advise against doing such nonsense. It's an amount that even in a crypto winter could change any life.I think it's more valuable make a donation to charity or helping people in needs...",
