I thought I was the only one reading the gibberish the OP narrated here, the thread might not be necessary truly. But on second thought, I think he/she does not know how to differentiate some terms thereby looping them together. There are places where investments and trading were supposed to have been strictly used, but marketing and confusing explanations were also seen.However, the end gist has been known wherein the investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is advocated.",

Yes, \"trading is likely to give everyone what he desires.\" Actually, it does give. It's just that the players don't often like the other side of what it gives. Everyone likes to seen the green (profit) side of trading and not when it turns bloody red (loss). Trading is risky just the same way it's lucrative.

You're right that they're into assets but take the example of Warren Buffett, he's an investor and focuses more on a long-term style of investing and that has made him wealthy.

So in the aspect of cryptocurrency generally and the best coin to invest with. It's audible to deaf and crystal clear to the blinds that Bitcoin is best coin that have potential than any other coins. Because the values always been in fluctuating circle but quickly regain it's potentiality when it decreases, but altcoins can die off during long term investment and can never ressurect again, so theirs is huge difference between Bitcoin and any other coin.",
