  "content": "#BitcoinTalk mod note: This IS a long-term Bitcoin project supporting the BTC ecosystem. A major source of the funding comes from many worthwhile projects - some of which could be called altcoins. We are using \"them\" to pay us back this time! (details below)    * Edit: \"I/We do not need a big response at first, simply a small group who wants to be a forward-thinking success, instead of a \"scared sheep loser.\"* I did not accept any payments.* This is temporarily shut down, but far from over.Hello, Welcome to 2048: The World's First Long-Term, Paid Study of Bitcoin Users.# Science + Fun create a truly awesome reality for you, and dramatically improves the heavily damaged (post FTX) Bitcoin ecosystem. * 2048: The World's First Long-Term, Paid Study of Bitcoin Users will be a \"sober\", academically valid long term study of Bitcoin users, AND it is combined with Fun and crazy experiences some of you will remember Happily Forever.

Please NOTE: If you see a toxic troll - digaran - in any of my threads, please do not allow him (and his false statements) to affect your own independent thoughts:He has a really bad reputation: Trust summary for digaranThis user's email address was changed recently.Post new feedback | Trust settingsTrusted feedbackUser   Date   Reference   CommentsPoker Player   2023-12-02      Worst paid signature campaign spammer ever.NeuroticFish   2023-11-25   Reference   Troll, to say the least.

I was not here then, but am aware of the extremely high quality content, complete lack of Spam, no crime, etc. The day I joined the forum, BTC broke over $1 for the very first time and was over $4 later the same day! I soon expected \"the price to go back down\" (when it was ~$7), and/or my main motive was being truly excited about how interesting the Bitcoin Experience was at that time, so I was not attempting to invest.*Here is a screenshot of one of the first posts I ever made here.*When I mentioned \"I do not even own any\", it was a simple fact, I was not wanting or expecting what you see in the second screenshot: Wow, nice surprise! I was so new, I used Google to figure out how/where to get an address.  During the exciting days I just described above, it quickly became obvious I was hooked on the Bitcoin experience, even without investing. Every time I logged into this forum the enthusiasm and happiness was wonderful. When I was offline, I noticed I would still frequently be thinking about Bitcoin and the amazing people here.Your Simple, Effective TestAre you currently reading \"The Full Version\" of this presentation? At this moment it is due to be released in ~4 to 6 hours or sooner. If/when you do read the full version, please start to noticed if you are able to go ~ 90 minutes or more without thinking about anything you read hear today. (Spoiler Alert) Even something as crazy as our Party On The Beach! section (in the Full Version 2nd half) - that is priceless and Fun for a certain very large group of people who tend to already be interested about Bitcoin and related topics.Please come back to this thread some day soon, and tell us the results of your test, thank you.Blockchain Buzzwords!Ricardian contracts, smarter contracts, Chainlink! (awesome since it can not only \"talk\" with most major blockchains, LINK can handle data from outside sources, like a MySQL database) You will not see me using a ton of those buzzwords, we see the people of this community urgently needing better opportunities, and our own Massive Global Escrow as top priorities. We also have over 40 staff/students interested in a full 18 hour Smart Contracts/Blockchain course (with a co-op effort to help each other), which gets started asap.Smart Contracts are a powerful tool and certified experts average over $175,000/year, stay tuned...Question: Can a Fun, virtual Paradise so good ever exist again?Moderately-Promotional, Info You Might EnjoyThe 2048 Long-Term Study of Bitcoin Users & Our Ten Seeds Network cannot reproduce exactly the type of Paradise which used to exist here, but we can have a tremendous amount of Fun giving it our Best Shot. Our new video was just released, on the front page of this site (just scroll down a bit) please enjoy.* The 2048 Study/Experience runs for 24 years* Mystery Money :: Your Time In Eden will last as long as you want. When our amazing Muti-Seed credits and bounties begin to turn into Real Money, many new realities will be open to enjoy. Similar to Bitcoin, some of us will truly enjoy the early days when it is an exciting new type of \"Magic Internet Money.\" Simple \"Roadmap\" For The Genesis of the 2048 Long-Term, Paid Study of Bitcoin Users:* Staff and paid members (at all levels) automatically are part of the Study. * In the best possible version we will have actual College Professors and MIT students involved also, helping to create a real scientific study with lasting value.* This thread will be for openly discussing various topics, and some Bitcointalk.org members will be chosen/invited into the paid study/experience, and able to start for free.You are now entering \"the New Part\", a major update.[ANN] Positive Coin (+++) A Fun Project Which Is Honestly Hard To Say Anything Negative About. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5477221.0Brief details about Positive Coin are at the ANN thread, please check for the technical details on our creative, new early-seed split where your early effort and value is instantly doubled. +++ Speaking of ANN. Ann Party has never been seen anywhere before Today[ANN] ANN Party: Fun + Blockchains = A Massive Source Of New WealthWe Can Have Fun, and Make Money!Reality Check & \"Big Balls\"First the \"Big Balls\", then we do a super-fun reality check.About Me: Years before Bitcoin even existed, I started reaching way beyond my current abilities because I Love to learn, and enjoyed the challenges of many IT related projects. You are seeing here only a small piece of a very Big Picture. Honestly, it takes \"Big Balls\" to come in front of you and shout (for example) \"Please try these Fun ways to Make Big Money You will be Amazed!\" My unique, unprofessional style is intentional, I am not trying to compete with the \"slick pros\" who have done so much damage to the Bitcoin ecosystem.  * People smart enough to join our events will see we have literally No competition as we go places no one ever has before. * Making Big Money gets much easier when you actually have no competition.Reality Check (Part1):\"It's no good believing in somebody elseIf you can't believe in yourselfYou give them the reasonTo take all the power and wealth.\" ~Alan ParsonsThis is for You, please enjoy the experience..........* Edit: \"I/We do not need a big response at first, simply a small group who wants to be a forward-thinking success, instead of a \"scared sheep loser.\"* I did not accept any payments.* This is temporarily shut down, but far from over.Everyone, thank you so much for your time and have a great day!Thanks for tuning in, and have a Great Day!",
