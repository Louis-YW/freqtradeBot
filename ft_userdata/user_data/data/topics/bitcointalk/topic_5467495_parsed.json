Economic problems such as recessions or high unemployment rates can hinder a countries ability to generate sufficient revenue. Mismanagement of funds, corruption or inefficient tax systems can further exacerbate the problem. External factors such as global economic crises or unfavourable exchange rates can impede a countries debt repayment capacity. Every countries situation is unique& finding sustainable solutions requires a careful examination of their specific circumstances.",

They could offset that but may not have been worried about it as they also have there reserves and their economy thriving well. But I think the reason they may not be eager to repay is when there is no pressure for them to repay so they would prefer to use the money for other needs and if they have not shown sign of bankruptcy.",

It's because they can't just pay it in full as there's always a budget allotted for most of the department depending on how the country distributes that. Our country also has a lot of debt but the government does pay it a little by little and what's sad is that it keeps on ballooning. The payment that's being done is just going through the interest and not with the principal amount. Maybe this is the same for the other countries that instead of paying the principal amount and they're capable of it, they're just paying the interest of it.Quote from: Davidvictorson on September 20, 2023, 06:37:23 PMObviously , these developed countries I believe are capable of offsetting their debts because they even render aids to other developing nations.Base from this website, this is what it said about even being capable of paying, they keep on borrowing as well;Quote from: https://www.banklesstimes.com/news/2020/04/17/rich-in-debt-why-do-the-wealthiest-countries-owe-the-most-money/Why do rich nations continue to borrow even if they have the money? An advanced country may obtain debt to give its slowing economy an adrenaline shot. This allows for the continuity of government programs despite the decline in tax revenue due to recession. Another benefit of getting low-interest debt is avoiding raising taxes or enabling tax reductions to sustain the national budget without hurting economic growth.Quote from: Davidvictorson on September 20, 2023, 06:37:23 PMSecondly, are there any benefits, economic or otherwise of a country being in debt?Aside from the connections and funding public projects:Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/sovereign-debt-default.aspUnderstanding Sovereign DebtGovernments may issue debt to finance essential public investments, to meet the demand from institutional and individual investors for safe assets, or to prolong unsustainable overspending and enable graft.",

      "body": "All things being equal, those debts were taken for an investment. The debts were taken to produce something, so the debt will be paid from that investment over a given period. Some countries that are badly run take loans for consumption like paying salaries etc. which is bad. Loans are taken for investment, then you pay the loan back from the proceeds of that investment. Let's use Japan and Greece as a case study.According to your post, Japan's debt is just over $10 trillion. Japan's annual budget is about $771 billion. So you see the damage that paying off a loan of over $10 trillion will do to that economy? The same goes for Greece with an annual budget of $111 billion.They also just can't print money to pay off the loans because you know what happens if they do that.Have you ever wondered why a big multinational company still has debts and asks for funding from banks and other financial institutions? It's because it's financially unwise to use all the money you have for an investment. For example, if a company has 30 million in liquidity, and they want to go into an investment where the capital is worth 10 million, it would be wrong of them to use the money they have for that investment. There are many different ways to fund that project, one of them is taking a loan despite having enough money to fund the project.",

It becomes a thing of wonder on how they got to the point they are now, sinking in debts and the worst is, you still find many of these nations borrowing more. Every government regime seems to be doing this and you still find the nation wallowing on poverty.Another thing you wonder is,If they aren’t meeting down the payments; just why are they being handed down more loans? Yeah, it’s a business and case of interest where you have these institutions have some control over the prices and supply of some of the rich in natural resources supplies but, these nations has to look towards a more productive aspect especially the developing once.",

If a country thinks that if they pay the amount of financial debt they have, they will face financial crisis again, then those countries refrain from paying the financial debt. But there are some countries in this list who can repay their financial debt if they want but I think financial debt is a cycle of business, no matter how developed a country is there will be lending or borrowing. Some countries may have borrowed for a long time so they are not paying their debts at the moment even if they can afford it.",

In the case of Japan they could literally pay off their debts with their vast amounts of resources, maybe even products that the lending country could rebrand as theirs although that would seriously hurt their economy. The fact of the matter is that a country couldn't just pay their debts in one go even if they want to, paying off a debt will cause issues to their economy which may lead them to take out an even bigger loan.",

The government of such countries may keep these debts as safety parachute once their economy falls to a new low and their GDP growth ratio gets destabilized. Some countries don't repay their debts because they get comparatively cheap interest rates to be paid, and these countries keep delaying their repayments to use the debt in various schemes through which they manage to gain more to add to their reserves. With some benefits that come handy to these countries, it should not be forgotten that these debts can be highly dangerous if recession takes place and that country becomes economically unstable.",

What they need, aside from accumulating so much money while in power, is to look good. They need that especially for the next elections. So they will have to implement all kinds of programs, build projects all over the country, subsidize various public needs, conduct all kinds of public activities, and so on and so forth. The funds available are, of course, insufficient so they will borrow money. They don't care about it. They don't pay for it, anyway. And they won't be in the position forever. Who cares if the next administration will inherit a larger debt? A senator here once told the public not to worry about debts, adding, \"they're just debts.\"",
