  "content": "As di topic implies, Nigeria like dis e don pas El Salvador for searching bitcoin in the internet. When I first see the things, e shock me and I was wondering if that is possible because El Salvador na di number one country wey do adopt bitcoin for di legal tender and Nigeria wey never accept bitcoin talk of adoption come dey pass El Salvador for the search for bitcoin in the internet. And one thing wey I like Nigerians be say dem dey serious to do anything wey good. And di day wen Nigeria go adopt bitcoin, lolz, no country in di world go near am for the uses of bitcoin. We go dey use am edge to edge. You go see say even SME go accept bitcoin. All di stores go accept am. El Salvador go dey play for where naija dey. Dat Nigeria Currency go rise up to ATH. Nigeria nai dey number one for all the countries wey dey search bitcoin for di internet. Dis one na plus to the Nigerian bitcoiners. Nigeria e no dey take last. At least Ghana sef dey push dey go and pass Canada.https://arbiterz.com/nigeria-has-most-bitcoin-searches-on-google-globally/",

      "body": "Please, it would be better if you include a link.I have always seen Nigeria as first since I know about bitcoin.This was updated 2 months and some days ago on July 19, 2023: https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/top-15-countries-most-curious-about-cryptocurrency. Quote from: https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/top-15-countries-most-curious-about-cryptocurrencyWe examined Google Trends data of search terms frequently used by people interested in cryptocurrency. These terms were then combined to give each English-speaking country a ‘total search score’ to discover which countries have been the most interested in cryptocurrency since the market crash in April 2022.Although those are lists of English speaking countries but I am not expecting El Salvador to surpass Nigeria right from time with how a population of over 200 million people are adopting bitcoin.El Salvador can not compete in regard to this, they are only just 6.314 million while Nigeria population was estimated to be over 200 million. I am not expecting it that people will compare El Salvador with Nigeria.This was 4 years ago: https://bitcoinist.com/top-5-countries-where-google-searches-for-bitcoin-just-tripled/amp/After El Salvador adopt bitcoin as a legal tender, Nigeria was still above them: https://beincrypto.com/worldwide-bitcoin-adoption-countries-peak-google-search-interest-2022/",

Omo this country hard but at still it's just like a disciplinary actions given to every Nigerian and that's how we have been so prosperous in almost everywhere and everything we do because we have the number ability of adaptation and anything that can actually yeild fruits then I think Nigeria will definitely be there.",

I believed  there are research experts that are doing this. And Forbes is one of them and others and in most time they got their information from google and other browsers directly. The data are easy to collect from google because google has each country information separately and each day each country visit to the server shows so if you want to get such information you just visit those browser support team and explain to them and collect the data. And there are other ways of gathering this information. But would not be done with manual counting but they always computing technology to find out the answers. There are some percentage they are using to measure the highest country. Frankly Speaking, I have not used altcoins before. And the only coins I have used and using is bitcoin.",
