I've already shared this news on Facebook so that my friends who have accounts on coins.ph are aware of it; they're probably checking their balances right now. I'm interested in how this incident will affect coins.ph. Will they close shop, or will they continue with business as usual? One thing is certain, though – the confidence of the users won't be the same anymore.",

Luckily I had my balance at BNB at never use XRP at that since if I choose to convert it with that crypto maybe I will get a problem. But luckily I manage to take out my balance and transfer it to my bank account that's why right now I decide that never put any huge balance on coin.ph again since we might know what will happen next after this hacking incident happened to them.For now will continue to use coins.ph but just for immediate transfer on remittances or on direct to my bank account for cashing out.",

It's reassuring if they have a fund for the security of users' assets (SAFU) like Binance.Hehehe, nabanned ba dude, congrats hahaha... pero joke lang yun ah, dati rin akong user ng coinsph, umalis ako dyan dahil hindi ko alam kung anong klaseng verification ang gusto nila  sa level 3 and 4, samantalang nung time ng 2017 to 2018 parehas lang naman ng documents ID ang binigay ko, pagdating ng 3rd submission declined na ang putek.  Kaya nga sabi ko ng mga panahon na yun magkaroon lang talaga ng ibang options na tulad ng coinsph aalis na ako dyan, ayun dumating si gcash apps lipat agad ako. Hindi na kasi maganda ang serbisyo ng coinsph by that time, hanggang ngayon naman ata ganun parin mas lumala pa nga ata. Kaya yang ngyayari na sa kanila, natutuwa pa ako, malaking butas yan sa kanila na pwede nilang ikalubog ng barko. Kaya sa mga may oras pa na mailabas ang assets na meron kayo dyan ilipat nio narin sa ibang exchange o noncustodial wallets, its better to decide now tahn later na hindi muna magagawa.",

Sa pagkakaalam ko ay centralized ang XRP kaya baka makapag request sila ng token freeze sa wallet ng hacker or request sa exchange kung saan pinasa yung token na ifreeze ung account.Sobrang nakakalungkot ito dahil coins.ph ang isa mga pioneer company na nag introduce ng crypto sa Pinas at ito din ang pinaka most use na crypto app sa atin.
