It's worth to mention even though trust wallet and atomic wallet seems like a great wallet since it can store multi coin, but it's close source and could have malicious code.Don't believe if someone say it's possible to add BTC into metamask because it's a fake coin that pegged with real Bitcoin price. It's run on centralized network and they can do anything with your fake Bitcoin.",

Also other wallets have BTC and alts in them like trust and atomic wallet but why not on metamask? This has been discussed many times on the forum. There's no need to open a new thread with the same question again. I suggest you search through these threads where you might find all the answers you are looking for:Bitcoin + MetaMask? Why isnt there a BTC browser wallet like MetamaskMetaMask makes friends with Bitcoin",

Also other wallets have BTC and alts in them like trust and atomic wallet but why not on metamask? Well it is impossible --why?Metamask wallet is an Ethereum network wallet while bitcoin has its own network and is based on a blockchain network. Separate your bitcoin from your altcoin, you can use both Electrum for bitcoin and Metamask for your altcoin, they are good wallets the same open-source wallets. But if you can afford --a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger would be the best, it supports most coins including bitcoin and altcoins.",

Also other wallets have BTC and alts in them like trust and atomic wallet but why not on metamask? Actually metamask is wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens based on ETH blockchain only and there is no way you can have bitcoin into that wallet and if you come across then WBTC is another token based on the same standards and don't confuse it with bitcoin.But why you want it in Metamask as there are many non custodial wallets like Electrum or hardware wallets to safely store your bitcoin with you and that's the best way but at this time Metamask not supports bitcoin.There are wallets who support altcoins as well btc but that's not the case with metamask so be sure about that.",

      "body": "OP, as others have already told you, Metamask is not a Bitcoin wallet, it is a wallet for Ethereum, BNB and other smart contract blockchains. If you see an option to withdraw Bitcoin on your exchanges of preference to an ETH address, that is not Bitcoin but rather a token representing actual Bitcoin being held by a third party.I will give you another reason to consider to use other free-software wallets over Metamask. Metamask back in 2020 moved from being open-source to a new license, a private one.In my personal opinion, a good software wallet for Bitcoin or either cryptocurrency you choose to invest in/hold must be open-source. In this ecosystem it is better to verify than trusting on others.",

If theres someone saying there btc on metamask maybe the wrapped version on eth smart contract. But this isnt recognized as true bitcoin, since they just made a token and calling it wbtc. Btc stands alone on its own network which cant be tokenized and load on metamask maybe not yet. Unless someone can create a way for this.",
