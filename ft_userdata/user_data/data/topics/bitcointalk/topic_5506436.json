Like the above said Bitcoin is freedom anyone can use it without relaying to country leaders and no government would able to hold your account since your Bitcoin is your own bank. Honestly, I don't think they can stop crypto and Bitcoin almost all countries are using cryptos they can ban them but it's just temporary, and later people are still using it.",

Bitcoin is not the solution to countries with high poverty rate if the leaders are all corrupt. Anytime I see people saying that the government doesn't like Bitcoin and crypto because of the concerns of money laundering, I just laugh it out. That's exactly what majority of them does but wouldn't admit doing it. Before, when an allegations is written on a politician that looted money, the money are always trace to business model money laundering through fiats with many accounts related to their own families or people not even close to them but now, most of them don't keep the money in banks, they quickly use it to buy crypto.However, where is an advantage, there is a disadvantages but the advantage of Bitcoin is far more than what are been seen as a threat. If the government want Bitcoin to work, it's going to work and it will give audience to public how money are been used and spend. People can analyze chain on transactions and how politician loots money and the laundering will become more difficult to do as everyone attention will be on them nationwide and globally.",

If the government fails to handle inflation, illiteracy, and insecurity, Bitcoin will do little or nothing.  Apart from corruption, poverty can be reduced by industrialization, economic diversification, and technological advancement. Bitcoin could help a country to get additional revenue if the government, businesses, or citizens are involved in it. It could also attract crypto investors to the country if the government makes friendly laws, and it could help reduce the cost of international payment transactions.",

But honestly, it's all just unnecessary hype, I don't think bitcoin can do those things. To be able to improve the economy is not a simple matter and takes a lot of time, we need to solve corruption, employment, inflation...can bitcoin do those things? Can Bitcoin eliminate corruption?

That's absolutely right, Bitcoin will not be able to help a country when its government is corrupt from the start, no matter what regulations are given by the government, in the end Bitcoin will only be a \"display\" to deceive people so that their country looks more sophisticated, when in fact what happens is that they do not fully understand what Bitcoin is and how they can use it for their needs. Bitcoin is a transaction tool, it never guarantees that it can help someone's economy, so never put your hopes in Bitcoin that it can help your country's economy because its price still tends to be volatile and there is no guarantee that the investment you make today can be profitable in the next few weeks or months.",

Bitcoin is a neutral tool which can be used for the good or evil, depending who is using it, and what their purposes are. Bitcoin alone can't do miracles, but it certainly can help nations, groups of people and individuals who want to thrive in an ethical way in life, aware that abusing others won't take anyone to a good place futurely.Thankfully you don't need your corrupt leaders or countrymen to adopt and be benefited by Bitcoin, due to the decentralization characteristic. Therefore, don't worry too much about others, do your part and reach as far as you can conscious your methods aren't the same they use to progress in life and be proud of yourself for that.",

I like to refer to bitcoin as the 'Grassroots Currency' because it doesn't require any government to function or circulate but only requires your individual interest and this is why amidst the news and propaganda we've been facing over the banning or restrictions of Bitcoin within the crypto community of some countries, it has only grow up in number of users within those countries anytime the government fights it.The government is a system that's built to have a monopolistic or if you like, centralized approach to everything including the financial aspect of people, yet bitcoin is an opposite of such practice because bitcoin grants freedom to the beholders and brings about a decentralized approach of financial systems which makes it extremely difficult for the government to destroy.",
