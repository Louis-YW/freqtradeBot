This FUD is the reason why Bitcoin and other cryptos tumbled so much in recent days, and it could be scary if you have a sufficient amount as a crypto asset.

The activities taking place in the recent market, common investors/traders like us have no choice but to sit and watch. Traders need to ensure that access to funds remains with them to keep their funds safe, centralized exchanges are becoming dangerous. Because there is no guarantee when an exchange will stop withdrawals, if something like this happens then the trader will have no options.",

It's not a fud but its a real deal. There is a reason behind this on why this is happening but what I know is that fuds are only imaginary. They are not real but only use or being push to scare the people to do a certain action according to what the fudders wants. But, you are right there.Even if Binance and FTX betrayed us, there are still other exchanges left, not just decentralized or p2p. There is Kuckoin, Houbi, MCEX and many more great alternatives. P2p and dexe's have an advantage but many people rely the most on cex.",

With the token having very little demand, it's not going to survive when someone dumps millions of FTT in a bear market. The volume is not even enough, it's a fact. If CZ denied bailing out FTX, he must have seen the balance sheet can't be rescued. It's too big to fail but looking at how much they are worth right now seems pretty much a certain demise unless someone like the government catches them from falling.",
