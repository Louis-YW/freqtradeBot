I have come to conclusion that when I tried posting like them it will lead me to restrictions or posting like them is a good encouragement to start with if I may asked?I am presently and working on how to be improving on my write up, then secondly I know isn't that trying to look on someone that have been here for years before me but there's a says that said in our local language \"The more you keep following people you don't know when you start acting like them\" this made me to have this belief that I must certainly improved even though I am not exactly acting like them.So much love the posting style of these users:Code:Filliponeo_e_l_e_oJayJuanGeeDdmrDdmryahoo62278LoyceVSometimes I create out chance to be reading their comments, I was saying how I wish I can post like them not because they are high rank members but the level of their composition makes me feels I will for sure improve one day.Especially JayJuanGee bravo to you sir/ma.",

I would say you should not force it so had now to be like them; keep reading the way you said you have been reading, and as you read, also make sure you are learning. You cannot compare your five months on this forum to the three- or four-year experience of those listed members with Bitcoin and in the forum. Those men have had an early start as well, which was not as professional as it is now.I will not call names, but some months ago, I decided to go through the old posts of some highly reputable members whom I also admire, and I found some of their newbies random questions they were asking back then. One of them asked how he could add pictures to his post and was told that he couldn't add pictures since he was still a newbie. But today he is very professional with how he teaches others and has more than 6K,10k, 8k merit.So, with time, you will also get to be like them if you are persistent in your learning.",

The op just need to build himself on bitcoin related threads and articles. And one thing op has to know is that, he can write his own pattern so people will also like it.
