  "content": "I will draw anything you want, based on a photo, query or random image that you send me.The style will be messy and random, as seen above. If you want clean anime w/e, get a free drawing from midjourney or some AI.For example, you might send me a photo or you might just message me a \"robot\" request and I will draw something (probably hideous) centered on your request.No revisions, luck of the draw.",

Fuck following the normal art procedures. AI can just do it now anyway lmao. It's coming for all your jobs. It can even program now.What AI can't do is add soul to artwork, so anything AI made means nothing. Soon, yall will see the echo-chamber of souless shit that AI can only create, although it looks nice. It has no real value.In the future, soul will be the value, not \"tried and tested beautiful and proportionate art and things.\" This is why lots of old music is good, because it has spirit.",
