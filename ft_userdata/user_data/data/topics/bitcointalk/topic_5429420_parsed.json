Since I'm pretty busy and can't keep track of everything, even though I'd like to, this is something that I don't understand very well and would like to get your opinion on.So, Binance recently halted USDC withdrawals because outflows reached $2B, which indicates to me that many investors are worried about their state, even tho they resumed withdrawals shortly after that.QuoteThe world’s top crypto exchange Binance paused USDC withdrawals Tuesday due to a “token swap.” Binance saw a significant surge in withdrawals yesterday after a recent proof of reserves audit and rumors of legal issues raised concerns among investors using the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.What is all the fuss surrounding Binance? Do you believe the recent difficulties could cause another crypto market downturn?source:https://app.getresponse.com/view.html?x=a62b&m=BVKQj2&mc=9I&s=BtgXWnG&u=QcLhh&z=EGCLwcu&",

You can use ledger, trezor, bitbox etc depends on the hardware wallet you're interested. If you don't have money to buy hardware wallet, you can use non custodial wallet like Electrum, Bluewallet (Bitcoin). If you hold altcoins, maybe Metamask is a good option.",

Regardless though, with the event like FTX, I don't think we need to keep our crypto, let alone a stable coin in any exchanges.And probably the outflow was due to this FUD though that's why crypto market is again affected after we have seen a rise of above $18k to bitcoin. Now it goes down again below $17k because of this negative news from one of the top exchanges that we have.Even the firm that posted this outflow, Mazars has deleted their tweet about this one.",

The many withdrawals may have been triggered by a recent news that some have heard  about binance, while some others just heard that people were making withdrawals and contributed to the numbers by withdrawing as well. Anyhow, this all still advises for self custody, so you don't get too worried to start making emergency withdrawals whenever you hear a news about an exchange where you kept your cryptocurrency.",

Just because the price has dropped 11.5% in last 24 h you are worried about BNB coin or binance will collapse? Let me tell you, binance is too big to fail. Just look at all markets, almost all of them got dumped as well because btc dumped too. Even i happier with this FUD so i can buy more BNB and added it on my bag. Just tell me if you want to sell your BNB.",

Afaik it should be just people pulling their funds out and putting them in their hardware wallets, which should've been something that has been done already in the past, but with the FTX drama I guess people got the wake-up call they needed. I don't believe it'd cause an effect similar to FTX, unless, maybe, Binance closes down or something, but even then it should be a temporary thing, just like with the FTX thing. There might be more though since afaik there's also some news about Binance being investigated iirc? Most likely just speculation though and nothing is guaranteed as of yet.",

And as for me, am not bothered or concerned because I know binance is very solid and doing great despite what those shameless paid FUDers are trying to display. According to CZ, Binance has 15 licenses to operate in different countries, and they will keep pushing to acquire more licenses, haters will always hate because that is their job. How many other exchanges can say they have such access? SBF and his little mouses will get tired eventually, binance and CZ can not come to the rescue anytime a project screwed up.",

Ever since its decision to cancel the purchase of FTX and made it open to the public, CZ already knows possible attacks of any sort. I believe Binance can weather the storm, it's too prepared for this. About the market, it is down already. Of course, it is affected since Binance is the biggest crypto exchange. Many are scared and didn't just withdraw their coins but sold them into fiat. For me, this is just FUD. My BTC buy order of $17.5k was hit. Now I need to cash in some funds so I won't miss this opportunity to buy at a lower price. The same scenario with ETH and BNB.",

They made that clear when they published the data about their exchange reserve funds which were at around 70 Billion $ if i remember correctly. That being said, i think there is no company out there in the world that is absolutely 100% bullet proof against a possible bankruptcy, so of course it is also possible hat Binance gets in trouble. The bad thing about such rumors and news is, that they are triggering a chain reaction. First a few big players start to withdraw their funds from an exchange and then as soon as this gets noticed more and more other investors are doing the same.",
