I mean that's good as you have a kind heart but I think you should not create a topic and ask newbies to share their posts here so they can get that lower number of merits. I am not saying that these merits are not enough because drop by drop an ocean fills. This means 1 merit can change someone's mood and encourage him. But the best way would be to give merits by searching for good and valuable posts for newbies and sending them merits on their posts. You can find my good topics in BTC discussions and even on local boards. I hope you will have enough time to surf on different boards otherwise. If you are an active member then you will find good posters while reading/participating in discussions. And then you can give merits there. But still, I think you wasted your energy in creating this topic.",

Don't give away to them who will apply first but to wait for some time check out some applications and then finalized your decision.

You have a point and I truly understand.  However, making the post might not actually be that bad since it is possible others can support him in giving more merits and not just the 8 merits. I have seen similar threads where others joined the OP to distribute merits to deserving members and that is a way of contributing to the community by supporting and encouraging low ranking members to give their best. In summary, if he gives his 8 merits and others also give even if 2 merits, it will go a long way. Instead of discouraging genuine intentions,  we should support and motivate.",

Instead of discouraging genuine intentions,  we should support and motivate. If you read my post well which I’m assuming you did, you’ll see that I gave him several suggestions on how he can send his smerit so I don’t see how I discouraged him here. Or are you in support that everyone here in the forum should start creating a thread for every merit that they want to share? The main essence of merits is to award post that you feel helped you or is relevant to a discussion not for people to start coming to you to submit links… the reasons why you see merit source create topics like this is because they won’t be able to read all the post that has been made in the forum so instead they’ll ask the people to bring the post to them for easy access but for a small smerit like this I still don’t see the need for the creation of this thread like I said earlier.",
