If you can invest $50 a week, Start Accumulating from this week. But, If your income is meager and you can afford as low as $10 a week. I would advise gathering them and buying $40-$50 monthly. It will reduce the fee for the transaction.",

If your income can't hold up all your bills, I will advise you not to force it just to buy Bitcoin, because taking the decision to buy Bitcoin with the little you could have used to sustain yourself is a bad idea. You can buy Bitcoin today and run into needs tomorrow, and you will need to sell off that Bitcoin, whose price might not be the same as it was when you purchased it, which will make you record a loss.  You are advice to invest money that you know you are not going be in need of anytime soon.",

And if some money is left for savings after completing household expenses, then you can invest it in Bitcoin through DCA strategy. Many people here do these savings through the bank. I think if you need to make savings for the long term, then you can get many times more profit than the bank if you do bitcoin investment without going to the bank.Quote If can afford storing every month in a long run I may realizes half of bitcoin unit and that's a big achievement to buy but to you is funny because you have enough of it. So advise me on what to do! Should I hold on because of the instabilities in price? Or I should buy and store? Over to youmate there is no reason to worry so much, you take your weekly or monthly statistics, where a certain amount of funds you can invest in bitcoin, no need to look at the price you continue it until the next halving i.e. until the next bull-run. I also have adopted a strategy of saving $10 per week since a few months ago",

Given that you have stated that you have family obligations to fulfill, we shouldn't be in a rush to invest in Bitcoin when we haven't met our basic necessities. Prior to thinking about purchasing Bitcoin, it will be better to take care of your family's needs. Don't worry too much about the price direction; you can buy whenever you want as long as you can hold for enough period of time to reach your profit target.

Sometime eagerness people later sell their Bitcoin investment before their target time because they have invested what they didn't suppose to invest by no planning it well. So don't be too eager to get the Bitcoin at early price when you may have problems to solve.buying of Bitcoin should depends on whenever you get the money, buying daily, weekly or monthly nothing is bad.",

Don't use all salary you received to buy bitcoin. Price can move higher or lower than your entry price and it is not happy and good if you have to sell your bitcoin at loss when you need money.So why don't reserve some from your salary in fiat currency and don't have to think of selling your bitcoin anytime because you need fiat currency for your family. $100 is always $100 but you can have $150 or $50 from your initial $100 which you used to buy bitcoin and sell it later.",

If you are unable to take the risk when there is a price shift that results in a reduced asset value that makes you worried and wants to sell it immediately, investing in crypto assets may not be the right investment for you.Don't ruin the initial plan just because of a slight shift in price, stick to the initial goal and you have to be sure of the potential that Bitcoin has.",

If you have decided to save bitcoins or have already started saving bitcoins, you have undoubtedly made a good decision.  Because the market level has been decreasing for some time. Yesterday the Bitcoin market crossed $29K to $30K which is a very good sign. So if you were investing in Bitcoin at the time you asked for advice here, you might have made some sort of profit by now. And even if you haven't invested so far, you can invest in Bitcoin now. Because now there is no such instability in the market. But the market is naturally moving upwards little by little.

I don't really care about price when I buy and accumulate using DCA. but I also have another method which is done by me when the market goes back to bearish. i.e. I buy back every stage of decline (Average Down). I also do that to make the average price I buy cheaper. but I only do Average Down for medium-term investments. medium term I mean until the bull market comes back. but for DCA what I do is for a longer term which I don't specify for how many years.that's why only use cold money that you won't use for years. or even we are ready to lose. and when I have other more important needs such as for my family. so I sometimes pause my accumulations and first prioritize meeting the more pressing needs of the family.I prefer not to rush and accumulate in a relaxed manner without pressure. because this is for the long term so we also prepare the planning carefully and full of calculations.all decisions are in the hands of each of us.",
