You are right, but I think the reason might be the length here, If he starts to write about each and every map even in short, the post would increase and might also hit the limit but that's not possible for the OP in this case. Overall, I was also expecting some explanation from the OP but he did not give any so why don't we discuss it here? For example in the Cryptocurrency Legality map it only talks about big countries, while leaving the developing countries, I mean to say, it does not say anything about developing countries in the map picture while it does have some statements about those countries in the details they have provided on there websites. And to be very honest, I came to know about \"Bitcoin Reachable Nodes Map\" a few days ago, I did not think, there is a website that tells you about the total number of nodes and even country-wise. I don't know how they verified them because if the website gathered data on them then that's against the anonymity of those nodes if they cared about it.",

I have also read that sentence in your previous post. Similar to what you said, the OP's thread has a lot of image content, and if quoted, the characters he uses are few, and there's still quite a lot of space, even if he wanted to add descriptions for each map that is the thread's topic.Therefore, I tried to compare it with one of the threads that I made.",

If you choose Legal Tender, you will see only two nations hightlighted on the map, other nations will be muted.Many developing countries mostly in Africa don't have clear policies on cryptocurrencies making them alegal territories. They have great potential for bitcoin investment but because of poverty and corruption, many Africans don't have the opportunity of investment in the sector. Some countries like South Africa and Nigeria are taking advantage of Bitcoin offers such as hedge against inflation and decentralization, while other countries are lagging. The map also showed that it is only in South Africa that mining activities is popular in Africa. This is because many African nations have high costs of electricity as well as unstable power supply. Africa would have been a center of bitcoin mining activities because of the less concern for the effect of industrial activities on the environment and flexible government policies. But until the power issue is handled it will not be active to miners.",
