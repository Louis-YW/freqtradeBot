      "body": "Absolutely do not agree. Take for example, intelligent folks you said who are wealthy have financial advisors to take care of their money. They do not need to keep making billions to survive. This will help secure a future and generations wealth to support their lifestyle and their family. I do not think they need to keep working but people like them who are so wealthy might be driven to making more money. This is a reason; I think they are working not to support a lifestyle. Now, for those who are not smart with money should find someone to help them take care of their money. This way it is safe and in the long run can help them.",

To super-riches like CZ or Trump, money is what keeps them who they are now but I think you misunderstand the meaning of money to them. See, on that high level of wealth, money is a purchasing fiat to buy things or material lifestyle any more, it is more like a power that influences society and countless people around them. Suppose one day they are not that wealthy, high chances are that their lifestyle can be maintained but the rapid loss of power will make them suffer. The real power, which is supported by money acutally, is indeed what keeps them alive.",

      "body": "Of course, they can still live a normal life, but they don't want a normal life under any circumstances. With enough money, they could also retire to a lonely island. But these people love the attention of the public. They need that even more than their money. The money gets them the attention because it is unfortunately equated with success. But it is the attention that keeps them alive. This is not only the case for some rich people, it can be seen in parts of society. For many, their \"life\" in social networks is more important than their real life.",
