I stand to be corrected but this is a very wrong and shallow analogy you've just painted about the average youth out there. As a matter of fact, if there Is any truth In what you are trying to say, It should be the reverse of your writeup. It is true that we have those that are born into reach and poor home as a major segmentation in the society but you you are being real in your analogy you should have known that most persons that are born into poor home are mostly hard working because they started hustling at a very young age. It is possible for a reach child to be selective of the kind of job he would want to be doing be the average poor person doesn't consider that mych on the kind of wok he choose to do. Laziness is never a function of class but it is even more associated with the higher class people compared to the lower class.",

We can't say all the youths don't want to work, their are some which are actually doing something for themselves working really hard to make things work out in a legal means.We should also consider the fact that their are those who are willing to work but the pay rate is too small, how will they manage to cope if they should spend the whole day hustling and after everything they are being paid in penny or after long days of being self employed and they now check how far the sales and see very poor profits, is it appealing to continue such business. We know how the countries economy is, salaries do not increase but every day price of commodities do increase which is difficult to cope with. Same reasons you see some youths which where into business stopped coming out to their shops and you see that in few months dey now have cars cos the shop can't pay dem well so dey decide to do it illegally, maybe by fraud but it will be advisable if they would get into cryptocurrencies and system technology schemes",

I said so because, when a youth finds himself being with friends of a person who doesn't slack in making money or finding better ways to make money by being of value, they too key in and make ample use of their, that's if they know what they actually want. Besides this if such youths hang out just to beg for food or perch around as vultures waiting to eat remnants, such youth are lazy and have the pride to humble themselves to learn so as to eke a living for themselves.",

Laziness on the part of people who already has life planned out for them and they really don't need to stress even more to survive through the challenging world economy. The weirdest situation is laziness from the ones who should on a normal basis, strive to survive as they're in a situation where they have little or nothing to live with. A lot of youths are lazy and it's not healthy because they tend to get affected greatly in the long run.    Pride on the part of people that'll say they can't work for people, well no one wants to be ordered around and so the best solution for them is to take up a personal skill, learn every bit of it then push their self straight into the labour market to strive for clients and survival. No doubt independency is good but no one should embrace laziness or pride and tag is as they want to be independent.",

But, you are correct, bitcoin may be a tool for individuals to create their own chances and get greater control over their financial destiny, but the first step is to identify credible sources of information. There are several appropriate locations to start, including the websites of major cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms. You may also get solid information from credible news sites like The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. Another approach to learn about cryptocurrency is to join networks of like-minded people. Reddit and Discord are two wonderful locations to locate these groups, and you can always ask professionals for help and advice.",
