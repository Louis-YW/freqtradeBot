Did make out some search about exchange platforms that have those Pi coins which it turns out that it isnt really on the same Pi coin that we are talking on here. If ever this one is get listed on exchange then im sure that its price would dump into the floor knowing on how many people been mining and been long time holding it.  Now that they do have that kind of KYC integration or requirement? I would definitely be having doubt on complying it out specially if it isnt really that been listed on any legit exchangethen i would definitely be skipping out on complying which you cant be sure on where it would be going.",

It's because if it does then there will be no Pi Coins holder hoping for it to get listed on any exchange. It's like a chain and token that's just made by huobi to attract all of those Pi holders to make it look like they're not losing the trend. It's been so long that this coin hasn't been listed on any exchange and not even on its own exchange if there's one that's being mentioned by the team. Sad to say that those that have complied for its KYC since the devs have asked for it were likely just collected it and sold it somewhere else. Just accept it together with your brother that it's certainly just a waste of effort collecting and mining those.",

The original PI network currency price has not been determined, and it has not been listed on exchange platforms yet. It has been in the enclosed network since March 2019 until now, and there is no roadmap. This project, in my opinion, is just a joke, and even their mining is not considered real mining. It gained its fame from the promotional and marketing hype, but working on this project was a waste of time. Regarding your KYC issue, the PI team has mentioned, as far as I remember, that newly created accounts must complete 30 completed mining sessions to submit KYC verification; the priority is for those who have worked on the PI application for years and have a large mining balance. I do not advise you to submit your documents because you do not know what they do with these documents and the reason for their delay for years, and nothing has been done for the Pi currency.",

And here comes that Pi listed on exchange where many think that is the Pi coin they are waiting but unfortunately still doesn't deliver their hopes since they cannot do anything with the funds mined. Since the Pi listed us not the same with the Pi they hold. So maybe those people who didn't do a Kyc will do extra careful to do more research since who knows they are just giving it for free to devs and use it for activities that we don't like.",
