You can do it with retroactive airdrop, do some tasks with testnets that are free, no cost, and get shitcoins. When you receive shitcoin distributions, you can convert them to Bitcoin. Sell them and buy bitcoin or swap them to bitcoin through cross chain bridges if possible.The risk is you need to use a device for interactions with shitcoin's websites and smart contracts.

Yet, it is a good way for future bitcoiners to learn shitcoining business well, and make some BTC meanwhile.Ie, in the end it is actually profitable if you're persistent and smart (yes, have to be smart not to always lose money). In essence, you're playing against the house and winning, so ... got to be smart.",

At one point I had got like 200 dollars worth or something like that before the value dissapeared lol. It was fun tho, I made a page for it and everything and I was really trying to research like every day. Sometimes I miss that little stage I had and often wonder whether or not it would have been worth it to have carried on with it. I wonder if there are still any good projects coming up that you can get in on.",

      "body": "It is theoretically correct but in the real world and in practice it is not. There are two reasons why it doesn't work the way theory says.First is the fact that if it were that easy to earn bitcoin through claiming \"free\" coins through airdrops, everyone would do it. And when large number of people do the same thing (claim free coins then dump them) the price of that coin cannot be high meaning the amount of bitcoin you'd earn would be very small. Therefore you can't really call it \"earning bitcoin\".Second is the fact that what we call airdrop or free giveaways is no longer airdrop or free. You actually have to work for it. Free giveaways used to be simple faucets like this one where all you had to do was enter your address and claim 5 full bitcoins! Nowadays you have to actually \"work\" to get \"paid\" that new coin. That work could be advertising their coin on social media, creating videos, and so on but it is work and you are getting paid. The payment is low as well, just as I explained in fist part.So if you want to spend time and work to get paid, why not spend that time more efficiently and do something else to get paid a higher amount of money and use that money to buy bitcoin?P.S. Keep in mind that exceptions may apply to what I explained. You could find some token that would give you a better reward but exceptions don't make the rule.",

Remember when ICOs were still popular between 2016 and 2018? I participated in a lot of bounty campaigns, earned tokens, and made a good amount of money. But I also know that many people became victims during that time. Most of the projects I joined, even those that got listed on good exchanges, no longer exist today, or if they do, their trading volume is so low that they’re practically dead. So if there were investors who held onto those tokens until now, they definitely lost a lot.",

If people can sell their shitcoin for a guaranteed $10k or more after a few months everyone would do that. It feels counterintuitive if your goal is to collect more sats but have a ridiculously high sell target for the airdrops that you get.I won't spend my time doing this unless I have enough money from my jobs. Looking for a side job is a better deal to me if I need more funds to buy Bitcoin regularly.",
