The only options available were to edit the poll or lock it. Within the \"edit poll\" option, I found the following Screen, I tried to check if poll deletes or not by saving without inserting any texts: Is there a method to delete the poll?",

Moderators can also remove polls and lock voting.So, the only thing you might try is to contact the Forum Staff or Moderator to delete the poll you created.Quote from: _act_ on October 24, 2023, 08:05:53 AM-snip-Edit: if it is self-moderated, you can not also delete poll, but you can delete the whole thread.

Maybe you mean what was deleted was the content of the thread?",

In a self-moderated thread, only other people's posts can be deleted by the OP but the OP can not delete his own topic unless he edited it. I have corrected it. Both poll and topic can not be deleted but edited. Admin and moderators can do that.",

You can delete threads if nobody has seen them. Otherwise, just click \"Lock topic\" link at the bottom left.I test with one topic in Beginners & Help; Bitcoin discussion boards but I can not delete two threads.QuoteYou cannot delete your own topics in this board.",
