  "content": "Hello everyone,I published a new article on my blog about the first genesis block mined by Satoshi. I analyzed the very first version of the Bitcoin source code (available at the time only for those who wanted to give their opinion on the code, published by Cryddit on this forum) and found many interesting peculiarities. I have also written in detail all the fields of a blockchain that maybe can be useful to beginners and non-beginners who have to interface with the code the first time.Here is the link: https://serhack.me/articles/story-behind-alternative-genesis-block-bitcoin/If you have any doubts, questions (or insults), this is the place to be! I know it's against the rules to spam, however, from the first feedback I gathered it seemed to be good enough to merit a thread.",

I should have mentioned that I compared the next versions of early Bitcoin source code (0.1.0 and sourceforge commits) to focus better on the writing style of Satoshi. I imagined that people worked so much on Bitcoin that almost no fragments of Satoshi code left intact. By the way, thanks again for the merit.",
