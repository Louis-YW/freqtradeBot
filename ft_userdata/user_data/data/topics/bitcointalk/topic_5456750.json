It can be anything except collateral scamming. You are a newbie so if you scam 10$ then that will not make you any trouble for your account. As there will have no problem ou can scam that 10$ collateral. So, if you are legit then you must have to use escrow.",

Or, are your comments meant to serve as a warning to others?Many users default to various reasons. If you check the history of the lending section then you would be able to know that the loan has been defaulted. And scam happened too much in 2018/2019 but nowadays it has decreased a lot. And yes I am practicing more and more to minimize being scammed.",

But nowadays a lot of accounts have been banned and also got negative trust that's why decrease the number of scaammer.",

Â So its not strange that members that been here and they have for sure seen many many scammers in their days, act like they do. They only want to protect the forum and its no wrong in that, they been was here long time before us, and probably will be here after us, so in the beginning we should threat them like we are guests in their home with respect.",
