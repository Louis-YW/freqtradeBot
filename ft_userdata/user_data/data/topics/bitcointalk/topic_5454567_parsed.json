If there has to be strict regulations, I reckon very strict regulatory procedures should be created only for users who want to avail of accounts that gives them access to leverage. This might be where the income bracket assessment might become useful. If some users does not reach a certain income bracket then no leverage, buy coins 1:1 and hold them under your own custody hehehe.If Canada is tolerant on swapping fiat for a few selected cryptocoins and strict on leverage, this might be the best regulatory compromise by any government.",
