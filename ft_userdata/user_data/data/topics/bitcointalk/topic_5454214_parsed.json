Then type the \"Root Key\" and \"Chain Code\" below.Click \"Restore Wallet\" and finish the rest of the steps.Then to extract the private keys, refer to the link in the reply above.But it's safer to set-up Electrum with your private keys on an offline machine and restore only the addresses on an online machine as watching-only wallet.Then, here's how to spend from that set-up: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html#create-an-unsigned-transaction (has outdated images but should be similar to the latest)",

Of course there are those who use their wallets on their everyday device and have not yet been hacked, but this does not mean that an email back up or any form of electronic storage should be used when there is an offline option.- Jay -",

(or something longer):Code:ra9gZBrlLJFzccxUMivcxayS5I2BliPqavhgqDk9/eI=IDK if it's an Armory backup since I haven't used the 2012 version.Or it might be an individual private key that you've imported to Armory so it's worth trying to decrypt it and encode into WIF format.It's hard to tell with the current info.For reference, Armory's \"Root Key\" and \"Chain Code\" both look like random groups of four letters separated by whitespaces.",

It will result in multiple files for a given wallet. Don't concern yourself with that, you'll be able to spend.",
