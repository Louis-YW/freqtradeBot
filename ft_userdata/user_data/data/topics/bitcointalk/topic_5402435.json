Governments eventually stopped that backing and effectively stole all that gold from the people, so it is not surprising a similar process has began against bitcoin already.",

It seems that is still impossible for now.Microstrategi just reported that its current leveraged position in bitcoin would be liquidated if bitcoin fell to a price of $21,000 and its current low of $22,812, which is a figure very close to Microstrategi's bankruptcy. and now the loss position of microstrategy is around $800 million.Not only Microstrategy, big companies like TESLA and the country that adopted Bitcoin for the first time, namely EL Salvador, also suffered a lot of losses. Of course they will not remain silent. We are just waiting to see what will happen next.",

When big alts are buying bitcoin and using as collateral, it shows the power of bitcoin to become the reserve store of value within the crypto ecosystem. That's good for bitcoin because the demand stays strong. They could have purchased any xyz cryptocurrencies but instead they are buying bitcoins to back themselves. It's a positive!

Some of them are sure to attract users with promises like \"Why use bitcoin, where you can only generate 50 bitcoins every few months? Use shitcoin instead, and you'll get 51 shitcoins every 2 minutes\".Of course the cheap imitators will disappear as quickly as those 1990s \"internet currencies\" like flooz and beenz, but lots of people will get burned along the way.It’s funny that it was foreseen in 2010 already.Blend out the promises they make first, and then just look at the monetary properties they offer, and it becomes clear they’re way inferior to Bitcoin. An altcoin can start out good and with well intentions, but if immutability isn’t there you can’t guarantee how long this is the case. It’s like taking a gamble that you can’t influence.And that’s what separates Bitcoin from all of them. If they don’t even make sense from an economic point of view, then what makes you think they have global adoption potential? Beware of empty hype.",
