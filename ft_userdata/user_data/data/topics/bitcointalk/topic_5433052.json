  "content": "I got to know about BTC in 2016 through a friend who introduced me to a pyramid scheme. I bought 0.0334 units of BTC at $20.9. I didn't know the risks associated with online wallets then, so I stored it in my blockchain.com wallet. I sent the BTC to an upline member hoping to receive it back from 2 downline members I introduced to the scheme. To cut the story short the pyramid scheme turned out to be a scam and I lost my BTC. Today, I was browsing through my phone and I stumbled on my blockchain.com wallet and I decided to check it out, lo and behold the value of the BTC in my wallet left me with mixed emotions. I was happy being that even in bear market, the BTC that I bought at $20.98 has appreciated to $566.11 and also I was sad because I wish I had invested in BTC instead of the pyramid scheme. I didn't buy Bitcoin until 3 years after. I really missed that golden opportunity to get it at such rate. Well the good news is that... The bear market is a good time to fill my bags and I got myself some BTC and I'll hodl unto it. You never can tell what price BTC could hit in the coming years.Transaction hash of my first BTC purchase 2016: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/0ffb4d64715a09d61491dab5d2ecceb7bd67f52aea61da19e4d168d8bf24caa1",

      "body": "I can relate to this. I already lof of Bitcoins lost in the early days of my journey when I started to introduce Bitcoin. I also a lot of pyramid or Ponzi schemes I joined before and even if I didn't deposit a ton of money before, I made a lot by just inviting someone, that's how I am dedicated before but later on, most of their earnings are lost to a lot of scams and altcoins that I bought using my Bitcoin. This will be a lesson for us.",

I learned lessons from it, but I payed for it a bit dearly. Later on in my Bitcoin journey, I fell victim once again, this time to a centralized exchange that went bankrupt. Again, I learned my lessons, but not before I payed for it.I guess many of us here in the Bitcoin community share the same rough road. But we're still here. We're still going forward. Instead of crying over spilled milk, we're making the most of the opportunities at hand. I guess there's a reward waiting for us in the end. Or so I hope.",

Mistakes like this are common, regardless of the various cases experienced, regret always comes when knowing the true reality. Bitcoin will continue to run, bitcoin growth cannot be separated from fluctuations that require you to be patient when the price is below. No need to rush to get riches in an instant way, walk slowly, sooner or later you will arrive at your destination safely. Remember, never keep any assets on an exchange for a long time, the risk of loss is very vulnerable if something unexpected happens to the exchange.",

At least you're accidentally remember your old wallet and your cellphone still able to survive for six years long, usually people change or lost their phone after 2-3 years. The most important part is, just buy Bitcoin when it's still cheap and hold it for long time.",

I remember to have made more than 0,001BTC daily back then only on faucets, planning to grow those earnings into something substantial. 100,000 satoshis on those times didn't worth too much, I think something around 0,40$-0,50$. But I wasn't disappointed about that, because I believed on the big potential of PONZI SCHEMES! There were a plenty of offers where you could earn more than 1% daily over your investments at the conservative ponzi schemes, as there were also the turbo ones offering 10% daily or so. Then I believed that could be true, although under the name of cloud mining services. All those opportunities made me believe it should be possible to grow micro earnings to hundreds or thousands on long term.And indeed it was possible, but not through scam schemes, rather through the simple act of holding! And it's never too late to start holding. Forget previous losses, have a new beginning from zero with bitcoin, it's still time to prepare yourself for the next bull run!",

And I think this is the stigma that left a bad test for bitcoin, and that it became synonymous to scams like pyramiding. I myself was a victim of bitcoin doubler, and just like you thinks that I can double my money and have a downline. But in less than a month, the website closed and the rest is history.

The one who makes a 20x or 30x often sells because he doesn't know what the future is going to look like and prefers to have the money in hand now.There are worse stories.

Its better to take this as learning opportunity and dont repeat this mistake in future when we have bigger crypto portfoilio.
