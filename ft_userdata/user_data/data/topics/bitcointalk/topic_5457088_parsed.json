The way I see it, it's a currency supporting his administration and it's conservative followers and Patriots. It may well be a another one since it's not the first Trump likeness to have been sold with the promises of it going to be a legal tender.Too bad people have been burnt as a result of this get rich quick promises they're making.",

And then this manipulators chooses Trump coin to be their next altcoin that they are going to create a hype and pump it and then sold everything. And there will be a lot of victims here, those who jump the bandwagon and most likely this are newbies.",

This is not a winner takes all, just like the recent Memes mania we had, you can be late to one and win with the other. I know Trump has NFT which is a better bet for me than these tokens",

I would say that developers are really made fun of for creating coins that have no intrinsic value. I won't be surprised if this would hit some hyped because of its name but I don't think this will survive and gain long-term investors. I ignore this kind of project creation. If we want to have a good investment, it should be put on potential coins, not into the projects that are just driven by such hyped. This coin has the HUGE potential to scam...that was my opinion.",
