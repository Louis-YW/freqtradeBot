Instead of doing that, they would have came in compliance where those gambling sites could have started paying task to further developed the country through those revenues.Suggestion: Don't you think using a VPN will help you have access to the site?Unlike our country when the government ban us from having access to twitter there where means of gaining access which many were using vpn.",

But any gambling site seen to not follow the regulatory laws should be banned. But I am always surprised how the governments knows the gambling sites that launder mone when the good people known in the public are having their own sides that they can not expose to public which is also criminality.",

Even if, launderers will still find a way to jump the hoop. Politicians and other criminal elements supposedly responsible for such a turning point decision should have been tasked heavily by an instituted regulatory body, so as to discourage laundering over a certain limit.Â Also, most of these sites would tackle the issue with other credentials and perhaps a fat envelope to lift the ban on them. It will boil down to those who are really illegal without intentions of applying for legality in the trade.",

When government take this kind of action to ban casinos they are punishing the public more than the politicians that trying to cheat through laundering of money and now is important question. Who is politician and who is government, this people are the same. The politicians go into power and become government but violate the system, take the people property yet announce a ban. I understand that in Bangladesh too things like that happen and who are the offenders, the same politicians.",

And if the government thinks that money laundering happens due to crypto, then they should ban every site related to crypto. People can do money laundering through crypto exchanges as well. And how about transferring money from one decentralised wallet to another wallet location in another country?I think govt. use the word \"money laundering\" as an excuse and real purpose is to discourage the use of crypto currencies. Perhaps Bangladesh government want to prohibit gambling too but there should be a valid reason for it and not just a lame excuse of money laundering.",
