To prevent being scammed, remember two things: 1) No one you don't know is going to give you money for free.2) Never send money to anyone yourself first under the promise that they will return it to you with a profit, in this case double the amount.",

The one who have access is the scammer, if you send to scammer address on legit centralized exchanges, there's a chance to recover it.I did not bother to check that YouTube video because I know already that it is a scam and that people should avoid the site. But how did you know that a private key wallet is used or not? There are some wallet explorers that can be used to know if an address belongs to an exchange or not, but already existing address that the exchange has used in making transactions. The coin sent can not be reversed and to recover it would be very difficult, but if the money is so huge, he can consult Chainanalysis about it but money would be needed for Chainanalysis to make investigations. The best is to prevent than cure, because once the money is sent, it is likely it won't be recovered.Never pay recovery service, sites that are promising you that they can recover the coin for you, they only want to scam you too. Also if the money is not huge like thousands or millions of dollars, never waste your time on small amount of money.",

How can i recover my BTC?Unfortunately, you can't recover any of your hard earn BTC because as others have said, this is more likely a scam site. I didn't check the website, but it sounds like a bitcoin doubler. And we all know that it is a scam, many of us has fall for that trick before and we have warn people about it specially newbies. I guess you are late. But take this as a good lessons to learn here in crypto, don't just trust anyone who says that they are gong to double your bitcoin, because they won't.",

Even a legit business can't give you double profit, so how they will give this in a short time. This is a very old scam method around the crypto world.

There are no investment sites that will double your investment by just transferring your coins to their website they are most likely scam. The weird thing is that how did you find this website? Do you own this doubler?Because the website currently does not have any good backlinks only here and the LinkedIn and it's also posted on the BMF forum so how did you end up investing in this website?Since the domain was registered on www.nic.ru you can report it there or contact email@nic.ru about this website to take down or ban this domain. Adding this I review the source code a bit and the console is disabled he uses this script console-ban v3.2.0 and other protection scripts to avoid someone to open the console like right-clicking disable.",
