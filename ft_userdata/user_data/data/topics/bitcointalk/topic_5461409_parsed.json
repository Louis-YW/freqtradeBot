How to do ?Find a job that we meet with many people,So, if you can do a job that meets lots of people who have a lot of quality,and we have plenty of time to engage.- what work is that?For example, being a luxury car salesperson, selling property, selling luxury apartments, and many more. Because being a salesperson is not just selling goods, but to build relationships and earn the trust of users or customers. In this relationship, the commission is much more expensive than just selling goods, and if our goods are sold, it will be a bonus for us. Well, that's the way to build an instant relationship without spending money, but instead we are given money.",
