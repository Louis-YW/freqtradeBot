Since he did not leave behind instructions for his family and his Bitcoins were protected by a passphrase he took his Bitcoins to the grave, leaving nothing for his loved ones.",

Even though I doubt I'll ever use it (at least not for inheritance but I might for the gift), will check it out. Thnx for sharing.",

Besides the legal procedure that may be defined to a certain degree on a per country bases, there is the actual, let's say, technical side of things to consider ‚Äì meaning how any potential heir may gain access to the bitcoins. One of the threads to read though would be this one: Halloween inspired poll ‚Äìwould your Bitcoins get passed on if you suddenly died?It offers insights into what people have planned in this sense, but also, and rather shockingly (as one might expect though), the poll showed that a very significant amount of people were aware that the chances of their heirs being able to access the bitcoins where small to none ‚Äì and that is on a biased environment where people tend to become more conscious of these things precisely because we talk about them recurrently.",

If you care for your assets, then you should learn to value them while you are completely alive. The reason why we need our family too or even a trusted friend to be inclined about bitcoin so that if we pass away, our loved ones can inherit them and use them purposefully. But it will be more satisfying on our part if they will continue what we have started since bitcoin's value will keep on increasing and would mean a very huge amount in the future. Otherwise, once we die, our assets will also be left with nothing and will become useless in the end.",

Obviously, if your family think it's a joke as you've mentioned, that can make it somewhat difficult. However, there's nothing stopping you from making the wallet that you want to inherit it too, and give that to them. Tell them to keep it safe, and that's all you ask. At least then, when the event comes they get to decide, and have that option open to them. Most people won't say no to an inheritance. Regardless if it was fiat, Bitcoin or watches they don't wear. If it has a value, they'll likely accept. Even if it's out of honouring your loss.",

IMO, instead of putting that in a bank safe for which if no one claims that, it will be their property after wards. The better approach I guess is to have your own safe at home and just put it there and let your family or relatives you want to give it open it for you as you pass away.You can be the one to make those instructions on how they'll gain access to those bitcoins that you left them. It's easy these days but still be careful with the resources because it's better to make a personal instruction so that they won't go to any website or ask it elsewhere that might fool them during the retrieval.",
