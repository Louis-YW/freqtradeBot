They want the money, they want the bags, it's why they are mad that they aren't a part of crypto space from the start, it's why they hated the new millionaires that operates exchanges right under their noses..Now these people can really keep track of your freaking lives and money, congratulations.

There would be lot of condition that would guide the exchange which taxation could be their top most target. One thing about the US is that they are too trickish sorry to say this if you are from US because they tried all they could to break down some of the cryptocurrency exchange but didn't succeed and instead of them to be left out completely they decided to build there exchange to be in the competitive race with some other well known exchange.My questionon is after this their launch; would bitcoin be legalized and Adopted Globally after building their own exchange?",

The good thing is people who fall in love with centralized exchange will see this as an improvement, but for real Bitcoin maximalist, it's a huge threat for them especially they're live in US.",

It's always about the money and will always be, know this and accept peace. What i think is, they already have resources to track our freaking lives and money too, because i have shared a topic a while ago which indicates that most of the people on earth using the internet (or internet users) have connected their lives to a centralized system and one of the biggest centralized app is Facebook, we all know that how Facebook is leaking data and provides users biased information so that they only see what they like, for example, if one likes the Compaign of guns to be legal they will see the ads of political leader against it and if they hate the campaign they will see the ads of same political leader against it. Isn't come to the category of controlling people's life.The point is, whether you use this exchange or not they have already control over your money even the one you are propagating through any type of exchange, and I found no bad in it but to some extent only, because when there is no one to manage the service legally then abuse of that service started. (I hope you understand what I mean). This exchange is just a way for them to keep relaxing those big investors and traders so that they could execute their activities within the USA and the USA could get benefits out of it.",

They want a piece of cake from the large market that they can't avoid. So, if this is going to really happen then this is gonna give more confidence to their users that their funds will be \"safer\" on their end because they're the actual government and it is their own. Now, it's gonna be the choice of people that's gonna go with this government-backed exchange rather than of those that's being fighted back.",

      "body": "Indeed, if everything is evaluated in terms of conspiracy theories against crypto, there will be many surprises and scary stories.In fact, quite obvious events are taking place. In order to return to reality, and realistically assess what is happening, you just need to remember a few facts:1. SEC is not against bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general!2. The SEC considers some altcoins to be shares or similar assets. And that means they fall under tax laws (you have to pay taxes, whether you like it or not!)3. The SEC, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the United States, considers it requires restricting the provision of services and services outside the United States to US citizens, which is quite logical. Because such services become services for money laundering or tax evasion4. Yes, the US does not ban cryptocurrencies, it just wants to \"wrap\" their turnover into legal requirements, as well as for everyone who receives additional income. Therefore, crypto exchanges in the United States are controlled, as well as the movement of funds on them.Now the question is - what's wrong here?! I propose to simulate the situation: you work in a company, receive a salary, and pay taxes on it. To you from the department they take, for the same position as yours, one more employee. BUT ! They allow him a free schedule, 2x your rate, and he does not pay taxes, he is constantly rewarded. What is your reaction? Just be honest, and don't say \"it's a completely different situation\"",

Many people is just blinded by influencers propaganda in social media but SEC is just doing their job to stop those crypto projects that offering security like tokens. Many crypto people is just angry to SEC since they are invested on altcoins that clearly violating the law. A much regulated exchange is much better to have a proper exchange that safe for US customers. This will help US citizens to finally have a peace of mind on using their own centralized exchange.",

What's interesting is that Gary Gansler once submitted a job application to Binance. So is this a coincidence or is it a revenge scheme by exploiting a loophole. Furthermore, Coinbase actually has a little more power to really be able to fight back against the SEC. The initial title of this mess was just some unregistered crypto securities, but the SEC itself has never established a legal benchmark for crypto securities themselves. So that whenever this case is in a gray area.CZ temporarily used the public support under the guise of saving everyone, but the priority was still the Binance company itself and its existence as the largest exchange. I think at the moment the best option is to keep pulling assets out of the centralized exchange and not getting in until everything is completely safe again.",

Do you live in the illusion that they (authorities) couldn't do it before? Authorities just need to request information about users and be sure that each CEX will work and submit this information. So I wonder where you actually see the problem?Maybe you think CZ is some great leader that takes care of its users and does not share their data, while he was enriching himself at the same time, allowing hundreds of scammers to promote and trade their shitcoins through his platform. Besides, do you really think they (the government) are so desperate to profit from cryptocurrencies since they actually have a money printer? What they really want is control, but they can only have it if people let them - in other words, why would anyone even use that new CEX?",

Primarily because centralized exchanges need to die out. This tweet is, if anything, just another a testament to that fact.Bitcoin never has nor ever will need a centralized entity in order to be sold, bought or transacted. Exchanges are just the factor for convenience. I trust a decentralized solution will be thought of, for the poor-coiners who leave their money in the hands of third party wallets just because it makes buying and selling Bitcoin easier.  But that comes at a cost: The government literally owns your money and wallet, if you put your money in a centralized exchange wallet. A centralized entity can be bullied and forced into doing what the government wants.",

Benefiting from Crypto in what way? Are they not already doing that? Are there no current exchanges and firms connected to crypto paying taxes? Are miners high taxes gone now? They are still benefiting from crypto; it's nothing new. If you say they want to control them, that could have sounded better to me. QuoteA centralized exchange that's in the pocket of the very government entities, brave to all the SEC supporters out here, and those that are too blind to see a thing, even while Binance exchange was a centralized exchange, the government still don't have the power to take over the exchange, it's why they use SEC ro fight CZ, and now they come out with their shit bag platform. In as much as most of us are against the SEC coming after Binance and Coinbase, let's not also forget the fact that most of these exchanges hands are not that clean. If you are to operate under any country's jurisdiction, you should do it accordingly. We all know what they are after is either control or tax, and it's not actually far from that. Both parties are not all clean; they all have something in common, which is personal interest. They are doing what they are doing: the SEC in the name of protecting investors; exchanges in the name of helping the crypto community; but behind all this, they all have personal motives.QuoteSo the existence of CBDC and now the government crypto exchange, what does this tell you?

Now these people can really keep track of your freaking lives and money, congratulations. If they eventually launch the exchange as they are planning to, it won't really be that bad for those who do not care about privacy. To some point, it might even be safer than some centralized exchanges out there since it might be backed up at some point by the regulatory authorities, and we might likely see a lesser case like that of the FTX exchange. Even if it happens, the government will probably try to pay everyone back in order for them to save their names. But when this form of exchange is used, the customers should be aware that they are back in the banking sector era, where your funds could be frozen at any time, where you will be limited to where to send and where not to send your funds, where from your login location to wherever you are being properly taken note of, and all of thatQuoteIt's always about the money and will always be, know this and accept peace.You sound too upset with the SEC and it's collaborators in this recent news as if you have some personal problem with them directly. We all know that no one is running anything out there currently that will not benefit them in one way or another.
