To connect with people (relevant to that field) you have to interact with them, involves liking, commenting, private messaging etcNOTE: do not spam• Be consistent with your engagements,• Provide value beyond your art, there are a thousand and one arts out there, try to stand out with other helpful content,• Remain consistent,• Constantly read and learn about building an online presence.Alternatively, you could always hire a social media manager.",

But you have to accept Bitcoin as a requirement to advertise in the services board. Feel free to browse through it a bit to see how other users are promoting themselves.

      "body": "The answer is quite simple. You still need to learn marketing of your project. Yes you indeed have talent for the nft however, not all nft me succesful cause we made one. What you need is traction and seeing there is no revenue sales, is probably due to lack of creativity or uniqueness? Dont get me wrong. Nft is great, but the taste of the community should be seen from the activity of those nft on the market. Its not too late, can still do a lot of things to make others noticed it.",

      "body": "Seeing your artworks in Twitter, I am afraid that a classical/abstract approach wouldn't get much traction in public as opposed to a digitally/3d modelled artworks which can be enhanced using various computer software. I am an artist as well and from what I have experienced, modern looking NFT's are far more marketable than those traditionally looking NFT's arts. When I say modern, these are NFT's that is created using 3d modelling software such as blender, autodesk, fusion and what not. And I know the artscene in cryptospace sucks especially when you are not as popular as Beeple or else you can't make any sale even if you have a genuine motive.You just have to admit that the NFT space won't be profitable if you are a one man team, no partnership to major companies, working product, and modern looking artworks.",

      "body": "As pointed out by @Maus0728 above that you are into competitive market of NFT and you have only 34 twitter followers and you would need marketing strategies to sell out your work which I am afraid is hard to do so.If you see from forum perspective then there's a collectibles section where you can see lot of members are interested in buying physical stuff that can be transferred to them via shipment but don't think so your NFT sale would happen there but still you can try out there.Or the other way is you can ask for help by reaching out members that can help your project grow but they will be paid service.You see there are really good artwork projects out there that are not able to sell without reaching the target audience so how do you think your artwork would sell easily.See don't get me wrong and I appreciate your efforts but if we are seeking fund raise then we also need to look at all the aspects like art improvement, marketing and what utility will it offer to the holders.So make sure you make some plans accordingly and then try to sell your artwork.One advice is you will get lot of people on twitter so make contact with them and your target audience is also there so reach them out.",

      "body": "Selling NFT is indeed quite difficult at the moment, especially if we don't have an active community network of holders or buyers for NFT, whether art, meme, or P2E. If you want to do fundraising, try making an announcement in this forum, and don't forget to be active on twitter/other social media, or, if you already have an NFT that ready to sell, you have to try to offering it on the marketplace board. This is the best way if you don't want to spend money on marketing for your project. Then, you should have more explanation about the value of the NFT/project you offer. Because with value, maybe you will find quality prospects for your project. Wll, to be honest, without network, you will hard to get customer except you are doing an airdrop with your NFTs or any giveaway. Sometimes, from doing this, you will find a customers.",

You can start up creating facebook page where you can post your artworks for free so that you can get the attention of the collectors then follow your daily activity.If you get tons of supporters then maybe that's the best time to sell out your arts by making it as an NFT.  since going to early without having a good background will make you struggle to find some investors on your project.",

Your art must be unique, marketable, then you must know how to engage with clients for the marketing, it requires time and quality efforts altogether to arrived with a good result.",
