I thought those like Ordinals are benefiting from taproot more. Is that not correct? There are many people that are still using bech32 addresses because it has the lowest fee for transaction except when the inputs are more. If the inputs and outputs are the same and if the outputs are many than the inputs, bech32 addresses have lower fee. All wallets that I have seen that is having bech32m are having bech32 as their default derivation path.",

I actually downgraded some of my wallets from Taproot, back into Segwit, to send a message, that \"I am not a spammer, and I am going to spend that output in the future, by using just a single signature\".Of course, I support Taproot, but it is nice to have a way to say to the world, that \"I am not a spammer\". In case of P2WPKH, I can explicitly state, that \"I know, what is the maximum amount of on-chain bytes that I am going to push\". In case of P2TR, it is not the case: it can go as far, as the maximum size of the block. And this is a good reason to downgrade, and not be filtered out by some nodes, which try to fight with Ordinals spam.More than that: I guess some people didn't upgrade to Segwit, just because you can sign a message conveniently, only if you have some legacy address. In other cases, it is more complicated.",

People prefer to use bech32 because the fee for p2pkh is much. Segwit reduces the fee to like 42% or more. For the sites that was not able to adopt p2wpkh fast, p2wpkh-p2sh was created which was the reason it was also common that time.Wallet developers know that p2pkh has too much fee and were fast to to support p2wpkh and make it their default. Some wallets like Electrum even removed p2pkh. That makes p2wpkh very common. Segwit still has the lowest fee till now except your transaction has more inputs. There are even some wallets like Electrum that has not support p2tr but they will likely support it soon. The fee will not make people really talk about it as an issue because people still like p2wpkh.",

Taproot makes the terms of the contract private when the keyspend path is used.let me make things clear for youwhen someone makes a taproot address.. that address is a hash of some termsmuch like multisig is a hash of multiple addresses, a taproot address is a hash of multiple terms in a merkle treeit does not require a exchange to know the terms or create the terms. they just put the finished hash(provided by customer) as a destination of a withdrawal.. they only need to know the destination of withdrawals not the terms of that hash, thats it. they dont need to be \"taproot\" compliant because there is no need to create the hash within the exchange they just need to know where funds go. user that want complex contracts create those contracts in private and offchain they only need to reveal part/all of the terms to the blockchain later on after receiving funds to it. where the user(s) then want to spend the funds on the address..  so dont need to get involved with the exchange to need the exchange to be part of the contract terms. all a exchange need to know is the destination of a withdrawalill say it again in different wording to save having to post again to correct your mis understandingan exchange does not need to be part of the contract to fund the address so an exchange does not need to be taproot compliant just to fund itand you do not need to publish the terms to the blockchain prior to handing the taproot address to people who you wish to fund it",

If you use P2WPKH, then you can always expect a single signature, and you can always calculate, what is the maximum size of your on-chain footprint.
