I haven't read about Hydranet and the DEX they want to release, can you provide an initial narrative on this and explain at least the basics? you're @OP and you should be responsible for the initial narrative, not just trash words.",

      "body": "Here is the Hydranet Roadmap Update: 2023 — 2024 :2023 RoadmapQ4 — 2023Hydranet Client DEX (Core DEX):    Release of an API interface for bot integration    Implementation of trading fee reduction for HDN holders    Add new pairs and tokens (based on DAO votes)    Debugging and fixes of potential bugs    Incremental UI enhancementsDetails: The Client DEX, from now on called “Core DEX”, will continue to operate and be maintained (until the Web DEX is in public mainnet), while the focus is transitioned to developing the Web Wallet and Web DEX.Hydranet Web Wallet:    Development of a proof-of-concept Web Wallet    Demonstration of UI and UX capabilities    Iterative updates and improvements of the UI/UX, to enhance user experience    Launch of a closed beta version on testnet for an initial internal group of users    Integration of additional capabilities based on user feedback and internal testingDetails: Hydranet’s Web Wallet offers on-chain and off-chain activities like sending, receiving, and setting up channels, both for BTC and EVM (ETH, ARB, POLYGON, and more) networks.Hydranet Web DEX:    Showcase of a proof-of-concept to exhibit the capabilities and advantages of a Web DEX    Release of UI/UX designsDetails: Hydranet’s Web DEX aims to offer off-chain exchange technology to everyone — desktops, laptops, mobile phones alike. This will not only increase accessibility and enable a user base on a completely new level but also improve the overall user experience.Marketing and PR:    Host Hydranet DEX bug bounty program    Host Hydranet DEX trading competitions    Creation and distribution of informational materials regarding the Web Wallet and Web DEX    Publish Hydranet DEX stats page    Host engaging social media competitions to create buzz and increase user baseOrganization:    Update the current team overview    Publish Hydranet DEX Network LitepaperHDN Token:    Define and describe possible actors in the Hydranet DEX Network, above all Guardians (Watchtowers) and Titans (Hubs)    Publish reward visualization (calculation) tool of the Hydranet DEX NetworkDetails: HDN should have more utilities than being a simple governance token. Therefore, it is planned to be used as security collateral for important actors within the Hydranet DEX Network. HDN token holders will not only have the power to determine which pairs and tokens are added to the Hydranet DAO Hub but can also assume important roles within the network.Hydranet’s Lithium:    Research and develop a new EVM off-chain protocol    Add hashlock payment settlement    Add the option to provide trustless channel liquidityDetails: Different EVM State channel solutions, like Connext’s Vector, the Raiden Network, and Plasma, all have different benefits, but also various shortcomings. For instance, the Connext Vector protocol doesn’t allow multiple routing nodes, which is a necessity for a future multi-hub architecture in the Hydranet DEX Network. Hydranet’s Lithium protocol aims to overcome these issues and enable faster, multi-hop off-chain payments.Research and Development:    Research trustless liquidity provisioning for channel liquidity    Explore and innovate the HDN Tokenomics Version 2.0    Initiate an overhaul of the existing orderbook for enhanced performance and decentralization    Research of an external signer for Bitcoin and Lightning transactions, for increased security and flexibilityDetails: To provide users with the best possible experience, we are continuously working to integrate the latest technologies into the DEX. This work requires thorough research and experimentation.Open sourcing (Core DEX):Preparation:    Code Review: Ensure no sensitive data is in the code    Documentation: Create necessary guides and protocols    Licensing: Choose a suitable open-source license.2024 RoadmapDisclaimer: While future plans naturally grow less precise over time, we’re excited to share our initial goals for 2024. Remember, as leaders in the fast-paced crypto industry, it is expected that milestones might shift, expand, or be replaced. This reflects our dedication to innovation and adaptability. Thank you for your understanding and support!Q1 — 2024Web Wallet:    Public testnet release to expand the testing base and gather comprehensive feedback    Release external Bitcoin signer for testnetWeb DEX:    Merging of the Web Wallet into Web DEX for seamless functionality    Commence a comprehensive re-write of the order book to improve performance and enable decentralizationHydranet’s Lithium:    Add multi-hop routing    Fee optimization of smart contracts to be even more competitive in comparison to on-chain DEXsDetails: Multi-hop routing of off-chain transactions is a necessity for the Hydranet DEX Network to be able to host a multiple-hub architecture. This feature is essential to improve the decentralization aspect of the Hydranet DEX.HDN Token:    Announcement and presentation of the HDN tokenomics update    Begin implementing the tokenomics update to improve system functionality and valueResearch:    Research Hybrid swaps, i.e., Layer 1 <> Layer 2 swaps. For instance, Bitcoin Lightning <> Arbitrum On-chain    Research on-chain governance for HDN tokenOpen Sourcing (Core DEX):Onboard More Users    Marketing: Amplify outreach efforts    Tutorials: Offer better user guidance    Feedback: Continuously gather user insights.Q2/Q3 — 2024Hydranet’s Web DEX:    Closed beta Testnet release    Implementation of potential additional features (user feedback)    UI/UX updates    Public Beta Testnet    Closed Beta Mainnet Release    Release external Bitcoin signer as Metamask “Snap” (https://metamask.io/snaps/)Note: In early 2024 we aim to unite the Web Wallet and Web DEX development into one project only, the Hydranet Web DEX.HDN Token:    Mainnet deployment of Hydranet Network actors    Implement on-chain governance    Get a security audit of new Tokenomics smart contractsHydranet’s Lithium:    Get security audit    Open-source Lithium codeMarketing / PR    Prepare release campaign for the Web DEX    Update 2024 RoadmapOpen sourcing (Core DEX):Higher Limits    Evaluate Feedback: Ensure platform readiness for the removal of temporary limitations    Update Docs: Reflect any significant DEX changes    Announce Transition: Inform users about the DEX’s increased channel rental and trading limitsOpen sourcing (Core DEX):    Repository: Set up, e.g., GitHub repository    Publish Code: Make Core DEX code public with essential documentation    Engage Community: Encourage contributions and issue solutionshttps://medium.com/@Hydranet",
