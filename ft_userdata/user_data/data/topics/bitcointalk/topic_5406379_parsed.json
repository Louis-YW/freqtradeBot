It will be fair!You say that the bets are made fairly, but we will not give you a bonus and do not name the reason! So you are scammers!And I want to get you a red flag!The bookmaker obviously could not keep up with its competitors, the offers were much worse than those of others and, as a result, lost all customers. Now he began to deceive even his only customers!This is what happens when a bad manager runs a company - it closes and deceives all its customers!p.s.  https://prnt.sc/anlkLf5hp0z8",

I'm sure there is a specific valid reason why they cant give you the bonus, it is just weird if you say that the reason is that they dont want to do it. As long as I know, there are always requirements/rules for every promotion in Fortunejack. Did you do something against the rules?",

Provide the screenshot of the whole conversation from the start. The support seems explained to you how you violate the bookmaker ToS. I’m interested to see her explanation since he provided it to you based on your latest screenshot.No one here will believe you if you are hiding or censoring the whole conversation to the support because we are all fair here and we need to see both side explanation. dont know how add all conversation here!actually I provided enough information!do you want to hear both sides? Great! I want to hear the other side too! And let the other side answer your questions!Knock on his wall. Ask the bookmaker to comment on his actions!Although I doubt very much that there will be any reaction at all. I don't have any reputation here. I created an account to leave a review.If you want or are trying to play the role of an arbiter, then first bring the defendant here and let him comment on the situation! Otherwise, your comments contain a particle of distrust and trust in the bookmaker in advance!",

I want you to answer only here, so that everything is as transparent as possible!And the first thing I would like to start with is to ask you a question:do you admit that you sent me a promo offer in which you ask me to make bets for two days and then receive a bonus freebet on the 3rd day???I also want to note that the promo indicates a bet size of at least 5 mBTC - which is not a small amount at all!p.s. in the continuation of the story. FJ refused to withdraw the rest of my money, saying that according to their rules it is too small for withdrawal - 3.65mbtcSeriously! you break your own rules against me, but refuse to give the rest of the money???in an attempt to raise the balance to the minimum withdrawable amount (yes, I had to continue betting with these scammers), I lost all the remaining money!Well lured me with an offer",
