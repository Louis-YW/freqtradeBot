  "content": "After the initiation of Faucet where traders were gifted 5 btc each, the integration of bitcoin exchange began with bitcoin market as the first exchange in the cryptocurrency market launched 2010. Buyers sent Paypal to the bitcoin seller then the exchange holds the funds until the sellers gets the funds. So they served as Escrow during the period. And it was the only exchange that is similar to the exchange of today. https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-exchanges-early-mt-gox-hack",

Just imagine the person who bought 40 btc for 10$ back then if he/she was holding till now, which investment way more than that?. This is how our today market will definitely be a reference to many in times to come when btc and crypto currency market will take a new phase.",

Hashrate is lower, difficulty is lower and miners can get Bitcoin from mining more easily than now.It is like mining Bitcoin in 2017 is more easily than in 2022 and financial input for mining 1 Bitcoin in the past is cheaper than now.I think we can look at the past record and say something, regret, have wishes but why don't do something wisely for fututer. Buying a bitcoin and holding it next 10 years. in 2032, people will wish they can revert the time to buy Bitcoin under $20,000.",

I was wondering what those people that came across Bitcoin in those early days and sold off would have thought about when the price of Bitcoin started growing. I keep going back to this story of Shiksay “Sziky” Miklos who left a comment for Sports.ru about participating in the AoV iCCup StarLeague. At the tournament, the cybersportsman took 5th place and received 25 bitcoins. Then they were valued at $ 41. Imagine taking $40 instead of 25 Bitcoins those Bitcoin are worth above $500k at today's price.  only if they knew.",

Many of the early adopters sold everything they had at the point of the price reaching like 50x or 100x compared to what it was when they first entered the game. I can't blame them, I would surely do exactly the same thing. Only now I know that when dealing with BTC, it is better to not sell everything at once. Keep 20%, at least, just in case it will cost much more in 2 years than the 80% you are selling today.",

Imagine how difficult it is to hodl bitcoin now compared to when they got those coins free. Only the believers held and some may have forgotten about their bitcoin private keys. It was more like a testnet in my opinion. 5btc was so little that it was gifted to multiple users. A time will come when the next generation of bitcoin will wish to be us.",
