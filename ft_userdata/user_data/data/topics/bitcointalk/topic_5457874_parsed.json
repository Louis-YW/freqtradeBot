  "content": "In 2016, when I first heard about Bitcoin. I never had any knowledge of the existence of a bitcointalk forum or even a detailed idea of Bitcoin itself, the first mistake I made was to listen to people's advice in respect to investing in Bitcoin. When I started reading and researching about bitcoin and its technology, A time came when I made up my mind to invest my little savings in it, but I decided to involve my parents, siblings and friends so that we can invest concurrently. But They came to the conclusion that bitcoin and all online investments are scams and I should not make such a wrong step if not, that am going to lose my money, I was confuse at that point, I thought of how I manage to save such amount of money, the fear of losing it, And what will be my fate if I lose it to scammers made me to succumb to their suggestion, in all, this got me dissuaded, this made me give up in knowing more about Cryptocurrency in general, and my investment plan in this indistructive decentralized digital currency (Bitcoin) and because I had no idea that a forum like Bitcointalk where new ideas are shared and bitcoin matters are been discussed by different people is in existence, but the good thing now is that even though I got notice of this forum late, I have learned numerous things in a short time here, for this reason I am always open to learning at any time from anybody.moral Lesson:when people give you advice, their intention may be good for you, but unknowingly to them that they have temporarily or permanently made you lose a lifetime opportunity that's if you listen to their advice. after listening to individual advice, it is your duty and decision as a person to filter the advice before making use of the ones you see that will be helpful to you. There is no harm in trying new ideas, just imagine, if I had attempted such innovations, even if is with a small amount of money, may be by now I would have been rich.In this life, If you want to grow financially, one risk or the other must be involved.In the pursuit of success, you must lose to learn a particular technique for the avoidance of its repetition.Don't live your life according to the criticism and dictates around you, If not, you will be suffocated with stained ideas, as long as you don't cause people's pain, chase your dreams, enquire and develop yourself in such a way that people will see you as a role model. People must talk, just be who you are, and be committed to making your dreams a reality.I am where I am today because I was unable to understand the value of making use of my instinct, But at least the knowledge I have about Bitcoin in the recent time is very tremendous more than before, from now onward nobody will ever discourage me from investing in any commodity that I see as a profitable one, no matter the risk that's involved. I will take it, There is no harm in trying with a small amount of money.",

      "body": "We should not regret what is out of our hands, I know at the start, it was in your hand to follow the one who was giving you the advice to invest in BTC but you were afraid to do so and in my POV you did the right thing by not following them. Even it could make you rich but still as I said do not regret it at that moment what if things went sideways and instead of being rich you could end up as poorer?The point is, we should always avail ourselves the opportunities even if we have less or more money, and risk is a factor that keeps everyone going and far away too. Because, if becoming rich without any risk factor would be a thing then everyone on earth will be rich now. I also made up my mind to buy BTC with my cousin, but we didn't have money so we thought we should borrow some money at that time we both were not earning any money as we both were students and dependent on our parent's money. So I suggest him to drop this idea as it contains so much risk and additional stress in our life. Why we should step into such a mess of borrowing money first and then investing in BTC in the hope to earn more is still a doubt. At that time, we both didn't have any idea about BTC halving so I only saw it as a token that will gain value when there will be more demand and it does but we were both afraid to take the risk and dropped the idea. But if we took the risk then we will have earned a lot of profit in 2021 (at the time of the new ATH). But as I said do not regret what is out of our hands now. We should focus on the current situation because if you had gained the knowledge which you lacked before then you must be more confident about BTC price than before. So, what is your idea now, are you ready to take the risk now or not? If I were you, yeah I will take the risk and invest in BTC. (It is just my opinion, not a financial advice).",

It’s always ideal to never invest your hard-earned money on other people’s advice. It’s always beneficial that you should do a personal research and then only invest in that. I'm glad to see that you finally found out so many things about Bitcoins and also about this amazing forum. Now don’t think about or regret your past. Just right now, buy as many Bitcoins as you can and hold them for some time.",

I will take it, There is no harm in trying with a small amount of money.There are many people who come late to invest in bitcoin for various reasons, but it's never too late to enter investment because opportunities are open to anyone and are never limited, but what must be understood is how far we understand how to make the right investment Because it takes consistency in collecting bitcoins in the absence of large capital support and knowledge is an innovation that can lead one to conclusions.Bitcoin has shown its existence even though there is a risk in it, many people don't understand the travel pattern so they don't draw conclusions when investing. When someone understands how to make the right investment, many people will come to invest in bitcoin independently, it's never too late and the opportunity depends on how you take advantage of it.",

The price of Bitcoin will still go up so we should take advantage of the opportunity at our disposal. I am sure in a few years people will also regret that they didn't buy at the current price. Yes, you lost a good opportunity to buy but it shouldn't be the reason not to seek advice from people. But we should always take advice from people that are proficient in the area we intend to invest. You are regretting that you didn't buy in 2016, but you might have lost it because you were not well informed about securing your coins.

Many around me speak as if they're experts, as if they are authority in everything. I listen to them but I don't necessarily follow them.

I’ve got friends who years ago I was trying to convince to invest at least a small portion of their savings in BTC and they were aggressively contradicting my facts with their imagined thoughts and beliefs. I get that mainstream media gets you to believe a thing although it’s not always true, but it’s very annoying. Don’t tell me something’s a scam if you don’t even know what I’m talking about.Follow your instinct and don’t let yourself be emotionally disrupted by the thoughts of those around you. I found they often pulled me back from my plans and now I have many plans I regret not following because I know they would’ve been successful. But that doesn’t matter - if they were wrong 10 times they’ll continue to be wrong an 11th time too..",

When it comes to Bitcoin investmen, you don't lose to learn rather you learn to earn and you earn when you gain that is the reason why Bitcoin investors are always advised to have knowledge of the type of investment they want to venture in to before investing so that they don't end up taking risks that will see them lose funds as a result of lack of knowledge.The only thing you lose in pursuit of success is time, the time you make out to get knowledge which will definitely help you to succeed tomorrow when you have gained a lot of knowledge from other investors so don't rush into any investment unless you have the proper knowledge of what you want to invest.",

The story never ends with a recent action, how much they've invested so far into bitcoin since they found the truth. Or is Op not yet sure that bitcoin is a good investment? Bitcoin aside, any investment should be taken without questioning and observe them to learn. Many people lose money everyday on different things believing that it'll pay off in future. I think Op should start investing now and not regret next time.",

But I never invited my friends or family to get involved in Bitcoin investments that I didn't understand at the time, because it would be very risky. When you are a beginner who does not understand Bitcoin and what the risks are, it is a careless act so you will be blamed when the investment falls.
