The halving hasn't happened yetAlso, I have been mining with Braiins pool the entire time, if that makes any differenceIt has nothing to do with the halving. The more miners mine, the less shares you'll get. Let's say the total hashrate for mining bitcoin is 1000 th/s in the world and yours is 10 th/s. You get 1% of the total block prize on average. When the total hash rate doubles (2000 th/s) and yours stay at 10 th/s, you'll get 0.5% of the block rewards on average in the long term.Since there are more and more miners start mining every day, unless you increase your mining power too, you'll always get less satoshis...For this exact reason mining don't make sense for home miners. You have limited space, you have limited budget, you have high electricity costs. You cannot compete.",

Valid blocks must have a hash below this target. Mining pools also have a pool-specific share difficulty setting a lower limit for shares. Difficulty is increasing as much as people are adding hashpower to the total network hashrate.Difficulty can decrease too, if the total hashrate is decreasing.You can look at the total hashrate for the last 3 years:As you know, more hashrate = higher difficulty in order to keep a 10 minutes block interval.So, for the same given hashrate, higher difficulty = your part of block rewards drops",

It is really hard to understand why anyone would provide their device for such low profitability if they can't offset the cost.Aside from low electricity cost, i'd speculate it's dominated by exiting miner (who used to mine ETH) who aim to either,1. Squeeze all money they could get from their GPU.2. Hoping those unpopular PoW coin might be enough to make break even.Although on those case, selling their GPU is probably more sensible option.

The decrease in daily Satoshi earnings could be due to increased Bitcoin network difficulty and potential wear and tear on your mining hardware over time. Also, mining with the Braiins pool could impact your earnings due to different reward structures and fees. Exploring alternative pools or mining settings might help improve your mining performance.",

I also hear people who works on AI sometimes looks for used Nvidia GPU.I see. So some of them probably hold the belief that getting crypto is still better compared to cashing out their GPU right now. I heard the same thing regarding Nvidia GPU. IIRC, the US government even told them to stop selling their GPUs to China due to its AI capabilities. Looks like companies are buying them to take part in the AI race. If I had an Nvidia GPU, selling to them would look like a better deal compared to renting my computing power to Nicehash. On the other hand, companies can also save money if they just use the cloud to get their computing power. Easier to manage to, since they don't need to build a dedicated space for that. CMIIW.",

It is really hard to understand why anyone would provide their device for such low profitability if they can't offset the cost.If you look at the profit of the NVIDIA RTX 4090 video card, which has recently been in the range of 2.5-5 dollars, then this is a good indicator if the problem with cooling these video cards is solved. And on good days, the profit reached 15 dollars per day.But unlike ASIC, such a video card is a very liquid product on the market.",
