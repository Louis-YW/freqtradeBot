If anyone knows, please tell me!You should move this on service discussion https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=85.0 since this is all about the feature of a service.Txbet.io which is the exchange you are using as reference is already shutdown so most of us here doesn’t have any idea how this exchange looks like. It will be easier if you will describe what kind of feature you are looking for on an exchange so that we can suggest you the one that fit to your description.",

      "body": "Visually speaking, I don't think you'll have a hard time adapting to most spot exchanges.Funtionality wise, you'd have to be more specific. But my general answer is, it's a lot more closer to lesser known exchanges with no mandatory KYC e.g. MEXC. I hope you're not aiming for the 0% trading fee subscription plan feature though as you may have a hard time finding that one.",

That seems to be the focus of their business, usually they own the copyright to their designs which I think is impossible to find anywhere else unless they have some kind of cloud service for partners.",

I just checked on the archived version and nothing special visual wise... maybe functional wise, which OP did not mention. Maybe he should just move on. I also experience the difficulty of using a new exchange after moving on from an old one, but I would eventually get used to it.How many still remember the old days of Bittrex and Etherdelta?",

I also experience the difficulty of using a new exchange after moving on from an old one, but I would eventually get used to it.How many still remember the old days of Bittrex and Etherdelta?  Poloniex, Etherdelta for DEX and then Bittrex which those exchangers are ones dominated those early years until they had been replaced by Binance and some known platforms like OKX or KUcoin .. lots to mention.Link given above for the said list which it is really that ideal that you should really be simply sticking into those reputable exchange platforms.Been using up before with Kucoin because of that non mandatory but they had changed up that thing and goes along with the standard and have that mandatory KYc which is shit. https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/crypto-exchange-kucoin-to-introduce-mandatory-id-checks-next-month/Txbit.io? I havent been able to hear up but basing on the long list of current number of exchangers then its not shocking that lots of names cant really be memorized one by one. Its better to make yourself stick into thosehigh ranking or reputable or known ones rather than on going into those non popular because majority of them arent really that could be trusted.Hence, top platforms does have it all.",
