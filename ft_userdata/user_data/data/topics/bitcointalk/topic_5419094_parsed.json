And worse is lottery, but the prizes are also big there.The odds at online gambling are debatable, they depend on the game and the odds the user is choosing (if he can, for example at hi-low). Quote from: https://www.quora.com/Which-has-better-odds-lottery-or-sports-bettingShockingly, the chances of winning the lottery are absurdly low.About what's written at Quora (not necessarily the \"article\", more the answers), well, I'm not shocked on how bad are people at math, but I'm shocked about how little they understand about the world they living in",

Especially if it's just between two teams pitting for a win. Normally the only factors that would really affect your win is how good the teams are, which could easily be discerned with a couple google searches. Lotteries have a reputation of being very hard to win, mathematicians around the world have stated that it's more probable for you to be struck by lightning multiple times than actually be a lottery winner. As for the others you have stated, like gambling, there's more to it than just odds. Innate skills, house edge, and knowledge of the game you are playing are good definers of how probable one is of winning.",

In betting, the bookmaker's advantage is from 4 to 8 percent. In gambling, from 1 to 5 percent. The most expedient game is dice - 1% house edge.But betting has its advantages - a variety of promotions that significantly increase your odds, plus sometimes you can find a bet with favorable odds, that is, literally one where you have an advantage over the bookmaker. There is nothing like it in the lottery or gambling.",

Seems like a rather inane, poorly worded and obvious question really. Sports betting is a form of gambling not a separate category by itself. You probably meant casino games which tend to have pre-defined odds or if it's something like live roulette it has a natural tilt towards the house. Sports betting comes in all forms - from the barely profitable x1.01 odds to infinitely high risk and chance of winning, that could really rival the payout of some lotteries. Casino games will tend to have natural ceilings related to max bet size and the casino is much more likely to take a profit over time. Lotteries are tiny chances of winning but usually counter weighed by high payout amounts.",

      "body": "Lottery is basically the simplest form of gambling. You can easily calculate the probabilities of winning since the rules are very clear and the process of selecting the numbers is random.Online gambling is basically the same as offline casinos. This means that every game will have different odds. Again, the rules are clear, but there are many, many different types of games with different rules, so calculating the odds might be a bit more difficult. The process of each game is still random though, but done in many different ways.Sports betting is similar to online gambling in the sense that there are many different games and each one has different odds. The main difference here is that, although the output of the matches are considered random, some people might have extra information about what's going on in the teams, which makes the process not completely random for some people.For example, let's say there's a match between two teams, but you went out partying the previous night with all the players of one team and they were all drinking alcohol all night.... you have information that might affect the results of the game that the general public might not know, therefore you might be in a better position there.",
