What's your opinion on this security measure? May I ask you, who advised that?As far as I know, forum does not recommend it.QuoteChoose password:For best security, you should use six or more characters with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.It is the forum advise that you will see at your profile page, Account related settings. No point about changing password frequently.I know some platforms, applications recommend it or even force their users to do it after a while like 6 months. However, it is non sense if a person changes from a weak password to a new weak password that only has some minor difference at the end.Changing from \"mypassword@2022\" to \"mypassword@2023\" does not improve security.",

I have been hacked before but it was long ago. My ETH wallet was hacked as well which is why I stake my Bitcoin address in the forum. Since then I have started using stronger passwords and always use a mixture of special characters, numbers, capital letters, and small letters. There is a chance of forgetting the new password as well. I have seen people changing their Android device pattern lock too many times and they had to reset the device because they forgot what pattern they have used. If you change your password too many times, you will get confused with too many passwords and won't be able to remember which one was the correct one.",

I do not change my password often and have never been hacked.I do not think people need to change their passwords at all if you chose a secure mix of characters. You just need to have a secure back up for it. The only upside to changing your password could be to log out any unauthorized access to your account. A hacker can get your email and password and be accessing your account with you without changing anything, if you change your password, they will be logged out.Quote from: EL MOHA on November 01, 2023, 12:43:25 PMOne of the reason of changing your password regularly doesn’t necessarily mean to avoid getting hack but you might also forget it. Imagine you been logged into this account for so long like a year and something happens to your device which it was logged in, there is possibility that you might have forgotten it since you don’t actually use it often.You should not rely on memory to remember sensitive passwords and other information. Backing up different passwords at different times can also get confusing, other than that, it is a safe process and could provide more security.- Jay -",

Only strong password is not enough because there are still other ways our password could ne compromised. If your browser saved accounts password automatically and you Gmail account compromised then hacker will easily access to your account. malware attack which copy all your keystroke could also leads to password leak. there will be more way which we don't know yet but I think we shouldn't called this term as a stupid as many big exchanges like Binance also recommend to do so Quote from: libert19 on November 01, 2023, 12:39:50 PMDo you change your passwords often?

Not that I will completely forget the password but I might make several attempts before getting the right one. I always find it surprising whenever someone say that they forgot their password. Unless I wasn't the one that set the password, I don't think I will forget it because I have a pattern I use for my password and they're unique to each sites. Making changes in the password will get me confused in the long run. When your password is strong enough that can not guess, then I don't see much effect on changing it.",
