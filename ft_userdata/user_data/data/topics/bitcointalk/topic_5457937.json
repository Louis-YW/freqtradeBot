If they will hold half of the Bitcoin supply, that can be more scary for sure let’s see what’s their real goal for this one. Yes, and its just in fact the reality on which to those people/companies/institutions who do have the money would be always be having the advantage on which they would really be trying to accumulate as much as theycould in likes of Bitcoin on which we know that they would really be diving in into those things which would be giving out those opportunities on making more money. Microstrategy is really that wise on taking up such space and accumulating while we arent still in a bull run.Its true that it would really be giving out that kind of scary feeling that if these giants would really be loading off their bags then for sure it would really create a huge long red candle in the market which is something that it is about to happen.This is why im not really that getting shock anymore if lots of institutional investors would really be diving on Bitcoin space and would be accumulating as much as they could since they could really be able to seethat there's really a benefit or money on this space and this is something that they dont really like to miss out.",

Are we at a local peak and facing months of decline ahead?' because it's hard to deny that Saylor usually hits local tops.",

They are going to hold as long as they can before selling it.Of course the market will have to be affected when news comes out that they are going to sell.Just like when Tesla sells before, the price goes down, but just like anything else, bitcoin is so resilient that it can stomach this kind of huge sells and the market go back to normal in the next couple of days or weeks.",

In case of an ETF approval, Microstrategy would lose all those investors, as the ETF is such a more efficient way of holding BTC. In case you want to bet on ETF approval: Long GBTC, short MSTR!",
