It's definitely a red flag.",

I say, skip this and anything similar, it is very likely a scam.The OP is a banned scammer.From here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465554They are asking about a certain BTC address. If you look at link @stompix posted you can see that there are a bunch of banned users who use it.https://ninjastic.space/address/19fCVjYVuppjhSvZc4fYimLSjTv63SyoYDSo it's probably just the same scammer.-Dave",
