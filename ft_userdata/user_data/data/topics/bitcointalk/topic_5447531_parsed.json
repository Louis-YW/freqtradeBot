  "content": "Hey guys, Libertadores of America will start today (third stage/group stage)This year's champion will have a guaranteed place in the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup, and also in the new World Cup format that will be played in 2025.The bets are already active at the bookmakers.This is a very difficult championship to predict the games, it has many surprises, games in high altitude places, teams with a lot of passion, etc.Do you already have a guess for this year's champion?Do you follow the matches?For those who do not watch, I recommend watching at least from the round of 16 on, I will try to post the links to the matches when there are official and free broadcasts.Sources:Official website: https://www.conmebollibertadores.com/You can check the schedule HEREPrevious thread HERE",

The team is doing good until now, 1 victory and 1 draw, but my Corinthians is not in a good situation, they lost playing in home and now the road will be hard.Quote from: alegotardo on April 25, 2023, 11:37:52 PMI hadn't seen this thread yet.Thanks @rdluffy for opening it and also for letting me know by DM.Well... despite being the biggest football championship in Latin America, I confess that don't follow it as much as the European championships and I believe that the rest of the world doesn't give it as much relevance either.It isnt wonder that Conmebol is discredited on the international scene for hosting these sporting events, in my humble opinion, it's quite incompetent and disorganized, because every year something goes wrong.This year, for example, they postponed the date of the Final game  and this certainly caused a lot of inconvenience for those who had already bought tickets, booked their hotel, flights, time off work...But anyway, I hope that the title goes to a Brazilian team again.I can see, it's hard to draw attention to this championship hahaha, but I can guarantee there's a lot of emotion here and memorable matches.Maybe you guys can watch the games from the round of 16 on, specially if the teams are Brazil vs Argentina  It is a different competition than in Europe for example where it is more organized, but the countries are richer and have rich soccer leagues. In South America there are still countries where professional soccer doesn't have that much money and can't get a decent organization.There's a great chance to have a Brazilian champion, specially Palmeiras, Flamengo and now Fluminense playing in high level again.If anyone wants good betting tips, I can post the tips and a brief analysis here.I'm already saying that for the next round I'll place a bet on Corinthians' victory, paying 1.82, playing at home, I believe it's a good odd.",

I don't think I will miss this opportunity, especially since brasil and argentine clubs are performing well in this tournament. Where can I follow this match? Please share a link if available. I have tried searching on Google, but without success.Sorry Ulven, I didn't see your post in time, but for next matches I'll try to find the stream to watch the matches, it's not easy because it's not only streamed in a unique place, last match of Corinthians for example I watched on Paramount + channelQuote from: alegotardo on May 05, 2023, 01:50:22 AMInternacional, on the other hand, need to play better, but I believe that the problem is mainly in the coaching staff, which isn't managing to properly manage the players in all the championships that the club competes in. After all, only now in May there will be 8 matches in a period of just 27 days between the Brasileirão, Copa do Brasil and Libertadores.Which championship and which players to prioritize It's not easy for any team to manage Brasileirão + Copa do Brasil + LibertadoresIn my opinion Inter is doing well, 2nd place in their group of Libertadores and 4th place in Brasileiro. The last result against Nacional was not that bad, since Nacional is a good team and it's in 1st place of group.I hope you didn't lose any money on that match hehehe.In your opinion, which championship your team will prioritize?Corinthians, will not prioritize anything at this moment, my team is doing bad in both championships and desperately needs to win in bothQuote from: Lucasgabd on May 05, 2023, 10:35:59 AManyone else has suggestions on that?I'll check later about the options of streamQuote from: Slow death on May 05, 2023, 06:16:29 PMhonestly Flamengo is in an endless decay, they were playing against an opponent who at 26 minutes was reduced to 10 players, even so Flamengo after winning the game went to shit and took red and a goal, it's unbelievable how Flamengo is in decline after Jorge Jesus leftGood points, I'll comment only in Flamengo's match, and it's impressive how the team's performance dropped, being almost the same team as the year before, when they were very victorious, but this year it seems that nothing works out.It seems that the coach makes much more difference than they think, and if they take too long to get right, it may be too late for Libertadores and even the Brazilian championship.",
