USDT should hold, i am 99% sure of it.Stable coins weren't always here. There used to be a time where people were only able to trade their crypto against the USD. (I mean the hard USD) Stable coins like Tether happened because the banks stopped doing business with Bitfinex. The main problem lies there.Banks don't want to do any business with the crypto exhanges. Why do they do that? We need to fix this first.Bitfinex couldn't fix it so they created an alternative to the USD, USDT.Now everyone is doing the same thing and it is creating more problems than what it was supposed to fix. The space got bigger than it supposed to,  thanks to the tethers and the other stable coins because the issuers don't give a damn. They create more tokens at will whenever a systemic risk occurs. An exchange is losing liquidity? Is it going bankrupt? Quick, print more! More more more, it is never enough to feed the best completely. Once you begin the printing game there is no end to it.The FED knows this the best and Bitfinex is just like FED except for one thing. The FED can print USD legally. Bitfinex cannot.Even if they somehow manage to re-peg the USDC/USD pair, that is not going to fix the core problem of this business model.Long story short, a correction in crypto is long overdue. Too many scammers around and they need to go away.",

Although people might still say that it's not safe because of the volatility that it has in nature. But with that, most traders are still keeping their profits in any stable coin that they're confident with. Such situations are giving us the idea that we should be proactive in the market because that's giving us the idea on what's happening and what could possibly happen with the projects that we invest in. So sad to see this happen to these stable coins although that's part of the risk that even stable coins cannot skip these type of scenario. Just be sure that you're aware with all of these scenes and it can happen to other stablecoins.",

If you are here before and you are following the news around cryptos, you will be aware that the stable coin of Luna is the first one to collapse or depegged and then it followed by others. People are already warned about the possibility of the remaining stable coins that are still at the op of the list but maybe this time have finally arrived.This is bad and I think this can cause another panic again and another dump in the overall market of cryptos. It will be okay if the impact is only applied slowly and not in an instant so that there is still a chance that the price can fight back and can recover to continue what it had started.",

The issuers need a better strategy to prevent such catastrophe from repeating itself again. Hopefully, regulators will weigh on the industry to give a better sense of legitimacy to mainstream investors and traders alike. Who knows if Tether (USDT) would be the next stablecoin to lose its peg? Just my thoughts",
