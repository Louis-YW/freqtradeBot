  "content": "I have been running Ethos for mining a couple of years, and it have been working great.But with the up-coming ethmerge I'm thinking it's time to switch OS on some of my rigs.I have a couple of windows computers running NiceHash and it works pretty great on the returns.At daily basis I work only with Microsoft environment, so I'm more happy with windows than linux commands.Before switching all the rigs I would like to know if anyone have compared the the output from Nicehash on Win11 compared with the Nicehash OS?",

      "body": "Yes Nicehash auto switch feature is incredible but there is a catch, Ethereum algorithm safe more electricity than others, if you have free electricity then no problem, if your rig switch to Ergo or Ravencoin you will be paying more on your electricity bill, I have a 1660 super that use 60watt on Ethash and 80watts on Ravencoin and SuperSero.",
