At present, the project is mainly used as a monitoring platform to provide strategic support for investors in the pre-sale stage. The community on telegram would like to invite everyone to discuss whether it is worth investing in. The official website is https://dash2trade.com/",

It either means that people are paid to tweet about it and are about to sell their reward tokens as soon as they can, or there are more people looking for referrals or people are desperate to create hype so they can sell their tokens once they are in the free market.Also as a rule of thumb: anyone who funds their project trough lbank and bitmart are new in here and don't know what they are doing.And then there is this: Scam accusation link",

Some shit scam projects were doing it caused by when that site was mentioning if it will be listed on exchange site and that's pretty much the same like that site was manipulating people's mind about the potential return once the token already listed. I don't know why people are still investing in this stupid scam token. The pre sale mechanism that used by that site was very similar with old mechanism that used by any icos back in 2017 - 2018. It seems like that so many dumb investors were lacking knowledge about what they should invest in. A bit surprised that kind of project able to raise multi millions of USD.",

So it's a hype project nothing more, nothing less and then there is this scam accusation, so not really looking good for this project. Or maybe the OP is shilling for it?",

I really don't trust projects that are just being promoted by these shillers and promoters in twitter, it's just like cheating the system to create hype. You have that thousands and millions of followers yet only a few are able to interact on your posts. Nah, not buying it. As much as I admire projects that are being built even in the bear market but with a twitter page that is sharing \"we're about to sold out\", and always contest and giveaways without making a good content to show what's their edge over others isn't worth it. I think we've seen enough of this social trading projects and this one is likely not to be on the long term even if they raised that much amount.",

It is best you have their website pasted here And I believe there are some individuals who would like go into findings to know about them.",
