  "content": "Binance Client Executives Kidnapped, Forced to Empty Crypto Wallets — CZ Says Total Loss Was $12.5 Million\"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has shared a story of how executives of a Binance client were abducted and forced to empty their crypto wallets. CZ detailed how the cryptocurrency exchange was able to track the transactions and freeze over 94% of the stolen funds.\"Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-client-executives-kidnapped-forced-to-empty-crypto-wallets-cz-says-total-loss-was-12-5-million/I just read this, what the hell is going on in this world? It's a dark place we all living in.  Me personal think this is impossible to happen without inside work from Binance. What do you think? 😎Good point by Franky1 and something to think about.Quote from: franky1 on November 14, 2023, 12:43:52 PMThe thief/kidnapper obviously done research, found wealthy people, formed a relationship, invited them somewhere.. the victims know details of the perpetrator. im sure the thief is being chased if not already arrested - Regards BabyB. 👼",

This is why we should be very careful in our crypto dealings and communications so that it won't land us in trouble. Do not let people know your worth in crypto and do not let anyone know in what crypto you have your assets.It's money for a Binance client executive now, what if it would cost the life of another in another event? Let's be wise. And I love the smartness of the victim, he actually declared the asset in the USDT knowing that there would still be a solution through tracking. Kudos!",

      "body": "Crazy story, cz said they were 'lured' to a business trip, so i guess it means the attackers organized the meeting and lured these clients in order to attack them, cz didn't provide too much information, like where these clients travelled from to Montenegro. It is strange that they could fall for a fake meeting such as this one, and since they were robbed of crypto, i believe they must have exposed themselves by talking much about crypto with their attackers before embarking on the 'business trip'.To look at it from another angle, cz may just be saying this to boost customer trust in Binance by claiming that they were able to intercept the stolen funds and recover nearly everything. If you follow the thread on X, many people there claimed they have lost funds in Binance, but the exchange were not able to recover anything, even when the stolen funds was sent to another Binance account; so is there a chance that this story by cz is made-up?",
