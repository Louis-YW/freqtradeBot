No one here can/should say that it is impossible to find a block using a CPU-based miner.It *is* however very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very unlikely.Even using the CompacF USB ASIC stick miner gives you an at least several-billion x more chance. Probably being the 1st person ever to observe a Proton decay event is more likely (google it...)But, yes -- it IS possible.",
