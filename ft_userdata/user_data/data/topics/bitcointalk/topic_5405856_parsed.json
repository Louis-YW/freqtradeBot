  "content": "Just came across this, published last month, but don't recall seeing anything like it on the forum, so just sharing.Original article by 911 Metallurgist, it's got the rates for some other crypto too but I'm just going to share the one for Bitcoin: Cost to mine 1 Bitcoin in every country.I knew Asia was expensive, but not THAT expensive. Also, I think this is the cost of grid electricity. I know in my part of the world, for example, some miners want to experiment with natural gas generators. Far, far cheaper, no one would plug into the grid!Kuwait, though!",

Which is why I commented that this pricing isn't entirely accurate, it's only based on commercial consumption cost by directly connecting to power grids. As you know, not all miners would do that, and not all miners pay the same rates -- like it used to be in China, where they'd be able to negotiate independent rates with state energy providers. If the other stats are true (like from Bitcoin Policy Institute numbers) then most miners already are on renewables and alternative energy sources -- so I doubt most of them are paying these rates.The data's just indicative of how much you'd pay if you just decided to plug in and mine.",

Discounts for agreed contracted amounts and tons of other variables. There are other countries that power is cheap but unreliable, I mean they put in North Korea where most people don't have power and except for limited exceptions it's not reliable. Pretty map but pointless in the end. Not to mention as we all know electricity although a big part is only 1 part of the cost.-Dave",

This amount for Nigeria is confusing me because if it is power that is used to determine the cost of mining then Nigerian should be even the number one in the list.

Climate plays a large part. It's better to pay more for electric and mine in a cooler environment to keep cooling costs down vs. cheaper rates but keeping the chillers running full blast all the time. Reliability and cost of internet. Yes most of us here can run our miners off of a cable modem or whatever. The big players have multiple fiber connections and run their own BGP.And so on.-Dave",

I found out at that timethis was in the 90's so mining was not a thing.I knew a guy that did forged jewelry and  that his basement workplace in a Manhattan skyscraper has a tunnel to a 3000 square foot space with about 300 amps of 240 watt power.Back in the 80's so mining was not being done.But people with 'free' power and the ability to say run 20 s19's would do 2ph a day which is only 176 usd  day so 21000/176 = 120 days 1 bitcoin  but that gear at best price cost 20 x 4000= 80000 the study leaves that cost out.  So the first btc would be 80k with everything being free but the gear2 btc would be 80k3 btc would be 80k4 btc would be 80k.  and you could argue this means a single btc = 20k cost.that study leave all this out.and all of us know that to think 20 s19's will work with out fail for 4 x 119 days is very optimistic.",

But probably far less useful to someone who actually would want to start mining.I strongly agree climate plays a role, I know first-hand the debilitating effects on hardware in tropics (heat is one problem but humidity is often overlooked and in some cooler countries the humidity causes problems on a machine that runs non stop). On the other hand, cost of repairs could be far cheaper in some countries with low energy cost anyway, and that could actually offset better than say, insurance and maintenance in more expensive countries.I guess a true cost calculation is extremely difficult, gear and maintenance, licensing even (approvals to run commercial enterprise or even specialised equipment).",

Most countries use tiered (or step) pricing. Past a certain amount, you're forced to pay more than the typical range for a household. If you registered as a manufacturer/business, you pay in time of use (depending on the time of day, 10PM-4AM is usually the cheapest). Some countries even use the mix of both, tiered within TOU. There is a lot of things that need to take into account for electricity pricing, not just fixed rate.",

Because the mining farm locations and power rates that I know of so far correlate with the green areas. This is from public mining farms as well as my personal experience.https://findenergy.com/The map displays average residential rate by county, which obviously doesn't include cheaper tariffs that may be available or tiered usage plans. But it's a good starting point to find industrial power. Simply divide the residential price by 2 to get a rough estimate. The exceptions to this rule I can find so far are upstate NY (divide by 3), Long Island (divide by 1.5), Northern NJ/JCPL (divide by 1.5), Central Washington (divide by 1), Delaware (divide by 1.5).Of course, the recent natural gas price hike is not included, which you'll have to pay for eventually, so use with caution.",

So if it makes a subject to discuss when you're bored or you think that crunching numbers over and over will get you somewhere, yeah it's a nice time killer but I don't think anything will come out of it. And even if we knew it....Quote from: buwaytress on July 14, 2022, 05:18:28 PMThey really are quite intensive mfs, but I've never seen them in use anywhere else, and from the responses on the thread, yeah I guess most of the world won't recognise them. I'd say they're fairly new tech, but I'm far from being an expertWell, don't look at me, we're running low on gas even in our gas pipes around here   so probably I'll be one of the last people seeing one around here.",
