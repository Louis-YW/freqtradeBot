I believe this scarcity no go last but make dem dey enjoy am while e dey on oh because na only God go judge this wickedness. I understand say Naira scarce and queue for banks long and to get Naira to run their pos business no dey but why dem go wicked their follow human being just because of that reason. Sha to avoid all this wahala, just carry yourself go bank very early so you fit withdraw money keep for hand as if you come anything more than 7-8 AM, before you fit comot bank go be by mid afternoon oh. Also try making use of the cashless policy wey the government dey try reinforce as e goes well. This days na only 5k I dey withdraw while I dey use app dey run transfer for any other businesses of the day.The only sad thing be say, bank wahala dun carry their own come. Every bank apps dun dey misbehave and na Kuda banks dey carry their own for head as if you check twitter, dem dey trend steadily due to their poor network that's causing the app to misbehave.
