  "content": "What is the meaning of freedom of expression?Freedom of expression is one of the basic human rights that allows an individual to express his ideas and beliefs freely without infringing on the rights of others or spreading false propaganda and hatred.This right is guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 in France.BUTWe all know that freedom of expression is very limited in third world countries, and when any statement is hostile to rulers, you put your freedom and life at risk, unlike developed countries, but we have noticed recently the lack of respect for freedom of expression by these countriesExample:- player suspended and menaced by thier team after showing support to palestine And the suppression of peaceful Manifestation that support Palestine- Attacks and threats to people who do not support homosexuality.Is this considered a suppression of freedom of expression?Is democracy a dress for dictatorship only?",

So for that many governments will only seek ways to restrict citizens' right and also make sure there be a place where we can all co-exist in without any interference from one another,  this has been the most pronounced aspect of the whole thing,  how we can freely express our fundamental right such as freedom of speech as you mentioned.",

Most times we are forced and deprived of this our freedom of expression as a result of specific rules implemented by the government and this same set of government we choose them ourselves. All we have to do is to keep mute at some certain levels and stick to the rules given in oder to avoid the penalties of breaking any. Sometimes we have to compromise our beliefs the way we display them outwardly and preserves the inner self expression to ourselves just to avoid certain punishments",

The reason is that if you don't curb the way some citizens make unguided speech and statements about certain things, they will end up causing crises for the country. You can't because you've been given the right to express yourself and you will make a statement that tends to cause war or chaos in the land, that's very bad.Of course, you can't close your mouth when you see your leaders making wrong and selfish decisions that you know will affect you in the long run but you need to make your statement with caution and courtesy so your good intention won't be evil spoken of.",

In Africa, you can't criticize or protest against a government policy. You will either be beaten, sent to prison without trial or even killed. The courts are powerless because they are under the control of the government in power. In Africa, you just keep suffering and smiling because there is nothing like freedom of expression.Quote from: rahim066 on October 22, 2023, 08:10:49 PM- Attacks and threats to people who do not support homosexuality.I just read news where Joe Biden the president of the US announced that Uganda will be removed from a special US-Africa trade programme. The reason is because of the country's anti-homosexual laws. Removing this country from this program will have an adverse economic impact on this African nation because it will limit its exports to the US.  The people of Uganda believe that this law is consistent with their values and norms but they are forced to accept a law that is alien to their customs and traditions. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67236251",

But if it has come to an extent that your opinion and expression is also becoming noticeable, much better to keep quiet. I know that this is the right of everyone and if your country has a side to go along with what is happening globally especially on the wars then it is better not to take any side or you just keep your opinions for now. Or if you're going to express what you feel, then you have to make sure that you're not figured out if the government you have is too strict about these matters.While I believe that it is a suppression to your freedom of expression, but know that there's always a limit and the more you talk, the more mistake you might say. Censorship happens and that's why even if you fight for your freedom to express, you might be silenced or just be in silence.",

Supporting Palestine or expressing one's views on homosexuality should ideally be protected in democratic societies. Democracy promotes individual freedoms and the right to express opinions without fear but the real world isn't always that simple. Balancing free speech with maintaining order can be a tricky challenge. Some argue that in certain cases, democracy might be used as a cover for more autocratic practices. It's a topic of ongoing debate, and people's experiences with democracy can vary widely. What's important is to keep the conversation going, raising awareness about these issues and advocating for the protection of everyone's right to express themselves within the bounds of respect and understanding.",

But you also need to keep in mind it is possible to incite violence or push for anarchy just by using one's freedom to say what we want to however we want. While there are citizens who use their right to spread hope and love for each other, some will take a loudspeaker and say we should abolish state, abolish police or even overthrow a sitting president, it is legal to say those things and yet they can put in danger the same democracy and liberty which allows them to be vocal about their feelings and ideology.

Freedom of speech doesn't cover that.No Democracies are ruled by the people in general. All Democracies have a small group of people as their rulers.

      "body": "I don't think \"freedom of expression\" carries much weight anymore. Arguably never did, at least starting in the early 20th century onward. Consider the Espionage Act that could've locked people up for holding an political opinion deemed \"too extreme.\" Or an extension of that scope when McCarthy had his communist witch hunt up until the mid-50s or so. Then after 9/11 the Patriot Act that green-lighted warrantless surveillance of individuals under the guise of terrorism. Some of these you could argue even started out with good intention on reeling in otherwise bad actors, nevertheless innocent people did (and do) get caught up in these surveillance programs for expressing opinions that may be considered extreme by a global entity like the NSA. Unfortunately for us, it's what they decide is too extreme. I do think we've entered a whole new era that's become monumentally more concerning though. With the rise of Big Tech, people end up profiling themselves a lot more than they realize, simply by using certain services without reading the fine print in ToS's. For example, monitor your scripts across every webpage you visit. 90% of them will have Google 3rd party scripts collecting data. Even when the webpage itself seemingly has no connection to Google. Facebook is a TOTAL wash, people profile themselves on that for fuck sake. Instagram, SnapChat, Tinder, etc. all the same.This in and of itself is concerning, but when you factor in the era of \"culture wars\" and \"wokeness\" that contemporary companies not only acknowledge, but many endorse, then Big Tech can monitor pretty much everything you do and cut you off if they don't think you express the right views. And considering by law these companies are considered private entities, your not protected under the first amendment. At least not as well. Because they can argue in courts of law that their platforms are owned by them, and they can choose to deny service to anyone for whatever reason they like. Hold the wrong view about Israel/Palestine? Gone. Hold the wrong view about Joe Biden? Gone. Hold the wrong view about Donald Trump? Gone. Are you skeptical about COVID vaccines? Bad news for you, you're gone. And it shouldn't even be about what's correct or not. Technical application of \"freedom of expression\" would allow for people hold, endorse, and even spread incorrect views. Provided said views don't incite violence towards another individual or institution. However people aren't allowed to have incorrect expressions anymore. Or, rather speaking, their not allowed to have what other private conglomerates believe is incorrect expressions anymore.",
