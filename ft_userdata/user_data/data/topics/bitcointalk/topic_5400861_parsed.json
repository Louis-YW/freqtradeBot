Floating point numbers are the real numbers - i.e. numbers with a decimal point.The bitcoin network uses hash functions, which works with integers, not real numbers.The number of FLOPS that this supercomputer can calculate is not directly related to the number of hashes per second it can calculate. The reverse is also true - ASICs can calculate an enormous number of hashes per second, but cannot calculate any FLOPS. Indeed, since this supercomputer will be massively optimized to squeeze every last available FLOPS out of it, it will be very inefficient when considering other operations, such as hashing. When it comes to bitcoin mining, this supercomputer will likely be vastly outperformed by ASICs.",

Even if they compare 11 yr old apples with 11yr old oranges I would say it's close enough for this discussion's sake...",
