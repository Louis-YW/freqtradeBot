Private keys are crucial for accessing and controlling your cryptocurrencies stored in your wallet. Maybe you should try transferring your private key to a physical safe or writing it on a paper than storing it to your devices.",

If you have your seed phrase, you do not need your password to spend your coins, all you have to do is to create another wallet and set another password. But because of your password, another person can not access your wallet to steal your seed phrase or private key if you are careful of people around you and also careful of malware.",

It does not depend on the type of wallet if it is a noncustodial wallet. Only centralized platforms can do that and they are completely different from noncustodial wallets.Yes platforms like centralized exchanges (binance and its kind) send new passwords to your Gmail and also phone number used to register on them. This one of the downside of using centralized platforms because this password are gotten with your email it is much easier to get access to your exchange. Quote from: Hatchy on May 15, 2023, 03:20:23 PMAfter generating the same password, will the new wallet have the same address as the original wallet?Let me break it down for you. A password only works on application or wallet you set it. For example if you set a password on the MetaMask wallet, when you import the seed or keys gotten from that wallet to a new wallet (say blue wallet), you do not need the password set on MetaMask to access this funds because the password only applies to the MetaMask wallet on that device only",

From this address the private key is obtained by the owner and from the coin address the owner can sign messages.When someone who wants to create a Bitcoin address in a wallet will go through several processes before the address is successfully created.There is a process in making an address, an order is obtained to save the seed and there is a process for the prospective owner of the address to create a strong password.Ok. The address was created successfully and the owner of the address allows the address to receive and send coins.If someone can guess the password and find your address seed, then that person can do as they wish with the coins in your coin address.That's what I know from what I've tried to make an address on one of the wallets and that's what I've read.Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins.Not Your Keys, Not Your Money.",

The former is used when you want to encrypt the wallet file locally, so that a thief can't steal your money with that file per se. But it can very much steal it with the seed phrase. The latter (which is also called BIP39 passphrase) is used as part of the seed phrase.- To recover a wallet which uses a custom passphrase, both the passphrase and the seed phrase are required.- To recover a wallet which uses a password, only the seed phrase is enough.",

That's what I know from what I've tried to make an address on one of the wallets and that's what I've read.Someone can only try to guess the password to your wallet file if they have the device where your wallet file is installed, so as you use a strong password for your wallet, also use a strong PIN for your device, so that no person can gain access into your device. Addresses don't have their individual seed, what they have is keys, but with hierarchical deterministic wallets, multiple addresses are gotten from a seed phrase, and with that seed phrase your addresses and their keys can be imported locally by whoever has it and be spent.",

With that key, everyone can get in your house and steal everything there.With Bitcoin wallet, we only need private key to move coins. You don't need a car, truck or anything to load up stuffs like stealing physical things in your someone house. Digitally is more simply.Quote from: Mnemonic code words BIP39 explanationMnemonic code words are word sequences that represent (encode) a random number used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words is sufficient to re-create the seed and from there re-create the wallet and all the derived keys. A wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic words will show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet. That sequence of words is the wallet backup and can be used to recover and re-create all the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. Mnemonic words make it easier for users to back up wallets because they are easy to read and correctly transcribe, as compared to a random sequence of numbers.",

Your wallet can be accessible without your password,if you forget your password and have access to your seed phrase.

Will the person be able to withdraw your money or change password and block you from having access to your wallet?Your wallet is merely a tool to interact with coins stored inside the Bitcoin blockchain, and this tool is almost useless without the actual keys that you mentioned as a \"seed phrase.\" Anyone who has gotten access to your secret key can theoretically import it into another wallet and move your coins to an address to which you have no keys. This is called a transfer of ownership, and it actually occurs every time you are making a transaction with another person. The main point of this story is that coins are never stored locally on your device: instead, they are being held by thousands of computers globally, but only the person who knows the secret can move them around. This is why it is important to never disclose the location in which a backup of keys resides or share the key itself because it would mean that you are no longer the sole owner of coins.",
