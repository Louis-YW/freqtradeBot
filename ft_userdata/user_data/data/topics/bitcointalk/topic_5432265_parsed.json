(on the paper).when I will implement in code , will try explain \"what is in my mind\".difficult to explain without code. this is just abstact idea. but sometimes abstract idea is working.It's just that I've never heard of a \"safety curve\" before, let alone a reduced one. Are you referring to the strength of the elliptic curve in bits i.e. the point coordinate size in memory?",
