I have noticed that many of the theories seems not to hold under the weight of one important factor: the imperfection of human beings. Human beings are corrupt , can lie, can steal feel tempted to screw others just because. If the class struggle is indeed real, I could see the struggle to continue even after the establishment of the communist society, because the corruption and evil which is often associated with capitalism may continue to exist.",

My brother your understanding of that Karl Marx theory is very narrow. That Karl Marx theory can only work in a small society of few people and not much. Which that can under themselves. Even a Nations State with large number of people can't unite themselves. And a society can never be equal again on this Earth because the mindset of the people is no more one again. Capitalism has spoiled everything for Marxist theory. Do you also remember that Marx said the only way for the people to have egalitarian society is massive revolution against the Capitalist society but the Capitalist use these the same youths to divide themselves, so there will be no unity in anywhere. The rich is using the poor to divide themselves.",

And the fact that society has allowed certain places, things to be only available to a certain class of people,equality can never be archived all thanks to this thing called money...unless you live in a communist environment.",

Human beings are difficult to control and with the different opinions and views that people have is increasing daily, people are becoming harder to bring together but easier to divide. An equal soceity will be something very difficult to achieve when people disagree on everything from religion to culture to lifestyle,",

A seamstress might not know how to make car engines. A car metallurgist might not know how to make glass for the windows. Only a few people know how to organize and direct the affairs of society to benefit everyone equally. And there is where the problem lies. You can't trust the leaders to keep from enriching themselves above the rest, and making everybody else their slaves. If they say that you can trust them, how do you know they aren't lying... or at least delusional?",

The society does not permit that and also nature does not permit that. There must be an imbalance in society for there to be the difference between the giver and the receiver, the rich and the poor.If everything is balanced and eventually everybody becomes rich, there won't be any story of success and failure and the whole life will not be sweet. The is why everyone tries to be in the rich category of the society and then money can flow from rich to poor.",
