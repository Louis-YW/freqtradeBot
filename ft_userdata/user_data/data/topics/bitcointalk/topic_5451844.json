  "content": "Recently got to know a friend of mine passed away half a year ago from the gossip, I thought the chat is just a joke or mistaken with another person with same name, in my best guess, there is no chance at all, I still texting with the deceased frequently over the mobile app until the end of 2022, we are so close we basically talk about all things, I also tell him about bitcoin which he seem to be listening, I also think he like to talk about Jesus everyday and all the post on his social media wall is all about Jesus, and he is a devoted to Jesus and such, however I remember to tell him to stop taking the JABS, because I take NO JAB, totally zero JABS, but he took every damn jab included all the booster JABS, I think there is a total of four jabs he took so he can got to save his job, I'm not saying the JAB kill him, but it was a shockwave to me, I was told he was declared commit suicide on news, that he is sleeping and never wake up again since no wound or bleeding, until his parent found him breathless and realize he passed while sleeping, it is too spooky to me, to my best knowledge I highly suspect it is another story.That is as much I would expose, I would like to keep the rest of the juicy detail confidential for some reason. I would not entertain request.btw he is very hardworking guy, and yes he is still a complete virgin and no single girl want to date him or approach him, a very typical nerd engineer guy who did very well in school.That remind me of the last recession where I see the same incident occuring, I'm not predicting anything btw.",

It's time to love and embrace Jesus your Maker.However, I don't think this post belong here move it to the off-topic section.",

Of course it would be much more complicated, it is a victimless crime, nobody should be blamed for it, because there can never be solid proof to blame anything, of course it might be his own fault for taking the jabs, also it is likely linked to habit too where he is living unhealthy lifestyle which could be the cause. Btw I do not like the jab, it is just my personal preference, I also know very well why he would take the jab despite all advices, and doubt against it, it is humiliating if you are not taking the jab when all your peer are taking them all, it is the peer pressure btw.btw taking four jabs within a year is something I can never imagine, it is basically a time bomb to me. Quote....Anyway who am I to be telling this to WHO...And you know what, corporate can never be sued for damages, they have buyout every loophole you could imagine. For the worse, everyone around you would be very supportive of taking jabs, your parent even go as far as name calling you and blame you if you refuse to take the jab, it is insane mental gymnastics going on. But what you know it set a very bad precedent, it is legally to euthanize with jab I would imagine, there have to be some funny thing in the jab, that is responsible for it.Btw, it is always tiring to convince anyone, although I had try to stop them once, but there is nothing else could do to stop people from doing their deed, and many such cases. Yup, it remind me of the exact same accident in the past, it is a mistake, it seem people never learn.",

He seems to be a good guy that was hard-working and not promiscuous. I think he had these good virtues because he obey the teachings of Jesus. The cause of his death is also strange because he died in his sleep. This is a clear indication that death is unpredictable. That is why we should ensure that we assist those we can and contribute positively to our family and community because we will be remembered for our good works.Quote from: swogerino on May 08, 2023, 09:01:50 AMI recently visited Austria and if you are talking about the vaccine calling the doses JABS,I am afraid you may be right.I saw in Austria people talking about such a high number of deaths from heart attacks that they had never heard before and honestly in my view this cannot be a coincidence,Austria,specifically Vienna is a place I travel often for work and since the vaccine things have precipitated for the worse,people are not happy and are suffering a lot of unexplained deaths which are happening exactly after people made the vaccine doses in order to enter restaurants,McDonalds,super markets like Billa,Lydl and Spar and all other facilities but which are now resulting in an increased fatality rate.We are all aware that most of these vaccines were hurriedly produced because of the emergency of the Covid 19 pandemic. There was a high rate of death so most government and pharmaceutical companies had to hurriedly produce vaccines that didn't go through the standard medical process. I will not be surprised if some of these deaths are because of these substandard vaccines. But until there is formal research on the cause of these deaths, we will just keep speculating on the real cause.",

What's the deal? According to you, did the vaccines have something to do with it or not? Because you seem to throw a rock and hide your hand. At the end of the day people die, and statistically it cannot be said that vaccines have significantly increased mortality, so don't bullshit.",

Sometimes we should really give ourselves some break from the fears that are inhibited inside of us and be rational. Somethings will actually happen whether we do something about them or not and death is inevitable.",
