This is presumably also how the police can seize NFTs, however, this could not be confirmed by the police, as this information cannot be shared.Almost like they just put it in to scare those who are using NFTs to do money laundering schemes. Well, I may be wrong but that's how I looked at it. It's a good strategy though, just feed the news to the people and soon it will almost look real even if it doesn't really exist. If it is, then the police are making amazing progress. They will not stop at just looking at the garage, and secret doors but also deep inside the computer and smartphones of every crime.",

It's an utter nonsense!I believe their authorities have done their homework, hence, even the NFT has been seized. They have their own reasons why they took it. But yes, seizure of digital assets is not new anymore. But maybe, one of the firsts for NFT. Their police force should be very familiar how NFT works, because if not, how could they seize it and assess its value? They may have been following the transactions of this person, and checking it in the market.",

Unfortunately, that guy didn’t know how to secure his wallet and gave up easily all the details of his crypto assets. This can be prevented if you know how to be more secured and of course if you are doing things legally. Hopefully, the authority will also come after those scammers and hackers because they are the real bad luck here in the cryptomarket. Let’s see if more successful seized like this to happen in cryptoworld, be careful always.",
