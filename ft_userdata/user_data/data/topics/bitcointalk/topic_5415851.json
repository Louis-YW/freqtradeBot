  "content": "What is Node Scan Network and Its Purpose?Node configuration errors and clutter in nodes in Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and many more blockchains have been a problem for hours or even days for crypto investors in blockchain and ecosystems.The Node Scan Network project is still under development and is in the fundraising stage, aiming to provide benefits for blockchain technologies. Its main purpose is to scan the node problems with advanced technological and artificial intelligence supported smart units. Our NOSC Artificial Intelligence unit, which can only scan the faulty nodes in the blockchains, will be able to offer solutions after scanning the node problems in the blockchains after completing the self-development phase and the funding phase.Why is Node Scan Network Important?Blockchains, which are the focus of today's technology, continue to develop day by day and cause many errors. These errors cause millions of crypto investors to lose money and lose their financial assets. One of the main of these errors is the misconfiguration of the nodes of the blockchains and the congestion problems in the nodes. On October 30, 2022, the Solana network, one of the pioneers of blockchains, experienced a 6-hour outage due to a node configuration error, and millions of Solana users panicked.This and dozens of node-oriented errors have occurred and continue to come. The Node Scan Network project is a startup project created to solve these single-focused problems and to make the ecosystem of blockchain technologies more useful, error-free and stable.NOSC Technology UnitNOSC is an artificial intelligence unit created by Node Scan Network and created to solve node problems. Our artificial intelligence unit, which we call NOSC and 100% belongs to our Node Scan Network project, was created on the basis of Python, C + and NodeJS. For those who are interested in artificial intelligence units: It has been prepared and continues to be developed with the help of NOSC, Numpy, Matplotlib and SciPY library systems.v0.0001 CompletedIt started with the definition of v0.0001 before NOSC BETA and was first created by taking ownership of a certain error algorithm. It was in a structure that could detect the matching problematic nodes within the determined algorithm by scanning the block units, which are the basis of blockchains.v0.0018 Ongoing processNOSC came to the v0.0018 version and was able to access the algorithm level by scanning many blockchains and nodes, detecting potential problems in advance. It can interpret the errors that occur and apply the Data visualization and manipulation and Array manipulation subroutines features in the SciPY library units.BETA Coming soonIn pre-NOSC BETA scanning systems, Solana has developed an algorithm to detect Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain block bases within the scope of known errors. Before reaching the BETA phase, the NOSC unit is about to complete its final development.Why Should I Buy Node Scan Network (NOSC Token)?There is only one rule that is currently accepted all over the world and in commercial areas; Finding the problem and producing a solution. That's why it is very important for us to take part in Node Scan Network funding and to grow together with our project that aims to provide benefits. You should not forget that we are trying to make a development focused on the benefit of not only NOSC Token purchasers, but also every project, company, person and people involved in blockchain technologies. We are working to become the center of attention of not only the Node Scan Network, but also hundreds of people who want to address this problem, and to make the blockchain ecosystems much better and stable by collaborating together.NOSC/WBNBBUY ON PANCAKESWAPhttps://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xa21e17ad5c7498c92914d4660efba65dbccbb70aNOSC ExplorerVISIT ON BSCSCANhttps://bscscan.com/token/0xa21e17ad5c7498c92914d4660efba65dbccbb70aNOSC/WBNBVISIT ON POOCOINhttps://poocoin.app/tokens/0xa21e17ad5c7498c92914d4660efba65dbccbb70aNOSC Token InformationNode Scan Network can grow itself with only 5% of the investments you have made and can cover the necessary marketing expenses, charity balancing transactions, technological developments, etc. will be able to cover all other expenses. Node Scan Network is a BEP20 Token built with the Binance Smart Chain network. You can purchase Node Scan Network token with the abbreviation NOSC from any decentralized exchange that supports the Binance Smart Chain network. Below you can access all token information of our Node Scan Network (NOSC Token) project. In order to aim to benefit you and to prove this, we have released the 91.9% NOSC amount of our project on PancakeSwap to be fair.Contract Address: 0xa21e17ad5c7498c92914d4660efba65dbccbb70aToken Name: Node Scan NetworkToken Symbol: NOSCTotal Supply: 100,000,000,000 NOSCCirculation Supply: 100,000,000,000 NOSCFair Launched Supply: 91,900,000,000 NOSC (91.9%)Buy/Sell Fee: 5%Slippage: 6%Some Precautions and DecisionsThe current and future measures taken by our Node Scan Network project against sudden dump/pump transactions in the crypto money market, which has high mobility and high volume opportunities, large investor wallets called whales and liquidity-oriented situations are as follows.We would like to state that the right marketing campaigns are important for our project. Cheap and qualified marketing campaigns called shill are not important for our project. Coinzilla, Flexe.io etc. We find professional and corporate marketing working systems working with a large-scale and Cost-Per-Click focus much more important and interesting. The activity and accuracy of marketing campaigns are important to us for the continuation and growth of the project.We have wallets that provide automatic charity against sudden pump/dump transactions. Of the 91.9% of NOSC Tokens released, the remaining 8.1% is available for charity balancing. In order to balance very large sales and very large purchases, wallets automatically balance the chart and the liquidity price, allowing our project to continue to live much longer.There is a 9% maximum purchase rate to prevent wallets that can make large purchases called whales. New investors cannot keep as many NOSC Tokens as they wish in one wallet! This project was created in order to prevent a large proportion of whales.Our liquidity amount (Cake-LP) is currently temporarily locked and the Cake-LP amount is not owned by NOSC Token! In order to indicate that liquidity is not in our project and to complete the accuracy in all working principles of our NOSC artificial intelligence unit, our liquidity period is under temporary lockdown for now. This is a reliable and must-have procedure. A few days before the NOSC Beta releases, our liquidity will refresh regularly every 3 months.Our Node Scan Network project consists of a team of 4 people and is temporarily not DOXXED as it aims to provide community benefit! After the relevant steps are taken in our roadmap, our team will gladly take part in our project by verifying itself by KYC. Don't worry, our community manager and our teammate who deals with human resources will be in contact with you anonymously in our Telegram community. You can book a voice call appointment and have a meeting with our team members.Marketing Budget GrowthThe Node Scan Network marketing budget is created by collecting together with the investmentagreements to be made, apart from the fees received in the purchase and sale.> 2.8 BNBThe marketing budget we set for the first phase will be used for basic development and social media marketing.7.5 BNBThe marketing budget determined in the second stage will be used for platform banner ads, Twitter and telegram sponsored advertising marketing and Coinzilla marketing budget.15-30 BNBThe marketing budget determined in the third phase will be used for stock market listings and collaborative advertising campaigns.+35 BNBThe marketing budget determined in the fourth stage will be used in large-scale marketing campaigns and in the development of NOSC AI infrastructure and foundations.Read more Purpose and Visit Websitehttps://nodescan.network/bitcointalk",
