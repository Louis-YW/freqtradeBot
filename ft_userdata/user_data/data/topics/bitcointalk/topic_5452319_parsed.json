It's just like giving them a second chance to see if they can still make it out to the up or not, which I can't recall ever seeing any project moved there survive before; it's always either straight delisting or moved to the innovation zone, where delisting those coins won't even create any form of negative reaction because there will be fewer people trading them there. Since tokens being in the innovation zone is already a warning that they hold a greater risk, traders will try so hard to avoid them.",

This innovation zone is a total bullshit, if the requirement is need to have an improvement or update to be not included in this zone, any project will create a small or fake improvement. Binance can cherry pick the competitor coin e.g. FTX to be included, this will make people think if the project is bad or rug pull. If Binance want to make sure the project is safe, they need to audit everything before they want to list to their exchange.",

Ideally, it is a second chance for those projects before they are removed, but I see that it is a pressure tool from Binance for these projects. They also indicated that there is no founder, and therefore the opportunity for Binance to make a profit from that platform will be less, and therefore delisting them is better than moving keeping it.Personally, I see that Binance is trying to be a central cryptocurrency and milk these projects to achieve maximum profit.",

Huge trading volumes of the PEPE token on the Binance exchange. It's good money and it doesn't smell like shit. Of course, I am for freedom of trade, but really good projects cannot get on this exchange, and useless memcoin, which will be forgotten, gets on the exchange very quickly.",

True, they should have named it \"Dying/Delisting zone\" instead of innovation zone.  It's like giving them the chance to be on Binance until they've been completedly out of Binance's standard. This is now how Binance controls the market with their own standard. Now these projects have to do what it takes for them not to be removed from them. I guess those desperate projects that want to remain in Binance's listing will be letting go a lot of cash coming into them to make it look like that they've got huge liquidity.",

It lets users trade these projects while knowing the risks involved. So basically, Binance decides whether to move projects into the Innovation Zone or upgrade them based on how well they're doing and if they're meeting the standards. This way, users can check out cool new projects and make sure everything is legit and sustainable in the crypto world. In the end, whether this plan is cool or helpful depends on a bunch of things and how you see them. Let's see how it ends.",

This motivates investors or others to always update information and monitor developments in investment platforms before or when they enter so they don't get caught off guard by delisting and usually there is notification/announcement in advance.",

Im sure it did loses its trading volume compared to before. But it does means they retain their innovative approach? Im sure with the normal zone and innovative zone, there must be a required activity auch as trading volume and its not about the project improvement since for sure its important to them to see if the token still actively been traded.
