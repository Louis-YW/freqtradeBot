      "body": "I think beginning to start playing gambling atleast you need know about sport to be able to predict what you feel might likely to be the result of the game based on pass performance of game you are betting on. One thing you must really understand that you need gamble with the money you can afford to lose, and gamble is not a do or die affair. Do not take it too personal when you lose, like playing continuously to gain your money back, it can be a strategy for you to keep loosing because gambling can't be predicted.  Do not have in mind that gambling is a way which you can make money as a side hustle,  too much expectations from gambling wins can ruin you when what you expect does not come to pass.",

Casinos have better odds than bookies.For normal sport betting, you will need to check the statistic of last the first matches two clubs that are meeting have. You also need to know the players that they are using, if a player is not among and if he is one if the star players or the star player, the match may not favor a very strong club while playing with underdogs. You can also check some predictions sites, but do not believe in prediction sites more than 50%.Let us hope that you will not later find out about virtual matches which is like you are gambling on a casino because the time needed for it is short and not more than 30 second. Another one are in-play which can be addicting because there are many matches that you can continue to gamble with their in-play.",

Since you said good win rate instead of good chance to make money, I'd say you just need to blindly put your bet on player or team where the odds is 1.01x, I'm sure at least you will win 90-95 from 100 bets you placed.  You will have 90%-95% win rate, isn't?If you're not understand with the sports, players or teams, there's no point to bet in sportsbook.",

Some sports bettor are usually betting in a Basketball tournament which is kinda usual these days but i suggest to you, to focus on a small area so that you will gain an opportunity to have a knowledge about the teams and players that you bet on, Just specialize in one area for now and track your results, in that way once you learn everything about sports betting, your betting results will instantly approve.",

      "body": "That is going to be a difficult task especially if you know nothing about sports. Well, you could start by asking yourself what sport is mostly played in your neighborhood. Soccer? Basketball? Baseball? Basketball is what I see mostly here in my street and I loved playing it ever since I was a kid so when I am introduced to gambling, that's also the first thing I'd look for. Basketball sports betting. It's simple. I know the rules, I know how the game is played, and I have been in love with it ever since I started playing the game. Now, the next question will be what big leagues would you like to bet with? NBA for me.Don't rush to know the game, just keep yourself updated about the recent events and very soon you will get the hang of it. If you like basketball here are some helpful tips.Try to always read in the NBA Season thread to be updated with the current events and other stuff. If you don't like it there then try following Woj of ESPN in X formerly Twitter, NBA.com, and CBS. Keep yourself notified so you won't miss a thing.",

For sports betting, I think soccer is easier for a beginner because no matter how inexperienced someone is, he will still know the top teams of major leagues. Playing those top teams on winning, goals and even 3ways does not require too much of analysis. Just a checking their recent stats and fixtures will already give you an idea of the expected outcome. Furthermore,  there are various options one can bet on for sport betting and this improves the probability of winning. So, soccer is my recommendation for a beginner.",

From the way you are expecting profit, don't always think profit is assured in sports betting, it still has element of luck on it so play reasonably and bet as you can afford to lose.I recommend you read through this board to see more about what gamblers have written.",

As I always say, gambling is a lucky game, so if you learn from an expert and you also engage in following the history of the term, whether it is football or basketball, you will have more experience predicting the game, and if you are lucky, you will be successful.Although I am not that good at gambling, I do gamble at times, so sometimes I win while other times I lose. In gambling, you should always believe that you will win at the same time you will lose, and very important, you should create a budget for your game in order not to become addicted to gambling.",

I believe it's important to first learn about the sport you want to bet on and become familiar with the rules, teams, and players involved, even if it's just the basics. That's how beginners start, and you should also consider their forms and records. Once you get started and gain experience, it becomes a continuous process. Just don't get frustrated if you don't like the outcome because it's part of the game. With every result, you gain knowledge that you can use in your future bets.",

If not then if might be difficult for you in the beginning, as you might get confused on the betting line itself. Although there are a lot of threads here and members giving out their tips, but for me to be able to win, at least know the teams and the sports that you are betting.

What sport do you have a sound knowledge about? Can you predict the performance of a team based on its individual players? Those are some of the things that will help you improve your wins; although, sometimes the unexpected happens and despite knowing and analyzing games you’ll still end up with a losing ticket. So it’s actually up to you to go to your bookie since you already stated that you have one, look at the different games there and check which of them you know and I’m then give it a try for a few days and try to also learn what each odds are for so you don’t end up choosing the wrong one.",
