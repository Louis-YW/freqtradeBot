Innocent until proven guilty.Donald Trump Demands All Jan 6 Detainees Be Released From Prison After Tucker Carlson Airs Never-Before-Seen Footage Of Capitol Riots: ‘LET THEM GO FREE, NOW!’https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-january-6-detainees-released-tucker-carlson-footage-capitol-riots/Former President Donald Trump called for the immediate release of all detained January 6 rioters this week after Tucker Carlson aired never-before-seen surveillance footage of the Capitol insurrection, RadarOnline.com has learned.In a sudden development to come shortly after Carlson aired the footage on Fox News on Monday night, Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to demand the release of all those arrested during the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021.The former president also congratulated the 53-year-old Tucker Carlson Tonight host for what Trump called \"one of the biggest scoops\" in United States history.\"Congratulations to Tucker Carlson on one of the biggest 'scoops' as a reporter in U.S. history,\" Trump wrote. \"The New Surveillance Footage of the January 6th Events sheds an entirely different light on what actually happened.\"\"The Unselect Committee was a giant SCAM, and has now unequivocally been stamped as CRIMINAL FABRICATORS OF THIS MOST IMPORTANT DAY,\" he continued. \"Pelosi & McConnell failed on security. The Police story is sad and difficult to watch.\"\"'Trump' and most others are totally innocent, LET THEM GO FREE, NOW!\"As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Carlson aired never-before-seen security footage from the day of the Capitol riots after being provided nearly 40,000 hours of footage from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.According to the security footage aired by Carlson on Monday night, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick – who was reported \"slain\" on January 6 after allegedly being beaten to death with a fire extinguisher – was seen walking uninjured through the Capitol building after he was supposedly murdered by the mob outside....",

A detainee is someone who is detained which doesn't necessarily mean arrested.The constitution and law says there should be a speedy trial... innocent until found guilty.Detainees haven't been found guilty in a court of law, even though you and I might say/believe/think/know they are guilty of something.Among the detainees are people that you and I would say are innocent.How does one determine if someone is guilty or innocent? By adjudication in a trial, which is supposed to be speedy; not their fault government wants to let itself be bogged down so they don't hire some more judges.Since there is no speedy trial like government is required, the guilty ones are government people. If they aren't guilty because they haven't gone to trial for it, at least they are guilty in our eyes. Guilty of what? Guilty of harming legally innocent people by keeping them in jail for well over two years... without trial.If you look at loads of commentaries on a speedy trial, they will tell you that most of the guilty will get away because their guilt can't be or isn't proven. When you look at court law, you will find that as many as 90% of court case that judge people guilty have been done wrong - http://www.voidjudgments.net/ - and are void judgments.Law enforcement has detainees pictures, their finger prints, their ID info. Let them go free, and pick them up later, when they can be tried speedily, to see if they really ARE guilty. Otherwise you are imprisoning a bunch of innocent, at least legally innocent, people.",

Do we really expect the appellate courts to bother touching this hot mess?I am not a lawyer and I have a limited understanding of the law of USA. However, if the released footage is relevant to prove that the defendant is actually innocent of some of the charges he was tried for, then an appeal is reasonable.For example, someone during Jan 6th could be charged by battering or violent assault, however if the new tapes actually reveal that specific person to behave in a peaceful manner while inside the capitol, then ok.nonetheless, other charges (like trespassing federal property) won't get dropped. An immediate release it is not likely.",

If the Jan6 rioters were so bad, why are Congress and the media not showing any real harm that they did?... certainly not enough to warrant more than 2 years behind bars without a trial;2. Why did the Jan6 Committee pick and choose the video that they were going to show people. All that Tucker is doing is revealing more of the video.Regarding your statement that Tucker is a liar:1. Everybody tells lies at time, even Tucker now and again;2. Why are the Jan6 Committee members lying?3. Why do government people take an oath to the Constitution, yet fail to uphold one of the basic Constitutional rights that people have... innocent until proven guilty in court?4. Why does the judiciary not uphold the fundamental rules for the judiciary in their Rules of Court - http://voidjudgments.com/?You are missing a whole lot about the way our government is run, compared with how it is supposed to be run.",

However, there is something I cannot get yet. If during Jan 6th there were undercover agents set to incite chaos, by the government; but was not Trump the biggest representative of the US goverment during and after that day? In theory he had access to the chief of both FBI and CIA, so if he wanted, he could have known whether there was some undercover operation going on. He held the presidential power for days after the capitol riot day.  Or he could not ask to have access to documents making reference to such operations? Does not the president have the highest security clearance?",
