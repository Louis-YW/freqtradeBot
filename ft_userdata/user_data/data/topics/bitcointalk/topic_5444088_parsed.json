Crypto payment gateways also ask users to supply that information - and that is without involving KYC at all.",

About the price fluctuation, you should know that you are dealing with a volatile asset and only little difference in price would likely be seen after the payment has been initiated. For business, it is better to make use of a payment processor, especially if you are having many customers that are paying with bitcoin, payment processor can even auto convert it from bitcoin to fiat for you.",

To confirm if its the right amount you can use a simple api that check price at a date of transfer. you can also set a price in bitcoin just like many crypto/fiat transaction intermediaries work (like bitpay or coingate). when you click \"pay with bitcoin\" it check current bitcoin price, set a price in bitcoin, add a fee, generate new bitcoin address for deposit and wait.",

From Binnace, Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, Bitfinex, BitMEX ?- You can credit each receiving address and label it with name of each customer if necessary. But this will increase your inputs for future transactions, then eat you more trasnaction fee.- Did you wait for one confirmation before processing goods to your customers? If it is what you did, you should have a transaction hash for each customer. Note it in your sheet.If you don't wait for 1 confirmation at least, it is risky. Double spend or reorganization can occur.How many confirmations is enough?",

You can maybe look into coinos.io. I haven't really used them myself (aside from testing) but it's pretty simple and straightforward. You create an account and click \"request payment\" whenever a customer wants to pay in BTC, a unique LN invoice/bitcoin address is then generated for the customer. If he pays, a message will show.You can also check this video to see how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXduj4fnSuw",

What's been asked by OP is simple thing, each transaction shows the value at the time of transaction and the value at right now. This is more than enough to understand which transaction is done by specific person.",

Then means after something and than means comparison.If transaction is missing after 3 hours, you will see it as unconfirmed transaction or transaction with less than 6 confirmations if you visit blockchain explorer and see transaction in details. If I were you, I would set up digital screen where I would generate QR code for them and would provide them with converted USD to BTC amount and with live information of recommended bitcoin transaction fee and would manually check fee of each transaction to be sure.I assume touchscreen and laptop will help you to make this process more exiting and smooth.
