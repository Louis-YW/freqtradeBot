Many old members with high ranks before appearance of merit system are shit posters.Members with same earned merits can have difference in post quality.

So both are needed.What you see as nonsense might make sense to others; you can't just conclude the complete meaning of someone's statement based on your own personal point of view. Here in this forum, everyone is entitled to their own ideas; you can't contribute more than you don't know. I won't argue with you about a few people posting or making off-topic comments because just because I'm a higher rank member does not make me perfect if I go off topic or my idea towards a particular issue is not in line with what's being currently discussed. Anyone can call me to order it's not based on rank. Another thing is that a legendary member, which you might also see dropping a few topics that do not actually match their rank or their comments are far off the mark, has been caused by or based on two reasons: 1: the member acquired that rank by opportunity and did not really merit it; what I mean is that they might fall among those that were airdropped merit when the merit system was introduced. Because earning enough merit and activities to reach a legendary rank is enough time for one to familiarize himself or herself with broad knowledge, It's not by force to always contribute to a topic, so if they don't have anything to say, they will avoid the thread.2. The account might have changed hands; the real owner built it to that level; if someone who's supposed to still be learning around the forum and outside regarding things now happens to get their hands on such an account, irrelevant posts might likely occur.But to be clear to me no one's comment is actually completely useless some people will still take a few point from it why you will be busy criticizing it. In your thread, for example, not everyone will have to support it; few will see it as completely useless.",

      "body": "It doesn't matter which rank you are. You may be at any rank and still can publish useless posts and in my experience, i have read not so many useless posts/comments. But i do read some useless topics and they were useless to me because they have been discussed so many times on my watch. For example. One topic you will definitely read in the trading section and in Beginner and help section:Top 5 or 10 mistakes that a trader must avoid as a newbie. And mistakes that you should avoid as a newbie on this forum to stay long respectively.The point is, useless and unnecessary characteristic of any topic is a distinct properties. This means to say one might see one topic as useless while at the same time, another reader might find the same topic attractive and useful. So it also depends on the smartness level of readers. Now, if you think you found some useless comments and they value nothing but maybe they might have some value to the OP. And at the end, the ranking doesn't mean you will have more meaningful and useful posts. Because I am at senior rank and still ask useless questions here which I can also search on Google and on any other search engine but i prefer to ask them here also because here i get so many suggestions with different answers and it only benefits me.  So my suggestion is do not afraid to ask questions by being afraid to be declared as useless. Because learning has no boundaries. But i have reported some topics too which were encouraging people to click on some links and spreading spam and irrelative topics on different threads.",

Some of those it was airdropped to couldn’t cope and had to bow out of the forum as for those reputable members you could see them still contributing greatly into the forum.

Maybe I haven't read all the threads, so I have to ask about my statement, that many high ranking members have low quality posts? talk nonsense and have no clear arguments. Is my statement correct?A high rank guarantees nothing. At all. Especially the quality of the posts. Forum members who received ranks in the old era rose in the ranking system only by activity and the number of posts. In the new era, this became more difficult due to the introduced merit system. As a result, many participants remained on the forum, for example, hero or legendary who never received a single merit. The quality of their posts is such that for thousands of posts, none of them attracted attention and approval in the form of +1 merit. Of course, even this is not an indicator, but the fact remains.I like your phrase that stupid people are also needed.  Otherwise, who will ask questions that smart people will answer. I definitely won’t blaspheme you, because I know firsthand the problem that you voiced, and in the same way I think that some high-ranking users are talking nonsense. Moreover, I see, quite often, such accounts receive merits, sometimes quite a lot and very actively progressing in the ranking system. Seeing their posts, surprise and bewilderment don't leave me, because it seems to me extremely low quality. This is my subjective assessment, perhaps for someone this level of posting will seem acceptable, but not for me. I will say that there is nothing to be done about this and I just skip such posts so as not to waste my time. In fact, we ourselves are not without sin, because at times, I fail to write as well as I would like. It remains unattainable for me that each of my messages turns out to be first-class and approved by others.On the other side of the scale, you can see the opposite - this is when low-ranking users write such good and high-quality posts that not every high-ranking one is able to write. In terms of presentation, informativeness or content. This in its own way creates a balance in the system and you should not worry about high-ranking posters. Don't think about them and focus on yourself and your actions.",

Some areas and posts are more for fun (one example is W.O.), and that should be taken more lightly.3. Some people prefer to have fun now and then, some others try too hard to post a lot (for their campaigns) and both cases can end up easily to also have some lower quality posts (some more of them, some less..)4. Keep in mind that people have started without knowledge. I am sure that many of my posts from my first years on the forum can be seen today as weak.But it doesn't matter that much.
