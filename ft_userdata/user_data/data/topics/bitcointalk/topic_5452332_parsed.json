I don't find Duelbits on your site, what the heck of Pepe Casino? it's a rug pull project.Only Rollbit, Bc.game, Stake, Bitsler, Roobet, Winz.io and Starbets that are having a reputation in this forum, I don't know with the rest.If you including Duelbits, I will pick Duelbits. But if not, I will pick Stake.",

What is missing are smaller casinos that also hold a good reputation, but are not so well known so far. Duelbits is a good example and also Coinslotty. I like those more, because they usually have better deals for you, because they want to attrackt new users.So my vote: Coinslotty because of the good deals when you sign up.",

However, they are some new crypto casinos that offer more than just a casino. Example 1, offers NFT as a bonus 2, Offer their own token, that you can stake on the casino 3, Casinos that offer you to lend your NFT to get cash ( NOT recommended)And who knows, maybe Stake is just very good at marketing, maybe there is other casinos, that have more games, better support etc, And the only way to find this out, is to ask the players",

      "body": "OP, I appreciate your initiative in trying to compile a list of the best casinos, but I have my doubts about whether it is possible to create a completely unbiased and objective list. There are so many factors that can influence someone's opinion, such as personal preferences and experiences. What one person considers to be a \"good\" casino may not be the same for another, and I doubt that you can find many members (if any) who have experience with ALL casinos. In my opinion, a more appropriate title for your casino list would be \"most popular\" rather than \"best casino\". This change would better reflect the content of your list while acknowledging the subjectivity inherent in such rankings.In addition, I would recommend sorting the list of candidates alphabetically. This would make it easier for readers to navigate the list and avoid duplication of entries. Furthermore, since there may be casinos with similar names, it might be helpful to include their full domain names to minimize confusion.Finally, I suggest that you limit your list to only those casinos that have a presence on this forum, such as an official ANN thread. Including only such casinos would ensure that you consider only reputable and established platforms that are already well-known and respected within this community.",

A solid criterion and voting members should also be present. If you plan on doing this, I suggest just picking those people that should cast their votes. The voting should not be open for all but only to eligible voters who meet the specified requirements (it'll be best to be transparent about who has voted, which casino they had voted to, and the results and numbers).

That will help your audience know what casino people vote on Bitcointalk. That could be their reference to search for the right casino for them. It also helps beginners compare each casino and find what suits them. By the way, I choose Stake.com",
