Likewise, blindly clicking on the “copy” button may ultimately provide the user with a link to a phishing site, and then the tragedy of hacking will follow.So be sure to check all the links you copy and paste to avoid being the victim of a hacker attack one day.",

Copying a link is as simple as holding the link url which copies automatically. Your suggestions might help a bit, but I don't see it being useful in anyway.

You can copy up to 10 things at once, depending on how many keyboards you are using, so if you are to copy multiple links when you open anywhere that you want to paste those links, you can then manually insert them by clicking on the keyboard option on your device. Then for iOS mobile devices, it's don't have that multiple copying of things to your clipboard all at once, but you can always use an alternative keyboard, which can all you do that, but do it at your own risk, as the more external apps you install in your gadget, the more exposed your device is to hackers, as you can never tell what else the app is doing in the background without your knowledge. Using your PC to browse through the forum, if you want to copy a link, you can just do that by navigating through tabs and pressing CTRL+C and Ctrl+P, and you are all good.",

There tend to be setting to hide URL bar while surfing website to make your reading experience better but even then there will be gestures or similar which will make your URL bar appear again. You can choose not to enable it, if you find it inconvenient. Regarding highlighting of links, I assume you talk about masked links, if so, you can copy link using, \"copy link to clipboard\" option, most browser have that. There are plenty browsers available on play store, each one having their own implementations, try them and you will find what you are looking for. I use Lemur browser, on it this is how you copy links [1], if you find extra tap inconvenient in URL bar, I think it's same with Opera. I'm primarily mobile user, never for once felt need what you are saying, [1] https://www.talkimg.com/image/PYCI5",

It's better not to mess with the current forum code. Who knows what bugs it may bring? There are other patches that you should be concerned about, like the security of bitcointalk. We have more than enough required features in BitcoinTalk. Try to use it some time. At first, I too had problems. But with time, I got used to it.",
