Last time I check, the software was proprietary. I hope you're not talking about the single-currency wallets which were all archived a couple of years ago, because those don't quality (and there is apparently only an Android version of that apparently).Also, Quotethe device we install this wallet has to be connected with internet to access the assets which make them vulnerable to attacks.This is not a security concern unless you are either making your transaction or the server somehow logs your password (extraordinarily strange, but stranger things have happened to Atomic Wallet).",

So use Electrum/samourai for bitcoin, NEW for Ethereum, and unstoppable wallet for other altcoins.Buying a hardware wallet is a good option in this case.",

Op should just get a good BTC wallet, either Electrum, Sparrow or BlueWallet for their BTC and get another altcoin wallet like Unstoppable wallet for altcoins.",

Both wallets were installed and not so much space. Something that is not wrong if done. There is a separation between the two.Bitcoin are stored in wallets that specifically support Bitcoin and use other wallets to store altcoins.It will be easier if there is a wallet that can be trusted to store two types at once, such as an unstoppable wallet. Of course, don't store it in large quantities.If storing Bitcoin in the Electrum wallet, I also recommend it because it's a proven wallet.It would be even better to use a hardware wallet in order to further increase comfort.Quote from: blue Snow on July 14, 2023, 02:21:45 AMThis way is the most comfortable for me when I compare it to installing a wallet that I don't trust yet.Including Trust Wallet.Wallets to avoid for storing coins.",

For bitcoin, Guarda wallet only support the legacy type of bitcoin address. Nothing like nested segwit, native segwit and pay-to-taproot.Â  Atomic wallet at that time and as of now, it is only supporting legacy address too. It is good for developers to be active and do what are the latest. I can list many coins that Guarda is not also supporting. If there is any doubt, you can ask me to list the coins.
