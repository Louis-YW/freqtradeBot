The problem of things is tied to the present lives of many people, and it is almost impossible for us to get rid of it, HOLDing is also one of the reasons that makes me find it easy to become very difficult when life influences it. I admit that I am also in need of money to serve the ideals that I pursue in life, and indeed, the money invested in the markets is a success that transforms my life process and perception different from the life we're seeing. What I've seen has fundamentally changed the fortunes that I have, and it's helped me personally first. And now when I share these things with the people next to me, it's just my own experience, so sometimes that formula doesn't work for them either. What do we expect from these things? I still can't say for sure if material wealth but being blind to ourselves will prevent the truth about money from coming out. Maybe some of the issues are a bit abstract, but the simplification of knowledge as well as the choices in this life help me realize a meaningful life.",

The mental strength to do and practice what we preach. Yeah, maybe in the first couple of months we can do it, but how about when the price is going down and seeing our portfolio losing value as well? So it's going to be very tough and for sure there will be nights that you wanted to sell, so you have to fight that emotions back.",

I was tempted between LUNA and BTC where I see others are getting FOMO’d days ago after they’ve bought the dip. But I chose BTC because I want long-term results and not some altcoin like LUNA that would likely rug slowly and get dumped when LUNA holders going to mass sell the fork version of it.I was surprised that my beautiful European friend who is much more experienced than me chose to buy LUNA because of enormous trading volume rather than considering the worst-case scenario after the fork.",
