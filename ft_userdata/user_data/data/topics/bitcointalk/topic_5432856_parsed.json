In the other mixers, it seems they're charge more fee, so just think like how centralized exchange make money through fixed withdrawal fee even though it's actually really cheap at the moment.I think if you're use Tor network to access the mixer, the domain host wouldn't record anything of your privacy.",

This being said, there's no valuable information to sell, since those not using Tor may not be actual users/customers, instead only some curious people. So I would not count on getting much of info from the browser.Of course, if a mixer is a honeypot, they can lie about not keeping client information and instead sell all the info to chain analysis companies or government agencies.After all, trusting a mixer still means.. trusting.Of course, unless a mixer was specifically built for as honeypot, it won't be doing that (keeping and selling user info) because it will mean they admit they are mixing funds and some agencies may not like that. So let's not become too paranoid...",

And lastly in terms of protecting a user's footprints, can a domain host give (sell) out this information to third parties ? The main reason why people use mixers is to protect their privacy and break the chain of transactions. So I don't think any mixer will sell off their user's data because that's the only area on which they have built their business. But no one really knows what they do at the background. There's always a risk! Also mixers have been a target for the regulatory agencies in US where FBI has already a mixing service to shut down. So it may be very much possible that the regulatory bodies already possess the data from the closed mixing service. A risk factor will always be there but it's no possible to catch it in naked eye.",

There are (at least) two types of businesses usually paying big bucks for advertising:* The newcomers that want to be seen, checked out, attract customers, and your example is very good for that* The established businesses that want people to see how big and important they are, businesses that want to pretty much be part of every day life. This is what Coca-Cole does at TV, this is how I see ChipMixer here on bitcointalk.Of course, there are other cases too, like new products (see new phone releases on TV, see new games or coins in the casino or sportsbook portfolio) and others I am sure they exist, but don't really come to my mind now.However, this is not something specific to mixers and not something specific to bitcointalk. Just something normal for all businesses and for all places that allow advertising.",

After spending big initial budget for advertisement, they will have to get another source for advertisement budget that only can come from their platform income.

Some mixers charge some fee apart from the transaction fees that you pay in the network to maintain operation costs and keep their employees paid. Others depend on Adsense which is why some mixers either employ the use of popup ads that come up every so often to confirm transactions, or the sidebar ads you see on some irreputable sites out there. Some like chipmixer, depend on the people's goodwill by asking for donations. So far Chipmixer's the only mixer I ever saw have success in this business model as not everyone will have the capacity let alone the conscience to donate. Long as they get what they want they call it quits and run off. Still, I guess most mixers employ the use of using multiple wallets, to mix and clean cryptocurrencies, but with enough dedication and redbull every transactions can still be tracked back to its source, it's just a matter of how good a mixer the site is, and if the coins you wanna get mixed came from scams, cos most mixers are now more inclined to helping the people rather than the scammers, and will freeze assets soon as they detect it came from fraudulent means.",

I read some mixers that operate a few months and suddenly shutdown or scam after their platforms received big deposit from a user and their teams decided to exit with a scam.Using mixer is like using centralized exchanges, we should not send a too big capital in a single deposit or should never send all coin we have to a mixer.
