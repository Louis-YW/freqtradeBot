Myself every time I transfer money, I even double check and it can take up to 3 to 4 minutes before I hit the send button let alone this is a huge amount of money. Although nothing too serious has happened yet, we should still be very careful, do not leave money on crypto.com, gate at this time. Proof of reserve is a great idea, exchanges that are shady about storing user assets will be phased out soon.",

They did a shady thing, and they are hoping that they could get away with it, and if they really do and nothing happens, it means bad things for our future.",

Either way, get your money out.You don't make mistakes like that with such amounts of money. This gets checked 10 times before the button is pressed. I feel like all these exchanges play around with customers' money and if asked to deliver 100% of it they'd repeat SBF's statement \"sorry, we fucked up\". What's keeping them alive is the fact that there's rarely a real bank run in crypto. FTX would've been with us if not for CZ and his token selloff that spooked other token holders, created a bank run and exposed FTX. Whatever happens, bitcoin will not be affected much. If idiots get scared and panic sell many people will be there to buy what they're throwing away for free. After all 90% of stock investors lose money and usually it's not because the companies go bankrupt but because they can't handle the pressure.",
