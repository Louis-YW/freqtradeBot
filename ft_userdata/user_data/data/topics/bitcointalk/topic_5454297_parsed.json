Using the date from the ann thread BTC was between $7000 to $8000. So, using today's BTC price I am asking for about a 3.25 to 3.5x premium on it.

I noticed this a while ago, but thought it would have recovered by now. Not the case but it will happen eventually.Have you tried putting it on scarce.city - not sure if they offer a normal sale option that's not an auction, though.I already got one of these, otherwise I'd be pretty tempted with a first (and only one) platinum collectible.",

If you look at the last auction I did: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5505172 or the one I have up now https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5507494 there is / was very little interest.
