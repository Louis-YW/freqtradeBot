  "content": "We know Bitcoin BTC is very volatile and it is still new in our society. Many people don't know what is Bitcoin, its utility and how it has changed the world. There are supporters and protesters that are good because the world and society don't have motivational reasons to self-adjust and grow more without counter-arguments.I introduce everyone two sites to check that How many times has Bitcoin been called as dead? It is more than 450 times.https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/I will add the screenshot laterLindy effectRead more in The bullish case for BitcoinA longer an asset exists, the bigger the Lindy effect is and a better survival for that asset.Fear and greed indexIt is 8 now that means extremely fearful. Check the index withhttps://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index/So, it is good time to be greed when others are fearful. If in either 2020 or 2021 you hoped to see Bitcoin at price $20,000 to buy it at discount price, now you have opportunity, will you take it?Or will you be fearful now and regret later?",

      "body": "This is very common, whenever the price crash takes place the panic among the common people goes high. This means the market always needs to be bullish. This won't happen with any of the real market. Only the manipulated market can be kept on the bull side without any big deviation downward.This panic makes people think of bitcoin to be dead and won't recover when there is drastic crash in the market. In such a way bitcoin have died many times. After every death bitcoin have come out with more potential. What we see can also be a decline for a big rise before the next halving.",

When Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 in late of 2017, they felt regret. Again, when Bitcoin hits $69,000 they felt regret. It is exactly what they told me but they just said, if you can help me to buy Bitcoin in previous years. Something like this.They missed chances but they have responsibility too. If they are serious, they can knock my doors, find me and I would have taught them to buy Bitcoin in 2017. They just wanted me to help them buying Bitcoin for them, with their money. I did not do this because I see risk when making transactions.They did not have experience with Bitcoin wallet, transaction so how should I explain in case I make mistakes and lose all Bitcoin in one transaction to non existing address. It's very hard to sayIn 2021, they came back with another demand, asking me to help them buying BNB. I rejected again. I can only teach them how to buy it, but not buying it on behalf of these people.",

Something like this.I have also encountered people like this who come up with excuses not to buy, the excuses sometimes change and could be;• It's too technical for me to understand• It is too expensive, I would not get much for the amount I have (but they will watch their savings eroded by inflation,• I wish the price would dip (when it's rising)• The market is unstable (when it starts dipping)• and so, and so.Such people would likely never buy, or would end up buying some shitcoin which is sold at $0.0001 per token in the hope of getting into the \"next Bitcoin\" early",

I think in 2009 there will be buying action all over the world.the price is far away from today, if they believe in the history of the past, the eye will not have any doubts for even the next 10 years?If you think that assets are needs, not greed, they (the holders) should think about the future, maybe it will happen again.for petitions or people who comment on the end of a bitcoin journey I think it's just an expression and overflow.and i still believe in bitcoin",

Peeps will see this as an opportunity but unfortunately these are no one but the whales who understand this as actual “opportunity”. They will invest without hesitation. Just open any exchanger and go to the volumetric market depth, we can clearly see huge buy orders even at this price which means investors are planning their future and being greedy to get on to this train.",

But some financial projects that could receive financial attacks can die and make a lot of people poor and few people rich. It is great to show that you can not trust in anything because the market is going up, sometimes you can lose everything.",
