I have claimed and it didn't cost me much transaction fee. I agree with your opinion that it might be criteria for their anticipated airdrop. I have been actively participating in its test net campaigns and completed all necessary task required to qualify for Scroll network airdrop. I am hopeful that announcement will probably made in first quarter of 2024.",

Imagine if those are the magnitude of airdrops that will be given to users, but anyway maybe a multiplier to the airdrop possible. Yet to interqct heavily on scroll as my funds have been somewehere else. But did some trstnet transaction though.",

But did some trstnet transaction though.You are absolutely right that large number of scroll network users have claimed this nft. Consequently, it seems highly unlikely that all of them will qualify for the expected airdrop. However I think holding of this specific nft might be one of the several requirements for eligibility, other factors, such as volume of transaction generated, and utilization of protocols built on scroll network may also play a role in determining eligibility for the airdrop.",

This seems possible since they had 3 phases, who deployed contract early got different nft, so it could be used as criteria with early deployers getting highest multiplier. Out of 1.1M, significantly less would have deployed early. Also, unique contract deployers may get better allocation, almost every one of these 1.1M would have used those online contract deployers, which ofc helped in completing task but may not help in qualifying for much Scroll tokens. Let's see how this goes.",

      "body": "I’ve minted mine last night and it’s Quintic. Good thing that my wallet is eligible because of successfully deploying a smart contract on this chain despite my transaction and activities are not that much. This could be a potential multiplier for a future airdrop if they would ever release a token. Although I do not see any guarantees or promises at all if there would be a Scroll airdrop, but I am betting on that chance even if it’s just very slim. I believe that I still have long ways to go though so I would be doing more activities in the Scroll chain with my extra “not beer” money for spending gas fees, etc.",

Since they already on mainnet it seems that the better task now is to interact with much dapps there and make volumes. However I didnt do much as I am focus on other networks. But since Ive made testnet hope it counts though. The thing about thr nft is thry got ranks or qualities maybe that also a big impact on the airdrop.",

My friend suggested me about this nft and complete all task because no one know on which criteria the airdrop will be distributed. We may see the good price of this nft in future if some rumour created for this nft in the future. Anyone know how much funding Scroll project still raised so far?",

Frankly not sure what would be the price of this nft as there are lots of nfts claimors. Can this be able to sell? cause from what I read its a soulbound token and has a unique identification per user but able to see this on some nft marketplace.",

Are we likely to see a resurgence in price of NFTs in 2024 or they will just populate this industry without much economic viability? I've seen a lot of projects ask participants to mint NFTs just like so many are having airdrops now too and chains indulging memetokens and silently backing them. Maybe this is a pointer to what we should expect next year of where the most money will be earned. Airdrops or NFTs or Memes?",

Im not familiar with the ecosystem yet as Ive still no funds to run by and still waiting for my other potential profits from airdrops and investment. But I will definitely do some volume and transaction on scroll anytime sooner.",
