Even Google explicitly states there is no desktop version of their translation service. Don't rely too much on antivirus too, most of the time we can just avoid any trouble if we research for a bit.",

I'm surprised it's worked and is on desktop though - I thought apps might be harder to find especially without advertisement.Antivirus is good with known threats and lesser known software (and to track when some programmes are using too many system resources) but I don't think it'd have helped in this case as the app was downloaded from a fairly random source anyway and users might just override the antivirus if they did want the app to work.",

They could have wallet stealers and keyloggers. All they need is to get one right person affected and it pays off for them.I am always assuming if i get warez or programs from unknown sources that they have viruses. I am using a virtual enviroment for them if i need to install one and keep my computer with my real email and I get a lot of people in twitter telling me they want to buy promotion from me with a good price. They send me something that look like contract documents or something like that in .rar packages but after closer look they have another extention after .doc extention. (aka viruses)I am betting people are falling these a lot because they keep doing this scam.",

A malware that is fashioned to be an antivirus is surely an ironic thing, but one can try to find a reputable and battle-tested antivirus officially, to prevent those kinds of things.What i mean is that windows own anti-virus system is so powerful at this point that i wouldn't recommend a 3rd party system messing things up. That's all i am saying. But there's no system that would keep users safe when users see warnings as false positives and launch .exes anyway that antivirus tries to block.Just NOT downloading any weird obscure software keeps newbs way safer than any 3rd party free or paid antivirus software out there. It's really hard to build idiot-proof systems when the idiots have a say what's better for their data safety.",
