The financial loss associated with misprediction is normal, a cost of obtaining income, just like gas cost for a taxi driver. Without fuel, the taxi driver will not earn, without occiasional losses, trader wont profit. Losing is normal. you just have to know how to cut losses, cherish profits, and make sure that at the end of the day, you come out on top.Quote from: Davidvictorson on September 07, 2023, 02:37:32 PMMaybe I should stop quarterly prediction and stick with monthly predictions. you should stop making predictions placed in any time perspective. Just bet on long/short. the market tends to be undervalued for years, overvalued for years. Good investor just bets on undervalued things and wait patiently - and here I will quote Warren Buffett that in the market, money passes from the impatient to the patient. Predicting that the price will reach certain levels by day xx contradicts this statement. And in particular, you should stop telling your colleagues about your predictions. It doesn't matter if they turn out to be good or bad, they still hurt them. I recommend Nicolas Taleb's antifragility - this will help you understand that any \"expert opinion\" is harmful.",

I hide my head in shame because right now it is struggling at $25. I know how you feel right now and you do not have to bury your head in shame, all you just need is to learn more. Perhaps the trading strategy you are using is not accurate enough, or you might want to add strategies to complement each other. And at times, you might not be reading your strategies well or not listening to their dynamism as the price of the market changes.Bitcoin is one of the easiest markets to predict for long and medium-term trading, and you might also want to focus more on support and resistance strategies, they are important for accurate predictions if used well.QuoteMaybe I should stop quarterly prediction and stick with monthly predictions. Also how do you suggest I handle incorrect price predictions? Anybody been here. How do you handle it?You and only you can know the capability of your trading strategy in line with the way you use it, and as you didn't disclose the strategy, it's difficult to advise you further on it.However, limiting the forecast to monthly prediction might make you manage your position more effectively. As for the wrong predictions, we should all prepare for contingencies when we trade, a simple exit level should have been predefined before opening a position.",

It's impossible to predict bitcoin's price accurately time after time. Some people manage to do it once, then fail, then get it right again and so on. You make a single prediction, fail and see it as a problem, which it is not. Operate on facts and the facts are:-fiat money is losing value all the time, so it's bound to be worth less in time than bitcoin, which slowly gains value due to growing cost of mining and limited supply. -bitcoin is eventually going to surpass its ATH. Don't try to guess when, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be by the end of 2024.",

How do you handle it?Knowing fully well that bitcoin price is unpredictable, makes it easier for you to be able to pick up when you failed to give accurate or near accurate predictions of the future market,  and for those that we're involved in the discussion with you when you speculated the bitcoin price to reach 35k-40k already understand the fact that it was just speculation just like you can predict the result of a future football match it may happen and it may not just like in this situation. So the best form of antidote for such feelings is by making up your mind to look away from reality regardless of whether you win or lose in your speculations since we already know that it is impossible to predict the future price due to high volatility.",

How do you handle it?Everyone here doesn't come from the future, meaning they never know what will happen the next day let alone in the next few months. If you make predictions and analysis, then it should be good to support your investment plan. But if you are doing it for someone else, then tell them that your analysis and predictions are not financial advice.After all, bitcoin is traded freely and it also has high volatility. Good news about adoption developments and others will make the fundamentals good, but conversely bad things will have an impact on price corrections. Currently the market is struggling to recover, but we need to be patient and it will take longer than expected.",

The person who made the prediction will acknowledge that it was accurate if the prediction is realized. But for the time being, all forecasts regarding anyone will remain conjecture.We therefore still can't confirm your estimate from the third quarter that Bitcoin may hit $40k per unit this month. Even if something unexpected occurs, your prediction may still come true. You are aware of how unstable and expensive the market is for Bitcoin. If you continue to believe your prognosis from January, there is nothing wrong with it.",
