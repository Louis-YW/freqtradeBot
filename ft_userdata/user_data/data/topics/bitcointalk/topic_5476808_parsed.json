  "content": "Hi All,I currently have between £300 - £400 left over each week from my salary in which i have been transferring in to a savings account with 4.75% interest, but recently i began to invest small weekly amounts into the popular alt coins (£50-£100) as i'm a fairly risk averse person by nature. I have recently sold those coins in my portfolio at break even or at best with small gains and re-invested the money into BTC & ETH.My plan moving forward is to use £150 of the money available to me to purchase BTC & ETH every week with the long game in mind, but was looking for advice really on how i should split the money % wise between the two assets? 50 / 50? i currently hold 0.096* ETH & 0.0057* BTC and have been seriously considering investing more but not sure if the amounts i have available make this worth while?",

Altcoins suchs as ETH might have shorter period of times where they pump more than bitcoin, but in the long run bitcoin always outperforms them. For a newbie such as yourself who probably won't know when to sell altcoin, imho going all in bitcoin is the right way to go and since you plan to be into this for a longer period of time (since you are doing DCA) I suggest to get a hardware asap.",

If that is your choice then do it because you must have done research on the coin you want to invest in but if you want to listen to other people's opinions then I would suggest focusing more on bitcoin. Not that we can't be in altcoins like ETH that you are currently holding but I think it would be great if in the end your focus is only on bitcoin. There are several things that can be the reason such as a slightly smaller risk and a situation where you can still be sure for bitcoin in the next few years. But if you really want to do both then I can't say anything and do what you want.",

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be both exciting and challenging. It's good that you're considering a long-term approach and diversifying your holdings. When deciding how to split your investments between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), there are a few factors to consider:1. Risk Tolerance2. Diversification3. Market Conditions4. Research and News5. Long-Term Goals6. Portfolio Size7. Cost Averaging8. Transaction Costs9. Future Additions10. Monitor and AdjustRegularly review your portfolio and adjust your strategy based on changes in the market or your financial situation.Given your current holdings, if you're leaning towards a balanced approach, a 50/50 split between Bitcoin and Ethereum is a reasonable starting point. However, always tailor your investment decisions to your personal preferences and financial goals. It's crucial to conduct thorough research and possibly consult with a financial advisor, especially in the dynamic and evolving world of cryptocurrency investing.",

Compared to 4.75% interestPerfectly said,  investing in Bitcoin is the best and least risky investment at this point,  much more effective than all the altcoins put together at most,  altcoins are nothing but gamble because there are no assurances in them and most times they are just a waste of time and money because most of them have ended up as lost or becoming worthless in the investors wallets,  so anyone who makes a good profit from altcoins investment is just lucky to have taken advantage at the peak of their price and as soon as they're done with the market rally their price will always slide back. So for sure putting a large amount of your leftover funds in Bitcoin will be the best decision to take as an investor and also making sure to only invest a significant small amount of good altcoins also is good that is if you must invest in them at all.",

Don't get me wrong, I didn't recommend JJG's links and posts because I wanted to tell you that it would be good to follow his advice blindly. A lot of the things he has written is not like advice, it is more of an overview of different approaches and potential outcomes as can by yourself be calculated and understood on the website that allows you to choose your own inputs. It is not anyone's parameters, you can put in whatever you think reflects your personal situation best. That was my intention and yes, never follow anyone's advice blindly and make sure you educate yourself to not keep your own eyes closed forever while trying to invest",

I'm in two minds on what to actually do now having read through the contrasting views. I can see valid points from all the suggestions and my knowledge is super limited which is why i have steered clear of the alt coins etc as i just don't have the knowledge to buy and sell at the correct times - i got a trial of trading view but that blew my mind so just read the ideas sections and this forum is amazing for content. i'm more interested in building something over time in addition to my regular savings and have considered commodities too which my bank offers, but maybe thats a venture for another time.",

I have got some food for thought from this OP and i'm sure the advice i've read will be beneficial to me in the long run. I totally agree ref the candles - i read a lot of new sites with those click bait type articles and to be frank got tired of the nonsense and false hope so just want to be able to assign a certain % of my salary to a solid asset without the rollcoaster journey along the way. Don't get me wrong, I didn't recommend JJG's links and posts because I wanted to tell you that it would be good to follow his advice blindly. A lot of the things he has written is not like advice, it is more of an overview of different approaches and potential outcomes as can by yourself be calculated and understood on the website that allows you to choose your own inputs. It is not anyone's parameters, you can put in whatever you think reflects your personal situation best. That was my intention and yes, never follow anyone's advice blindly and make sure you educate yourself to not keep your own eyes closed forever while trying to invest  Thanks for the time you've taken to reply to me, i really do appreciate it.. yours and others posts have certainly given me some things to consider. Getting to grips with all of this has been super interesting for me albeit confusing at times lol.",
