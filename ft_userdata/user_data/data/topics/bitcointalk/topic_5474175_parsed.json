      "body": "Sounds to me just like a parlay bet, do you have to win all the bets that you're combining on the bet builder tab or not? Because that's how you can win in parlay bets right? By correctly predicting all the right events or wins in a game. Probably the only difference of parlay and this one is that bet builder is just for one game, so if you're betting on a low odds team, you can maximize your wins by adding other predictions and to me, it's a pretty risky thing to do especially if you add who's going to score the most or who gets the first score.",

With the bet builder, you don't have to study a lot of games on the board to be part of your leg to increase the odds, as you can get everything in just one game. Though it's quite limited compared to parlay, I think it's easier to win with the bet builder compared to parlay. But if you are serious about your betting, go with a single bet most of the time; this bet builder could only be good if you like to experience extra fun.",

I find it easier to win than a parlay. In one game, if you know your team well — for example, a high-scoring team — when they win, that means they are dictating the game. This suggests the game will likely end up over or their total score will be over. So, the bet would be TEAM + over, and the odds will only be based on whether you choose the spread or the moneyline.",

      "body": "Yeah! I'm 100% into parlay betting since it feels like winning a lottery to me eventhough I haven't hit any yet. I've been doing this for years now and none of my bet builders have been successful. Hitting a parlay or bet builder bet is tough because you're trying to predict the outcomes of multiple events. As you add more predictions it gets harder because all of them have to be right for you to win. Even if you're good at predicting one thing getting everything right in a parlay is a bigger challenge.",

Although if the lower the money you will use for it, you can try it out yourself and have the experience yourself.How do you factor I risk to reward ratio with single bet option? What has been your win rate? Do you consider it profitable on the long run? I do believe that gambling requires strategy thats why I use the bet builder and focus in winning one bet in at least ten bets and this covers all the losses and still keep me in good profits. There are other factors I do consider too which I might not be able to detailed here. So far, it has been working for me and that's the most important thing.",

If you have taken higher risk in a game or a particular game, that will increase the odd for you and increased odd means higher profit from the usual but you have lesser success rate if you had taken only one chance.For example in a soccer match where you bet on goal/goal and over 3.5 , it means both sides must score a goal and the total goals must be above 3 goals. So you should get a score like 3-1, 2-2, 3-2 but where all above 3 goals was scored by only one of the teams, you will lose the bet. Therefore, if you have a result like 4-0, 5-0, 6-0 , you have lost the bet since the other side didn't get a goal because you predicted that both side must score and that the goals will be above 3 goals.In the same light, if the goals were below 3 but shared between the teams, you still lost. Like if you have a score line of 1-1, 2-1, you also lost the bet .There are so many examples that can be given with your enquiry. Like if you bet 1& ov 2.5 , 2& 2.5 etc, they are of two different bets in a game and they deserve increased odds and it limits your winning chances.",

It's fun to bet on these high odds though and very satisfying when you hit one. i have not won any of the parlays i made, it could be a waste of money like its said above but it's still fun. winning methods is the easiest to guess especially in boxing when you know the puncher is a KO artist.",

So I'd like to hear your thoughts regarding this, is it also profitable or just a waste of money?Actually, Bet builder is really popular now because you can have a higher on winning this kind of bet type when the match goes on to your prediction.Eg. is when you pick multiple bet on over score (over 2.5, 3.5 and so on) while the result of the game is high scoring. You can benefit on this if you knew that the game result will go according to your assumption unlike parlay that is based on multiple match meaning different variables. Bet builder is a one time big time tool which will give you more benefits if you properly analyze one game.",

      "body": "In my experience, it depends on the type of bet builder you're making, as it can be a money maker on certain days, or it'll be the one burning your bankroll. I'd say the feature is good enough because it offers an alternative way of getting better odds whenever i'm less interested in betting on a specific market. If I see a team that always wins and is bad at covering the spread, then I would go for their moneyline and pair it with a team total or another stat that the team can cover. It shouldn't be a waste of money if you research hard enough between the teams and players because bet builders also include player props.",

So I'd like to hear your thoughts regarding this, is it also profitable or just a waste of money?This feature is profitable and at the same time carries high risks because even if one of your predictions goes wrong you will lose your money. A lot of sports bettors i see prefer this feature because with lesser amount of money you can win higher amounts. The difference with single bets is that you can stake as low as you want and the more games you accumulate the higher your potential win but for single bets you need to stake a reasonable amount in order to increase your winning except if maybe you go for bigger odds which usually is more risky and reduces your chances of winning.

Although if the lower the money you will use for it, you can try it out yourself and have the experience yourself.I prefer to go for the multiple bet feature especially when I don’t have much money to stake but the risk is even higher than the single betting. The higher the risk the higher the win, but in my case i don’t accumulate too much games i only stick to at most 5 games per stake when i want to try the multiple betting feature.",

Problem is the difficulty of winning; bigger the odd build, greater the risk of losing. Best way is to lessen expectation with bet/odds ratio. Greed is a powerful factor which often yields to loss. There are just people betting a small amount with a 10 odds, some would make the kdds higher, still for the sake of earning more. I do bet still with bet builder in particular with Basketball related leagues.If you’re into risk then you might be attracted with this one aside from the kind of sports which would allow you to enjoy and embrace the risk of losing but hitting a jackpot if would be fortunate.",
