Or they can even ask for the KYC if you deposit any big amount in the casino. For this reason, i will usually deposit less in a Non-KYC casino so in case they ask for KYC or do not accept my KYC, in both cases my risk of losing money will be minimized.",

It's not a responsible gambling if one isn't making enough money per month and using all they have to try out their luck on a casino, that's a very bad gambling strategy,  there are many things that comes first before gambling, like savings, emergency money, investment money, if all these are set then you have a responsible life going on, then you can start using some small part of money to gamble. Losing $1000 to a casino is considered a great loss to someone like me, because I am not making up to $500 in a month, that's why I don't use more than $40 max for gambling and most times I even use less than $40.",

Have you ever wondered why some casinos would start as a KYC free casino and after a while when members have deposited their funds and have started playing games and winning and when it is due withdrawal they tell them to do KYC and if the gambler refuses, they block or ban them permanently from accessing their account. In some cases if the KYC details are suspected to be from nations that have restrictions on gambling, they take advantage of it to penalise the gambler by suspending their account while in some cases they take the assets of the gambler.One of the major challenges of KYC I think is the issue of privacy. When ones privacy is compromised, their is every possibility that their details would be used against or possibly do some shady that they have no knowledge about.

Some won't even ask you to complete your KYC when you are making a deposit unless it is too large, but they might ask you for KYC verification during the withdrawal process if the amount isn't too small.That being said, I wouldn't recommend anyone using non-KYC platforms if they are willing to gamble with large amounts because security is the most important thing when it comes to finances. If your funds are lost or the casino closes down its services all of a sudden, there is no way for the customers to get their money back.",

The increase of leaked or sold documents of people, is a disadvatage of KYC. Many players do not give their real information, they buy it. I'll always prefer the non kyc casino due to its fast registration process. But, casinos accept KYC to provide atleast an information of a player, indulging in money laundering. If not, the Government can hold the casino responsible for supporting such action. Yet the disadvantages goes back to other innocent players, who submit their real documents. Security conscious players, who understand this, don't go for KYC casino. Any reputable no KYC casino, though rare, will experience rapid growth in players. Meddling with our documents online, just for gambling isn't encouraged. It's better to play in physical casino.

The best available care they show on vulnerable individuals is to write the \"play responsibly\" advise on their TOS. On the other hand, they also use KYC to keep track of underage players, but, its already late if the casino asks this during withdrawal. The underage person gambled already, before asking or investigating to know if they're qualified to gamble. Even, teenager have means of tricking the casino, with the details of adults. Casinos are concerned about traffic and profits, they invest little effort in eliminating irresponsible gambling. Another good actions casinos take against addicted gamblers, is by finding out if a player has been banned by another casino for being addicted, and then terminate their account or ban them too.",
