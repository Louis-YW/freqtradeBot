The time is coming when the bear market would finally be over which would be followed by another bull run. Anything can happen this time, the price of bitcoin may decrease further, or maybe not, but we should prepare if it decreases. If any further significant decrease occur, this would significantly result to a bull run that may increase the price of bitcoin to over $30000 again.",

You wake up with the good news at any given day, prices go upIt is possible that bitcoin and the entire financial market will be pumped if this news happens, but there is no guarantee that bitcoin will stay high and the uptrend season will come immediately. You should remember that we are still in bear season and the bear cycle lasts 4 years, and another thing is that we entered a bear market before the war so the current drop in prices is only partially affected by the war, the main cause is still in the yearly bear cycle.

Market does not estimates present. It always tries to calcualate 1 year ahead. Its not that everything bad needs to stop and we have to have flow of good news to see a bottom. Bottom will be 1 year before first good news from economy. Same was in 2008. The biggest amount of bad news was right on the market bottom. So if now \"macroeconomic view looks like trash\" it doesnt mean we have to go anymore lower. Also bitcoin reached ATH 3 month before SP500. Its possible that bitcoin will reach the bottom 3 months before SP500 which will reach the bottom 1 year before first good news from economy. Also fiats are going down at a rate >10% per year so sooner or later fiat denominated assets needs to stop falling. Its not regular recession. Its stagflation. Like in 1970-1980.",

If bitcoin price decrease, it can not go down more $10000 and this has nothing to do with the Russia and Ukraine war. This is only an assumption, the probability that it will happen is significant, but it is not a solid fact that should be counted on. The majority believe in the next halving and the bull run that will follow after that simply because that is the only thing that has a very clear point in the future in the sense that the halving will happen, but you should always be careful because no one can predict the future.I also think that it is not realistic to expect that the price of BTC can go below $10k, but who thought that it would be this low today after it almost touched $70k? Being prepared for something completely unexpected is something that everyone should keep in mind, because that way there would be much less panic that often results in financial loss for most people who invest their money thinking that profit is assured.As for the war, I would say that it affects everything, especially the markets in Europe, which suffer the most. The uncertainty caused by the war certainly affects the decisions of people who are less willing to make any risky investments, and when we talk about the EU area, it is about 500 million people who are generally people with considerable purchasing power. First they were hit by inflation, and then a bloody war broke out in their neighboring yard, which in any case is very bad for any business, unless you produce weapons and similar war supplies.",

The only way I see the Russia-ukraine problem resolving itself fairly quickly is if at least one of those countries goes into civil war (it's more likely to be Russia due to the lack of democracy - but it's also likely Russia can remain stable with a bit of restructuring - or nothing).2. Interest rates probably need to go down for everything bitcoin related to improve for a fast return to higher prices. That's unlikely to happen, a drop to 4% is predicted by 2022 but that's long enough away that we'll see more stagnation internationally.",

But we are still in the bearish trend, unless the news of the war ending will happen right after the bitcoin halving then yeah. But it makes me think now, if we will have a massive bull in 2024, this could be one news that will help it pushes to what we all have been imaging the price, $100k++",

I'm not telling if it will have a big impact on the financial market when the war is over, but for sure, the market now is in recession.I guess there are smart investors who are putting their money on bitcoin and make it as a store of value.

If we would base from the calendar and the past, there should already be an uprise pressure with market price of cryptos because of the season, but what happened is the other way around. Cryptos are prone from factors such as what we are experiencing right now wherein economic crisis is a problem to many countries around the globe which reflects as well in this industry. Whether it will go up before this year end or not, it would be surely hard to tell. The best thing we can do is to patiently wait and cope with market behavior.",
