So it basically depends on the psychology of the environment on bitcoin. If you know it's going to attract attention towards you then avoidance is the best thing.

If you done want these to happen then you should place the artwork in a part of your house where only you and family members can see it. Don't go taking pictures of it and telling us on the internet page where you share it about your history of investing in Bitcoin.",

You are right about being a potential victim if you wre attracting too much attention but as the post above said that there's a way to not get scammed or fooled by people with bad intention like scamming you for example by selling you an art but nothing you will get and you only pay the scammer bitcoin for the so called art which is as I have said mentioned in above post and that is to avoid.",

The question I'm asking myself: by doing this, aren't I attracting too much attention and becoming a potential victim of theft?  (Although you can love Poletti's work without being rich in btc)I'm not conversant with any Bitcoin artist and I am hearing about Lucho Poletti for the first time ( I might read about him). I have seen some fine Bitcoin related artwork from some members of the forum and I love some of them. However, I will not like to keep anything that connects me to Bitcoin in my environment.  My concerns is the misconception in my country by most people that anybody who owns Bitcoin is rich. Living in a country with some security issues this could make one a target of these criminals.  It will be better to be security conscious because you don't know who is monitoring you.",

I might not be correct but if you are security conscious it will be better to keep your connections with Bitcoin secret and disclose it to just one or two trusted people. Secondly, you might not be able to control who comes into your room especiallyif you are not living alone. Sometimes children can easily bring their friends into any room at home and they could expose what you are keeping secret. Except you live in a relatively secures area or you accept Bitcoin in your business, it is better not to expose anything that will give people hints that your own Bitcoin..because the days are evil.",

And my question is, so far has there ever been a case of a Bitcoin painting owned by someone who has negative things that harm the owner of the painting. Because I once found a Bitcoin painting or Bitcoin graffiti on a fence wall and everything was fine and even used as a place to take pictures if the writing or picture was interesting.",

It could be displayed in a space that's not too exposed to the public or placed somewhere that can be moved or hidden when necessary.

Bitcoin is money, and by just displaying its logo through art, it doesn't mean you have a lot of coins in your wallet. I guess thieves are more interested in wealthy goods.

But since it's a Bitcoin art, most of them won't even pay attention to it...Just don't tell people how much you hold in BTC, and you must be fine.

Maybe because they do not even know what the logo represents. I do think that it will depend on the kind of environment you are in. Some people might not care as much maybe because just like you they already own some bitcoin. But I would not be so comfortable parading around the fact that I own some bitcoin around people who may not have bitcoins themselves. If you live in a place where it is secured and no one easily can get in then I think it is okay.I still want to be safe rather than sorry so I do not want to test my luck.",

I have seen a lot of clothes with Bitcoin logos, but I am probably too secretive to wear T-shirts or sweatshirts, showing my interest. But to be honest, I feel some betrayal of what I am interested in, but I am not ready to show it to the whole world, since this can cause many questions and unnecessary speculation. But while Bitcoin is not in the zone that can be calmly talked about and shown to many, let it remain only in some personal places.",

My country is not that focus on Bitcoin and consider it as high risk since it was attached to many multiple scam here that being televised.However, there’s country like US that think holding Bitcoin means you’re rich because of its popularity so it’s really a bad idea to put any attraction that will lead that you are a Bitcoin holder.",

The question I'm asking myself: by doing this, aren't I attracting too much attention and becoming a potential victim of theft?  (Although you can love Poletti's work without being rich in btc)I don't think installing paintings or sculptures depicting Bitcoin will make us a target for thieves. Because currently there are lots of people who openly own a lot of Bitcoin and even that person is a content creator on YouTube. But until now I have never heard of this person being robbed or stolen, in fact this person has become increasingly respected by many people, because he was able to become successful as a result of investing in bitcoin. So after seeing this, I think in this modern era, it probably won't be a problem if we have paintings or sculptures depicting bitcoin in our homes. Because according to my assumption, currently very few thieves are targeting people who own crypto assets such as bitcoin. Because they will definitely think that stealing bitcoins from someone is very difficult, different from stealing gold or money. Especially for thieves who don't really know about current technology, I'm sure they won't be interested in bitcoin. Because in my opinion, thieves prefer instant items to steal, such as money. So I don't think you need to worry if you want to install a Bitcoin painting or picture in your home.",
