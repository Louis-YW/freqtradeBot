It does mine at an average of 288 MH/s. So, just to be sure, I e-mailed Idan Abada from Bitcoin Merch and this is his reply:\"Hardware errors are normal. I see 289 GH/s, the advertised hash rate is 250. You are doing wonderful!\"When I said it's a 50% hardware error rate at that time, I got a reply back saying:\"Yes as long as your hash rate is normal, yours is very high so very good!\"So, my question is: is a 42% hardware rate accepted when mining at an average of 288MH/s? To me, it sounds like faulty hardware.",

I don't understand the answer from the owner of Bitcoin Merch then.For me, it is not ok if the miner reaches almost 50% of the hardware error but this issue can be solved and according to your hashrate for me, it looks fine.Sometimes this issue comes up on the first run and the miner needs to be warmed up first to get rid of this issue. So I suggest try to reboot the miner after warmup and now monitor the hardware error. If the issue is still there then downclock the miner.",

Once in, type \"sudo screen -list\" and you will be shownaÂ  few screen instances. Connect to the one that is histing CGMiner and you will get access to CGMiner. You do this by typing \"screen -r ###\" (### being the screen instance number).",
