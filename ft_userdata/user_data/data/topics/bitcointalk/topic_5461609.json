All they are doing is, placed one group around one corner to talk bad about BTC and another group in another corner to support BTC. And they are getting benefit from BTC as one group and filling there pockets equally. In simple, words they wanted to manipulate market and this is just in front of our eyes. Because first they made a group to go against crypto which makes BTC to bleed along with its investors.And now, just after making BTC bleed, they have started to promote it like it's there own initiation. This is just all game and many people have already understood that. So, such news might not create hype in the market which could make other people to take entry into BTC who still hadn't took one.",

This is getting interesting, let's see how Coinbase officially responds to thisMaybe bitcoin is considered by the SEC to have undoubted value so they recommend bitcoin trading. This shows that the SEC is on board with bitcoin and the value of bitcoin is so strong there is no doubt about it. Bitcoin is a commodity that has a high value, I think that is undeniable and the SEC justifies this with their statement, because they reject altcoin trading in favor of bitcoin",

They are created by criminals, people who are just trying to get people' money with fake pump and dump schemes.Those schemes are illegal in almost every country for a reason.I am not saying every altcoin is a pump & dump.

The SEC sued them for the trading activities of tokens declared as securities, and Gary then Declared that BTC is not a security, even back in time around 2018 or 2019. This indicates Gary's interest in and devotion to BTC. But still, he has pressure on his head, so he might change the statements, but such acts as these are expressing his love for BTC.I doubt he would have bought some. Other than Gary, This is good news for the whole crypto market, but I am not seeing any impact from it. As all eyes are on ETFs right now. Even those who are speculating on ETFs don't know the result date.I mean, if they knew about dates, they might not remain that optimistic about ETFs. One thing still confuses me: Coinbase and Binance were both sued for illegal trading of securities that were not registered with the SEC, so the SEC sued them. But why did the SEC allow Coinbase to stay while kicking Binance out of the league? I mean, does Binance not deserve such a chance, or am I the one missing some pieces to this puzzle?",

However, bear in mind that the landscape of regulation is still in its infancy and is subject to rapid change. What if Bitcoin's success is owed less to its quality than to the fact that it was the first digital currency?Lets be honest, numerous alternative cryptocurrencies give superior features to Bitcoin. Smart contracts on Ethereum and oracles on Chainlink are just two examples of how blockchain technology is changing industries outside finance.It may be wishful thinking to assume that Bitcoin's substantial price increase will be the result of its legal difference. What if this categorization results in more stringent standards for Bitcoin while the alternative cryptocurrencies thrive under less stringent rules?",

Since the SBF case we've witnessed the SEC being attack from both sides of the political scene. Crypto critics were criticizing Gensler for meeting with SBF and not smelling anything fishy, while supporters were asking why it is that after so many years we still rely on laws that were never designed with cryptocurrencies in mind. On one hand the SEC rules are vague, on the other it didn't even enforce them on those who really needed to be put in their place, like SBF. That's why the SEC is so eager to show that something is being done and that something is an attack on altcoins that passed the Howey test. In Coinbase's defense, they asked the SEC to clarify and they asked Gensler to meet with them, so they are now being punished for lack of regulatory guidelines.",
