  "content": "The question of whether Bitcoin was created by the NSA has popped up several times. Some believe that Satoshi was an NSA agent.We know that the secret documents Edward Snowden made public made interesting revelations. Among them are the backdoors the NSA inserted in Pseudorandom Number Generators. PRNGs can be intentionally weakened to allow backdoor access, enabling an entity with knowledge of the backdoors to predict the outputs of weak generators. Any system relying on such PRNGs would thus be insecure.The NSA has looked for ways to decrypt encrypted data to gain access to it. They managed to do that by compromising the Dual EC DRBG algorithm, which was thought to be secure. In a different example, the NSA reportedly paid $10 million to the encryption company RSA to use a weak encryption algorithm, which the NSA had a backdoor to. It was for a protocol that was certified in the US by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).We know from other sources that the NSA and the UK's GCHQ have the tools to decrypt emails, online banking accounts, etc. A US program paid tech companies millions to favor their weak RNGs and insert intentional weaknesses that the government can exploit. The agencies also cooperate with ISPs and telecommunication companies.The NSA has also exploited internet cable taps and tried to find ways to decrypt data from Google, Hotmail, Yahoo, Facebook, etc. Security agencies have ways to break the encryption of fiber-optic internet cables.When Satoshi created Bitcoin, they could have used a certified method to achieve randomness. One of those that turned out later to be backdoored and weak. Instead, they used an uncertified method in ECDSA and secp256k1 for key generation.One might wonder if this was just a coincidence or a choice made by someone who knew about the backdoors in certified RNGs. Did Satoshi have insider knowledge about potentially vulnerable algorithms, or did they make their own conclusions that certified encryption wasn't safe based on their programming and cryptographic knowledge?Insecurities in certain certified systems were already found as early as 2007/2008. It could well be that Satoshi knew about this and had nothing to do with the NSA.I don't think Bitcoin was created by the NSA or a similar agency. I also don't think Satoshi was an NSA operative in any form. I believe he thoroughly studied encryption algorithms and cryptography before choosing what key generation method to adopt for Bitcoin.But it’s an interesting idea. What do you think? Was Satoshi in the NSA or just a knowledgeable programmer who appeared at the right time?Sources and further reading:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1alb982/saw_this_video_was_wondering_what_you_guys_think/https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.htmlhttps://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-tohttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security",

      "body": "Satoshi might not have been in NSA, but I'm sure satoshi was one that had many connections and must have known this, satoshi had meetings with many persons before the creation of bitcoin like Adam strange, so he must have also had some idea about those backdoor and weak algorithms, what I think is that the person of satoshi might not have been that of just a technical person but also someone influential in a way and if satoshi really had some insider knowledge about nasa's algorithm then he must have been a person of some kind of status.Why I really think this might be true, satoshi really knew how to keep himself anonymous and could arrange some meetings and this persons did not ever reveal his person at anytime, there should be a certain level of control or power in his hands, so satoshi must have not been the average person but a person of status in a way, if I'm right then he surely must have had some insider knowledge, or he was way ahead of NSA in knowledge as to beat them without even having any information but why I'll doubt is that, for the amount of accuracy put in building the blockchain either a lot of thinkers and specialist involved or this guy must have been a person of some status, high status I mean.",

The code for bitcoin was perhaps never meant to be public knowledge, but was leaked anonymously by someone in the NSA working on the project with the title you mentioned. That could very well explain why Satoshi wishes to remain forever anonymous for obvious reasons. I don't think the US government takes kindly to its workers releasing top secret information and he would be brought up on serious charges if discovered.",

Quote from: LeezHamilton on February 27, 2024, 10:59:46 PMRe: Do you think Satoshi worked for the NSA?To get a proper answer to your question, wy don't you ask Satoshi Nakamoto if whether he worked for NSA or not ?or You can ask the NSA if they have employed Satoshi Nakamoto to work on the Bitcoin Project ? Is satoshi even his real name? There is a huge possibility that satoshi nakamoto is nothing but a pseudonym and if asked around, no one will be able to actually tell you who he is or what he looks like. I think he’s just someone rlly smart and had access to a lot of equally smart people hence the birth of bitcoin.",

Then, why do you hate that very man who is the inventor of Bitcoin and founder of this very forum ? moses(leez) and do some research, CSW is not the inventor.. CSW is a scammer, conman, fraudster and no one should like CSW, even you should dislike himthe actual satoshi disappeared in 2010(here)-2011(completely) and never returned. so there is no emotion about someone that has no bearing on bitcoin todayi respect what the actual bitcoin inventor done for bitcoin. but you keep thinking a active scammer today is satoshi.. you have no clue and should research or move on",

Yet, secp256k1 is in more public scrutiny than ever, and still no weaknesses have been found. I don't feel as if it is backdoored. That being said, I don't see how that would convince someone Satoshi knew it beforehand. Sounds like a wild conspiracy to believe he worked for the NSA apart from simply... selecting cryptographic algorithms that weren't proved to be backdoored. There are other people who've selected such algorithms (beyond secp256k1) that are still not evidently backdoored, but we don't blame them for working with the NSA.  Quote from: Pmalek on February 28, 2024, 04:17:04 PMYou can't know that for a fact unless you know Satoshi which I don't think you do.Sure, you can't prove a negative, but the default position for an anonymous user is to be one. If I don't know anything beyond the pseudonym \"Pmalek\", my default stance is that you're one person. That's what you've shown, and what I naturally interpret. There is no strong enough evidence he was more than one person (only one supports they were both Nick Szabo and Len Sassaman?).",
