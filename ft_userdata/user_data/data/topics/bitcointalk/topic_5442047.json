I recently invested in a ColdCard mk4 to keep my funds safe (using it fully airgapped). It really made me understand how Bitcoin works, I learnt that cryptography is literally what holds Bitcoin together, which I find awesome.I've built up a pretty nice amount of Bitcoin over time and I have never spent any of it (except when purchasing my coldcard). I know for a fact that one day Bitcoin will be worth so much more, cryptography is the future. I'll HODL until the day I die.It's pretty nice too because customers who know about and pay with Bitcoin at my store tend to come back when they need to purchase something and pay with Bitcoin.So yeah, this was my little update, thanks for listening to my ramble , I'm out.",

I have a shop accepting Bitcoin myself and the only I manage to not convert Bitcoin payment into Fiat is because I use my job salary to cover it so that we will save transaction fee. This kind of update seems too good to be true and everything seems a very fancy story.I’m having trouble myself on getting client that pays Bitcoin despite my customer is purchasing via online. I wonder what kind of hardware he has which attracts buyer to purchased using Bitcoin since most of the customer of hardware is non-techy person since they are involved on hard labor.",

Fantasies are not punished here. In addition, I think he has a couple of accounts that also wake up from time to time and create beautiful stories, as a result of which he receives a good amount of merit. Look who the OP gave a lot of merit to.But even this does not mean anything, since the OP is difficult to call a malicious spammer, on the contrary, he can be called a successful liar that periodically makes people believe him. Until he gave a single piece of evidence of his possession of the store, he is a liar. But he did nothing bad to anyone.The question is different: how many people here are ready to believe him?",

I mean anybody who is good in thinking and structuring of lie could simply cook up a story like this and share it to the community in other to achieve so many goals which I believe such terms is classified as spamming in the forum.

It's like not having this money at all because money is a means of exchange, something you give to someone in exchange for something meaningful for you (goods or services). If you don't want to sell Bitcoin for fiat, it's okay. If you want to hodl for a while, it's fine. But hodling till the rest of your life is meaningless, unless you want someone specific to inherit the funds (they were never meant for your own benefit) and have made arrangements in place.As for the update on accepting Bitcoin since September 2021, I'd like to hear more! Have you analysed the percentage of customers that pay in Bitcoin or the average number of Bitcoin payments you get per month/quarter? Is your revenue in BTC a sizeable amount, comparable to your revenue in fiat? It would be great to hear how accepting Bitcoin in a physical store works out for you in practice and how many people use this option. I'm sure I'm not the only one here who'd be interested to hear about it.",
