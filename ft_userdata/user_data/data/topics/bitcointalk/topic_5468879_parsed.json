If you want to become a DT1 member, theymos must add you to it.Not necessary DT1 must include you to become DT2, numbers of DT2 can include you to become a DT2 also.I have always thought that a member on this forum that is not a DT member before can only become DT2 if someone in DT1 add the person to the his or her trust lists until I saw this Huppercase posts not quite long. Is Huppercase correct?",

Those who added by someone himself in his own trust list are T0 (where DefaultTrust (DT0) is added by default). Those who are added by those ones who in T0 are T1, who are in the lists of T1 are T2, etc. Depth up to 4 (2 by default). So to be at DT2 the one needs to be in a Trust list of someone from DT1.",
