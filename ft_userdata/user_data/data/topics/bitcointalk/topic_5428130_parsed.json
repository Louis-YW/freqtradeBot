It is already considered rare to see your favorite NBA players compete with some of the best. But in this case, you get to see all of the allstars combined playing in one night. Again, this is an opportunity of a lifetime where I would definitely purchase a ticket to watch it. I just hope that they do not further increase the price and they release it with available stocks.In reality, however, I would be able to purchase the cheapest ticket as $400 for the next ticket is way too high for my budget as a student.",

So team USA vs Philippines is not sure yet but it is not impossible to happen if and only if PH team will dominate the game and got a chance to world's bests including USA.About the ticket fees, well, expects it will be higher since this is a world cup than those typical PBA match, but not so expensive. Or the association will probably face a slap from the public.",

They have tried it before when NBA stars visited the country but their management didn't allow a serious game; it was more of an exhibition and also, if both teams would get serious, for sure PH would be at the disadvantage for height and skills ofcourse, everyone knows that so there's no need for a betting game on this one.",

But then, FIBA won't be happy if the gate collection gets reduced. The world cup happens only once every 4 years or so, and they want to maximize the revenue. Also, this time the world cup is being co-hosted by 3 different countries - in addition to Philippines, there are matches scheduled in Japan (Okinawa City) and Indonesia as well. So you can't have lower prices for ticket in one country and a different pricing for another.",

Not because the Philippines selected Team USA as their preferred team to play the group phase here in the country, but it doesn't mean Gilas will face Team USA.Team Philippines (Gilas) is not in the same group as Team USA.Is there a dedicated thread to the FIBA World Cup of 2023? I couldn't find one and I believe that this thread can be converted to the tournament thread. If it is not possible to do that, then the best thing to do will be to close this thread once the current discussion is over. But then there is still 9 months to go for the tournament. It maybe a bit too premature to start a dedicated thread for the 2023 World Cup, unless we have anything solid to debate upon. Fortunately the qualifying process is complete and we know in detail about the participants.",

The one you see on live stream or TV is way different when you are on a Live Game as a Live Audience. Been in Smart Araneta several times already and the usual tier we always choose is lower tiers (Upper box Section). I will disagree that the view on that tier is like watching dots. It's very clear and has a good view.Anyways, did FIBA already mentioned the possible venues for the games that will be held here in PH?",
