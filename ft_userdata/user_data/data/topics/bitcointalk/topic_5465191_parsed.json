Even if a trader is not disciplined enough, he may be controlled by emotion. But sometimes, it is good. Example is when the market is overbought or oversold so much to a greater extent, a good trader may see it as a good opportunity to open a position. Trading is more than that though.",

      "body": "Yes, but only when I was new to crypto sphere. Now, I can control my emotions and have found ways to control the urge to follow FOMO sentiment. Knowledge is power which could help one to control the urge of getting into FOMO. So, my advice to all is, try to get more knowledge about something they wanted to start investment in. Because once you will gain the knowledge then you will know what results you could get in all possible scenarios. I have a friend in my circle, who was asking to invest in BTC, when the price was at $25500. I said him to take entry so that he would at least be safe from FOMO but he did not listen to me and today he told me he should have taken the entry at $25,500 (around this price). He learnt the lesson hard way but still he did not lose much as BTC is only $2000 up which in my sight is not that much.Point is, to avoid FOMO we have to buy at least some of the Satoshies with some of our money. Like we should not do Lump Sum instead use only 10% to 20% of your investment so that you could avoid FOMO.",

So far I have been lucky because the times I have sold have been at high points in the market, something that has happened to me in the stock market above all and also in bitcoin. Quote from: MarathonA on August 31, 2023, 01:49:39 PMHow do you permanently change and naturally be patient? Sometimes you learn the hard way, when you lose a lot, but some people don't even learn that way. I would recommend that you don't trade, take the long term. And stay away from casinos too, they can be disastrous for people who have problems controlling their impulsivity.",

Don’t check price frequently and only follow tokens that you add on your watch list so that you will not be FOMO if some bullish news appear on other coin that you don’t have any idea which is the main cause of FOMO or what called APE (buy in impulse and do research later).Just trade tokens that you are following so that you will be comfortable to buy and sell since you knew in details what’s happening on the inside.",

How do you permanently change and naturally be patient? Thanks all. There is no permanent cure for this feeling of FOMO. Most of the newbies fall for this sentiment and lose their assets. But pro traders also fall for this sentiment because sometimes, other than BTC or some good coins, there are projects that look attractive but are not. Those good promises and posters sometimes attract all types of people, whether they are newbies or not.But there is a cure for it, which is different in different types of scenarios. For example, if you wanted to invest in Bitcoin but also wanted to buy it at its lowest point, But you wait for a time to get the market to that lowest point, and in that journey, BTC moved up, and you started to think the market would never come back, so you jumped into the market while that FOMO hit you to take action at the current price while the possibility of the market coming down was also there.The above scenario also works for those who wanted to sell BTC at a certain price, but because of FOMO, sometimes they sold lower and then the price of BTC went higher.",

It has almost happened to everyone may be while we are still newbies and then invested in bitcoin with the expectation that the market will surge within the shortest period but instead continue to go dip and maintain being on bear mode for so long, there are also times that we got negative impression from what we hear from the news about cryptocurrency. Quote from: MarathonA on August 31, 2023, 01:49:39 PMHow do you permanently change and naturally be patient? Maybe sometimes we got consolidated from friends or when the market pumps back to give us more hope that the market will keep rising, it's just that in most cases, we do forget that we are dealing with a volatile cryptocurrency, bitcoin can rise and fall at anytime, you can not have an assurance of this if you had invested on altcoins you're not sure about.",

It's a time taking process and obviously you'll lose a lot of money in the process as well but almost everyone went through this process before becoming a good trader. Better is to go with low amount trading, so that you lose lesser amounts while you are learning this skill.",

All traders and holders must carefully and consciously be able to plan their next move whenever there is a new development. If you find out and observe from yourself that you sometimes get impulsive, you have to fight to gain control of this habit consciously so it does not lead you to making wrong choices in your trading. You may not be able to permanently change the habit of impulsiveness in all aspects of your life, but you can control it and eliminate it from affecting your trading. Also when you realize that you are prone to impulsive decisions, learn not to take decisions in a hurry.",

Experience would be the cure from real engagement on which this is something that you would inevitably be able to experience or gain on the time that you do engage on things.There's no one would really be able totaught you about that but only yourself. It is really just that normal for a noob to have that kind of experience and everyone do able to experience that on the time that we are just starting or on the time that we are dealing with things that we havent experienced before. Emotion is the main enemy that you would really be able to encounter but just been said that on the time that you would really be able to have thatexperience then you would gradually be molding up yourself to be better since you've been wary on how things works and how things do behaves.It would really be that impossible that you wont really be able to make out adjustments since you have already witnessed it on the past.FOMO and FUD is something that very common which not only focusing on positive hype or movement in the market but also into other side of things on which it would really becommonly be affecting your emotion which would lead into alteration of decisions.",

A lot of FOMO in my trades because I don't want miss an opportunity in trading that's why I immediately buy long even though the price was already high and sell short even though the price was already low. The main reason why I keep doing these before is because I don't have a trading plan. Don't rely on learnings from YouTube because you will having a hard to time to create an edge in trading.

How do you permanently change and naturally be patient? Thanks all. FOMO is one thing that causes some people to make mistakes while investing in crypto or trading. The remedy is that you should learn to exercise self-control and also do good research about the coin you want to trade. As a trader, you will need to learn how to analyse the market with some tech tools that can give you a predictable movement in the market, although they might not be very accurate but can help. While trading, you must not let your emotions guide you, but make sure you process your decisions very well before putting them into action.",

How do you permanently change and naturally be patient? Thanks all. Most of the people who started in trading most likely also experienced that kind of thing, for me it wasn't really permanently changed or cured when you feel FOMO. Cause you will always feel that when people around you are hyping on other coins which you really don't have any idea and knowledge about it. You will just control and resist the feeling  which in the long run you'll get used to it like it's part of your life in trading cause FOMO is always around in the crypto industry. You can't just take any hyped coins just focus on one where you have accumulate knowledge so when you do trade you'll feel much safer than a hyped one. It's like the heart vs the brain because your heart will say that people are gaining on that one coin but you will use your brain to handle the situation.",

Haha as a crypto Doctor OP, I want to recommend you to use more fresh water which will keep your Blood more rich with the hydro neutriants. Do daily 2 miles of walking daily in the early morning to have greater control over your Emotions (Kiding). Haha buddy there is nothing extraordinary needed to control your emotions you need to try to learn to be consistent with the market.In order to increase your performance with the emotions in the market you need to follow two golden rules, one is never rush with Twitter and other crypto news because this is where most of the traders lose their patience, first of all, verify news even most of the time Cointelegraph and coindesk news are just piece of shit so how can you trust the celebrity you are following.The second rule just follows the market principle to perform better, \"Be fearful when everyone is greedy and be greedy when everyone is fearful.\"",

But what I did is that I'll take trading seriously I need to be more cautious with my actions and the market response, it gradually changes until such time that I totally control my emotions. However, this would not give us assurance that we never fall into wrong decisions and make loss of money because whether we like it or not, this thing is going to happen to us.

There is no perfect trader, some might actually done the fomo act, even me when I am too excited about something I tend to fomo a lot and resulting to burn up instead. Thats how the market usually it pointed out on the opposite direction you expect and if you dont got patient youll definitely burn out and lose your position and sell into loss instead.",
