  "content": "What is UselessShit.co?UselessShit.co is a fun project which purpose is to help spread spread the bitcoin adoption. One of the ways, in which I'm trying to achieve this, is by allowing people to easily create unique, physical paper items (like bitcoin cards, bookmarks & stickers), which can be printed and handed out to friends, foes or complete strangers. These items can also serve as gift cards, as they can be loaded with precious sats easily.See for yourself how easy is to create your own graphics (no other tools required):https://uselessshit.co/card-generatorFeaturesdedicated panel for creating personalized cards, bookmarks & stickers;lightning gifts;simple & embeddable fiat2sats calculator;price receipts for your bitcoin purchases;list of bitcoin resources;Some bookmarks, business cards & stickers created with the card generator:https://i.ibb.co/JF1J1Xp/lightning-gift-card.jpghttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fd5iiVVWAAIjJZu?format=jpg&name=largehttps://i.ibb.co/BygMLNh/bitcoin-artwork-creator-1.pnghttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdgushIXEAM5R24?format=jpg&name=mediumhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdgusgrWYAARtsG?format=jpg&name=mediumWould love to hear your feedback Have a great day ahead!",

But i always wonder how effective is this? Anyway, the domain name is straight forward. Some people find it offensive, so every now and then I try to work on the overall tone, to make it more positive   I also purchased another domain (at https://thisbitcointhing.com) where I'll try a bit different approach  Quote from: ETFbitcoin on September 03, 2022, 12:10:29 PMAlthough you missed your chance to use controversial TLD such as .sucks.You're right   But maybe it's not to late to get domain like that.Quote from: Pmalek on September 03, 2022, 07:39:51 AMI love the name you picked, couldn't have done it better myself.  But like any other website, I hate seeing black fonts on a white background.

Simple, homegrown sites without anything crazy.My only criticism as a web developer for 15+ years, would be the following (and I mean this with the best intentions, btw - because I can tell how much effort you put into the site)1. I would sway away from rotating slideshow on the homepage. Honestly, I think if you used the following image as a standard image (https://uselessshit.co/images/card-2.jpeg) it would be much less anxiety inducing on the user. Finding a way to place the other images (if you want them) on the page, might be advisable. Remember, you're bringing new users to Bitcoin (and these foreign concepts) to the site, having a slideshow showing technical jargon right away probably isn't the best way to keep your user calmly scrolling down the page)2. I would reduce the amount of verbiage to get to the basics. TBH and in full transparency (and quite embarrassingly) I had no clue what stacking sats was, and linking to another site (under the \"were you handed a card\") is probably just bad flow. I actually ended up googling it to find out what it was, vs reading the site - which is probably a bad sign. I would perhaps take the most important points you're trying to make, make them concise, and include them plainly in the first 1-2 minute read of your site. You'll get more traction this way. Otherwise, great job! Clean design & code looks good!",

You are right - I sometimes forget that things that seem obvious to me, are completely foreign concepts to others (and vice versa). I'm already working on a new flow - also a friend who's a nocoiner (but finds bitcoin interesting) offered some help in reevaluating the content",

I believe onboarding as many people as possible now, before the system collapses is of a great importance. Bitcoin is a digital superpower & without it, we're screwed.",
