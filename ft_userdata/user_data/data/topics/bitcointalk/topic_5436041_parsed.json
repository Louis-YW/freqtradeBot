They could be using it as a shield to conceal their criminal activity, but bitcoin has nothing to do with it and does not encourage it in any way. This is one of the reasons it has yet to be accepted as legal tender throughout the world. I hope the bitcoin jinx is broken soon and bitcoin becomes widely accepted.",

But ensure you guide your curiosity with discretion and willingness to learn. The information in this forum is boundless because you can learn about almost everything about Bitcoin in this forum. It is possible to make genuine income from Bitcoin dealings but it is better not to see the sector as a full time job. This is because the sector is ever dynamic and unpredictable. Get a job and see this sector as a side hustle.It is also important to state that this forum promotes integrity but cannot guarantee that every member upholds that priceless virtue. That is why you must verify and confirm every information your get from the forum before application. My advice to newbies is that they read more, asked questions and write less for now until they have learned enough.",

I have read this so many times and still cannot really wrap my head around what you mean by with bitcoins people are able to make a genuine living. It sounds like something that can be misinterpreted by beginners to mean that bitcoin is a get-rich quick scheme and that depending on bitcoin alone without having any other plans is okay. It is not so. If you've gone through so many discussions on this forum you find out that the general advice is also that you should not completely depend on bitcoins and investments in cryptocurrency for your livelihood. So how do people make a living from bitcoin? are they really HODLing?To correct you OP, I will say that bitcoin has offered hope for people in Africa to get out of poverty through purposeful and smart investments in it, not just an avenue to make a living like you suggest.",
