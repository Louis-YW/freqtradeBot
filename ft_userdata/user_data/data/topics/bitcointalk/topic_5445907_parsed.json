  "content": "Scammers can exploit people's emotions to their advantage if they can manipulate their emotions.I remember watching the Squid games series on Netflix and not a single soul that I recommend the series for hated it, I mean we all like the Squid games, people were so into the twisted plots and we never got tired of talking about it.Later these scammers come up with Squid Game token, this is an unauthorized altcoin that's based on the Netflix series. Â  People got too emotional about this release, in a matter of weeks, this Squid Game token went through the roof, the token was almost 3000$ per token.The funny part is, CNBC, Business Insider, and even Forbes covered this scam token, I believe it got that much attention through these big news outlets.Later people who invested in this fake Squid Game token started complaining that they aren't able to sell on the open market, I believe this was the creator's plan all along, some people who smell danger right from the beginning where able to sell, but the majority couldn't sell any token.People wished for this project to work out, because they like the series, someone living nearby introduced this project to me but with the past experience I've gotten through crypto rumbles, I knew it is not a safe investment, I couldn't confused him because he believed, he learnt his lessons few weeks later when he could not sell. ðŸ‘‡*LEARN FROM THIS*ðŸ‘‡â€¢Even if a big Business news channel are talking about a project, it doesn't make it a scam-free project.â€¢Scammers always like to use whatever is currently making waves in the crypto space to take advantage of the people.â€¢Right now, there is nothing else that's captured the public imagination like cryptocurrencies, the number of scammers in this crypto space is very big.â€¢Scams attracts people faster than something legit because something legit takes time, only fraud and scams rushed in attracts people fast.The problem doesn't end with Phishing, exchange hacks, or social engineering frauds only, learn to control your emotions when people are rushing after something, most of the time, it's probably a scam, it is not going to end well.",

      "body": "The squad game scam is one of the highest I have ever witnessed, and a few of my friends were victims of it. Just imagine a project that went up 13000% just a few days after it was launched, thanks to the hype it got from its movie series supporters. It was really a smart move done by those scammers, who ever they are; as of the last time I checked the scam record, it was recorded that they made away with about 3 million dollars or more; that's people's hard-earned money that just vanished into scammers' pockets.Â It really taught a lot of people a lesson, and it also made a lot of people lose faith in altcoins.Â But I believe the highest victims of this scam were the greedy people who, even after seeing the price pump, which on a normal day looks too good to be true, most of them kept on pumping in money with the hope of getting back 10 times their investment.Â Funny enough, I could have also been part of this said token victim because of the trend in almost every social media platform, including the top searches on both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.Â Â Back then, when I was newly into crypto and coinmarketcap cap was not owned by Binance, we barely heard of scam tokens like this gaining too much ground and trends without any solid news or something to trigger the price pump.Â My question is: Is it that there is no form of research done by this coin tracker before they list any project under their umbrella?",

      "body": "Ignorance, greed, want to do what people do, no proper research of our own. That's what makes most people fall victim of this scam. Even people who don't watch the movie because they saw someone who they know invested in the token they always want to invest. They saw it increase by 200% in the last few hours they want to buy now so that they will be part of the people who are to enjoy the next few hours pump. This are just how I believe this scammers where able to use people's ignorance and greed at their own advantage. I wish Newbies and the greedy traders will ever learn from this past experience, because the more people fall victim of this scams the more the scammers will have hope of pulling another one in the next coming days, months or even year with the believe that their efforts is never gonna be a waste.",

      "body": "Absolutely correct! Feeling is the central concept here. Emotionally charged situations can cloud rational thought. Many different thingsâ€”movies, music, dogs, partnerships, and so onâ€”have the potential to stir up strong feelings in a person and thus influence their thoughts and actions. Con artists are aware of this, and they use it to their advantage. And we know it's not wise to make financial decisions based on how we feel, right? Because doing so risks making a poor choice. Scammers aren't the only ones looking to cash in on Squid Game's popularity; legitimate businesses selling merchandising and fans looking to boost the profiles of their favorite stars by editing Squid Game footage are also cashing in. Everyone wanted in on the action. Because of the Squid Game's popularity and the sheer volume of people who are negatively impacted, I think the conventional media also gets exploited by this endeavor. As a result, more people fell for the scheme after it was widely reported in the media, creating a self-perpetuating circle of evil. In general, I concur with what youâ€™ve said.",
