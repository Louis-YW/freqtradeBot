He is asking for help in public telegram group however he is disguising as newbie that suddenly mistaken to post his seed phrase on the chat as if he is asking a help to access on wallet funds. But the catch is you can’t move the balance out of it because of the frozen fund but not USDT in my case. When I check carefully the blockchain records for that specific address, I saw that all transactions that attempt to withdraw the balance fails while all Ethereum that sent to the wallet was automatically sent on a specific wallet.I encounter this few ago but I first saw this kind of scam trick was during 2018 when time that hacker purposely put private key instead of wallet address on bounty campaign spreadsheet.",

Why did you post this here?  Of course, I will not check anything, because zasad@ warned of the danger and in this case, I will have to pacify my curiosity.For me, in this story, the implementation remains unclear, although I am not technically strong. How and why does the scammer's program affect the ethereum network or wallet (Not sure if I phrased it correctly)? Why can't change the settings and priority of a transaction in a wallet?",

Why can't change the settings and priority of a transaction in a wallet?The scammer has a program set up that automatically detects when the address receives ETH and withdraws the ETH to another address out of your control. The thousands of dollars in tokens the scammer has in the wallet (which private keys they revealed) are just a bait to tempt anyone to send some USD in ETH to pay the gas, but since the scammer set up a program there is no chance anyone can do the transaction faster than the program.Also, as mentioned, it seems the tokens are locked by Tether, according to the block explorer.",

Some are so naive, believing that such an amount can be quickly received, and it is they who will receive it. Greed does not allow you to turn on the logic. And as @m2017 said, many hands itch to try. This is the most common passion. The scammers are betting on him.How many people win big sums in the casino? However, the flow of those who try their luck does not decrease.",

That's my financial guide besides never getting greedy. That which you shared here has been on for a long time now, especially on telegram. The first time I saw someone plastered their passphrase on a telegram group I knew that person wasn't that dumb doing that. It was a bait. I didn't even contemplate checking out the wallet transactions. I just continued reading other stuff. Those who fall for this type of setup have the tendency of scamming others.

Look at the address, there is no gas fee at the moment. Say scammer contact you and try to convince send him a small gas fee. But you weren't convinced since you know this type of scam happening. So scammer will try to convince give you a private key and check your balance. So when you log in with the private key you will see USDT there. Or sometimes scammer forwards private key through Telegram where have balance. When you will see a balance in your wallet then definitely you will try to help him or withdraw funds. For that, you need a gas fee. Once you will transfer the gas fee, the address automatically will transfer the funds to another scammer's wallet. This means scammers set up the software to move funds from that address once detected a new transaction. That's how scammer scam. Hope you understand now.",
