Still I would never touch anything of ftx.That competitor was down already, the likely scenario is that it was an inside jobas o_e_l_e_o suggested. It makes perfect sense, why hasn't FTX been hackedbefore this, I mean I'm sure there were attacks of the platform in the past.I have deleted the app as directed, luckily I have no funds on FTX  or any other exchange",

Be your own bank.I definitely won't believe this story, they've definitely gone bankrupt and can't liquidate their users, this is the perfect escape plan.This is not the first time an exchange has crashed, we have had Mt.gox crashes before and the drop is said to be as severe as FTX but eventually people will quickly forget it and will still use centralized exchanges as their utility is essential. The way a centralized exchange and a bank work is quite similar, but it's pretty lame when you compare how secure a bank is to a small exchange like FTX. Banks are backed by the government and banks bankrupt only when the government collapses but better be your own bank.",

Fortunately, in terms of price it's hitting us at a time where investment would've been low anyhow.Unfortunately, a ton of people have yet again lost money. I just wish we could change the status quo, and eradicate exchanges which have wallets completely. There shouldn't be the option of storing money on an exchange, since that introduces bad practices, and even encourages them. That way, things like this wouldn't happen, and consumer confidence wouldn't be damaged, and ultimately people wouldn't lose their Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Both FTX and FTX.us were hacked. My understanding is that these are two entirely separate companies. FTX.us was continuing to server its users, was not involved in the Binance deal, had not had liquidity problems, and so on. They were an entirely separate company with separate wallets, separate databases, a separate back end, etc.And so what is the likelihood of a random attacker breaking in to two entirely separate exchanges at the exact same time? Almost zero. And what is the likelihood of an attacker simultaneously gaining access to the accounts needed to push malicious app updates as well as the accounts needed to put malware on their website as well as both exchanges' wallets and private keys? Even closer to zero. This is almost certainly an inside job, the way I see it. And with that, any shred of hope that FTX users had of recovering even a portion of their assets is gone.Quote from: mk4 on November 12, 2022, 05:40:09 AMJust a heads up: a lot of people might probably say that this is unlikely a \"hack\" and that some FTX personnel(regardless if it's SBF or not) is just running away with the funds(and I agree that this is highly more likely), but regardless — don't open the FTX website and uninstall all FTX apps. JUST TO BE EXTRA SURE.I don't know how FTX works (and I suppose it depends on the specifics of your bank/jurisdiction), but it is possible that FTX has permission to pull funds from users' linked bank accounts or cards to execute buy orders. Users need to make sure they revoke all access, if they haven't already when they went bankrupt. I'd also be concerned about the security of my other private keys and sensitive data which is present on any device which has since accessed/used/downloaded FTX software.Quote from: daweller1 on November 12, 2022, 06:14:26 AMdon't trust exchanges with more than  a few hundred bucksDon't trust exchanges. FTFY.Quote from: harapan on November 12, 2022, 09:37:35 AMIf they are thinking they be safe with Binance then they are messing about.Exactly this. FTX was the 2nd(?) biggest exchange. If they can simultaneously go bankrupt and also scam all their users, then any other exchange (Binance included) can do that too. Any coin not in your own wallet is not yours.Quote from: Wind_FURY on November 12, 2022, 10:55:09 AMIt's currently harder to trust which exchanges are safe for us plebs.Here's a simple way to find out: Is the exchange centralized/custodial?

Quote from: DaveF on February 23, 2020, 02:32:09 PMYes but as I posted someplace else, it's somewhat a false security.Do you check the hash of the file you downloaded against what is posted?Do you have automatic updates turned off on your phone and not update till people have verified the posted code is the same as what is in the app store / play store?And as I posted in another thread unless there has been a 3rd party audit of how they push the update to the store this is all just security theater.Think about it, if there are poor controls to upload the compiled file to the store then it's all pointless.DaveF gets a job with bigwallet as their IT hardware person. It's open source, it's audited, it's amazing beautiful code.Friday @ 4:30PM as everyone is leaving for the weekend I post a corrupt fund stealing compiled app to the app / play store and walk out of the building, head to the airport and fly to some island with no extradition. Saturday AM they have the bad wallet pulled but by then I have 1000s (10000s?) of BTC that were sent to me before anyone knew what happened. And I'm on a beach sipping drinks out of a coconut.On the other hand the shitty closed source wallet needs 2 people with security dongles to log into the PC that updates the code that is in the app / play store.You might not know what the code is, and it may be crap with bugs, but they at least know that what they wrote is what is up there.However, since as far as I know NONE of them publish / publicly audit how they push updates to the stores it's all just trust.You may feel differently. You may disagree. That is fine, but IMO it really needs to be discussed.-DaveThis is an edge case with the exchange imploding and everything else happening. So it could be the owners doing it, or it could be a low lever programmer that had access he or she should not have had and found a way to run with the funds.It will probably take years to know the truth and even then we will never truly 100% know. With enough money involved, it's not that hard. Remember it does not matter if the evidence exists or not, I can find it...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7o1tg1r_DM-Dave",
