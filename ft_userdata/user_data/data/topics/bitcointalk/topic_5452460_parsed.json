Internet is working on fixed line connection that is reaching homes. So there is still some connectivity available.If government shut down internet service even on fixed line connection then there will be complete internet blackout in the country and in that situation we cant use bitcoin.I think this is also one of limitation of bitcoin that we need internet to use it.",

Shutting down the entire internet system will cut off a country from the modern world.  At present, no work can be done without internet. I hope that the entire internet service has not been stopped in your country, only the internet services operated by the government have been stopped. You can use other Internet services if the government-run Internet services are stopped.",

You will always need some form of internet to get a tx in or out.There are ways / sites that you can broadcast a transaction that you created without needing a node. You just really need an understanding of what you are doing. It's not a simple click -> send. But, if you do not have internet, you don't have banking either so it all comes back to that.-Dave",

Internet is working on fixed line connection that is reaching homes. So there is still some connectivity available.If the cellular data is disabled then that might be suspended intentionally. However, in such cases it is always preferable to use secondary connection in the form of Broadband, or Fibre optics as they most likely won't be affected in such situations. It's always a better choice to have access to internet via multiple routes just relying on cellular data is not a reliable thing.QuoteIf government shut down internet service even on fixed line connection then there will be complete internet blackout in the country and in that situation we cant use bitcoin.The government won't shut down the whole internet as that will take the country backward, however if anything like that happens then only those people will be able to use the internet who will have their own private connections via satellite. One such service is Starlink as they offer satellite services across globe.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 12, 2023, 09:49:27 AMWow man! The information is really amazing! But it's very technical for someone to get access to such internet connection. I also think that such connections might be illegal and could cause problems for the user. If a government is completely blocking internet and still the user is trying to access it with the help of such connections might be the reason of legal action against the user.",

Well, if there's a total internet blackout, I think you'll have bigger things to worry about than not being able to access your Bitcoin. Basically, every form of internet communication will be disabled, including email, web, online banking, social media, and even communication apps like WhatsApp and many other services. In such a scenario, people would likely turn to alternative means of communication and transactions, such as using cash (in many countries, card payments on POS systems and ATMs may also be affected). Plus, a widespread internet blackout can have far-reaching consequences beyond personal finances and communication. It can potentially disrupt essential services such as emergency response systems, transportation, and logistics, making it difficult for people to access medical care, food, and other essentials. We rely so much on the internet for everything these days, so it's a pretty scary scenario to think about in the modern world.",

Restricting Internet usage like this is such a serious measure, and not one commonly used to deal with protests (if that's the cause). I mean, I'd understand if there was a major disruption that naturally led to serious Internet connection issues (we had such things in Ukraine because of the war and blackouts related to the war), but that's something imposed, done on purpose...I suppose under such conditions, Bitcoin being a digital currency is an issue (although there are workarounds, as o_e_l_e_o mentioned). But aren't there also bigger issues that come from such harsh Internet restrictions that make Bitcoin only a minor thing in comparison?",

And you could have some sort authorized organization, more like Central Bank, printing out different denominations of bitcoins on papers or any reliable material for buying things without the internet. The paper or material will have Bitcoin private keys sealed on it. Once the seal is scratched off the paper will nolonger be in circulation. To check for counterfeits or fakes just sms some code from the papers to the printing organization.The fluctuations of Bitcoin price shouldn't affect this too much. If you buy 0.0003 paper sats to buy some food stuff for example and the price of Bitcoin goes up, you will be be given change in Bitcoin or fiat by the food stuff seller.People are free to try this in their countries.",

I did not mean to discredit Bitcoin, but if basic things like information access are limited and prevented, it has more urgency to be addressed and in regard to shifting the blame to bitcoin, it is rather not on point.Others have given solutions about 'off-grid' solution to send bitcoin transactions, but in essence, it is not a bitcoin limitation since it is just how it works.",
