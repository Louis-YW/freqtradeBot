Well, OP when such question is asked again I hope you will know something better to say than the above. bitcoin is not just a crypto currency it's a paradigm and the root to other cryptocurrencies that exist out there. so having to invest in bitcoin gives one the edge of confidence that their money is safe even though safety depends on your capacity to safe guard your wallet. You should say something simple like bitcoin is far better than other cryptocurrencies because it's the king and can't disappear like other coins, other coins are shitty compared to bitcoin so you're friends can have a clue that bitcoin is a safe investment and a better currency.",

Bitcoin was created because the current traditional system is failing And history can back the success of Bitcoin. Most popular is that is a means of accumulating wealth to to mention it been an hedge over inflation. In summary It's trust, Bitcoin has given adopters reasons to trust it over others.

It is only natural that some people think alts are cheaper therefore buying them makes more sense because the upside potential is higher. Obviously they can't see the bigger picture clearly. Price means nothing in the end. User adoption, merchant adoption, trading volume, brand recognition, network size... These are way more important.",

Some altcoins after launching may drop in price and not recover back or the dev may rug the community, leaving investors in losses. Bitcoin on the other hand has been around for a some time, it's community owned, has a proven track record and no matter how deep it falls in price, it will bounce back.",

Its easy to buy a piece of Bitcoin - $25 worth for example.Others are realising that they dont actually have to own 1 Bitcoin and so owningSatoshi's instead is far more achievable for many people.When the Bitcoin market moves up more people want to be part of it. Hopefully the message about looking into the future has reached more people.",

Bitcoin is all that matters in the long time. All other cryptocurrencies are generally referred to as altcoins because none of them can be able to stand the position Bitcoin is today and their existence has a a stronghold of what bitcoin is today. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and till date its decentralized nature has made it a more dependable coin to invest in rather than depending on some altcoins that the future of them may not be certain and has a very high probability of not staying long in the market. Telling them that is how bitcoin started has been the case of many altcoins and several years down the line, they’re either no more in the market or have lost their value and cannot grow higher than what they are today. The adoption and use case of bitcoin will make it a more dependable option to go for in the midst of many coins that their value can no longer be dependent on.",

Bitcoin's price is expensive because it has a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins, from which 19.8 million coins are mined and 3.8 million coins are lost. Bitcoin is probably the only decentralized coin because it's the most adopted coin, mined all around the world and it's creator is unknown for the world, he remained anonymous and disappeared, which strengthened the decentralized legacy of Bitcoin.So, there is a limited supply and there is a demand, many institutions are adopting Bitcoin and there are still many more that will adapt Bitcoin because it's the future, it's simply inevitable. Bitcoin ETF approvals prove again that Bitcoin will further be adopted. So, that's why people invest in it.",

Not everyone is buying one Bitcoin and above, some are buying in bits which makes it affordable. Most people prefer Bitcoin because it could be held as an asset for a long time. This is because it has proved over the years to be reliable. It is also very simple to invest in Bitcoin compared to altcoins. There are many altcoins and most of them have proved to be scams, so people are careful not to invest in them . In terms of profitability, Bitcoin has also proved to give investors good returns if held for a long time. Also among all the cryptos Bitcoin is the most stable/volatile making it the best choice. Also the influx of institutional investors and the government into the Bitcoin space has also made Bitcoin more popular and reliable than others.",

Most of the altcoins now have been pumped already. And whenever someone says that Bitcoin was already very expensive, it will always be with that kind of description even in bear markets. You're right, people keeps on having a double mind to invest because they're doubting it even when the prices are considered low.Quote from: Bright0515 on December 03, 2024, 04:52:19 PMI didn't talk much I told them that, that was how it was with Bitcoin when it started but deep down me I wanted to give them more reasons but I was short of words so I guess my people here still have something more to say so I would love to hear from you so I can tell them when this topic arise again.

So how it do end up? They are the ones who do make money with this current market condition specially on breaking up new all time highs.No one had anticipated that this would really be that become too big on which it did really comes into a point that government and institutions are really that making up some recognition and now that it is really that starting these funds are flowing into this crypto market which does simply means that it is really that making some noise now and even government and billionaires are really that been starting out to dive in.Adoption and recognition is on the move and one of the most notable event is that when the time that El Salvador did make Bitcoin as legal tender on which it did really shook up other countries on such decision.They did even accumulate even more on the time that Bitcoins price dip on $15-20k as far as i remember and that one really paid off if we do base up on the current price condition that we are into.This is why if you are an investor then riding up with the waves will really be the best thing to do.",

And the reason why Bitcoin price and marketcap keep rising, while most altcoin is stuck and then died, is because the trust and adoption itself, because there are already many people using and invest on Bitcoin so it creates trust for everyone who wants to begin to buy Bitcoin. While some altcoins who are just started has no user so the trust is low, on the other hand we can see popular altcoin like ETH and BNB that already have their own users are able to maintain its price and marketcap.",
