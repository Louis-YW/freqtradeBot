  "content": "I’m installing Bitcoin Core to a 32Gb thumb drive. These are the steps I took:1. Choose my thumb drive “D:\\” as the installer location2. Refuse to let Bitcoin Core start automatically after setup3. Create a shortcut and set “Target” to “D:\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=D:\\Bitcoin”4. Open Bitcoin Core from shortcut and choose Settings>Options>Open Configuration File 5.bitcoin.conf:Quoteserver=1 rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 rpcuser=user rpcpassword=pass prune=550When I closed Bitcoin Core, my debug.log file would say it’s checking D:\\Bitcoin, but “bitcoin.conf not found, (skipping)”. Now my debug.log doesn’t offer any clues. It just shows the different blocks.If I choose Settings>Options in Bitcoin Core Shortcut, it shows that prune is set to prune=550, so it must see the bitcoin.conf file.However, my thumb drive has now used about 20Gb of storage and continues to fill up.",

I added -prune=500, restarted Bitcoin Core, and I’ve been waiting to see what happens. It fluctuates, but I’ve lost about 4Gb of storage, so it doesn’t appear to be working.

You should be able to confirm if this is the case by checking the size of both your blocks and chainstate folder on the USB drive. It's possible to split the data directory across multiple drives if you need too but if you want the speed of USB 3.0+ then you're probably going to need a bigger USB stick (I can't find accurate figures of how big both are at the moment though).",

I'm curious though: why use a USB stick instead of just normal storage on your system?

I’m wondering if the problem is my thumb drive is formatted to exFAT. I would have to delete everything and reformat the drive to see, but at this point, I think it would be easier to just install Bitcoin Core on the machine. The reason I’m doing this is because it makes my program easier to use, but a little more difficult to setup. However, I think I might be introducing user and compatibility errors that are unnecessary, so I’m going to reevaluate.",

I've seen some people use FAT32 or exFAT on their external drive to store Bitcoin Core files without problem.Quote from: BTCapsule on October 15, 2022, 12:19:23 PMThe reason I’m doing this is because it makes my program easier to use, but a little more difficult to setup. However, I think I might be introducing user and compatibility errors that are unnecessary, so I’m going to reevaluate.Have you consider you might fell into XY problem? For example, if you just need to get recent block and your user don't care about privacy, you could just use few free API offered by block explorer rather than obtaining data from pruned Bitcoin Core.I wanted Bitcoin Core to be stored on a USB with BTCapsule, but I changed my mind. It wouldn’t make sense to have an old version of the software, and it was causing way more problems than it solved. I don’t think asking someone to install Bitcoin Core themselves and add a few lines to the bitcoin.conf file is too complicated. Hopefully it will lead to more people running a full node.
