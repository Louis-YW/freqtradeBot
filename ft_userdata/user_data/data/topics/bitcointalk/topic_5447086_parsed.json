And theymos always try to introduce something funny to all. It is a little bit fun. I don't know how much time it will remain. I think it is only for 24h. I passed my first captcha by playing game in 2 minutes.By the way nice game theymos.",

I didn't get the point of doing such as you also know it's part of the day. If you can't make someone happy, don't be a reason for someone's sadness. I am sure theymos won't be sad because of that. It will encourage him to do something more unique next year. Still, why are you guys doing it?",

By the way, everyone is talking about the captcha, what about the coins we collect while solving the captcha? Are these coins worth holding ? Are these coins bitcoin killer ?",
