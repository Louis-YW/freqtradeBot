  "content": "I was looking to join a DAO and I couldn't find one that suits me. I am sure you had the same experience or at least partially.In my experience all DAOs are focused on accomplishing some sort of external goal * creating a new defi feature/protocol/dapp * building the revolutionary new dapp no one has ever seen* creating a new metaverse where nothing is like in the old metaverse * crowdfunding an acquisition of a photo of Billie Eilish's panties * etcActually I shouldn't say \"all DAOs are focused on accomplishing external goals\", most of the DAOs are just scams.I mean those DAOs that are not scam are focused on external goals. While some of them are really interesting, useful for crypto and sometimes profitable for the DAO, once progress is made the DAO typically dies off. But I didn't find a single DAO focused on the members of the DAO and their long term growth. And I don't mean just financial growth, I mean growth as a valuable member. After all, what's the point of a DAO full of investors and no one to take decisions? Why am I looking for this approach? Because this: https://youtu.be/4YWOCYSoTu0 and many other examplesWhy this would make a great DAO to join? Because over time, compound output of the improving skillset of each member is generating exponentially better total output quality and better quality decisions. What do you feel about the DAOs you have come across?Do you know of any project focused on self improvement?What is a great DAO to you?What do you think about a self improving DAO?",

In another hand, in what way does the capacity building for the member is effective toward reaching the goals of self-improving \"DAO\"? Why should this DAO be the reason to reach your mission instead of just simply a community where the community encourages each other to reach their full potential of themselves?Focusing on the internal things, as what you have said, seems too broad that the actual goals of the DAO creation itself are kind of meaningless to reach.",

      "body": "So you will be creating a brand new platform that is built based on this idea. Within the platform, the content circulation is mainly initiated by the DAO's investor or DAO's creator, and the creator is monetizing their content with a token of themselves. Did I get that right?The main idea seems promising, but I'm afraid the market potential or even a member's commitment toward this vision will be lacking. This will be a high-commitment relationship between the member-- investor and creator, whereas those are the essence of the platform. And another problem is by creating a new platform, gaining a new user base is difficult.",
