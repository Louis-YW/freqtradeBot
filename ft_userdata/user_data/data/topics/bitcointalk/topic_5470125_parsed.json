  "content": "For the online space when we de so, we know say some of our street boys done really spoil the name of the country and e come de very difficult to do business with person from outside as a Nigerian and the person go still trust you that much.Even most site when you go fit find better online jobs do don blacklist nija already and immediately you ignorantly put your country as nija, them go reject your application.I been de into cpa marketing at some point although I been de work with person when don already create the account. Issues burst out and the niga come comot me from the job. Based on say I done de do the job with am, I come think say I fit just open my own account use start the stuff on my own. Immediately I tried registering I received a mail that I haven't been accepted into the forum and will not be accepted at all. I did my research to find out why I wasn't accepted and found out that our country has been blacklisted and so any device registering with an I.P address from this end will be automatically denied access without a second thought.I was bittered but then, na them get the company so they have the right to blacklist who they want To based on there past experience.I believe say our snr men for the forum suppose don tey for the online space and suppose don get one or two experience regarding issues like this.If they go fit share some light regarding this matter e go make sense aswr. Like how we go take navigate through this challenge of some sites where we de blacklisted? If una go fir share una experience, e go make sense",

If una go fir share una experience, e go make sense If a site blacklist Nigeria IP addresses, you can use VPN. I have used paid VPN in the past and it work on some sites to bypass, but not all sites. This is not only happening to Nigerians, it can happen to some other countries and you do not need to be bittered about anything than for you to look for ways to become more successful.",
