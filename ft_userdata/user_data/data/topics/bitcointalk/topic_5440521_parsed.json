  "content": "We are currently in the economy where lot of pulls and push factors affecting it. Whether it is pandemic, war, inflation, political factors OR misled economy, it always thrive with the time after a shockwave. I was just researching about whether the growth of Bitcoin-ATM's has declined over the time due to above factors or not? Like, there could have been possibility that due to above mentioned facts Bitcoin ATM owners could have gone out of businesses, rents could have been over burden, increased inflation might have stopped people from using the bitcoin and much more. Even a thought came in that whether to bitcoin crash, does people stop using bitcoin ATM's? & thus eventually does it reduce in the number?However, it seems Bitcoin-ATM's are consistently growing around the world and keeping the steep graph of new installations. There is stagnancy seen but overall it is going on all the time. Q. How many Bitcoin ATM's are being installed per day ?Interestingly its around 13.6 ATM per day average. Coinatmradar uses 60 days methodology in which they would check the data over two months and take the 7 day factor to calculate speed. They have nice speedometer for this purpose and is shown in the below diagramImage Source Click HereQ. How many Bitcoin ATM's currently installed & how's the growth?The data that is captured on the website suggests around 38,160 ATM's are availale at the time of writing this post. This is huge leap considering we had 6 ATM's on October 01st, 2013. We can safely state that over the period of time Bitcoin has really made nice progress in terms of it's physical out reach. Despite the fact that we were in the middle of Pandemic, the growth of Bitcoin ATM became 2.5X in just one year from 2021 to 2022. That was realy enormous growth. Checkout the grpah below for this. Image Source Click HereQ. Which manufacturer is taking the leap?It seems that this data is a bit inaccurate since over the time many ATM's have switched to another software as and when needed. However, coinatmradar have tired to keep the histogram as per the received data. Since August 01st 2021, BitAccess seems to be leading the market and outgrown all the old players. Though all the four manufacturers coexisted since very long time, now it is the era of BitAccess and currently has 11,000+ ATM's using their software. Image Source Click HereQ. Bitcoin ATM's GEO distribution.This one is fun to see. North America alone contributes to 94.30% of Bitcoin ATM followed by rest of America. However, as whole America it contributes to 86.7% ATM against the World Ratio. Canada follows 2nd number lead with 6.7% of the ATM's and the runner up is European continent with 3.8%.This makes us think, though there are SEC, CBDC and FED's highly active in America and always restrict usage of bitcoins or at least try to be very strict about it, Bitcoin ATM's growing a lot with the time in America. Image Source Click HereThere are so many other tools that we can use and keep track of these ATM's, fees, softwares, manufacturer and much more. Check out all the data here: CoinAtmRadar",

      "body": "This is a good article but some of the claimed facts are not accurate with what I know, while some others lack consistency. Nonetheless, the article is good and worth considering as the reality of what is happening with Bitcoin ATM installation.What we need to consider are the facts that Bitcoin is not stable in price, that's a reason why many will not trust it as some people want. They might be losing money relying on their BTC in their ATM cards, unlike the fiat, especially the USD which is so stable.The appreciation and patronage of the ATM machines matter to the success of the companies involved, but it discourages when they are low, which is why declining is being experienced.Mind you, SEC, CBDC and FED as you claimed are not a problem to Bitcoin. SEC regulates, but never an issue for ATM, while the work of FED is even limited in this regard, it's only verbal yet, though as much as I know.While the CBDC is not yet a problem, no one is regarding it as a viable rival of Bitcoin yet, it has not even been in force in the US.",

      "body": "Nevertheless though, if we focus on the most recent months, the number of bitcoin ATMs since august 2022 has actually decreased slightly over the past six months, essentially driven by the numbers related to USA, which is the dominant segment that drives overall numbers. The other geographically broken-down charts may still show a mid-to-steep recent increase in some latitudes (i.e. Australia is rocketing), though their contribution to the overall numbers are a bucket of water in a pool.One interesting bit of data that I miss on CoinATMRadar’s site is that of a chart that distinguished those bitcoin ATMs that are only available for purchases vs those that allow buy/sell operations. Ideally there’s also be another set of charts that breaks the installations down by type of kyc/limits, although I gather that the data is neither normalized not complete for this latter set.",

Post 2017 bull run, I expected Bitcoin ATMs to just slowly but surely grind lower lol.I would not trust for 100% in numbers that coinatmradar.com shows. For example it shows 3 ATMs nearby. First of the ATMs is an office where I can do p2p exchange. Second ATM is also an office where I do p2p exchange, and also can buy different cold wallets. I would say that they looks more like a store, where you can buy crypto related merchandise, gadgets and also make an exchange. Third ATM - used to be an office, but their windows are so dirty, that is looks like the place has been closed for years. Problem with coinatmradar.com is that it is madly moderated. You can mark a place as an ATM, add pictures from the Internet and most likely nobody is going to check that info.",

Not only do they have the largest number of crypto ATMs, but there are also the most powerful companies in the world of cryptocurrencies, and this includes not only trading, but also mining, which according to some data has over 35% share in the US.If we take into account the ATM number, the fact that it is mostly the most expensive way to buy/sell BTC - then the conclusion is drawn that Americans show a great interest in exactly this way of trading, and that high fees are not a problem for them.",

Bitcoin ATMs do not even support cards before.The scope of my discussion was targeted to the card not where you are unnecessarily driving towards. I'm aware of what you explained which was why I didn't widen the discussion to that angle you brought out since they are well-known facts.Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 20, 2023, 09:04:56 AMFiat is also not stable, just not volatile as bitcoin, but inflation makes it volatile in the down direction which does not favour in long term, but bitcoin volatility in long term makes the price to increase.Fiat is stable, no currency will be at one spot if that is what you are mistaken as unstable unless a country has a major problem or boom which makes the price of the currency significantly change, and this rarely happens. But when it comes to the range of their fluctuation, they are regarded as stable, unlike crypto, you can do your research.Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 20, 2023, 09:04:56 AMPeople like to get bitcoin as a means of investing, which fiat can not give.Says who? You don't seem to understand the meaning of currency investment thinking it's only crypto one can invest in, people invest in fiat daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and so on. So those who enriched themselves by buying the USD last year, didn't they invest? And if they had bought Bitcoin in the long-term in the same year, would they not lose? There are retail and institutional investors that just buy currencies and keep them when they speculate they will appreciate over some time.It's about understanding, there is a reason why there are risk-on and risk-off seasons in the currency market. For the former, you buy USD and kept it, and for the latter, you buy your choice of appetite fiat and keep it. It's as simple as that, and it's an investment which banks and financial institutions do often.",
