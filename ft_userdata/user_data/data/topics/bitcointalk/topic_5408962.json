  "content": "Looking to hire a developer to create a simple user registration and management system, with an interface to a Bitcoin wallet.Need to also secure said wallet to protect all users coin and sites coin.SQL Table would need the following table:ID.  USERNAME   WALLET.  ADDRESS.  BALANCE.       NEWBALANCE   TRANSACTIONID.  DATETIME1.    TestUser.      WalletID. AddNow.    0.00234.         0.00233.          1TX.                     1/1/22 1:0:00 I think something similar to the above, then to get users current balance you just query for the latest datetime and newbalance.Maybe a cron job or something very quickly so if funds also come INTO the users wallet, the same entry is made updating balance.Again if one user sent to another user - I’m not sure how that part would work.Will pay some money up front and the rest on completion. Looking for anyone capable to give me a quote for this.The developer also has total freedom, so don’t need to use my recommendation - use any method to achieve the functionality I describe.Also important is that the front end of this must be capable to be ran as a hidden service. So don’t go using lots of JavaScript and things. Just keep it simple.Hope that makes sense.Thanks guys.",

Getting a PHP developer would be the better option (PHP and JS tend not to mix very well).",

Getting a PHP developer would be the better option (PHP and JS tend not to mix very well).  Mysql and NodeJS should work perfectly fine?OP you should do this yourself unless you want to shell out a couple thousand dollars. Run a full node, choose a language (JS) and enable walletnotify.Assign address to user and let walletnotify hit a certain internal route (/make-deposit) where you credit the deposit and store the new balance in your DB.QuoteThe developer also has total freedom, so don’t need to use my recommendation - use any method to achieve the functionality I describe.Bad idea. the work will be half-assed and you will have no idea whether or not it functions correctly.If I were you I would look into btcpayserver for certain deposit logic and then just keep track of balances using mysql.QuoteLooking to hire a developer to create a simple user registration and management system, with an interface to a Bitcoin wallet.This is not simple. You're asking someone to write a front-end that has sound registration logic, so a backend and mail server? and crypto payment logic. If you want this done well it's gonna cost you.",
