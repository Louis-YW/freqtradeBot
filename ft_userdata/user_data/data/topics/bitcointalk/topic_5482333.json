  "content": "Hello,I would like to know what types of transactions on the BTC blockchain would be responsible for a consequent move of the BTC price (e.g. a move of 4USDT)I guess several criterias are to be taken into account:- the amount of the transaction, I guess at least 1000s of btcs would be required to have an effect on the price. Do you have any idea ?- who is the sender and who is the receiver. For instance, if I (the receiver) buy 10k BTCs on Binance (the sender), I guess this could result in an increase of the BTC price (?).Thanks",

As a small example, for 1$ move on the btc price, it would require a transaction worth around 250 millions dollars.My question is more: what type of sender / receiver correspond to what type of move (bull / bear). For example: if Binance send 250m dollars of bitcoin to somebody (meaning the person bought these bitcoins on Binance), what is the impact ? the price goes up ? But maybe I was not very clear",

And vice versaI would love to see this in action, but for this I would need to 1) be able to see the transactions happening in the blockchain 2) filter out only the huge transactions (that may appear extremly rarely I guess, 3) observe the bitcoin priceI know how to do 3) but not the two others, any idea ?",

For example, when a long time holder, be it Microstrategy, sends a lot of coins to an exchange, you can expect them to be preparing to sell. Analysts track known addresses belonging to mining pools to see if they accumulate or sell their coins. They also track exchange wallets to measure inflows and estimate total amount of coins held by exchanges. That said, someone can send coins to an exchange and never sell. People sometimes do it expecting a big move, but when it doesn't come they don't sell and sometimes even send coins back to storage.QuoteSo, to summarize, if some people sells off a lot of bitcoins to Binance, this should/could result in a bearish. And vice versaFor a sale to result in a drop in price there has to be not enough buyers.Think about it this way. You have a big seller and a big buyer. The buyer is set at 40k USD with a buy order of 1000 BTC. The price is 40100, a buyer comes in with 800 bitcoin and dumps it all. He sweeps all the buy orders above 40k and dumps the rest into that 1k buy wall. The price drops by $100 and most likely recovers when small buyers see how big of a buyer is there at 40k.As long as the supply is faced by equal or higher demand the price will not drop.",

For instance, if I (the receiver) buy 10k BTCs on Binance (the sender), I guess this could result in an increase of the BTC price (?).Thanks The significant move of Bitcoin price is motivated by the players in the transaction and other factors. Often times, we do not hear any announcement about institutions buying Bitcoin until they have actually bought, if for any reason the public gets wind of information that those institutions want to buy Bitcoin, it will affect the Bitcoin price, hence, the reason why it is not announced, however, it is the reverse on the sell, it must be sold to someone in the public market. So, people tend to see the negative values.When the number of withdrawals from cex increases also, it suggests that it is being taken for a \"hold\" and this drives scarcity which further increases the price also",

Many other factors like halving and ordinals can also affect Bitcoin price. the price of Bitcoin courses the congestion of Bitcoin transactions because our experience that if bitcoin price is not high there is nothing we make the price of Bitcoin all the transactions of Bitcoin to be congested so what courses the price of Bitcoin to increase is the mind and what makes the congestion to continue his also the high price of Bitcoin because once bitcoin price is high once the mind is also high once people like to transact so the transaction of Bitcoin is what courses the transaction fee to be high and the congestion continue to happening.In this aspect what I want us to understand is that if bitcoin price is not high will not have a large congestion but if the price is low we will have a limited congestion so that is what I noticed in Bitcoin because since the price continue to increase is when we are experiencing high fee but when the price was low nobody experiences high transaction fee so therefore it is the demand what causes the congestion, why if it is supply is higher than the demand they congestion will be also low so that is what I want everyone to understand in Bitcoin",
