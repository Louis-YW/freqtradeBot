      "body": "The keys from a single key wallet is of different type of compared with the keys of multisig wallet. If you take a close look at it, the private key from a single key wallet starts from xprv, yprv or zprv, but it start with Xprv or Zprv in multisig wallet.I will advice you to just create a single signature wallet directly and use seed phrase wallet instead.Another thing is that you can use one of the seed phrases of multisig wallet to create a single seed phrase wallet. But what most people do think about is otherwise, by using single key wallets seed phrases they generate to create a multisig wallet. Both are possible.",

An identical key at an identical path can be used in both a single-sig and a multi-sig wallet simultaneously without issue.Quote from: Charles-Tim on March 01, 2023, 06:09:10 AMThe keys from a single key wallet is of different type of compared with the keys of multisig wallet. If you take a close look at it, the private key from a single key wallet starts from xpub, ypub or zpub, but it start with Xpub or Zpub in multisig wallet.This is true only for extended keys, not individual keys. Individual keys are indistinguishable, and a private key at any derivation path can be used to generate any type of wallet or address. (Also, xpubs are extended public keys, not private keys.)Quote from: Jlh74 on March 01, 2023, 12:47:41 AMWanted to use one of the keys I've already stamped in steel washers for the single SIG. I didn't think there would be any issues, just wanted to make sureHave you stamped an individual key, or a seed phrase?If you've stamped a seed phrase, the only issue I could see was if you then extracted an individual private key from your multi-sig wallet to use as a single-sig private key, then you could very well run in to major issues in the future trying to recover that from your back ups. If you are simply taking the seed phrase and using it to generate a brand new single-sig wallet as normal, then there will be no issues.",

That's very convenient and easy to keep track, but at the cost of less security. If one gets compromised, you lose everything.So even though it's possible, I wouldn't do it. Use different passwords for everything, and use different private keys for every address. Address reuse is generally not recommended, you're taking it a step further by reusing private keys. Just don't do it.",
