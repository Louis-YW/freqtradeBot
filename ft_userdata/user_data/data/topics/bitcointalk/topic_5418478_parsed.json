If you think 10% change on cryptocurrency is really amazing, you should look on past few years chart where Bitcoin price increase for 30% at single day which is a sign of bull market. Also the reason why Ethereum price increase is because Bitcoin price is increase earlier, it's not because of altcoins market.",

If though the market will have a run up to at least $50k this year, then maybe we can call ourselves in the middle of the bull run. Or as others pointed out, the cycle has change and that the 4 year old cycle will no longer holds true as the crypto narrative has change.So don't celebrate yet, we will have to wait will be up to us till this year. In any case, it's good to see the prices going up on some major altcoins like Ethereum. Bitcoin getting back to once it's support price at $20k.",

It could be a sign for the upcoming bull runs that's why if you are a risk taker and want to multiply your earnings by 10x it's better to look for some potential altcoins to invest your money with. but this alone is hard to find and even rare nowadays. But when you have the necessary info to search for it, it is recommended for you to do so. Just don't get blinded by the hype and make yourself blindly follow anyone on investing random coins.",

There is not much trending news lately about Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., so we just don’t know the factors behind the short term increase.I hold both BTC and ETH and continuing to do DCA with my extra money that I have per month. Most likely the next big bullish news that we expect is the much-anticipated 2024 BTC halving (unless there’s someone out there who would successfully hype the entire market like Elon Musk did last year).",

Don't get me wrong, I also want to see a bullish trend before the year end but there's just no reason behind why or how it can create one. Maybe if we start smelling good news about how the economy is getting better then that's a good sign a bull can happen. But right now, I doubt that. Necessity prices are not changing much and in fact they are more expensive, then there's the oil/gas problem.",

Yes of course that price pump of almost all cryptocurrencies that happened yesterday was pretty surprising to me as it came completely out of nowhere and with around 10% increase in price it was also a pretty big pump in my opinion. That being said we had this kind of breakouts a few times now already in the last few months and after that the prices always slowly but surely went down again to the level before that pump or even below that. So as long as we stay below the 1600$ mark per ETH i still think that this was just a small pump that will fade away soon again.",

If you smell it, go with it but come with caution because smells are often deceiving. If this pump sustains, we might be having a bull run on ethereum. But at this point it is difficult to say what will happen in the future. If you have bought at lower price, keep calm and hold for a few more days unless you are looking for a quick flip. If you have not bought yet, you missed the opportunity and hence just hold the fiat/btc till the price drops again.That is as far as you need to do, let the market unfold on its own, bull or bear will reveal on its own - keep watching and waiting. Patience over the market's short term movements will give you good results instead of impulsively acting on them.",

Prices for other cryptocurrencies are also rising. Bitcoin rose by 8 percent and crossed the rate of $20,000. Of course, these are good trends. But it is still very early to say that the bullish period is returning in the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency is very volatile and can make such jumps and falls in prices, but in the end, without changing the general background that has developed on the market so far. Therefore, we will more closely monitor the market. In general, the end of October and beyond the period until the end of the year traditionally had a good impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. So anything is possible. Analysts admit the possibility of a good price growth in the cryptocurrency market in the near future.",
