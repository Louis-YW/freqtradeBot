The problem is with the paper naira withdrawal limit and inadequate new naira in the circulation. Although, the paper naira withdrawal limit is not the cause of the recent problem, it is caused by the inadequate new naira notes in circulation.Not a lie that we are going through hell in Nigeria right now because there are some people that do not have online means of payment, people we buy pepper, onion, tomatoes and many other things from. Many people do come from village every 4 days to sell in town, many of them do not collect bank transfer but rely on naira notes.",

Even Bitcoin is considered as legal tender in a country, there are people who use it and there are people who don't mind to use it. You can not force others do things they don't like and don't want to do.If there is no prohibition against Bitcoin, it's fine enough to use it without fear to be put into jail.

You do no longer need any central banks to secure your fund and approve your transfers. You can do it all by yourself, secretly and very safely.Security checklist",

But what's a bit worrying me lately is the extent of how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used; as a profitable asset. What's more likely to happen if we would push adoption of this technology is regulation more likely. Governments would want to benefit on every transaction of its users and that is thru taxation. Also if this is the case, there is a tendency for the price to be less volatile simply because demand would be neutral as well because of the possible increase with fees and such which would persuade some investors to just use fiat based digital currency. If the price would be less volatile, will this industry still has a high demand from it afterwards?",
