  "content": "I'm trying to create a new strategy for dice, and i was looking at the odds/numbers, and i was thinking.Can you roll 00.000 , or 100 ? But that's not my question.Then i set the slider to the lowest number, on 2 sites with a house edge of 1%, and the lowest number was 1.99, and highest was 98.So then i thought, if i set the slider to 1.99 and roll 1, that would be a .99% house edge, but .99 is 1% of 99.Why is the slider on one site (Wolfbet) labelled 1-100? Because if i set the slider to 98 and roll 99, then what does 100 have to do with anything?So, my question, how many numbers can you roll in dice? (ignoring the decimals? or not?). Now im watching Just-Dice and i see someone rolled 00.71 ... (please dont make the discussion about the sites i mentioned, they're just examples in the problem)",

(please dont make the discussion about the sites i mentioned, they're just examples in the problem)I am one of those who often play Dice games in various crypto gambling, and every time I play I don't go below 100 rolls and my bet amount depends on the crypto coin I want to bet in the game. For example, I chose dogecoin to play, so the minimum bet I will bet is 2 dogecoin in 100 roll or round game, if I use USDT, I will do 0.2usdt, that's the style I do in making my game in dice games on any crypto gambling platform currently.",

(please dont make the discussion about the sites i mentioned, they're just examples in the problem)I play dice depending on my profit target, if target has reached then I will stop playing, I always hit variety of odds e.g. x11- win chance 9.00 or even x112.5 - win chance 0.8800 But I don't stay on any those few, sometimes I hit more x2 - win  chance 49.50 too.Do you mean that's someone did a roll under on 00.71? if I'm not mistaken it's about x140. I think \"somene at that's dice gambling site\" you are referring maybe have targeted a chances as well. Like this thread Chasing a x330,000 - Update: i hit it! that person is too very smart.",

I've hit this when playing with zero betting amount.That's hard to hit. I've done that before but never had the luck to hit with that multiplier and not lucky on that strategy that you've mentioned. Been there and so I have seen that it's not working for me, I just go with the normal one with a 98%.That's sort being assured but still with a 2% chance of losing. I just ignore the decimals and just slide the dice if I want to. But, I don't do automatic so I can fell my money winning or not.",

It is a strategy within gambling that is uncertain itself, and that is what is needed to be productive. I just wanted to ask you, what are the sites you are using for the dice rolling and what are your experiences with withdrawals? I've read a lot of negative reviews from some common ones, please of a guide.",

What I have known about virtual games like dice is that it is more of game of luck, I have seen the martingale strategy to be useful, by just starting to gamble with a very low amount of money, double the money or increase it in certain percentage as you continue to bet if losing, even if the bet does not hit in the first place is not bad at all as you double the money, so if the bet later hit then you have better profit, but I have preferred this strategy only on games that the profit : loss are both 50:50.",

Like this thread Chasing a x330,000 - Update: i hit it! that person is too very smart.Obviously, you will hit lower multipliers than the higher ones because their win chance is high although there are rare occasions where you can easily hit higher multipliers. What you are doing is right. Don't stay hunting higher multi's for a long time but test only your luck for a few rolls and then play on your main targets which is lower multipliers.All gambling sites have a target chance or you can set your own desired multipliers but I think the op mean is that some gambler can set their odds lower than the minimum odds. I think that is only possible if you will use a dicing bot. The result will look like they roll on the lowest possible odds but they actually roll on the minimum odds only.",

I've hit this when playing with zero betting amount.This will take too long to hit, but you will eventually get there. If the platform allows you to bet a satoshi per roll then perhaps you can do an experiment similar to what seoincorporation did. It will take an awful amount of bets but this will hit eventually. At times, I'm also trying to hit the x9900 multiplier when I'm getting bored and I just want to get things over with while also taking a chance to see whether I'll get something good. This happens very rarely though as I try to get the most out of my money by staying at a over/under 49.5 roll most of the time.",

It's also possible to roll the same without decimals and extend the range to thousands as there was a dice site that did it so I think the numbers could go higher if needed.Quote from: CiderWaffles on August 20, 2022, 09:53:26 AMWhy is the slider on one site (Wolfbet) labelled 1-100?
