It's one of England's quaint old traditions. Heve you got anything like that in your country?I watch a lot of this video on facebook shared by many friends in the past. I don’t understand why participants is very eager to get that cheese in exchange for the pain in their body? Is there other prize aside from cheese that makes the participants motivated?The closest event that we have on our country is agawan buko(https://youtu.be/zJDUMr9nSG4]. It’s like American Football but there’s no rules on how you will get the buko(coconut) to other player. Also players whole body is cover with oil to make it slippery and very hard to catch. This is the game that I know with same unique objectives and rules.",
