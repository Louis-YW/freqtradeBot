I also agree with the assumption that having received a new income option, some people have given up the idea of criminal income.And it is good, if those who began to earn at the expense of a new direction of activity, help (or even maintain) their relatives. But another question remains - is this way of restoring the economy, changing the situation in the country, fighting real problems - is this way not considered at all? ¬†Just the idea of isolated satisfaction of one's needs without changing the environment, it does not always give a good result.",

If we refer to the signature participants, actually the number of participants is not many, apart from that the income from the campaign is also not good if used as the main income because it is unstable, but for additional income it is very good.So I don't think we should rely on income from forums. It's a good idea for us to keep trying in real life and make the forum a place to discuss and earn additional income. Especially when it comes to the Nigerian economy, I think what you are saying is too much and going on a signature campaign will not bring much change to the economy of a country in general.",
