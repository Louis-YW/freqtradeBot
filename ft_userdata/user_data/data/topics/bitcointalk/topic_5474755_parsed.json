  "content": "This topic is a translation of a  topic, created by myself in Russian Local Board. I think it would be interesting to discuss it in general thread as well. Lately I’ve been reading some discussions and come across a very wide-spread idea that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are the prerogative of people with a mathematical and even technological “mindset.” That cryptocurrencies are, first of all, a technology based on calculations, codes and programs. And it is precisely from this side that Bitcoin is of interest.For a person like me who has received a humanitarian, namely philosophical, education, and who is not exactly far from technological “insides”, but who rather does not find any special interest in this issues, the above-described position seems one-sided and does not take into account the enormous advantage that humanitarian standpoint allows us to see in Bitcoin. And this is the path to freedom.Freedom is not only one of the philosophical categories, but also the highest individual value. The implementation of personal potential is impossible without freedom. The ancient Greeks generally associated freedom with immortality. For immortality, it is extremely necessary to live to realize one’s own plans and ideas, otherwise a person becomes only a means for fulfilling someone else’s will. Not being able to leave your own unique imprint on your actions and thoughts means existential defeat and guilt for free citizens.Nowadays, the realization of freedom is inseparably linked with financial opportunities. And we are talking not only about their utilitarian properties, but also about money as a means of influence and control. First of all, over your own life.Existence and even stability of income does not really mean financial freedom. If an income depends on another person, company, corporation, state, this puts the recipient in a dependent position. No matter how beautifully the importance and value of a particular person in the system is presented, it is always worth remembering that the elements in the system are interchangeable. Therefore, no high position, professional length or experience is a guarantee that a person will be provided for his entire life. Moreover, being inside the system limits and sometimes completely destroys his actual freedom.So, what does humanitarian education have to do with it? Despite the fact that it is precisely this matter that makes it possible to see and realise these things. Of course, such conclusions can be reached in other, more experienced ways, but they are usually longer and more painful. Whereas theory (from ancient Greek - research, consideration) allows one to arrive at this in an a priori way.Back to Bitcoin. How many people who understand the technical features of cryptocurrencies decide to “sell” this knowledge by choosing to work for companies or states? How many of them continue to live from salary to salary and believe that stability of income is the greatest happiness, continuing to have a very ordinary existence? Judging by what is generally written on the forum - one of the most advanced meeting places for crypto lovers - these are the majority. I think they should ask themselves whether their education (or self-education) can really change their lives for the better and make them different from the lives of the other 8 billion people. I believe, we all need to periodically ask this question so as not to live a boring, monotonous, stereotyped life. Cryptocurrencies allow you to earn money without “working” in the usual sense of the word. They allow you not to depend on employer, but to take responsibility for your own actions, successes and failures. They allow you to choose not from a given range of possibilities, but to implement your own, while accepting the consequences. And philosophers who lived several centuries ago help to arrive at all this, although at first glance it may seem that neither they themselves nor their ideas have anything to do with such a technological miracle as cryptocurrencies.I would like to hear opinion of users regarding the resonance of this topic in their own lives and observations, if there is one and is of interest for discussion.Perhaps you have examples of philosophers or writers who influenced the formation of your own ideas about financial freedom that you would like to share and discuss.",

I think it's difficult if we only depend on bitcoin, especially if we only hold bitcoin. Bitcoin trading is also difficult and cannot guarantee that we will always make a profit every day even if it is done by a professional.

Like Thales who drank poison to maintain his idealismSometimes those of us who chase money or wealth are considered capitalists and individualists because we don't prioritize other people. Humanity is not about money but about relationships with humans, such as socialism which prioritizes togetherness and anarchy which does not want to be led by other people.I quite agree with Hegel, where all theses must have an antithesis. Likewise, every philosopher must have different and sometimes contradictory thoughts, but even though their thoughts are different, the value of idealism will remain the same.",

Bitcoin trading is also difficult and cannot guarantee that we will always make a profit every day even if it is done by a professional. Can you explain more about making money from bitcoin without working?In my opinion, working is about working for someone else. Under someone else`s leadership. While bitcoin can provide you with the opportunity to self-work, when you depend only on your own skills, creativity and opportunities. Not when someone tells you what, when and how to do something. We can hold bitcoin, we can invest in other projects, we can do trading. Of course, it won't be successful every time you do it. But it can liberate you from the necessity of being an employee.

Bitcoin doesn't provide or allow you with anything, Bitcoin is a tool.Your financial independence is not provided by Bitcoin is provided by other people who use their funds to buy Bitcoin, you could have all the knowledge on Earth if nobody buys the coins 21 million of them will be worthless.

Yes, you are right, we can invest bitcoins in other projects, and trade. I think it's difficult to make money consistently from trading and investing in other projects because as far as I know, crypto projects always have very high risks. If the goal is only for that, then fiat can also be used. Can be saved in a bank as a deposit, can be used for stock trading, can be used as an investment for people or institutions, and can be used to buy daily necessities.In my opinion, bitcoin or crypto is an investment instrument and as far as I know it is very difficult to be able to depend on investment unless you have a very large investment value, small investments cannot be relied on in the short term.Quote from: Etranger on November 20, 2023, 11:38:53 AMQuote from: PytagoraZ on November 20, 2023, 10:03:59 AMYes, I agree that freedom is an expensive value, but the freedom that philosophers mean is usually freedom for oneself and has nothing to do with money, because usually philosophers are idealists and don't see money as something important in this world.

Yes, I mean Socrates, thanks for the correction. In my opinion, in philosophical conception, money is not something important because money sometimes causes problems. One of the reasons why we want to have a lot of money is because we follow a lifestyle. I know several people who really don't depend on anyone, including money. He has rice fields planted with rice, gardens planted with vegetables, as well as goats and cows. He lives simply and doesn't follow the lifestyle of most people, he enjoys life in a relaxed and carefree manner, in my opinion that is true freedom because he is free from anything, including freedom from lifestyle demands.Quote from: Etranger on November 20, 2023, 11:38:53 AMQuote from: PytagoraZ on November 20, 2023, 10:03:59 AMSometimes those of us who chase money or wealth are considered capitalists and individualists because we don't prioritize other people.

I have friends from departments and fields not related to computers, such as civil or medical engineering, or even doctors and lawyers who have a good background in Bitcoin. Some of them even learned the basics of programming. To verify the open source code and started using an open source operating system.Learning Bitcoin only requires time, reading some books, listening to real teachers on YouTube, and allocating some time to reading technical discussions, but using it only requires knowing the basics of dealing with a computer and phone.being associated with the health-allied field, i don’t understand this take on bitcoin even if i’m not particularly well-versed with mathematics and technology I still took interest in bitcoin because I saw potential where it could lead me to a better economical status of course this belief can only take me so far I had to learn about cryptocurrency it was boring me at first because it was far from my interests and far from the career path i was taking however i tried my best to learn about it",

I think it's difficult if we only depend on bitcoin, especially if we only hold bitcoin. Bitcoin trading is also difficult and cannot guarantee that we will always make a profit every day even if it is done by a professional. Can you explain more about making money from bitcoin without working?Maybe we can make money from this forum, but what is clear is that we work for campaign managers and it's almost the same as working anywhere else.Yes, I agree that freedom is an expensive value, but the freedom that philosophers mean is usually freedom for oneself and has nothing to do with money, because usually philosophers are idealists and don't see money as something important in this world. Like Thales who drank poison to maintain his idealismI am not surprised hearing people think that the fact they are into Bitcoin or crypto-currency guarantees then financial success even if they won't work at all for it.This misconception has to start from how Bitcoin was presented to them, many if them was told that Bitcoin would change their financial status so long as they are involved in Crypto-currency.This is a failed mindset because thinking like this can increase your risk to getting scammed, or making the wrong investment moves.",

And it is precisely from this side that Bitcoin is of interest.Let's forget about any humanitarian or philosophical approach we give to bitcoin, it's only what it is base on what the whitepaper said, alot of scholars have said many things concerning bitcoin both in a way we could possibly get along with and the ones we may totally go against, but bitcoin will always remain the exact currency it was intended for and continue to serve through it protocols under the blockchain consensus, irrespective of the way everyone accept it, bitcoin remains the same with what the inventor planned over it.",

I'd say for vast majority, it's better to have a primary job (either work under someone or freelance) and use Bitcoin as a store of value.Yes, I define myself like that. Of course, I understand, that majority prefers working in a more traditional way. But this isn't my story. Quote from: kingvirtus09 on November 20, 2023, 12:57:37 PMQuoteCryptocurrencies allow you to earn money without “working” in the usual sense of the word.I don't know what you mean by this, because, as far as I know, you can't have cryptocurrency or bitcoin without making any effort to have it. Even if we say you didn't take out any money, you still have something to do for it.I have not said that you don't have to work at all to open the crypto pass for yourself. You have to make efforts to purchase your first coins and then trade or hold them. What I meant is that trading, for example, requires only your own knowledge, responsibility and desire. You don't have to report to anyone, you are your own boss, and for me this is the perfect way to work. Quote from: stompix on November 20, 2023, 01:09:46 PMBitcoin doesn't provide or allow you with anything, Bitcoin is a tool.Of course, it is a tool. But this tool opens far more opportunities, than traditional ones, I believe.",
