  "content": "As many of you may have read my previous posts and know that I used to accept crypto in my business. I was waiting for a Bitcoin payment to happen because all others were in alts. I used to convert them to BTC. No big deal there. But recently I am facing some issue with this. I had to stop accepting Bitcoin/ Crypto payments because Cryptocurrency is not legal here anymore. It was in a gray area for quite some reason, but recently the law department is making their move by putting crypto in a black area, thus declaring it illegal. I don't wanna wind up in some illegal affairs, so I put a halt in the crypto payment section. From my point of view, this is the best option I am left with right now.  I have no idea when will I be able to continue, or will I ever be able to continue again. And this whole thing is not because of any complaint from the police or anything like that. I am doing this for my own safety and to continue with my business. They are putting people in jail if they know we possess crypto. So it's a personal thing for me. I can still continue if I wish to, but that doesn't seem like the wise decision. So let's hear what you guys want to say. Give me some advice from your personal experiences.",

      "body": "It's understandable that you want to avoid any potential legal issues, so stopping the acceptance of crypto payments for now seems like a reasonable decision. However, it's important to keep up-to-date with the legal status of cryptocurrency in your area and to follow the law. You may also want to consider seeking advice from a legal professional to ensure that you're making informed decisions. Additionally, you can look into alternative payment methods that are legal and secure in your region.Here are some general tips for preserving privacy and avoiding tracking when using Bitcoin:Use a reputable and secure wallet: Store your Bitcoins in a secure, private wallet that allows you to control your private keys.Use a new address for each transaction: Always using a unique address for each transaction makes it more difficult for others to track your activities.Use a VPN: When accessing your wallet or making transactions, using a VPN can help hide your IP address and encrypt your internet connection, making it more difficult for others to track your activities.Avoid reusing addresses: Reusing addresses can make it easier for others to track your activities and connect multiple transactions to the same person.Be mindful of your personal information: Be careful about sharing personal information, such as your name, address, or other identifying information, when using Bitcoin.Additionally, running a node allows you to validate transactions and blocks yourself, increasing security and reducing your reliance on centralized services.",

There is a difference between explicitly banning crypto and being crypto-unfriendly, for example in the United States crypto and BTC isn't banned, nor is it illegal, but the government want to regulate it, and would probably never make it a legal tender, but you can perform any crypto transaction without facing legal problems. China is another country that has banned crypto mining and crypto exchanges, but didn't explicitly make crypto transactions illegal. In op's country Bagladesh, crypto is explicitly illegal and trading it can bring problems for the person doing so.Quote from: tjtonmoy on February 06, 2023, 08:50:13 PMSo it's a personal thing for me. I can still continue if I wish to, but that doesn't seem like the wise decision. So let's hear what you guys want to say. Give me some advice from your personal experiences.If you will run into legal problems by accepting crypto payment, then the most logical thing to do is to stop it. You would surely continue using BTC and crypto secretly as there are ways to do it, but openly accepting it in your business kind of brings you out and it could be bad for you as it is illegal.",

Bitcoin is great, and bitcoin accumulation is always worth our money, but bitcoin without the support of the government and being banned all over the world, then I think bitcoin will end up useless. Although you can still continue to accept bitcoin if you like, for your own investment, but i don’t think if there will be a lot of customers that will prefer to pay with bitcoin instead of fiat.",

From my point of view, this is the best option I am left with right now. Constraints like these make crypto, especially Bitcoin, unable to be maximized as it functions. Here, we understand that sometimes we cannot put forward our ideals in doing something, because sometimes it can become a rock and an obstacle. It's not that I don't support the use of Bitcoin as a means of payment anymore, but if this is the case like what you are experiencing, then I think it's okay to comply with the government more securely and for the sake of your business continuity without any problems from the authorities. This is not only happening in your country, but also in mine. Even though crypto is legal as an investment tool or commodity, Bitcoin is still not legal as a means of payment and cannot be used as a means of payment. hence, some people who wanted to do it, had to go underground. And this is of course difficult because we don't know who or which merchants received it because it was not announced.",

There’s no sense fighting and promoting for bitcoin because the people around you will not gonna fight and oppose the government policies as they are afraid to do so. However, you can still continue to invest and accumulate more bitcoin but not in a process of accepting bitcoin as a payment system as your consumers will never want anymore to be involved in bitcoin as it’s banned in your country.",

From the look of things ops may end up making a rush decision in stopping his cryptocurrency alternative payment because, from the look of things on the government bank circular ops posted,  it shows that the bank is just trying to warn citizens against the risk associated with virtual currencies, but not a total ban and I am sure P2P will work perfectly in this situation. *ops should know that, receiving cryptocurrency payment give his business an edge over its contemporaries who only have one payment method. *I advised ops to seek legal advice as suggested by someone on thos threads.",
