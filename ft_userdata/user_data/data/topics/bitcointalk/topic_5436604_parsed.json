Who's making that currency and what will stop them printing too much for themselves?All countries have high levels of corruption already when it comes to managing government spending but I think a unified currency would make that worse (I'd be inclined to say the same for the UK too if it aligned its currency with another country's again).As a mode of exchange, you could of course argue for one but then gold (or another asset) might already be able to serve that purpose.",

By doing this, authorities might be mixing systems people from one country or another aren't confortable with. And considering how chaotic is the economical situation in Argentina and Brazil right now, I don't see it as productive measure.Anyway, the proposal doesn't replace the currently Real and Peso by a new currency. It's different from the Euro in Europe. They would coexist and the usage wouldn't be imposed to every citizens from both nations.Regards Africa, well, it's not a common currency for the whole continent which is going to be the solution for their problems.",

But this currency may be useful for exchanges between the two countries.For African countries, they cannot do this easily.

Africa's main problem is corruption, its second problem is also corruption and the third is corruption. Note that eight African countries already have a single currency called the West African CFA franc, yet Togo, Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali are some of the poorest in the world.A common currency is good because it removes some of the barriers that different currencies cause during international trade and it could also help reduce the overdominance of the dollars. Such a single currency might end up becoming strong and widely used internationally because of the unified economic strength of African countries. Even with a single currency, we don't need to expect anything good from a continent where the stealing of public funds and lack of accountability has become the norm. Few economically stable countries in Africa would always oppose a single currency because they are scared that the current woes of other African countries might have a ripple effect on their fragile economy.",

It can actually be a good idea for neighboring countries to come together under a common currency because it does bring down so many barriers to trade and generally you will make a lot of trade with those around you. You can share things like tourism much easier and in a wider sense you are likely to bring down other barriers like border controls which slow down business plus leisure. However it works best when the economies are similar, but you will inevitably have certain countries in the group that are weak and some who are strong. The weak ones gain some credibility while the strong ones have the power of their currency weakened slightly, which is good when they're trying to export. However it takes a lot of preparation and unless it's managed well it can go badly wrong.",
