  "content": "Maya Protocol has a really interesting model for LPs and liquidity nodes, modifying the usual pure bond model and creating a more capital efficient platform without compromising security.This is achieved by bonding LP units via nodes, so nodes end up becoming liquidity providers.Maya might be a THORchain fork, but it adjusts the approach used by it regarding the Pure Bond Model security policies, where:- More than 67% of capital has to be bonded by the Maya nodes.- This balance must be found by rational market forces such as supply and demand.- There must be a high node count to incentivize decentralization.nodes still need to buy and bond a big amount of $CACAO (Mayaâ€™s settlement token) for the exact same security reasons but store them in a totallydifferent place. Whereas in the other model bonded native tokens arelocked up unproductively inside a specific address, bonded $CACAO inMaya is deposited inside Liquidity Pools, paired with other nativeassets and generating yield.Also Maya node operators can supercharge their invested capital efficiency by earning both LP rewards as well as their usual Validator rewards.This is really interesting because they achieved a model that creates a sort of liquidity flywheel effect while still permitting similar security features and parameters to the legacy pendulum.",
