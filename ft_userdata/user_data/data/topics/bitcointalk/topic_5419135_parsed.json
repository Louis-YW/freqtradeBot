Can someone explain what it is and how it can be used to determine the best time to buy miners?Just look at the chart for the whole timeline.One example is this one, I don't know if I'll be able to insert the image here, however, the original link is https://resources.swissquote.com/sites/default/files/2020-04/graph1.pngWarning: this is a logaritmic scale chart, you may want to crosscheck with another price charts!Quote from: https://en.swissquote.com/crypto-assets/education/bitcoin-halvingI see a cycle from halving to halving. Others see it from ATH to ATH. It doesn't matter, still a ~4 year cycle.In second cycle the crypto winter was around the first 2/3 of year 2015. In the third cycle it was pretty much during the 2018 autumn and 2018/2019 winter.The longer the \"depression\" lasts, the more the people call it crypto winter. But overall it's the worse part of the bear market, it's the period the price is the lowest in such a cycle and doesn't give any signs of recovery. It's the most depressing part for holders, it's the period some miners may be disconnecting their gears (for shorter or longer periods of time).I am not an expert, but this is how I see it.Also according to this chart, one year before the halving the price is already on a healthy rise. Maybe that's the moment you want for buying gear? I don't know, I certainly cannot give advise in that one. All this is more a price analysis/speculation.",

Winter just like the season is a period where nothing grows due to the extreme weather, so a crypto winter will mean a period where it will be difficult and unfavorable for crypto, so investing in crypto at this time, you should not be quick to expect growth. After winter is followed by spring where plants begin to grow, the rally that follows after the crypto winter cycle can be attributed to the same characteristics of the spring season.",

However, crypto winter also impacts the mining difficulty because mostly during the crypto winter mining difficulty is always down but if the mining difficulty is high it will suppress the crypto winter trend and generate a bullish trend.Mining is always profitable during crypto winter because most miners consider crypto winter mining not to be profitable since they need to sell their earnings to fix bills but if you're going to mine for future purposes while to fix the bill using another means the current unprofitable mining earning will be in your favor when it bullish market.",
