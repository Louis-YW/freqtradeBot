Is this exclusive for these rolls or was it used for other items, too?Any numbers on mintage of these special edition rolls? Those boxes were made by @BG4, aka Mr. Papersafe. He did a monero box, & I think he did a box for Nastyfans, and the BTC penny boxes... Not sure if more were made. His laser engraving work is stellar on these for sure.  I had him make me a Monero box fora ¬†Lealana 3-coin set, and at the time I paid him 1 BTC for the box. (around/under 1k per BTC at the time, can't really remember but know it wasn't more than 700 bucks or so in btc at the time). ... My my how times have changed! Love it , and good to see you micromen, hit me up sometime on the telegram - had great times meeting you with @zeph in 2018.. Edit - My 2019 roll looks literally the same on the tarnish.",
