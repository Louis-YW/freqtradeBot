It can be confusing because some times moderators leave a redirection topic but other times they do not I do not know what the criteria is but if you find this happens again go to your profile and check your topics posted by you and you will probably find it.

Right.grumpygit, you created your topic on \"Bitcoin discussion\" and moderators moved it to \"Web Wallets\". That's all. Take note that you can see all your posts in your post history. Go to your profile and click on \"Show the last posts of this person\" to see all your posts or \"Show the last topics started by this person\" to see just your topics. Edit:As shown in the modlog, three of your posts have been deleted recently, but they don't seem to be what you are talking about here. May I ask you why you repeat the same thing again and again?You have made the following post in four different threads.Quote from: ninjastic.spaceI cannot bare to read some of the spineless posts today and over the last few weeks, people forget so easily.It was only in early December that we were all wondering could Bitcoin reach the impossible level of $10,000. It has done and it still is above that level after a heavy fall, if you don't have the nerve or guts then go and invest in something safer and boring.",

You first thread would have been more than enough to learn the reason why that action was taken and also how to avoid it. But instead you went on creating multiple threads and even I even saw one were you insulted Welsh who was simply doing his job by moving your post to the correct board. And if you continue like this more of your posts are still going to face the same fate.",
