The following evidence canâ€™t be dismissed so easily...https://davekleiman.substack.com/p/craig-wright-sanctions-hearing-onCraig Wright is a scammer who wants to own the copyright to bitcoin in order to receive royalties from all crypto companies for the rest of his life. But no one will allow him to do this, and he will lose court cases in all countries. And since he has financial problems, he is forced \"to spin like a snake in a hot pan\" (C).",

You don't have to worry about the trial in Miami, Craig Wright is widely known as a liar and fraud, there is no strong law against his explanations in court, whatever reason he utters in court does not change anything for the Bitcoin community.You can see here clearly.Craig Steven WrightQuoteCraig Steven Wright is an Australian computer scientist and businessman. He has publicly claimed to be the main part of the team that created bitcoin, and the identity behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. These claims are regarded as false by much of the media and the cryptocurrency community.QuoteSecurity researcher Dan Kaminsky said in his blog that Wright's claim was a scam and bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence publicly provided by Wright does not prove anything.[35]Craig Wright's words have been going on for a long time, nothing has changed even though he has a myriad of reasons against the creators of Bitcoin.",

He even managed to trick Gavin Andnrsen in 2016 when he was required to sign a message on one of the first 50 bitcoin wallets. There are huge profits at stake. This is the copyright of Bitcoin and the shilling of its own coin as Bitcoin SV.",

I saw it like something that will fizzle out within a short period of time. But the law was not approaching his case aggressively how I ought they should threat it. They are instead being lenient and seeking evidences even where it does not exist.Right now I am no longer comfortable with CW. He is obviously not a fool, even if he is a liar. For him to continuously invest in his quest and chase for bitcoin ownership, he has a vision and for this case not to have ended since, there is a conspiracy. The community might be saying another thing because they know the truth, but the court can crazily decide another thing.",
