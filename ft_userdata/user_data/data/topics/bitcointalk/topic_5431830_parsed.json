Your post was deleted because it most likely did not fit into any board for discussions, and it did not also make sense enough to be sent to the off-topic side of forum. Do not be discouraged please OP, you are not targeted, and nobody hates you.",

Occasionally, if a thread is meaningless, the entire thing will be deleted, including all comments. To prevent this from happening again, it is important to continue posting high-quality content and to comment frequently on other high-quality posts.",

Someone most likely reported it to prevent spam. So avoid spamming the forum and keep it clean. Mods definitely did the right thing, so act accordingly. You must be an good contributor in the forum. As a result, your posts will not be deleted. But don't take it seriously; occasionally, though somewhat infrequently, our posts are deleted. But this is normal; when mods deem a post unnecessary, it is deleted. Rather, concentrate on improving your posting quality.",
