In fact, you should probably sell ALL of your video cards NOW, or at least as many as you have time for. Sell the AMD cards first, then the higher-end RTX cards. That's what I did. You will probably be able to build back later at half the price. Buy coins or hold fiat.",

This bear market has not seen the worst moments, and I believe there is more to come.We are not sure if Polkadot and Avalenche will be the next Luna or Solana yet  I would wait until we are deep into the bear market and see how projects survive through it before thinking of buying the promising coins.",

The developers of the miners had to spend several months for the hashrate of these video cards to become high. This situation can be with new AMD video cards. So I wouldn't be in a hurry to buy. A huge sale will begin after the completion of Ethereum mining. It is even more profitable to sell video cards now in order to buy the same or better at a lower price in 4 months.",

RX 560 4gb? RX 570 4gb?I agree with your general idea of GPUs having gaming value, but I don't think we are anywhere near the price floor for current-gen video cards. RTX 3060's are selling for $330 used today, but let's say they end up at $200 in 3 months if today's coin prices stay steady. That is a capital loss of $130 / 90 days = $1.44/day.You will get $0.60/day of profit mining CFX at free power. That won't compensate for the $1.44 in capital loss. So the most profitable decision would be to sell that RTX 3060 today rather than take the -$0.84/day = $75 of loss over the next 3 months.After I did the math, I came to the conclusion to sell *now* instead of riding the market down.",
