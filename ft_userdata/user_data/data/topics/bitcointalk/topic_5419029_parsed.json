Black Friday is more for frenzy buying sprees,all the people in US and Europe have saved money during all the year in order to buy their latest gadget and technology devices the most from what I have seen in the last couple of years.Sure the casinos follow up by bringing good bonuses but as I said before the only bonus worth mentioning from online casinos at least in these last years is the one from the end year holidays and with reason,we are staying at home at least 10 days so the casinos also know that and tease us with the biggest yearly bonus.",

Firstly, new year holidays vary from one country to another. For example, people in CIS countries have always had much more holidays as those in Europe. Secondly, playing habits also have much to do with a country's mentality and attitude to the gambling industry. Some place bets/play the roulette on the weekends, other solely during working hours.",

Question - are you expecting exclusive promo offerings on the Black Friday? - Gambling players do not want the promo or bonuses that can be obtained from those things.Of course, all gamblers want that dude. But I don't rely on the promos on black Friday because as far as I know, they have criteria that are given so that you can avail of their promo or bonuses.Now if those criteria are easy, probably many people can get those bonuses in the promo. But anyway, good luck to those who availed.",

We always expect exclusive promo offerings on special days that require it. Big retail companies always offer huge discounts to their customers who walk in to get products when the black Friday deals are on. Since Online casino's do not sell commodities and  cannot offer discount on bets, the alternative to celebrate that day with their customers are extra bonuses, which can also promote them. It is not a must, but it is something that casinos can do.",

As far as I know, I never encouter here any exclusive promo regarding black friday since this event mostly for shopping on e-commerce industry. I'm not sure but casino nowadays use all the special events for there promotion so I'm expecting that there will be but the prize is not the huge compared to major holidays such as Christmas and New Year. Also there some casino always has a free spin promotion as part of there regular bonus such as Winz and Blackjack.fun.",

I think if am coming towards this kind then it's my first time to hear casino offering free spin only on the occasion to mark black Friday, bonus can actually come in different forms with promo but i think this together with black Friday will make gamblers develop more interest with the target to make their luck with black Friday, the event us specially observed during or when close to Yuletide season, am sure gamblers will have enough opportunities to make something different from the Casino Free Spin to mark this year's black Friday.",

The op's gambling site is new so maybe there are other interesting features to find on here aside from this event unless if you are only gambling for one purpose and that is for the bonuses.Bonuses can come in many forms. If that is a deposit bonus, well obviously you need to deposit something but if the one that you want are literally free bonus that doesn't need a deposit then expect that it has a high wager requirement. It may seem strict but if they didn't do it then it's an easy loss for them.",

It will be also better if we can do something at Bitcointalk forum by the casinos. I mean only exclusively for Bitcointalk members, this will grab attention to many forum members and will definitely love the idea of the promotion. Black Friday is also majorly celebrated in the US, so people outside US might not be aware of this event. So it will be best if the casinos provide amazing bonuses like wagering competition and lottery contests. It will definitely attract more gamblers to the site.",
