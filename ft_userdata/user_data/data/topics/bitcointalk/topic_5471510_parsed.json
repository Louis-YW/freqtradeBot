This network is able to coordinate an infinitenumber of blockchains (execution shards) by using the Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)consensus mechanism, which eliminates all consensus-based contention. The ability for PoEM tocoordinate a perpetually growing set of blockchains allows the network to process more than50,000 transactions per second. The architecture is a composable multithreaded executionenvironment with blocks being produced approximately every 1.1 seconds.-----for now the algo ProgPow in tesetnet ( iron age )in this tesetnet 8M will go to miners in rate = 1.48 Quai a block in mainnet stats of netwrok  :  https://stats.quai.network/app/dashboards#/view/42c8bea0-c347-11ed-97a4-9f17539a647d?_g=(filtersofficial discord : https://discord.gg/quaifor mining your need to run a node and set a proxy see  https://docs.quai.network/node/run-a-nodeor join to have your proxy (pool) :  https://discord.gg/xVqPVNEg",

As soon as this goes live, all airdrop hunters and people who got a piece of allocation will be dumping this stuff instantly. Don't expect the price to be even above electricity costs a day after the dump.",
