  "content": "Hi!In Monero community it is an important idea to decentralize mining by using own p2pool instance by every single miner.Meanwhile, it is quite difficult to build, deploy and maintain such an instance for a non-advanced Monero user.Hereby, I officially introduce brand new Monero mining pool that uses its own p2pool instance as a hashrate-liquidity provider.******************https://minexmr2.com******************The pool is completely open source, of course. It's name is devoted to legendary departed pool minexmr.com. But I am NOT affiliated in any way with minexmr.com's owner. I am completely separated person.Digit \"2\" in minexmr2 means \"p2pool\" as well as \"2\" means next, 2nd generation of minexmr pool.I made a really old-school Monero mining pool without any registration, cheating cookies, personal data collection, etc.When you mine with minexmr2.com, all your hashrate is redirected to internal p2pool instance,thus all minexmr2.com hashrate is actually accounted to p2pool hashrate.Pool minexmr2.com processes all the PPLNS billing and eliminates p2pool's dust payments, aggregating them to 0.01XMR chunks to be paid to you.Also minexmr2.com pool can be easily up-scaled on a dozen of servers, using haproxy as a request scheduler.Source code mirrors of the pool:https://github.com/minexmr2/minexmr2https://gitlab.com/minexmr/minexmr2Just try to mine (all the instructions there):******************https://minexmr2.com******************",

Don't forget to press F5 or Ctrl+F5 in your browser.minexmr2.com is now full-fledged!P2Pool hashrate charts & miner's last 10 payouts to show in web-UI have been implemented and deployed to minexmr2.com site with miner's hashrate charts. Remember, the pool supports only automatic difficulty that is coming from p2pool and starts from some 4000K. Minimum possible difficulty is set to 50000. That steps are made to avoid server's overloading by misconfigured miner rigs. Minimum total miner's hashrate (per each unique XMR address) is recommended to have at least 50KH/s.Today, minexmr2.com has all the base features of a full-fledged Monero mining pool:It shows approx. estimation of payout frequency (typically some 2 times per hour).It shows P2Pool 24h hashrate charts that reflects the actual frequency of a miner being paid by minexmr2.com pool, because it has effective hashrate of P2Pool.It shows Miner's proper 24h hashrate charts that reflects the actual payment amount of a miner to be sent (each time above 0.01XMR threshold).It shows Miner's proper last payout (amount and UTC time) as well as latest 10 payouts sent.It shows many other parameters like minexmr2.com pool local hashrate, P2Pool local hashrate (these two parameters should be nearly equal to each other if P2Pool instance functions properly), Miner's 24h mean hashrate, pending balance, etc.Enjoy! And share this great news in your social media. Tell to all your friends. Have a nice Friday!https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/comments/10sc6lk/minexmr2com_is_now_fullfledged/?sort=new",

      "body": "As all of you must know, Crypto notion is not defined as some transactions infrastructure based on a cryptography.Cryptography is just a first historical-appeared technology to guarantee all the transactions in Crypto are IRREVERSIBLE.Yes, there is only one property of Crypto notion that is necessary and sufficient to call an entity the Crypto:IRREVERSIBLE TRANSACTIONS.All other properties are just derivatives from that most fundamental property. For example, to be yourselfyour own bank, in other words, to hold full responsibility yourself if you got scammed, newbies.But let us return to irreversible transactions. Indeed, historically, irreversible transactionsare implemented by running the same special cryptography algorithms by all the Crypto coin participants simultaneously.Here is coming decentralization. Participants running cryptographic software are not organized in a some hierarchicalrelation but rather form an [ONE RANK peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network.All the participants are interchangeable, no one is emphasized.But ONE RANK networks are pretty rarely found in real nature. All the laws of physics, chemistry, biology, sociologylead to [RANK-SIZE distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank–size_distribution) in any use-case, wherean innocent mind expects [UNIFORM distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution).And, RANK-SIZE distribution is the CURSE of all the Crypto world since its creation by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.First of all, there is still no one well working meanwhile perfectly decentralized exchange.Several centralized exchanges, if they were distributed uniformly by popularity between end-users, might forma good approximation of a whole decentralized exchange. It were the case, if each end-user selects a centralizedexchange for every next currency conversion RANDOMLY.But in real life, popularity of centralized exchanges has the cursed RANK-SIZE distribution, furthermore in its worst case:Almost all the people (90% by money flow) use the f@cking BINANCE.I am Florida Haunted from [Bitcointalk 2014](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=341464)and I had already seen the end of RANK-SIZE distribution: [MT-GOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox).Crypto people, you are all under the severe CURSE of RANK-SIZE distribution where as few as just 1-3 TOP participants serve the whole industry.Consequently, if they got scammed or ruined by state regulators, the whole industry will be devastated.Mining industry is as well deep hard under the CURSE of RANK-SIZE distribution. Given any coin, [TOP 3](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero)mining pools are occupying some 70% of network hashrate.Despite the fact there is decentralized [p2pool](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool) software for some coins,it does not change the game.The reason is simple: p2pool IS NOT a mining pool but rather a composite of software to be built, deployed,connected to each other, running, upgraded, maintained on the responsibility basis of every end-user participant (the miner).The CURSE of RANK-SIZE distribution is one of the reasons I have made [minexmr2.com](https://minexmr2.com),first open-source Monero mining pool using decentralized p2pool as a hashrate-liquidity provider for frequent payouts.I do recommend all the miners to use p2pool directly if they have resources and time to deploy and maintain the node.[Gupax](https://github.com/hinto-janai/gupax) may help a lot as it automates many routines. In coins other than Monero,corresponding implementations of p2pool or even gupax also exist, I believe.But p2pool is not a mining pool, as it was mentioned above, it is a piece of software interacting with other pieces of softwareyou must build, run, maintain for your own responsibility.[Minexmr2.com](https://minexmr2.com) from the other hand, is just exactly a classic vanilla mining pool, you can switch to INSTANTLY.And hereby I ask every person reading this, a person that has no resources to establish his own p2pool instance,AND connected to [TOP 3](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero) mining pools by hashrate, to switch to minexmr2.com.For coins other than Monero, one can adopt the pool's open source from[GitHub](https://github.com/minexmr2/minexmr2)/[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/minexmr/minexmr2)to the coin of his choice.Please do not switch to minexmr2.com if you are already connected to a pool outside [TOP 3](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero).You do already vote for UNIFORM distribution instead of RANK-SIZE one.Minexmr2.com is a full-fledged pool with hashrate charts, payment history, pending balance, etc. It makes automatic payouts withtypical p2pool frequency (some 2-3 times a hour), if pending balance is above 0.01XMR.Tell that to your friends and share on your special media.You may RANDONLY select ANY pool outside [TOP 3](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero). Just do that to fight RANK-SIZE distribution together.And of course, abandon the f@cking BINANCE exchange right now! Select any random exchange from[kycnot.me](https://kycnot.me) or [trocador.app](https://trocador.app).Together we make RANK-SIZE distribution UNIFORM and rescue the Crypto world!!!",
