  "content": "In every part of the world things are going worst by the day in terms of prices of commodities and services. Whereas people keep hoping that things will some day gradually start to get better and we will all go back to days when things were less expensive and moderate.   Am not of that school of thought that puts hopes in such ideology that things will eventually get back even close to how it were in times past looking at how the society is degenerating by the day.Best I believe on is to work out different ways of income's through different means or streams which is the only way to meet up with the concurrent rise in prices of commodities and services stead of waging hope on the mirage of better days ahead. As you makes some profits from Bitcoin trades you make, also endeavor to extend hands into other forms of business in addition to your regular pay job as it's the most rational thing to do.I don't know if am being realistic here or pessimistic about issues.What's your thoughts?",

I as a person don't like one source of income, my father used to say that having one thing is like not having at all, if you are making money from a source it could get blocked one day and if you have two source of income you still have something left that can make you money. Some people prefer starting a business first before investing money but we can't all do the same thing, humans aren't wired this way, I started investing money before having a business and that journey was not easy at all.",

We'll live prosperously at some point (maybe not this year, but we will). And then again after a few years another crisis will emerge. It's just economic cycles, and failure is part of it.",

I don’t see how the fiat monetary policy is sustainable over say, 200 more years. Wages don’t keep pace with inflation so it’s inevitable that eventually fiat will collapse like a house of cards.Just by knowing & being aware of the above gives you an advantage. Bitcoin beats inflation, it is by its design, a deflationary asset. Plan & prepare accordingly for what is coming.Buy BTC.",

Every time I go to the supermarket, I have been dreading how much more I will pay then the last time. But there’s no way I will starve, nor not have food in the fridge. The price of gas has risen due to climate change, or some blame it on the war Ukraine. I still need gas to drive to get from point a to z. I’m no economist, these are all changes worldwide, with all the causes and the effects are higher prices. We just must remember, we must be on top spending, like maintaining a budget and staying within the boundaries you give yourself. This will help adjusting through inflation.",

I mean, you're absolutely right that relying solely on the hope that things will magically get better is not a realistic approach. Instead, diversifying our income streams and exploring different avenues for making money is a smart and practical way to adapt to the current economic landscape. Whether it's investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or starting a side hustle, there are plenty of opportunities out there to increase our earning potential.",
