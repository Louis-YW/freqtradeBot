  "content": "Bitcoin has created a lot good wave to it's investors during bull market, bad wave during bear market. Bitcoin is a seasoned coin that undergoes halving every 4 years, yet many have not gotten use to bull and bear market of Bitcoin coin, some people only get happy during the bull market as a result they forget to prepare their mind for bear market too. 1 Bitcoin = $26 (2013) Â  when only an average number of investors believed in it, Now that many investors are into Bitcoin investment, it cost thousands of $$ Â to afford 1 Bitcoin ( 1 Bitcoin not for everyone).perhaps Now that the potential of Bitcoin have been globally let out and with regards to more innovation, the price will continue to go that many can not afford 1.",

I agree, it's like they created this idea that you need to be a member of 1 BTC club. So regardless if you can get to it or not, just take advantage of it just like money because it is money after all.I was also obsessed with the idea before, to be honest was able to save 1 BTC. But then again, I sold some and used it the way I wanted it to be and then just continue to reinvest in bear market. At least there is no pressure to save and then what?",

In this present day when Bitcoin price is beyond the reach of the average man, accumulation of Bitcoin is still the idea. Price is not the concern when dealing with assets that can be broken into smaller bits. The more the accumulation the closer it gets to 1BTC. Some times all it requires to own a single BTC no matter the price is patience, taking advantage of opportunities especially during the bear and discipline to buy the dip",

I just know a lot of people personally won't get into Bitcoin now, because they feel out priced, simply because they can't justify or afford to buy one Bitcoin. Even though I've explained it a million times, and torn my hair out in the process, they just can't seem to get over that mental block. Yeah, despite Bitcoin being complex, I think stocks are even harder to understand, and I can see the appeal that Bitcoin has from that perspective as well as the core principles of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's almost like a catch them all. Personally, I'm not as comfortable investing in stocks than I'm with Bitcoin. Stocks are highly dependant on how the company performs usually, whereas there's a lot of factors in that, which are wildly unpredictable, especially when it comes to the reputation of the company, and the people running it. Although, I guess to a certain degree the same could be argued for Bitcoin, though Bitcoin being decentralised there's at least a bit of mitigation to prevent that. Anyway, by all means make one whole Bitcoin your target, but don't make it prevent you from getting into Bitcoin if you can't afford it. Most people can't afford that amount for an investment, especially something you might not be completely sold with (that usually takes a year or two).",

Or maybe some of us can't afford that time because we started late in our bitcoin accumulation. So personally, I would not just push myself into it, of course I will save what I can only afford and dream that someday I will be a member of that prestigious group.
