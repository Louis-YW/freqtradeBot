  "content": "Hello everyone,I need clarification on the concept of market cap, please. I am referring to market cap and not fully diluted market cap.And my question concerns tokens that use existing blockchains (such as play-to-earn on BSC).So, if I understand correctly, the formula for market cap is token price x number of tokens in circulation.Hence my first question: What is meant by tokens in circulation?I understand that this refers to ALL tokens in circulation, meaning all tokens that are not locked, burnt, etc.Generally, among the major categories that appear in a project's tokenomics: we see financing rounds (Seed, private, strategic, public), the ecosystem, liquidity funds, budgets such as marketing, and then the team, the community, etc.If I understand correctly, does this mean that a token that is not locked, whose purpose is for marketing and not for liquidity, still enters into the calculation of the market cap?My second question is this: How is the token price calculated?On CEXs, I suppose it's the law of supply and demand, so it must be the price of the last buyer?But on DEXs, how is it defined?***slight digression: If what I said in my first point is true, I have the impression that for a lot of projects (especially in the play-to-earn space), the number of tokens in circulation listed on sites like Coingecko or CoinMarketCap is not at all correct, or am I mistaken?****One last question, which is actually a concrete example.Let's take the example of a new project with the following characteristics:- It has 10 million tokens- 1 million are sold during an ICO at a price of $1 - The remaining 9 million are locked.So if I understand correctly, the market cap is $1 million, right ?If one million tokens that were locked suddenly become unlocked, assuming nobody sells or buys, the only thing that happens is that these 1 million tokens are unlocked.Naturally, the price of the crypto will drop to $0.5, right?Because if the price doesn't drop to $0.5 and remains at $1, it means that for crypto projects, all they need to do is generate new tokens to increase their market cap, which doesn't make sense to me.That's all. Thank you for your help.",

      "body": "What you're saying about dexes does make sense and I'm not too sure how it's handled (like I don't know if weth is an individual token or if it's included in eths cap but if we assume it is then market cap checks out - ie the coins still exist but they're wrapped as a token so they're still somewhere).If you have 1 million tokens each worth $1 and an extra 1 million are unlocked the market cap doesn't have to fall, but it probably will. If no ones watching it well then it'll be able to keep its $1 price until those extra million move, if they don't move and are just unlocked and held for a while (and get sold strategically for example) then you can expect the coin to maintain its market cap or double it (but then there's things like if a coin isn't allowed to go over a certain amount before more coins are sold they might start dropping for that - for being less competitive than coins in other places).[hr[Compound might be a good example of how market cap either dies or stagnates (I've not paid interest in the past from comp making up the difference - a lot of defi tokens are similar).",

With altcoin projects that have very wild volatility, their marketcap can change quickly from the moon to the hell. If you are in a bear market, you will see how potential projects in bull market will be tested by the bear and those project marketcaps will be divided many times even more worse than your imagination.",

      "body": "Well, howdy there!When we talk about cryptocurrency projects, market cap is a mighty important metric to size them up. And it sure tickles my funny bone to see you asking about it! Now, to answer your first query, tokens in circulation refer to all tokens that are on the loose and ready for trading. This covers tokens held by the team, investors, and those earmarked for marketing, liquidity, or other goals. So, if a token is out there and isn't tied down, it'll be counted in the market cap tally.Now, as for your second question, the token price is like a fickle pickle and depends on market forces. It can vary depending on the exchange or platform where it's traded. On CEXs, the price is determined by the last trade executed by a buyer and a seller. On DEXs, the price is determined by the liquidity pool, which is driven by the ratio of tokens supplied and demanded.Let's say we've got a new project with 10 million tokens, and 1 million of them were sold at an ICO price of $1. In this case, the market cap would be $1 million. But if a million tokens suddenly got unlocked, the price would take a nosedive to $0.5 if there are no buyers. But hold your horses, partner! Market cap ain't no perfect metric, and it can be tampered with by projects generating new tokens to inflate their market cap. That's why you should also consider tokenomics, team experience, and community adoption when sizing up a project.Hope I've cleared things up for you, partner! And remember, always do your own research and due diligence when investing in cryptocurrency. Happy trails!",

Example:Project get listed on pancakeswap and founders put 1 mln tokens and 1 mln USDT into pool as startup liquidity.1 mln USD / 1 mln tokens = 1 USD/tokenNow You came and do a buy order using 10 000 USDT. Now, inside pool, we have 1.01 mln USD and around 990k tokens (a little more due to slippage but lets use that to make it simple to understand).1.1 mln USD / 0.99 mln tokens = 1.11 USD/token - new price.why CEX price = DEX price for most of the time? because of arbitrage traders and their trading bots that in any time can buy on dex and sell on cex for tiny profit (and vice versa).

Because if the price doesn't drop to $0.5 and remains at $1, it means that for crypto projects, all they need to do is generate new tokens to increase their market cap, which doesn't make sense to me.Why did you assume the price will drop? Your previous description about the market cap is more or less correct (some members already clarify it for you), and I don't see why you would assume any price change if there is no change in trading activity (volume, etc). In an ideal world (for the project team at least), that would increase the market cap instead. So yes, a project can increase its market cap anytime it wanted to, but no one would buy their tokens at all. If a team can increase its own holding then it means it can create as many tokens as it wanted to dump on the market, which will drive the price down regardless of how big its market cap is. No one would like a token like that. That being said, it is true that most of the time when a token unlocks happen the token price would decrease because the selling pressure is increased while buy orders decreased. The reason why those tokens are locked is that they want to prevent people from selling them anyway, and keep the price up. As far as I'm aware, this metric is not being used by most traders nowadays. At least those that I know of. Sometimes they would see the fully diluted market cap as a comparison to see if it is worth trading the tokens for mid-term or daily (or holding it for the long-term). Most of the time though they just don't care and look at the charts. CMIIW.",

      "body": "Hello,Thanks for your answers.You're right, my approach was not really correct.I assumed that the price would drop by 50% in this scenario because I have always considered the market cap, alone, as an indicator of the trustworthiness of a token.And to me, I could not believe that it was possible to artificially make the market cap of a token increase.Yet, it's the case.I'll just take an example just to make it clear, that I understood the things right.For instance, if 10 fraudulent people launch a new token. Token price is 1$, 10000 tokens are available to be purchased, which is 1% of the supply.They buy 10000$ overall.Then, they artificially increase their market cap by releasing the tokens that were locked. The price can only increase because they won't sell their tokens, and new people may buy the tokens, .If they release, let's say 50¨% of the overall supply, that will be 500 000 tokens available, with a marketcap price of at least 500 000$, right?And in this scenario, if one takes the sole marketcap as a trustworthiness indicator, that'd be actually a huge mistake.So one could say that instead of taking the market cap as an indicator, one could also take the token price. But it makes sense as you said that when tokens are unlocked, the price decreases. So price isn't enough.And the numbers of holders neither. Because I assume that fraudulent people could create a lot of different wallets to buy the tokens, which would make people think that there are a lot of holders, when there actually isn't.So what I'm starting to deeply understand is that actually, one shouldn't trust these numbers alone, and it's much more complex than that.One should'n take these numbers are reflecting perfectly the health of a token. Even if they give a good idea, most of the time, of what's going on.And you helped me understood it , so I thank you very much",

So tokens won't be easily unlocked at will the developer just to disrupt their tokenomic. Suppose you set a 5 -year locking period on your smartcontract, then the market tracker refers to the indication (after the contract code is validated). The token will remain locked, the market cap will only be re-adjusted according to the current token circulating after reaching the unlock date on the smartcontract.",

Most public sales participants or just buyers in general would use other currencies to buy the tokens. For simplicity's sake, let's say they use ETH. It means that at the time the sale ends, the team gets $240k in ETH. They can decide to sell some of them or keep them depending on their needs, it has no connection to the token market cap at all. In an unlikely scenario, they might convert some of them to their own tokens, but that is almost impossible unless the team is so dumb. Almost every project will allocate some tokens to the team, so there is no incentive for them to convert those ETH to their own token. In short, the team/project is likely going to be fine in the short-medium term even if the token price plummets that hard. The buyers are the ones who got screwed.",
