I don't want to lose it but since I need the money I decided to take a loan instead.If you believe you have a profitable and good business plan then use your own fund, funding, and trusting a project should start with the developer.You should only take a loan if you do not have available funds to start your project.It's hard to get a fund if you only have your Twitter you have to introduce yourself professionally and include your Linkedin account where they can see your whole resume and your achievement and what guarantees you can present to your investors that their investments are safe and profitable.",
