  "content": "QuoteKusama in a follow-up tweet said, “Yes I am serious. We would be at the table with policy makers and would help shape global policy for the MV alongside other giants like FB (bye Zuck), Sand, Decentraland etc.”Whether this belongs to the Economics forum or Altcoin discussion, it's worth talking about because Kusama, as we know, would be working with the high officials of the world. What are your thoughts on this?WEF if you have read about this before is a very shady organization that was allegedly working with FTX where the page of FTX was deleted from thier website. WEF was promoting a lot of unbelievable stuff like the great reset down to eating insects. https://www.weforum.org/https://www.forbesindia.com/article/cryptocurrency/wef-invites-shiba-inu-to-help-develop-its-project-on-metaverse-global-policy/81421/1",

Is that right?I wouldn't be surprised why WEF is inviting it because Shiba Inu at this time is also one of the most famous meme coins with one of the biggest communities in this industry and if I'm not mistaken it has built over 100k plus community members in the crypto space.And I also think that these two will work together when they a collaboration because this Shiba Inu is also undeniable that there are many connections with big business people today.",
