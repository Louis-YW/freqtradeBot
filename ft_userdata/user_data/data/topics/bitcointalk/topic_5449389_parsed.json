Your story is confusing.This story has a message that if you are lazy and careless with your capital, no one can save you. There is no free lunch, and if you want to have it, spend some time to learn and do your own research always. Don't rely on anyone to buy anything for you.QuoteI suggest newbies to visit bitcoin.com and buy any cryptocurrency.What?Again you changed from Bitcoin to any cryptocurrency. Confusing again.QuoteYou can buy with you gift card, debit card, bank account, apps wallet and so on to avoid loss.Bitcoin [dot] com is a site of a scam team (Bitcoin Cash team). They wanted to claim Bitcoin Cash as a real Bitcoin.On that site, I saw they have Wrapped Bitcoin which is a token and not a real Bitcoin. It can be de-pegged too.Don't buy Bitcoin Cash or Wrapped BitcoinHow do I become productive in this forum?. Being a good member does not mean you must be productive in creating topics like these.

Your story is a little confusing, but if you say so.  There are a lot of scammers that do this kind of scam, I also have a friend that got a scam that is really similar to this, he invested in a guy and got an agreement that he would buy Bitcoin for him and put it on a wallet then they could split the profit in the future, but the guy disappears and scam my friend's money. He has a bad experience with cryptocurrency so I told him what he does is wrong since he trusted his money with other people, I told him that if he doesn't want to learn bitcoin and invest on her own just dont buy Bitcoin at all.The easiest way to buy bitcoin depends on your country, for me buying bitcoin on Binance exchange and then sending it to my wallet is the best and fastest way.",

Also, since you use a centralized exchanger, why don't you choose a good one! For me 700 dollar is not small amount I feel sad for that.  And if you have problems with buying directly in the decentralized system, then you can choose Binance as a centralized exchanger as a beginner, here you can directly buy some other types of Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin through P2P through any type of mobile banking or bank. But you should be also remembered that for holding bitcoin centralised exchangers are not right place so I would like tp suggestion for you to transfer those bitcoins funds on a good noncustodial wallet and it can be more better if you hold those fund on hardware wallet for risk.",

I've heard some horror stories about people losing their life savings to crypto scams. I suggest researching the platform thoroughly before making any transactions. It's also helpful to seek advice from experienced investors or join a community of like-minded individuals, like this forum, who can provide support and guidance. OP, I noticed that you suggested using the bitcoin.com exchange, but I think there are better options available. It's a good idea to ask around in your local community to find the most reputable and suitable crypto exchange for your specific location and needs. Factors such as the availability of fiat deposits and other specifics may vary depending on your location.",

The mistake that Op made is that he did not research enough before choosing where to invest, whether to choose the platform or to research the background of the person who suggested a specific platform. Perhaps for this reason, most of the victims of this type of scam are beginners.The best option for beginners is to follow the advice of proven and reliable experts. The forum here represents the best space in which a beginner can ask general questions and get useful answers if he does not want to bother with searching. Even the first purchases can be made directly peer-to-peer with one of the members who provide sales services and have proven their reliability.
