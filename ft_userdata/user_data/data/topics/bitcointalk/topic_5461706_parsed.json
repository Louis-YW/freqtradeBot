  "content": "Hello , Cyrus and Peers ( please this is a indetail post, please do not merge or lock ) ( Cyrus i hope you can guide me more , as i am new over here)Website Name : stake.comGames : MinesI had doubts since stake.com was looting and scamming its customer, so i started recording my game play so that i can keep track of losses on monthly bets and betting patterns of stake.comSo i came across few bets which were missing from stake.com,  these bets were placed by me 20 days ago , when i ask get the, hold of specific betid , i was in shocked. i was agitated and asked stake.com to compensate me.For instance,Bet id: 167247337064This Bet id is not showing on stake.com but bet before this and after this are coming in the system . i was told this bet was archived , and i asked support to get the results from the archive file , and came to know this bet is registered under archive as played on 11 mines. ( everything attached on the screenshot )https://postimg.cc/gallery/yB9Zg7h( they removed my image )https://drive.google.com/file/d/19WBdS_JnP5lsd8Zou9SZg1mAw7MvPU29/view?usp=drivesdkhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GjHzR5Lq7SJyznRSaDH0ih_aUBQxJ-m0/view?usp=drivesdkhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTk1YIT_scQoyTtfufEBQi35cUvoBaFD/view?usp=drivesdkWhen i checked the archive found discrepancies with majority of my loosing bets , either the odds were high which i usually play.However , the original result of the bet id :167247337064 is in the link below .https://postimg.cc/gallery/5M666wBas this snapshot of video file cant help with quality.And yes, i want to be compensated , till now i have not received any rely from Stake.com the support chat just states thatis above thier jurisdiction. And you have to judge yourself , is stake.com Genuine or its just a scam wesbite after they stopped the API where you can export and verify the bets.People saying verify the bet , on provablyfair.me dont know its the same website of one of the subsidaries of stake.com.",

It's just a log to easy check for you, a better explanation you get from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459921.msg62612666#msg62612666 (@CHRISBIN702).Most important are (Seed, nonce and client seed). Just change your bomb number from 11 to 2 dumb ! like I said, how many bomb you are choose 2,11,24 are not gonna to effect the result.Same seed, client seed, nonce on mines will generated 24 first number came out from 25 number with RTP and being used for the showed bomb (If you choose 2 bomb, the first two number came out from 24 roll are gonna to be the bomb). Off course, you can't understand my explanation because you are stupid. - Accusing people have multi account just because wearing the same signature (like accusing @Pmalek with other account).- Don't understand about how the provably fair work- Most hypocrite, saying CASINO SCAM over 2-3 month but still playing on CASINO you are saying SCAM ? Gosh.- Spaming over all the board, created multiple thread with a same topic.NEXT TIME DON'T GAMBLE, I belive you got debt on someone ! that's why asking 1,000,000$ ~LOL. If you really2 feels that, and stand with your opinion (Go sue Stake and going to trial on courtt) oh I forget all the money has been lost by gambling incluiding life-saving & have debt to be paid.No debt , unlike you asking for loan on forum. I have checked your posts man. Get a real job if you want to take loan 🤣🤣🤣 each and every month. proud family money. inheritance.now you will complain, wooh its not your money you just acquired.let me tell you , its not my problem that your forefathers were lazy . its not my problem your dad was broke and didnt left you any money.",
