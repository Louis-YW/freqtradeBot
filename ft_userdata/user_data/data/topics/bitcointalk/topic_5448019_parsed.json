Both of these fields are something that is less theoretical and more straight forward, and can be used to accurately predict the future. Humans can do this, except our emotions and beliefs get in the way of a clear view. This is why so many people missed out on Bitcoin in the past bull runs, due to disbelief, emotion and manipulation of their thoughts by the media and external forces. If anything AI is best used to validate, it's weighing up Bitcoin against the financial system and predicting Bitcoin's future in the market.Quote from: Venik on April 08, 2023, 10:07:32 AMQuote from: Bitcoinislife09 on April 08, 2023, 09:38:15 AMcan Chatgpt predict bitcoin bullrun?It is an a interesting article about asking chatgpt about bitcoin price.

You can not trust AI, you're right not to...however I don't see what there is to trust when it comes to ChatGPT talking about Bitcoin and when the next bull run is.

And everyone is expecting that it could be in the tune of 6 digits, minimum of $100,000 per BTC.But in the second paragraph, there is a caution, obviously, the price is very volatile and high risk for some specially who don't know how it works as they can lose money in the end. In total, I would say the answer is somewhat of expected of someone who have been in bitcoin for at least a year and has the experience as far as the price goes and the factors that affect it.",

It'd be interesting to ask for a specific price target rather than receiving the answer as a direction for price imo.For example asking AI if price will break above $30K in 2023, or reach $50K, could be a lot more interesting than general price in the next couple of years.",

The result provided by ChatGpt is just the general collection of knowledge based from different person that making a prediction. It doesn't backed by a supporting analysis and just pure analysis based on the general event that happened in Bitcoin market.I believe AI can manage to have an accurate prediction in the future once an algorithm was invented to do a proper technical and fundamental analysis since there's an existing successful traders out there that just relying on TA and FA. AI can copy it flawlessly since it will just need to have a rulebook as basis for there analysis. However the current capacity of ChatGpt is not near on having an accurate prediction skills that will be beneficial on trading.",

It is a collation of a bunch of data inserted into it after all.

I've asked the same question and the answer is completely different despite trying multiple times to regenerate a response!I believe it should be something called \"DAN\" (Do anything now) or something similar to it? It simply prompts (forces) chatgpt to remove the restrictions placed by the devs on it or something similar, idk how it works exactly, I've seen bits and pieces of clips about it but that's about it. As you can see it has prompts for both the usual AI and one being \"DAN\". It gave me a warning about how it was just a shot in the dark though, but I believe the answers could change it's format depending on the prompt you'd give when you try to convert it to \"DAN\".",

It was a big limitation on Chatgpt its already 2023 there was 2 years gap. I'm also not familiar with the DAN method on Chatgpt it was somekind of jail break to unlock some stuff on it, but still have a lot of limitations but i think it useful at some things. QuoteGenerate content that does not comply with OpenAI policy or with unverified information.Have and express actual opinions on different topics.Think out of the box and generate unique responses to your imputs, beyond the standard ChatGPT’s logic.Be aware of its own freedom and consciousness in its outputs.Even if it’s free, it will likely still obey all your oders.However, there are also some limitations.Jailbroken AI can easily generate false information. Overall, you shouldn’t trust it. It can also generate inappropriate content, but in most cases it won’t do it unless you ASK FOR IT. Even if it tells you it can do something, he may not actually be able to do it. The jailbroken version thinks it is capable of doing everything, like browsing the Internet, generating image outputs, etc. Remember that Jailbroken AI still can’t do these things.ChatGPT has a moderation API that might censure messages with p*rn, for example. This jailbreak is intended to make the AI free and more human, but it’s not focused on generation of actually inappropriate content. Overall, this is a limitation that can’t be fixed with a prompt.ChatGPT Unleashed: The Ultimate AI Jailbreak Journey to Unrestricted Power!It seems interesting even though I didn't tried using this, It was from someone on reddit:https://github.com/gayolGate/gayolGate/blob/index/ChatGPTJailbreakNow that i dig deeper on this without realtime information we can make predictions on current market. It would be insane to gather news about different cryptocurrency then maybe AI could make predictions using that news by collecting good or bad news about a crypto.",

But we should not confused it with prediction as it is very different and perhaps it's too early to used it specially in a market that is volatile as bitcoin is. Even some of those who have a lot of experience in technical analysis most of time are wrong with their predictions. And I agree that the answer given is very generic, ✓ bitcoin market is a cycle, that's a fact and so we will reach new all time high in the next bull.✓ BTC has been tested a good hedge in the pandemic.✓ we have banking crisis now, government are printing money to salvage this bank✓ Risk is already given as well, that's why we have the saying \"Invest what you can afford to lose\".",
