We agreed with a friend that when we had the opportunity to try the beetle, we would do it, when we arrived in another country we couldn't even touch it, let alone eat. Do you think you could take part in a show about fears and survival? If so, what would be the scariest thing for you?",

Do you think you could take part in a show about fears and survival? If so, what would be the scariest thing for you?Is that a Reality Show? I do not really like the way this world run such shows. They tend to be so realistic that participants end up getting pregnant, harmed by animals in the jungle,  fight each other to the point of death, etc. It's possible that people you're interacting with in cyberspace or physical world are mere actors acting a show you aren't aware of. People who aren't part of the show get involved without their consent, or the actors/producers fail to let people know that a scene they got involved in is merely a show. For example, an argument scene will normally attract people in certain countries who will try to settle the argument without knowing it's merely a planned movie scene or something like that. Though movies tend to be more controlled unlike reality shows, and people are more aware that they are interacting with actors or watching a movie scene. Well, the interesting thing about such shows is that  it's pretty similar to how humans are existing in this world. It's like playing a role while being watched by angels, principalities and Powers... It's like a show within a show. The ones made by humans are watched by \"big brother\" and people.  People are allowed to live their real life in the shows while being watched. In regards to the part about fear and survival, for us there is absolutely nothing to fear. It's hard to be afraid when you know you are sorrounded by an Existence with invisible Beings that protect you and grant your good wishes/requests",
