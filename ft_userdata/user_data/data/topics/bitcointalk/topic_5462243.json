  "content": "Turn you adversity and suffering to advantages, we have several adversity in bitcoin such as no return, hacking, price volatility, scam and piracy. There are profitable ways we can turn this into adversity Firstly you have to embrace discomfort, discomfort can be very bad but they challenge for growth. You have to be ready to face life challenges and emerge victorious, firstly you must learn from you mistakes and look for a better way to improve, while improving you have to be consistent and consistent comes from the mindset. Without the mind being developed for its outcome of accepting whatever thing that comes up it very difficult. Like a skilled civil Engineer, if he/she doesn’t practice consistency he will not be smart, fast, accurate when laying bricks. Secondly you have to stay away from people who don’t believe in your process, you have to be with people who will encourage you when you When thing are rough. Thirdly take sometime to reflect on your dreams and goal and let them light you to the future.",

As long as you're aware of the risks involved, and understand the subject in depth, it's all a matter of personal decision. Not everyone needs to be \"embrace discomfort\" to invest in BTC, others are willing to, it's a case by case basis... I don't think it can be used as universal advice.",

Also experiencing something you want to do before reviewing what you have mistakenly done or what you have to improve and many more. It is more like hands on first rather than just learning through reading without actually doing it. Nothing beats hands on in  a personal work which is vital in learning much faster.",

It's a fact that it's more risky for the average Joe to hold Bitcoins at home or on an exchange than fiat money at bank. Saying wallets and exchanges have been hacked but the blockchain is still uncracked doesn't mean anything for the average user.The high volatility of Bitcoin is maybe good for trading or gambling but it's bad for using Bitcoin as a mean of payment. And saying scams only happen with altcoins, never with Bitcoin is just a lie.",

This holds true for investing in Bitcoin too. There are numerous challenges, particularly during bear markets, which can occur unexpectedly.

Moreover, to say that you have to accept discomfort leads a person even more into despondency.Therefore, writing such posts with dry advice without personal intervention is simply stupid. What does it mean to limit communication with people who do not believe in you? Sometimes these people are relatives.  All motivational texts work until the first personal mistake until the advising person faces his loss.  But how he will deal with it shows his personal strength and advice from the outside, which only generalizes the situation and does lead to anything.In addition, the person who teaches self-control must have a name that can be trusted. What does your name tell us?",
