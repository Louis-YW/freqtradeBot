Or those that saved the values or there holdings in some reserved stable currency. So you can determine a dip or low and buy right there to increase your holding.I realise, it's not a time to sell, nope, not at all and to do that successfully, one have got to have some means to cash outside crypto to keep up with the bear market. That's why you shouldn't take crypto for some full time job. As it won't be easy in the bearish periods as, its a time to keep holding and invest fresh funds to maximise profit.",

I regretted not selling at the top before the great Bitcoin crash started. But thanks to my continuous gigs back then in 2018 to 2019, I’ve managed to sustain them and continuing my advocacy to spread awareness and educating the masses about Bitcoin and cryptos. I learned my lesson back then when I was still in my first year in doing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies seriously by not being driven by FOMO, never sell at a loss, never be greedy, etc.",

It all depends on the time that the bear catch up with the coin. If bitcoin goes you expect the bear in general.

It is a lesson that should be learnt that after the halving of bitcoin expect the bear correction. Back in last halving same thing happened when bitcoin price crashed from 20k to below 4k. This is playing out again and all coins crashing down.",

I hope you haven't listened too much to various influencers, because they are just looking for a sensation that will attract as many followers as possible. If cycle theory makes sense to you, then assume that after 2024 halving we can expect a new big bull run again, and the question is what will happen by then. For those who invest in the long run, this issue is not too important, because Bitcoin is quite cheap if we take into account last ATH.As for altcoins, I don't want to comment on them because this is a board for trading about Bitcoin - for everything else there is Alternate cryptocurrencies.",

I exited LUNA for instance, around $30, next day I checked it was at around $1, so that was a good move. You may think prices are low now, wait till Bitcoin hits 11K. And yes, this target is from a credible source, he's a bit of an arrogant prick but he's been in crypto since 2010 and his predictions have been on point twice before.The other thing I would do is exit your centralized exchange and learn MetaMask and DeFi. In fact, learn as much as you can about investing and crypto in general. Now that nothing is growing it's the time to prepare for the next cycle.",

It all depends on how you are prepared for a worse market scenario, even a credible trader will not speculate 100% accurately. Accumulation does not mean blindly buying at once with the remaining funds. Accumulating at several price support points will reduce the level of losses.",

And we will never know when the market will recover again so its best to sell our coins once halving is done and while the market has not turned into bearish yet. And one thing i've learned too is to secure as much profits as you want and prepare for an incoming bear season. That way, you will never struggle in buying cheap coins, and will always have all the funds to maximize your purchase when all the coins are on bargain.",

The last bear market was hard actually, that you are not profiting and just sitting back while waiting for the market to recover. This made me realized that the market will always go through its own cycles no matter what so we better lived for it. And keep the patience during bear days because its the only way you will never come into losses. And as much as possible, take time to sell your coins while their prices are at peaks, becaus when the bear season comes, you will only be buying and hodling all the time, and there are no profits coming in.",
