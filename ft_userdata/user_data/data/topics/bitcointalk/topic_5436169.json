If there is all ready developent to connect cash atm machines to USDT or other Stable coins.Generally speaking the tradional banks dont work anymore and up coming cyber attacks will only proof that the current fiat banking is weak.We not talking about CBDC by goverment control as new system we are talking here pure Stable coins such us USDT.Where do i Will invest my all wealth? It's not gold not btc not Property either ... Property is most risky Investment it's Like NFT it has no Market price fixed by exchangers so gold is much better If i have to choose.The safest Investment would be stablecoins USDT can buy soon all the world.Once all cash ATM can be connected to USDT to cash then the we Are ready all the new financial freedom and Simple and best system with fast transactions system and with best liquity.Sorry but Im out of old Fiat Banks they are old and dont just work anymore maybe revolut bank can work but other Banks really the time IS up and USDT can replace them",

      "body": "When you say that stablecoins like USDT offer advantages over traditional banking, I can see where you're coming from. On the other hand, I cannot agree with you that stablecoins are a \"great\" or \"safe\" investment. A stablecoin's value follows that of the underlying currency it is tethered to, in this case the US dollar. You are, then, merely storing a digital representation of the money you already possess. It's the same as keeping money in the bank or a savings account with a regular financial institution.There may be advantages to adopting stablecoins in terms of transaction speed and simplicity, but I wouldn't put all my money into stable coin (they are not a term of investment). Bitcoin, gold, real estate, and more alternatives exist. More money can be made using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that there is always some degree of risk involved with investing. But if you have faith in digital currency, you will be compensated",

A close example is the stable coin TerraUST which brought destruction to the development of their ecosystem even though not because it was frozen but everything has the potential to be destroyed if something goes wrong or even proven fraud, I think that can be used as an example by us not to save money in stable coins especially if you invest in it. And it is true that USDT operates on the edge of the law and is the object of investigation due to many suspicions of fraud.",

That's why and due to lack of the trust in stablecoins that's possible to rely on stablecoins, in the other hand if you consider stablecoins for huge and international trades it won't be useful for a government to use stable coins because of the market cap of these coins.",

The economic situation triggers the demand, and a meltdown in crappy economies triggers a rush to a safe haven, it's almost the same as in BTC but with a twist, while some try to escape a devaluating currency to USD, with BTC more look for gains now, not protecting their wealth. So, demand that triggers value, vs constant value that triggers demand. Quite the opposite of what one would have expected.",

The asset is issued and redeemed through the Tether.to platformTwo years ago, around fiascos of Terra (LUNA and UST stablecoin depeg and death spiral) and FTX, there were massive fear and many questions around stable coins and companies behind them. I remember that I read Tether's ToS that they can allow users to redeem or don't allow users to redeem. It's big risky term from Tether company.Redeem Tethers to fiat currency. Their guide says you only can redeem with some conditions, and the min redeem value is $100,000 which is big for most of Tether users. Hence, if you are not rich, let's assume you're unable to redeem your USDT to fiat currency.Your choice will be selling USDT to your fiat currency but generally Tether's redeem process is not accessible for all users.",

However, it's not that simple to say that this makes stablecoins the complete solution. For one, banks are adapting. Many test stablecoin technologies for their own sake, such as JPMorgan with its JPM Coin for faster cross-border transactions.But stablecoins are a growing breed, and they do come with some significant risks. Many, particularly those backed with assets such as commercial paper, can lose value during periods of market stress; that, in turn, might lead to loss of confidence and ultimately liquidity problems. Regulations around stablecoins are also tightening, so it's not that clear how long they'll operate outside of the oversight that banks are currently subject to. So, as helpful as stablecoins can be, especially within the fintech arena, the reaction at both the banking and regulatory level is one to watch. They may not be obsolete just yet. Moreover, if I have to choose a digital currency Bitcoin will be the first choice, the stablecoins are centralized not so different than Bank, except the transaction speed, other risk and issue of Bank is persist in the stablecoins.",
