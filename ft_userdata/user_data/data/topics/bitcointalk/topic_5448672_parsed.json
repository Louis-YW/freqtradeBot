  "content": "@sujonali1819 created this thread Jr BM asking for 300 positive comment in his service thread via bounty campaign\". Naturally, as a campaign manager, you would never appreciate someone getting positive reviews through a review campaign. When I checked the rules on the Service board I never found any rules for BM. As those rules were written 7 years ago I think there should be a new set of rules added for BM. What do you guys think?Otherwise, every BM can get a lot of positive comments and some might also get positive trust by abusing the board rules.",

Well, I don't think there should be a set of rules from the forum itself. Rather, let the community and default trust members handle such an issue lol. If the forum gets involved with such an issue, I think you will see a lot of accusations/complaints when something will be wrong. Feedbacks are there but it can be verified. If someone doesn't do enough home work, they don't deserve quality service either.",

Mods would delete post and nuke brand-new accounts involved in the Altcoin ANN bumping. Some threads would even get closed by Mods.Has anybody tried to report the thread and the accounts involved to the mods yet?",

Do you think a signature campaign member would be able to give negative feedback? As he/She knows that a few BM are operating around here why take a risk and question them? They will always give you good feedback and some might give you good trust feedback to get noticed. We need rules and we need those rules to be hard for BM.",

      "body": "If the main goal of these fake reviews is to scam new clients that this product is excellent and should be trusted, then trust flags will be enough to make it stop. Who would think of buying from someone and there is a big warning sign in front of topic? I donâ€™t think anyone will care about the positive feedback and ratings below when See that warning.Quote from: theymos on June 12, 2019, 03:13:36 AMA newbie-warning flag is active if there are more people supporting such a flag than opposing it. It shows a banner on topics started by the flagged user for guests and for users with less than 7 days of login time. For all users, a \"#\" is shown next to their trust scores.For contractual violations only, a scammer flag can be created. This is the only thing which causes the \"Warning: trade with extreme caution\" warning to return. It also triggers a banner similar to the newbie-warning banner which is visible to all users. A scammer flag requires 3 more supporting users than opposing users to become active.A new scammer flag should be created for each separate alleged incident. In the spirit of forgiveness/redemption, scammer flags expire 3 years after the incident if the contract was casual/implied, and 10 years after the incident if the contract was written. These expiration times might be administratively changed in specific cases.",

Naturally, as a campaign manager, you would never appreciate someone getting positive reviews through a review campaign. What @sujonali1819 said about (Jr BM) that abusing paid reviews is certainly unfair/dishonest for a BM to do this especially since they have allocated a pool of 1000 BUSD and this obviously invites a lot of spam in the thread.Quote from: elevates on April 13, 2023, 12:50:53 PMWhen I checked the rules on the Service board I never found any rules for BM. As those rules were written 7 years ago I think there should be a new set of rules added for BM. What do you guys think?I don't think it's necessary as this is optional, of course BMs who already know this they don't want to have dishonest reviews.Quote from: elevates on April 13, 2023, 12:50:53 PMOtherwise, every BM can get a lot of positive comments and some might also get positive trust by abusing the board rules. With other BM they don't abuse it, but they get positive comments and positive trust because they have collaborated with their clients so it's only natural to get that trust and not blame board rules.",

My simple brain says that they both are the same. If I consider guidelines to be the same as rules? Why guideline was not updated? Why BMs are still not accounted for their wrong choice of a project? This is just a beginning and it will hurt the forum like anything if they do not come up with a solution. Which I think won't happen anytime soon.",

It's really dumb how people come around to a forum and don't take their time to observe before starting any Strange ðŸ‘º thing that could tarnish their trust. Maybe no one would have troubled him had he just carried on the campaign for his Twitter and Telegram pages. And I also think he's not yet oriented on how to look for projects to run campaigns for.",
