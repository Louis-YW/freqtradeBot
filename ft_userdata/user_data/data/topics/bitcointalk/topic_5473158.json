For inside Bitcoin investment, if person no get good source of income (steady income) the person no go fit hold em coins for long terms because as SAPA hole am em go press the sell button and if care is not taking, the person go even fit sell all em holdings, so creating a good source of living first before investing in Bitcoin is the major thing some investors should do before investing into Bitcoin.",

Right now even getting cash gifts from people seems like a huge task cos of the economic situation. The solution is not saving cos a time will come when these savings would be needed. It's not even just mere earning, a random or low earning will still mean struggling through survival, do your best to earn big so the struggle will be less. Invest in productive businesses is also a good idea but be cautious of the investment, and do not use all the savings. Everyone is in a haste to make meaning out of life even in this hard situation, so the whole process is getting tough and challenging but one just has to scale through. It's not our fault, it's evident that our corrupt, greedy and self centered leaders are just not ready to help change the system and status of the economy but what can we actually do.",

Na so so hand to mouth I dey take survive now. It's unfortunate that we have to discuss this more than one times here but it just shows how realistic and truthful the current situation is now. Nigeria is almost bent on its knee as a result of the hardship the citizens are facing. The fuel pump is getting more expensive by the day which is the reason why commodities in the market is also following the upward trend of becoming more expensive by the day. Surprisingly none of these commodities are scars in the market or at the farm. Not even the petrol in its self that is scares. But our leaders and the bourgeois will always create an avenue to make life uneasy on the young ones . We need to arise o compatriots and come together under a single voice and character of national interest above every other personal interests we have",

If e happen say , everywhere red for you, you fit chuck hand for your investment take save your self from the current economy situation even when you know say, Bitcoin halving dey for one corner e de very funny how topics relating to the hardship in the country don become the most comfortable topic for people to easily relate with. And some lazy people go even use this whole \"the country is hard\" stuff to support there laziness and won't go out there and look for something reasonable to start there lives with.One thing we need understand for the situation of our country be say I no de even see any possibility say things go better like that anytime soon but you self fit make the decision to better your life by being intentional about your financial state and with time, if dollar like make e rise or drop, if fuel like maker e scarce or not or the price of yarn go as high as possible, e no go affect you that much.And the thing about investing into bitcoin or any other investment you de do be say you no go see say hunger de show you shege and you know say you get wetin you fit sell use sustain yourself den still allow hunger to continue making mess of you. The temptation to use your investment take hold body for the moment go come to your mind and you might not be able to resist it.What I'm saying in essence is this, regardless of the harmattan when de blow every where, make we still try find something wen we go do when go fetch us some money so our mind fit commot for our bitcoin investment.",

The height of economic hardship in the country is becoming unimaginable that you don't know where to place your hope in for a better tomorrow. Worst of it all is that the prices of goods and services are increasing 3x higher of it's previous price within the spate of every three months and the government with all the economic policies they are making we are not feeling a remedial effect.The scary gull about this hardship is how it's penetrating into all economic class in the society with scarcely any person not complaining how's things has been tough their their livelihood. The rhetoric is that if the rich and wealthy are complaining about the hardship then how's the poorest of the poor surviving in this hard times. I am trying not to imagine it.",
