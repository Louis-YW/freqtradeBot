Is there something technical that is not Worth publicly exposed/expressed?Why don't they feel the guilt of losing the affiliated clients that was to profit them as they delisted them above?Are they just realizing the inabilities, insecured and the poor possessions of the delisted industry just of recent? Or they have been on track before these days?I am curious to understand this because I leans my Bitcoins to the Binance crytop currency exchange.https://cryptopotato.com/important-binance-will-delist-the-following-cryptocurrencies-on-december-7th/",

      "body": "I doubt the delisting has anything to do with the cases they recently agreed to settle or any regulatory issues. They have a set of criteria before coins or tokens are to be delisted and they've listed it in their announcement https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-delist-bts-perl-torn-wtc-on-2023-12-07-d24dd4a035c443b1ad8cf49f60b9d194I don't know anything about these coins and tokens but the major factor is probably trade volume and further project development.",

As others said, this is probably unrelated, and I'd be guessing this is just a routine procedure of cleaning up the site from low-volume pairs. Have they only removed certain pairs or stopped supporting the listed altcoins?Nevertheless, I'd imagine they would notify users somehow before that happened, either by making an announcement somewhere on their site or by sending emails (to those subscribed).Speaking about the recent events and the settlement penalty - I don't think people comprehend how huge amount that is. They'll be paying penalties exceeding $4 billion, which is the highest in history. There must be some panic and disruptions going on in their operations, which could have some effect on their customers eventually, but I wish them all the best.",

I haven't heard news about it in several years. Waltonchain is also an old coin that had become irrelevantafter some scammy behavior. I don't know if the Tornado Cash token is associated with the mixer but Binance probably doesn't want to be associated with something that has been sanctioned by the US government. The other tokens I haven't heard of but I assume they are dying projects with very little volume.",

Other exchanges like Coinbase, Robinhood, have also delisted certain crypto currency pairs and one of the reasons they did it was due to regulatory concerns. Another reason which I think the delisting was for is due to the decline in trading of these pairs. I feel like they have become utterly useless and just both in the number of persons who hold them and trade them. Basically, the goal is to optimize the trading environment.",

Therefore, after a while, their trading volumes are very low, and the cost of running the servers to keep these currencies active is higher than the total circulation, so they are removed.

Before they got fine they were delisting tokens already and this is because of low trading volume. Binance exchange wants to make profits therefore they're removing projects that isn't giving them profits to make space for new ones.All attention will be pushed towards the new project that Binance will list during the bull market. Delisting those old coins will make their customers not to Invest in them but invest in the new tokens that'll have more hype and give Binance exchange more profits due to the high trading volume. Altcoins that don't have hype will have less trading volume and will be delisted from top exchanges. Other centralized exchange are delisting altcoins too that have low volume.",
