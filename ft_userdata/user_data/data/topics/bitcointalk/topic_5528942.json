  "content": "Bitcoiners don't want anything else than grow the amount of bitcoins they have. Best way to do that is by selling bitcoin at the bullseason top and then buying at the bear season bottom. Best way to do that is buy exchanging to a stablecoin and that strategy has worked mostly great for most bitcoiners.But this time it could be different! Anything I say is not financial advice.MICA law in EU has banned all stablecoins that matter except USDC. They are clearly herding us like sheep to USDC. USDC is centralized and have the power to freeze all our USDC even if they are in non-custodial wallets. MICA law also requires KYC on everyone. Maybe their plan is to herd us into buying USDC at the bull season top then they will freeze all USDC and tell us to go to a gov website to do KYC and AML checks. If you don't it will remain frozen and if you can't prove where your crypto comes from because you used coinjoin or something else then they will tell you to let them confiscate it all or else go to prison. That is my theory of what could happen in 2026.But this is great news because that means maybe this time most people will not sell their bitcoin at the top. Now is the time to start hodling permanently, now is the time to forget about the 4 year cycles and bull/bear seasons, now is the time to never again sell bitcoin.",

      "body": "Your theory is extremely interesting, and is so because it's actually a very strong probability that MICA would conduct something like what you mentioned in the second half of the thread. Maybe this is a message to be spread - selling your bitcoin for stablecoins could lead to limitations down the line. I already knew USDC/Circle USD had the ability to freeze, I haven't seen it quite in action yet, though I could see it being used in a situation like you described in 2026. Even generally, 2025-26 is going to be an extremely interesting period. I foresee unlike anything we've ever seen before (hopefully for the better).",

Your conspiracy should be work in the next super cycle where holders will think to not sell their coins.Or this could be a rise of no KYC exchange/DEX...",
