Remember e-gold/HYIPs? (RIP<3) Yeah stop doing this. Create a business and have a coin just to have a coin if you want to, that is just what the stock market does. The crypto verse is no different and who is anyone to tell you otherwise? Crypto is on your side.Crypto and most importantly Bitcoin has shown us the stock market can be just as much a joke and bad investment as anything else no matter how regulated you make it.Binance is ahead having its own token and blockchain. I wish coinbase would follow suit leaving the stock market functions behind. The other exchanges are looking like something from the distant past, designed to confuse users and full of bugs.Maybe Elon Musk will take doge to mars. Bitcoin will stay the heart of crypto because as long as people can transact value/communication between eachother without governments saying no, it will never die and won't go down without defending itself.Crypto operates easily even in China for those who know how to truely utilize defi functions. Western nations will continue to fully support crypto and Starlink might be used to send some doge.Crypto truely is the people no matter how hard anyone trys to demonize it. Demonize yourself regulators.",

If I remember correctly, mt.gox collapse led bitcoin to test ~$180 by January 2015 and in November 2022, around FTX collapse, we tested ~$16k levels. I call these price levels as real value of bitcoin as there were enough buyers around those levels for not letting down bitcoin falling further.In next 8 years, we may see many exchanges come and go but when bitcoiners start believing into the concept of decentralization and ignoring centralized services then we can prevent another incident of influence of collapse of an exchange or any other similar centralized service provider.All centralized services are prone to collapse as they are built and managed by few people and people are known for malfunctions for any reason. Until we let centralized service providers to grow giants, their collapse will influence bitcoin market for sure.Diversify your centralized service needs to ensure less influence of them into bitcoin markets.",

My point is if inflation had arrived in 2021 during Bitcoin's bull market, I'm sure most (including myself) would of wrongly claimed that inflation is good for Bitcoin, while now many still hold the belief that inflation is bad for Bitcoin, whereas as I stated Bitcoin has performed much better than previous bear markets without inflation and other factors - at least so far and based on the theory that the bottom is now in.I think we will only know if all or any of these factors above are \"bad\" for Bitcoin will be price drops lower (in % terms) than usual, which would be <$12K, which remains to be seen. If the perma bears are correct and we will go into a global recession in 2023 and see Bitcoin make new lows beyond the \"usual\", then sure we can probably say that inflation/recession is bad for Bitcoin. It's not that I'm saying that certain events, whether it be hedge fund liquidations or other global economic factors doesn't have an affect on Bitcoin's price, but I only really see it accelerating in the short-term where Bitcoin price will end up eventually, ie where price was going to reach by the end of the bear market anyway. Without certain events price could have held $30K until November before dropping to $15K for example.",

Baring in mind there is a logical reason why markets fall during a recession, it's not just people liquidating assets to survive, it's that people are spending/buying less, there is no longer economic growth and therefore most markets won't grow either and neither will their share prices. With 50% of global wealth concentrated to 1-5% of the population who aren't seriously affected by recession (when it comes to cost of living etc), then half the sellers come from those minimising inevitable losses.So in this sense, half will be selling due to cost of living crisis (inflation), the other half would be selling due to declining investment values (recession). But obviously this is dependant on those investments actually declining, otherwise there wouldn't be a reason to sell in order to preserve wealth. For example Gold rises during a recession, or at least has in the past, but I don't believe this comes from 95-99% of the population suffering from inflation, but the 1-5% who can afford to invest in Gold who are experiencing a lack of wealth increase due to recession, ie mainly institutions. The reality is Bitcoin isn't disconnected from these wealth distributions either, with around 2% owning around 93% of all coins, or 0.36% owning over 80% even (which is an enormous difference compared to 1% owning 50%), and this doesn't even factor in that many will own multiple accounts either, so the split is probably more likely around 1% of individuals owning 95% of the coins imo. At the moment, this wealth distribution probably has more upside than downside right now.My rambling point is I don't believe that Bitcoin is dependant on economic growth for it's own increase in value, just like Gold. Because it's value is based on scarcity, not on economic growth. It's only fundamental weakness imo would be for example increased energy costs and seeing a 80-90% correction in hash rate, that would certainly have the affects of continued downside price action, with more miners selling and mining companies going bankrupt etc, creating too much supply and not enough demand. But for all we know while 93% of the population are somewhat forced into selling due to inflation, the other 7% could well be buying more than usual causing the price to increase, especially if it becomes \"immune\" from recession in other markets, ie de-correlates (again) and instead correlates with Gold, as a genuine inflation hedge.Either way I think by the end of the year things will become clearer if recession is to take hold. This year (the year after a 1 year bear market) is supposed to be a recovery year, whether that be going back to the upside (like 2019) or consolidating sideways (like 2015). So either the 4-year cycle will remain in tact, or Bitcoin will be negatively affected by a recession and prices will continue to decline.But for now, given Bitcoin has acted more or less \"as expected\" in 2022 irrespective of inflation, ie a 1 year bear market after it's bull market, call me naive, but I still think it's too early to tell.",

I'm saying that these things are not the ONLY reason for dumps.Even your zoom in this picture showing the dumps is isolated since the dumps started from November 2021 from $69k not 6 months later in May 2022 from $40k.Some other events during the same period are:- Russian invasion of Ukraine- Increased inflation in US and Europe and pretty much everywhere else- Euro/USD exchange rate dumping hard for the first time in years- Increased interest rates- Recession- Food scarcity crisis when the export of grains halted globally for a while- Energy crisis- Other markets like stock crumbling down (eg. in first week of June which is Celsius on your chart, S&P500 dumped 11%)- Introduction of a New World Order- ... a lot more that has been affecting the global economy in a negative way hence affecting bitcoin price also.No offence, but it seems you are listing a lot of relatively isolated events to support the argument of Bitcoin's dumping -77.5% from it's highs in 2022. The irony being that in 2014 as well as 2018 Bitcoin dropped -83% from it's highs, so in reality Bitcoin has performed better (so far) within the 2022 bear market than in previous ones, given Bitcoin's bear markets remain part of a 4-year cycle. My point is if inflation had arrived in 2021 during Bitcoin's bull market, I'm sure most (including myself) would of wrongly claimed that inflation is good for Bitcoin, while now many still hold the belief that inflation is bad for Bitcoin, whereas as I stated Bitcoin has performed much better than previous bear markets without inflation and other factors - at least so far and based on the theory that the bottom is now in.I think we will only know if all or any of these factors above are \"bad\" for Bitcoin will be price drops lower (in % terms) than usual, which would be <$12K, which remains to be seen. If the perma bears are correct and we will go into a global recession in 2023 and see Bitcoin make new lows beyond the \"usual\", then sure we can probably say that inflation/recession is bad for Bitcoin. It's not that I'm saying that certain events, whether it be hedge fund liquidations or other global economic factors doesn't have an affect on Bitcoin's price, but I only really see it accelerating in the short-term where Bitcoin price will end up eventually, ie where price was going to reach by the end of the bear market anyway. Without certain events price could have held $30K until November before dropping to $15K for example.EVERYTHING effects the markets. It only becomes obvious once you look back, but not duringYou clearly did not look at the charts at all. No offense but your just full of it.",
