That's the problem with desperate people during this period, they always want to believe in the things that are widely too good to true and that's the whole issue. This is the period when scammers know that people will be crazy to acquire some riches due to the wild spread news of advantages that are open in the crypto space and also because the crypto market has started showing sign of bullish trend so everyone should be cautious and watchful of their greed because they are vulture waiting to prey on their weakness of wanting to get easy passage to wealth and quick profits.",

If you mean crypto investment, then first investigate the investment opportunity, find the project team behind. So here a critical approach when exploring profits and promises of high percentages is very important to analyze. Don't immediately target to become rich, if I get a little profit from me it's worth it.",

Those kinds of people are what scammers are looking for. Here in my country, from the 4th month approaching to the end of the year, what you will come across is all this get rich quick scheme. The same way someone who is greedy is looking for a way to get it real quick in a shot cut, so are those who are also looking for a way to make it and flex the end of the year big while also drawing their own plans. That's why you see all this scam project scheme bumping up from September to December and those who also want to make it fall for such. But one thing most people need to know is that what you were not able to acquire for the past 8 months, is it at the end of the year that you will get that rich? There are possibilities of breakthrough in a short period of time, but not in the way they are always chasing after a money-doubling platform, which they end up losing the little they have.",

Actually, the scammers use that method - that's all, but why are so many people still getting scammed? In fact, in my experience, it's not just beginners who get it, even those who have been in crypto for a long time still get it. Is it true that greed can close our logical thinking? even though usually what scammers laugh at is below market prices, profits of hundreds of percent, and other gold glitter. But why.",

A lot of people forgot that due diligence is important at all. One should always remember how to study and give some deep search on the details ot be able to know if they are joining a legit one or have potential to grow projects. Scammers are with us and o one can stop them from doing that. So we ourselves just make sure to have protection to these kind of people.",

Greed and lost for filthy wealth is what is driving more people to be scammed always. There is a way human mind functions that if you don’t control that greed level, you will always fall victim in hands of scammers and projects they bring to scam people. Before investing, know what you’re putting your money into, calculate the risk involved and be careful when making a quick decision so that you don’t miss out. Most fear of missing out always end in regrets. So take your time to analyse the project, its advantage and disadvantages before putting your money into it.",

Indeed, all that shine is not gold, you are talking about phishing attacks and I agree with you that on events like Christmas, Halloween, etc. scammers will try to spread as many phishing links as they can. You might can receive an email from any airdrop that you might have joined a few times back or maybe not joined, but that email will have a Christmas theme and will be saying \"You won this prize to claim it click on the link and verify it\" etc. These types of email scams are so common at Christmas and people are in emotion feeling so happy and ignorant that they mostly wear off the thoughts that there is a term scam and we have to avoid it. Scammers are utilizing this emotion of people, mostly of old people because they know this is the right time for grandparents to scam them, as most of the grandparents save money for their grandchild to buy them gifts but when they click on some link send them via email that if they buy this one product they will get 100% discount 50% discount, etc. And they fell for it.",

I think we can't stressed that enough, we have seen lot of forms and shapes of scam in crypto, impersonations for one like in Twitter, or too good to be true offer like luring you to a investment that will give you huge returns and others.The best weapon against this scam is to really educate our selves. This should be the first thing that we should learn when we get ourselves involved in crypto. I myself was a victims of such scams as well in the beginning, I don't know if you heard about \"bitcoin doubler\" before. But when I enter crypto space it is one of the most rampant scams being run but I was gullible as a newbie and like the rest of those who have been a victims, attracted to the huge % that is supposedly be your profits without doing anything in your end. So it's a big lessons for me and I was glad that it did happen early. Now I equip myself with knowledge and promise not to fall for any scams in the future.",

I just hope that these newbies and beginners would understand that getting rich is not about cutting corners- it is all about hard work.If getting rich were that easy, then every cryptocurrency investor would be rich by now. This is the reason on why some fail as an investor and they have nothing to blame but themselves for falling into this very obvious trap that scammers built.Lastly, if something is really good to be true, then doubt it. Prevention is better than cure- stay away from offers that look very attractive as they are most likely involved in a shady scheme that may left you in danger.",

That's why they always end up being scammed. Scammers are always taking advantage of people's desperation, and they believe the only way people can fall for their lies is by offering them quick money, making them believe they can make the money they haven't made since the beginning of the year, they will be making it within the few weeks left until the end of the year, and they do promise them zero risk being involved. Whenever people who are really in need of money see things like this, they easily believe them and follow what the scammer asks them to do.Whenever you are into anything, we shouldn't talk about crypto alone. If you are being promised a high reward for an investment, then it's better you do more research on it, because if you don't do more research, you are likely to fall victim.
