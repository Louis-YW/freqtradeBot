Unbeknownst to me, until after the 3rd deposit was complete. So at this point she has deposited .032 BTC into her account there and came to me because she can't move or do anything else with it. I have emailed support,and used the chat function.with no solutions. I googled them and can't find any direct complaints or problems.They are associated with Payward somehow. I don't know how else to go about getting our money back out to use for its original purpose(Rent).Are we screwed?Has anyone heard of them?Are there methods I am missing to try and reclaim our money,or the coin associated?Any comments,questions, or help are appreciated.Mahalo in advance for any and all help",

If after depositing on that platform, the money you put in cannot be moved, and you don't see anyone who can report such an issue to   the exchange you chose, it is obvious that you made a wrong decision to invest money. There are so many other exchange platforms that are   known for cryptocurrency, I wonder why you chose that as the source of your money. Here it seems like you showed that you just put money   in without knowing what you are going to put in. It's a bit of a lesson that happened to you and I hope you learn from this matter.QuoteHas anyone heard of them?- honestly, I just heard and found out about that now, because if that exchange platform was popular, it would have been the noise in the   world of cryptocurrency, but it is not like that in the reality that it happened months and years ago.QuoteAre there methods I am missing to try and reclaim our money,or the coin associated?- If a few days have passed and there is still no reply of the answers to the issue you faced on their platform, it only means one thing, which   is to accept it, you will have a hard time withdrawing the money you first entered in that exchange, but I hope you can release it.",

There ought to be cross fertilization of ideas between a couple on major issues such as finance and upkeep. Now, back to the site; it's an obvious investment gone wrong example. The cash fell into wrong hand and I don't think it can be retrieved. That's gone. It's a shoddy site.",

Your wife used money that she could not afford to lose, as that money was supposed to be for rent, she did not do her due diligence, tried to trade because she thought she could get some free money, probably knows nothing about trading, followed the referral code of someone else and finally put her money in a website almost no one has heard about and that looks like a scam, so I hope you recover your money but things do not look good for you.",

      "body": "It's a very popular scam right now.... Scammers DM their victims about how successful they are as a trader and later on offers help. The catch is victims will be redirected to some no one has ever heard website, similar to you. They will try to loosen up their victims by saying \"you can always start with small amounts\". That being said, few trades will work until the victim does a big enough deposit for the scammer to freeze their account. You might get asked to pay more money to them in order to get your funds out, please don't.",

They do the research after they've invested in a so to say, putting the cart before the horse, manner of approach. It wouldn't take anyone more than 30 minutes going through that site to discover it's a scam site. Laziness is the bane of many investors, truly. Like I noted in my previous comment, the wife didn't act in good faith also not letting OP know she was investing in something so that both of them would've looked at it together. Two heads are better than one. Couples shouldn't be keeping investment secrets.",
