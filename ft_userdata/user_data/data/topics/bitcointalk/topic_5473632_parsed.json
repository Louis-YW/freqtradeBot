Even now that the price has gotten to this level, everyone has a target. Some people's target is for them to see bitcoin at a particular price before they can move to sell. Some targets are to accumulate a certain number of bitcoins within a certain period of time. We all buy for different purposes. In short, we should not be swayed by the current price of Bitcoin and recommend that our relatives or friends invest in it. Just because the price is high now doesn't mean it will continue to rise in the coming weeks. If the price drops below what they bought it for and they're disappointed, that's not a good outcome. The best strategy is to increase the dollar-cost average (DCA) over time, and they should have started doing that earlier if they could. While we can't predict exactly when Bitcoin's next all-time high will be, it's certain that the price will drop before the next pump.",

If they do not have enough money, they can DCA if they are salary earners. But if they have enough money and they want to invest, they can DCA or they can buy big. If bitcoin price will fall, it is an unrealized loss as 1 BTC equals to 1 BTC. United States SEC is closer to approve bitcoin spot ETF which could likely increase the price to over $40000. If bitcoin price fall, no disappointment if you can wait for like a year or two when bitcoin price would have increased significantly and likely reached six digits.",

Thus, they spread the news of failure in crypto and remember  a news can't be same as reaching millions of people  compared  to its original source, then , you will hear them saying  Bitcoin is a scam",

If you are still waiting for the price to come down you’ll be missing on buying it this low. The price is currently in a stage of bullish form and there’s no sign of it coming down now. Bitcoin has been envisioned by many analysts that it will exit six figures after the nest bull run. The price is not even yet $50K, so buying now is still a very good time if you’re going to be holding for long till after bull run",

This is even enough for you for you to get in before it pumps.Make your research. Learn more and get into it ASAPI see enough reasons of buying bitcoin now, anyone that is still doubting if bitcoin will drop is thinking otherwise. Bitcoin was at ATH of $69 as at last bullrun and falls down below $20k to $15 earlier this year I think BTC is trying to recover it's lost Glory, and it might surprise us by not falling below $30k or $36 this time. This price you guys are seeing now might be the last time you might see BTC to be low compared to the upcoming amount. Since BTC bullrun is always a four year circle, I think whosoever that has money should try it's Best to buy now an never have a second thought that BTC might fall below again because this might be the last time you will see bitcoin to be low. You might still regret that I had the opportunity to buy it when it was as low as $36k. If Bitcoin is soaring to climb $110000 like as @charls Tim said by analysis, not only did he said there are other evidences to prove that Bitcoin might still hit $1million in the future so no need to be afraid.",

There is still enough room to buy Bitcoin because Bitcoin halve never happens, and even though the Bitcoin halve takes place next year, from the history of Bitcoin setting a new all-time high it will take Bitcoin like six months after halve to set another record of ATH.
