Still, you did not provide even a single proof in the current claim as what you did last December. As far as I know dinabot is a trusted 3rd party exchange in Stake and Primedice, I have never seen any significant issue with this bot, if this bot is scam, Stake/Primedice (no longer available in PD) should have blocked their account so players wont have any chance to use the service.

Initially thought it was a bot which allowed people to exchange casino money for other coins outside the casino (I am not sure whether that goes against the ToS or not, by the way)A bit weird that you do not know about this service while this service is currently available in the casino you promote in your signature. This bot has been operating for over 2 years if I remember it correctly. This is just a bot to exchange your coin in Stake to other coins. Lets say you have btc and you want to exchange it to tron because you want withdraw from stake with lower fee, you can use this service. In simple procedure, you tip your btc to dinabot account then dinabot account will send you the tron in your stake account.",

It’s an exchange bot that makes user swap their coins to other coin within their casino account. I on,y saw this bot operating on Primedice before when I’m still active in there.OP’s sentiment is probably just his assumption on what the bot doing on his money since they are within the exchange. This bot is operating for a long time without any problem in fact they doesn’t have any benefit on scamming small fish since they have a lot of customers on the primedice that switching their coins.",

I visited the site and found it very annoying with just few elements and nothing special. The owners are so lazy that they haven't even written good Faqs for the site. I would personally never trust such site to deposit my coins for the purpose of swapping. Instead of this you could easily use any decentralized exchange to swap your coins without much worries. First, you should try to contact their customer support like @Webetcoins said, and when you get no reply or any kind of help from their customer support team then only you should create a scam accusation against the site with proper proofs in the form of screenshots or screen recordings.",
