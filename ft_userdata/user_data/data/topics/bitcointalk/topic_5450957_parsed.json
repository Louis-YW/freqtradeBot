I know AliExpress stopped doing so (not sure of the reason) so it would probably be best to try and find a WMZ -> BTC exchange (or individual to deal with) first.",

So if you are getting 20$ from your client you have to ask him to send around $4.61 dollars more. If you could mention your region and how you are going to withdraw your money from Web money.As i used it for Adsterra to get my payment and to convert the received money into pkr, the exchange rate was too low and i was losing around 40% out of my capital. I hope you got my point so, be careful and calculate your final output after all transactions so you would avoid loss.",

I am quite nervous when I have to use something new, sometimes there will be payment problems like Paypal, it is very disturbing so I need your advice.Webmoney is a Russian company with a payment gateway solution that is topnotch, its rivalry with Perfectmoney lingered for years after the US government took down the popular Libertyreserve over a decade ago. At some point, you would hardly see a retail broker that doesn't accept Webmoney for deposit and withdrawal. All these happens until cryptocurrency came on board and reduced its popularity.These expressions are to tell you that Webmoney is not new and was indeed popular. Nonetheless, it's still in use, but you might find it difficult to exchange it for your local currency if it's not popular in your country. Local exchangers are scarce for it these days in most countries.Alternatively, you may use the service of https://www.bestchange.com to convert it to crypto, but be ready to part ways with a higher fee. Also, if you have a trusted person in Russia, you can send your Webmoney, and such will send you crypto (most reasonable for value).",

Yeah, there were some minor issues, like navigating the website and getting used to the interface, but nothing too major.I think the main thing to keep in mind is to double-check all the transaction details before confirming, just like with any other payment platform. If you ever run into any issues or have questions, their customer support is pretty responsive, at least in my experience. Just be cautious, as you would with any payment method, and you should be fine.",
