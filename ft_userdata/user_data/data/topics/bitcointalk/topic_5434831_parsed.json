  "content": "I have been gambling since the age of 21 (now 31).I place the majority of my bets with Sportsbet who are the largest online bookmaker in Australia.Between June 2022 and November 2022 I turned over $1.344M and over $961k in August 2022 alone.I was at the pub today with a few friends and they all received $100 bonus bets and I received nothing.They each turned over less than $500 in the month of December 2022 and $300 in the month of January 2023.I turned over $200k in December 2022 and already $88k in January 2023 so I called to ask why I haven't received any bonus promotions after spending a lot of money and the answer given was because I have a winning position against Sportsbet in the last 12 months.This has left me VERY angry and proved to me there is no loyalty amongst these gambling companies regardless of how much money you spend.I have decided to permanently close my account on 30/01/2023. The reason for this date is because I have a six figure NFL bet (Kansas City Chiefs to win their conference) which is playing on the 29/01/2023.I am writing this to remind you guys that these greedy companies have ZERO loyalty or respect for their players and to never forget that. Make sure you have accounts with different sportsbooks and don't be afraid to look around for better offers.A friend of mine has introduced me to his sportsbook and I will be signing up with them ASAP. He bets between $10,000-$20,000 a month and has received very generous bonus offers for the last 18 months straight.I have posted my activity statement ending in November 2022 and will upload more when I have the time to access them.If you look at the bottom it will you show you my monthly stakes from June 2022 - November 2022.https://imgur.com/a/gFB14gl",

I remember our boxing chats too Unfortunately this is sportsbet.com not sportsbet.io (which is on this forum). I thought they were the same company up until a few weeks ago.I am most definitely a whale but I only gamble what I can afford to lose.I don't understand why these companies can't be very generous to customers and offer the highest RTP to players. They would still make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits but they are greedy and want to suck every dollar out of you.",
