I understand the technological limitations of this and I don't see how this is possible, but I've seen things being implemented that at first seemed impossible. Would it be possible to establish an option that sets a safe amount of blocks and keep this threshold of blocks and download and delete as you go?Of course being a purist myself I only consider doing real Bitcoin with a full downloaded blockchain, I don't even enable pruned mode, but I was wondering if this is something someone is actively researching at all.",

That way you limit the disk space needed and still your wallet is fully functional. That kind of configuration could be replaced by SPV wallet, but using Core you verify blocks yourself and you do not need to rely on 3rd pary solution.",

Pruning is very useful for those who know what they're doing, but, on the other hand, it gives (wild) ideas to people who have missed or misunderstood the \"don't trust, verify\" part of bitcoin's blockchain.Quote from: takuma sato on October 12, 2022, 04:09:08 AMWhat I mean by this is that, instead of needing to download the whole blockchain before you can enable the pruned nodeAfaik, you can enable pruning also before starting IBD. However, this doesn't means you won't download the whole blockchain, you will still download it all. And if you have an old wallet and forgot to put it in place before the sync (in pruned mode), you may need to download the whole blockchain again for the new wallet. Of course, only a small part will be stored; but is DaveF said, storage is cheap; even internet may go cheap, but our time usually isn't.",

A Bitcoin user's priority should be to protect himself against surveillance and keep his money safe. Helping the network bandwidth-wise is secondary.This is from an individual perspective, because Comcast/Spectrum/Three/<household ISP> limit upload speed and capacity so thoroughly that it becomes impossible for people to complete verification in a reasonable time (a few days to a week or two).The network as a whole does not benefit from reduced bandwidth usage, it's those who run nodes from their house who stand to gain from such a reduction in bandwidth.Let's not forget that for IBD, the network usage is proportional to the blockchain aka. disk size. This is where I'd think alternate clients would come in handy as I don't see Core ever implementing this.

Businesses and offices, and any other entity that uses bitcoin should be running one (preferably non-pruned). Academia can run a node for any purpose, whether financial, educational, or experimental. But my point is running a node by using computers not \"officially\" supposed to run a node. If a rebellious school university employee secretly installed Bitcoin nodes in the computers at work for example. I believe pruned nodes will be quite useful for that. I know it's a bad example, but you get the point. It helps the network to give users the option how much disk space they want to allocate for their nodes.",
