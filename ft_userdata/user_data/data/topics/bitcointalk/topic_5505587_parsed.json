People perceive things differently and when in 21st century we still have people who believe that earth is flat we can't really expect much from humanity about more complex and less common topics such as Bitcoin.QuoteThere even might be people in this forum who have similar misconceptions, the question is how do we tackle this misconceptions?First we have to educate ourselves so that we actually know how Bitcoin works then we can explain it to them kindly if they were interested in learning about it. If they are not interested, then just move on. It is not our responsibility to educate others.",

It amazes me every time, regardless of how often I explain it to them that bitcoin is divisible enough, making it possible that you buy $1 worth of it if you want. To that they say that it would look silly if they owned only 0.00001 BTC or something like that. Sadly, there is no helping some people.",

You can say that misconceptions about bitcoin can start from newbies and end when they have enough knowledge about what bitcoin is, but there is no need to mention market manipulators because it has nothing to do with this thread at all.  Market manipulators can have good knowledge about bitcoin. Even they will likely have enough knowledge about bitcoin and how to manipulate the altcoins (low market cap coins) market.",

There are people who when the price of Bitcoin was under $100 said it was going to go to 0 and they are still saying it. Don't tell people there is a gold mine, you better grab a pick and shovel. I totally agree with all you said here, because it's mostly those that have no knowledge of Bitcoin and all it entails that mostly thinks that way, and saying so because I have been in such space before, when I was totally misinformed about Bitcoin and how it works, I stayed away from it completely because I initially thought that it was one of the new ponzi scheme out there after MMM, because in my country, during that time that MMM went away with people hard earned money, that was when I heard of Bitcoin, I thought that is one of this Ponzi scheme  just as MMM, because that's what almost everyone sees it as at then, but with time, I  started getting the right information about Bitcoin and I started feeling regret that I missed the opportunity to acquire it when it was a lot cheaper, so in essence of what am trying to say is that, it's most newbies or completely novice just as you rightfully said  wether in this forum or not that takes Bitcoin as such, base on what they were told.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and that's why there is no central authority that is controlling and can control it. It's no doubt that whoever has the most holdings of Bitcoin can manipulate a bit the market but soon, it will stabilize on its own. And for the miners, the hash power of it is said to be that whoever has it can also control the network. But how are and are they controlling it? it's even the opposite that many quit mining because they can't handle the difficulty of hash rate anymore. I'd say that one misconception about Bitcoin is that it will make someone rich overnight.",

All these set of people can be classified as a combination of ignorant people and haters.  It's deficult for someone that has been in the Bitcoin system to still hold on to such claim that Bitcoin is being controlled by a single entity. If that's true then I would be very much interested to know who those entities are.One major misconception a lot of people though mostly newbies still don't want to let go of is this get rich quick thought that they attribute to Bitcoin which makes them think that holding Bitcoin for a long period of time will automatically translates to them becoming rich. It's a strange and false concept but I guess that's what being a newbie allows you to. You get to assume so many things and get a lot of narrative wrong but with time you eventually come to terms with what's really true and that's when you've actually grown enough as a full blown Bitcoinner.",
