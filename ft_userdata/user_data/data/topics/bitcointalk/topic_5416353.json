If you do make a mistake here, the mods can move your thread to the one they feel is a better fit.For when; at the time you have something to contribute to at least one other forum member, or have some question or inquiry to get clarity on.It helps to use the forum search option to confirm if there is previous discssioons on that topic, that would guide what content you include, or if you go ahead to make the post at all.",

That happened a few years ago.I hope that this will not be the case with the OP and that he will soon become much more active on this forum.He started in a very good way, asking for advice and help, so I sincerely hope that he will soon become an active member of our forum community.

Don't see the forum as a place with many rules that is so hard to keep, the forum is not as hard you think.

Never plagiarize. The forum is very strict on that. Most other rules are more or less up for discussion, but the plagiarism rule isn't. It's better to add one link too many from the sources you got your information from then not adding any at all.   Quote from: Nwada001 on October 13, 2022, 12:49:40 AMonly having issue on how to add image and add links to comments like i have come across in many thread... The images you add now won't become visible while you are a newbie. When you rank up to Jr. Member at least, you will be allowed to post them freely. The ones from your past posts will also become visible. There is a workaround to that and that's buying a copper membership.
