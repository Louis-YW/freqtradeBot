  "content": "Aside from typical bounty campaign and airdrop. Now the hype change to incentivized testnets. There are some projects who are testing out their platform and able to give some free token during launch. Actually this isnt new anymore as it being done in the past. Gonna share some of the projects  Ive done on testing. Dont have tokens and the task are not too hard but some are long process.This is also a risk approach. We dont know whether they are really gotta give up some tokens so my advice is use all dummy accounts for this. Like dummy wallet or any email in case they ask for one. We dont want to compromise our wallets with asset. Not a financial advise but if you want to try then feel free to search on your own. Sharing below the list of the projects Ive done the task with for possible testnet rewards.Incentivized testnet projects. 1. Sei network - ✅ 2. Jump protocol - ✅ 3. Prime protocol - ✅4. Diva Protocol - ✅ 5. 1kx Protocol - ✅6. Dotbit domain - ✅7. Zetachain - ✅ 8. Harbor Protocol - ✅9. Mintsquare - ✅10. Shardeum - ✅ 11. Ragnar Protocol - ✅12. Deepwaterxyz - ✅13. Argo Protocol - ✅14. Sisu Network - ✅15. Swapped Finance - ✅16. Commodo Finance - ✅There are more but I not doing some that I feel not worth my time and looks very scam. DISCLAIMER:Not affiliated on any of these projects. Just sharing here in case you are looking for a reward task like bounty and airdrop. Im not confident too if there possible scam to that but I checked their social and details and looks good. But of course its always better to be cautious so like I said only used new wallets or dummy email accounts or any important things not to connect with for these kind of tasks rewards thing.",

But I am indeed searching for others which can also give good rewards like aptos project.Maybe sui network, arbtirum and zksync.

Offering skills like managing a campaign or any related crypto works that use the skill is somewhat also a good idea. However, with the strong competition we've seen and a lot of members who are offering such services, it is difficult for beginners to take that offer, and those who have a long experience and good portfolio will able to get the opportunity.",

I get this to support my argument https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/aptos-sui-reportI do believe sui will be listed on binance and FTX at the launch of token. As far as i know there are not airdrop task for next phase of incentivized testnet. I have been running validator for sui (devnet). The next phase will be started in the next weeks.",

Maybe no one is selling at ATH, but yesterday's price hovering around 10$/APT is not a small amount. These are huge rewards, bigger than any current bounty or airdrop campaign. Testnet is not new but a lot of people still doubt about it and don't believe in it, until Aptos makes a difference and now people start flocking to testnet.",

I am not sure how it is done and who is allowed to do it but is it possible for non technical backgrounds to fulfil their requirements and get paid for it? Like I might be able to spare lot of time for such project. But I’m not sure what does test net is? Do we have to check something related to their coding and stuff? If that’s it then I am out of competition already. Lolz. I have also seen few people asking for testnet coins which means it needs additional investment to buy these so test coins and then the real stuff starts right?",

All I can say is that apart from bounty campaigns and airdrops, crypto trading is one of the main ways for us to earn cryptocurrency. And in addition to this, for beginners, the crypto faucets can also generate free altcoins that are only a small amount that some can get. And the third is playing of crypto gambling, where others gamble here because they dare to get their luck, that's why the risk of entering here is quite high.And if you have other skills that you can offer such as making avatars, signature banners, and so on, you can also offer your services here on the forum platform that you can see with other members here.",

After APT created the testnet wave, people are turning to the Suinetwork project, but this makes Sui's discord as well as the testnet faucet encounter too much traffic making it trouble. They have announced that they have no plans for any airdrop yet, with this information I believe many will give up but I will continue to pursue Sui's testnet. I also joined the aptos testnet, it's really hard to make a profit during this bear season but the testnet has given me a considerable profit.",

Based on what I've read, huge profit could be earned from it but I guess it still needs knowledge and skills which is actually important for projects that aim for success. It will surely require time and effort but those who are planning to join this type of project need to be skeptical because scams and fake projects are still everywhere. There will be no problem here if you use a new wallet address when you join, and I believe that this won't be a problem at all. This is simply a form of testing the products of a project and most of us use those tokens with no actual value for practice.It's surprising to see that most people don't know about testnet or retroactive, for me it's quite popular and known since 2021. I have seen a lot of people who have earned great rewards either from the testnet or from retroactive. It's not like airdrop spam, testnet requires you to work hard and take the time to experience the product seriously and give feedback to the development team. This not only gives us income but also helps us to improve our knowledge of the market.",

I remember I also got 400 UNI upon using them while they were not releasing a token yet.This is a risky approach though and will cost a transaction fee which is unsure whether they really will give away tokens. But this is a sign of a near bull market because during the time of UNI, its where coins are also retracing back to high support levels.",

For example I participated in one: Network Name: Rinkeby Test Network, which they provided a faucet for the gas fee, and promised to pay each participant 1 Venice token, as the reward for the airdrop, which they did pay. I think the test may still come as airdrop, it all depends on the project view. Basically, testnets are not as popular as the usual airdrops, but IMO, it could be a new area to look into for better possible rewards when compared to the usual airdrop tasks.",
