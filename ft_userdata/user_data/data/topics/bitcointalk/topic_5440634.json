The main reason to change the username was his legal name was visible to others. So it seems like it is now clear that theymos started giving importance to ppl's privacy and anonymity whether the person is a brand new account or not.Im really impressed (and a bit shocked as well) by this activity. This was the first newbie (atleast in my eyes) who successfully got a name change in this forum. Have anyone seen such a username change scenario before ? I even know that reputed members have to DM theymos again and again to get a name change after a long waiting time",

I know the reason behind this because privacy reason, but I don't find his old username, so I think it's safe to share and let you know if deleting an existing account is still possible.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5360539.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5360159.0",

It’s a shock especially when only a handful of persons have been able to get admin to change their username. The only thing that beats this is when Cryptovator changed his name twice in one year.  The privacy issue of this youngster using his real name to register is of great importance, hence there was a need to change his name. This user is just sixteen and seems to be showing commendable interest in Bitcoin, he needs to be encouraged. One of the features of a successful leader is the ability to groom successors, I think Theymos might be looking in this direction. His former nameee was wonderful, but this one, I am just speechless.",
