      "body": "The only way out ,is for Nigerians to vote in a good president that can change the corrupt political system. Someone who will welcome new innovations, fix up our refineries, so that we can start refining our crude in the country. Also working on abandoned natural resources that can help boost the country economy than focusing on crude oil alone. Nigeria problems are so big that corruption has caused, due to the greed of every individual in Nigeria including myself.",

      "body": "Yes is true my brother I agree with you. Nigeria can only get a good President by we voting the right person. But the problem now is that corruption everywhere. Our politicians will be using their money to influence on the youths by buying our mind. And when they win they will do whatever they want because they will say they paid for it. I urge my fellow Nigerians. my fellow youths. To vote wisely this time around nobody should receive them with their so-called wealth",
