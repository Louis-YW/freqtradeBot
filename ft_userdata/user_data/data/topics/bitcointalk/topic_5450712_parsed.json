  "content": "Today I came across a few advertisements on Instagram (I am sure they would appear on Facebook too) that promise a program can find lost/forgotten cryptocurrency wallets. For me, that was a red flag! The inquisitive me was eager to know what exactly was being offered. I went ahead and followed as instructed and found a telegram bot that was designed to install Malware on my mobile device.Why are hackers targeting mobile devices  The crypto wallet market size would explode for sure and the same would happen for cryptocurrency exchange apps in the future. How can anyone ignore this fact. We are living in ,2023 where AI bots are controlling content generation & content development. Considering those factors, imagine on what level scammers, spammer, hackers and a normal person would work on to fulfill the desired outcome. Sharing the advertisement screenshotYou can read the message displayed on this screenshot. If you were a newbie or someone struggling with trading or you might have lost your fiat due to the volatility of the market, scammed by someone, wallet got hacked then what will you do? You would surely click on the Learn more button.That is what I did and went to the next screen which was a self-hosted website. Why was a redirected to a website hosted by the hacker?

They'll just keep following the prompt from the program while some may come to their senses when the program requests for key phrase or some personal information while some others may just foolishly go on until they lose their coins. Back to a very important security tip,  before you click click on any links or download any files be sure that  you have verified the sender's identity to avoid sad stories.",

      "body": "Well, I also saw this kind of ad on Instagram and actually it's also on Facebook but I don't have a screenshot. But fraudulent ads on facebook seem a bit different. because of fraudulent advertisements on Facebook about offering accurate trading signals that promise multiple profits. I'm not trying to log in. but one of my friends was curious and tried it. and it turns out that the contents of the ad are linked to the channel on Telegram. and it's the channel about trading unknown tokens that show up as well as insane like thousands of percent. (pumps). so the channel owner invites people to buy tokens which he says will be pumped. and my friend tried it. but it turns out that the purchased token cannot be sold. i don't know what type of scam it is. but fortunately my friend only tried in a few dollars. because he was already suspicious. but he just wanted to confirm his suspicions. and then it tells me to avoid it. he mentioned the term of the token (non-sellable token) but I forgot what the term of the token is.",

      "body": "I always disregard any form of online advertising because the rate at which scammers are using ads to penetrate users' gadgets is very high. Clicking on those ads alone is very risky, even to the extent of joining their Telegram group. If that link is a phishing link, your device will no longer be safe. There is every possibility that you could already have been compromised before now, even without joining their proposed private Telegram channel.My advice is that you should always disengage yourself from clicking on unknown links, especially when you are using a device that contains your crypto wallet information. It's really not safe.In addition to the main content on the OP, they want to invite you into their private channel so that they can show you some convincing stuff that will make you believe that they could really help you restore your lost wallet or probably send the victim some links that will grant them complete access to the user's device if they don't have it already.",

I am still surprised why Meta does not make any effort to remove this type of content, even though they have enough capabilities, resources and technology to curb this fraud, if not reduce the fraud rate to zero.The scammers are also lazy and their methods are easy to learn, however Meta leaves all the side to the users who waste their life effort believing these ads.Increasing awareness will make these scammers pay Meta for free or revenue for their scam.",

Especially if they tell us to use something that might look normal so we won't suspect it is a sign of fraud.I think many cases have trapped many people in fraud cases without them being aware. By looking at the screenshot, we have to be suspicious and not continue it because it could end up being a scam that happened to us.But I don't know. Maybe some beginners will be stuck with what people say, so they will do what they want. And finally, they will usually ask for money to be sent to their wallet and leave the victim without notification.",

As a newbie who knows nothing about bitcoin or cryptocurrency and is unaware that the transaction is irreversible, they will immediately follow the instruction and fall into the hands of this fraudster. To me, even though the adverts on the website appear to be genuine, the fact that it quickly led me to Telegram to continue with a Telegram bot raises a red flag. Cases like this should be reported so that Instagram can remove similar adverts, although this may take longer than intended. They don't easily take down such with few reports, and I believe they are more concerned with money than with reports like these until they no longer have a choice.",

They may create false advertisements that display false promotions, display deceptive images or information, and encourage people to click on the advertisements.When someone clicks on the ad, they can be taken to a phishing website that mimics the official site of a popular cryptocurrency exchange or digital wallet. Then, users are asked to enter their personal information, such as a username, password, or request a Private Key, which can be misused by criminals.It is very important for us when using social media to check the legitimacy of the website before entering any personal information or carrying out any financial transactions on the internet. Always use official, trusted sites for transactions, and never click on suspicious or unknown ads. Do not be easily tempted by promotional offers that are too good to be true and always exercise caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies.",

Anyone who is dumb enough to get to this stage of contacting admin is likely to get scammed. Exactly my thoughts, most times when you stay for a long time in the group chat even when you never had the intention of participating in their so called money making strategy but because of the fake realistics testimonies being provided by fake or socket-puppet accounts you might be tempted to put your money in it. I have seen and heard stories from people about how they fell for such a scam and that's why both newbies and veteran members should remain vigillant of this type of scam.",

So, We are known for a long time ago, facebook or any kind of social media is a nest of scammers, the scammer gathered there to just make plans and strategy how to steal what you have.
