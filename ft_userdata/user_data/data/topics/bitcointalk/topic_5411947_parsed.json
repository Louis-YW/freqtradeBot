On the other hand, PoS is not liked by some because it is a bit \"centralized\".If I follow this hype, I will try to be as neutral as possible especially since I only see the price of ethereum following the current market trend. General wise advice, \"invest as much as you can afford to lose\".",

Anyone probably would take sides with ETH's surge if they can buy a lumpsum of ETH to become a validator and that means those who hyped the ETH are likely among or looking to be part of the validators.",

Many are hoping that there will be a short pump because of the ETH merge. Well, it might pump but there is a chance that it will remain stagnant or worse it might go even lower. It will depend on the sentiment of the people and how they will react to the update. We've seen numerous updates regarding Ethereum in the past, but those updates didn't make the price of Ethereum go up.As for me, I will keep accumulating Ethereum not because of the hype and the merge because I believe in the coin itself. I'm buying it for long term purpose and not for short term only so between those 2 options that you shared, I'm neither one of them.",

Shame on these developers playing tokens on the name of the great Vitalik. We can always saw such action in the degen space and nothing could definitely say how bad the crypto influence to such developers when it comes to pnd schemes. Even a photo could be a subject of such project alone which is quite ridiculous.",

But this merge is a highly awaited change people are waiting for a long time now. It will give a lot of people a chance to stake their coins and earn an API. I am definitely not buying more as I am accumulating bitcoin while it is available at a discounted price.

But let's say we put this scenario:Scenario 1: You are very active with ETH (not me), and you are willing to take that big risk to jump on the bandwagon because you know it is going to pump when the Merger this month. So you just wait for the right time and then boom short term you make some quick money.Scenario 2: Like me, you are not that active, just laid down but looking at the outside, just invested enough. But regardless there will be a pump or not, you are in for the long haul.Scenario 3: Different story though for those who are willing to stake 32 ETH to be a validator because you can't withdraw it.",

Of course I know that there will be a big event, but I'm not going to get involved myself. If I can get airdrop because of the fork then so be it, if not then I'm cool.So yeah, probably I would say that I don't care about the upcoming event, nor will be interested to see if others will make money riding on the hype or not.",

No doubt many people invest in and will not understand truly how much ETH has been locked and staked, and the risk behind it.Very hard to predict ETH's price both before and past The Merge for now. But judging based on the long term, ETH has a lot of rollout and planning for post Merge which the price for it eventually bound back anyway.",

Ethereum merge is getting very close but we have not seen bug change in price yet. 6 September is date to be noted. We may see high volatility in this day. Many users will sell POW token and will convert it to POS.There’s a lot of possible scenario that can happen before and after the merge, I will personally wait for the result of this update and buy if I can still see opportunity. It’s too risky to buy early but it’s all on you. If you see the market, there’s a lot of different predictions and speculation, if you do follow it without having your analysis, your money will be on a risky position, many will surely buy ETH after this merge.",
