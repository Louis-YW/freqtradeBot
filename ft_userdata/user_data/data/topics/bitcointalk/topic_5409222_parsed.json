Poloniex started trading this new ETHPow this month, and ETHPow get support from justin sun for example:https://cryptonews.com/news/justin-sun-poloniex-back-plan-create-pow-ethereum-hard-fork.htmBut year no whitepaper, no real informations on their homepage, so many redflags in my opinion but many people think this is good or real. No one need this shit coin - mine ETC after the merge if you want, this makes more sense - ETC is the original ETH so no need for ETHPoW or how this shit is called.",

When Ethereum owners can get their coins and send them to exchanges, the price of this coin will fall.The price was around 125 dollars and has already dropped to 73. If the price does not fall much, then we can still mine this coinhttps://www.mexc.com/exchange/ETHW_USDT",
