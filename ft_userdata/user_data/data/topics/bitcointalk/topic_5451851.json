There are unspent UTXOs but that's more advanced. And yes, of course we can say \"balance\" and understand each other",

Every Electrum has how many keys and are they public or private  Bitcoin is based on cryptography. There is no better place to educate yourself about it than those links: 1. https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin-2nd/9781491954379/ch04.html2. https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/keys_addressesThere are basically three concepts you must get familiar with:A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a private key and a public key.  Therefore, a wallet can have multiple key pairs.Private key: The private key is just a number (256 bit long), picked at random. Imagine something like 00101...101 Public key: The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication (that's pure mathematics). Please make sure to remember that the process of deriving a public key from the private key is a method that is irreversible. I mean, you can't derive a private key from the public key. A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key cannot be converted back into a private key because the math only works one way.Address: A bitcoin address is a string of digits and characters that can be shared with anyone who wants to send you money. The bitcoin address is derived from the public key through the use of one-way cryptographic hashing. A bitcoin address is not the same as a public key. Bitcoin addresses are derived from a public key using a one-way function.Now, since you asked about electrum I will let people answer specifically about electrum. However, what I have written above is NOT application specific. It is essential to bitcoin.",

Unfortunately I don't use electrum, so I don't really know what password you are referring to.

Those 12 - 24 words can help you recover your private key. Please check here: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mnemonic. Some applications also allow you to use a password, but this not related to bitcoin protocol. It is application specific as an extra measure of safety. If you forget your password, you don't have to worry as you can enter your 12-24 words to another software and have access to all of your funds. If you lose and forget your 12-24 words, you lose everything.2. What do you mean public addresses? They can be shared without risk, if this is your question.Extra note: Since I understand that this is your first contact with Bitcoin, make sure to be ultra safe when backing up your wallet.

It is not the actual private key, but if you have access to the seed, then it is essentially the same thing.2. No! Addresses are not public keys. Please check the first link I sent you. In general, the process is: Private Key -> Public Key -> Addresses3. I will not comment on that, since I haven't done extensive research.
