That's a thread where a whole lot of members on this forum have shared their stories about how and when they bought their first bitcoin. Many times, this same topic has been discussed, and it doesn't really provide a great help to the Bitcoin space. From the threads I shared, the last one is still active, as is the interview with BitcoiTalk members. In my opinion, I would suggest you lock this thread and learn from the other threads if there is really anything good you intend to learn from your topic.How did you first hear about bitcoin?When did you bought bitcoin?My first Bitcoin",

I'm sorry, but the topic you made has been discussed many times here on the forum platform. Only a few of the links posted by @Dr.Bitcoin_Strange are related to the topic you made.Maybe that's just the idea of another topic that hasn't been discussed here, so that the discussions we can read here on the platform make more sense. In order not to spam the former part of our topic here, believe me, it has been discussed here more than once.",

      "body": "I first learned about bitcoin from another IM forum. Some members on that forum were accepting payments in crypto but I did not take it seriously at that time. But later, when the price of bitcoin started increasing fast, I also started accepting crypto for receiving payments. I am glad that I took that decision because it benefitted me a lot financially. Thereafter, I also invested in alt coins and made good money with it. Now , for all the advancements  related to crypto , I follow bitcointalk.",

I'm sorry, but the topic you made has been discussed many times here on the forum platform.  There's nothing wrong in asking such question. Since op is still new to the forum he probably got curious to know about other peoples story about Bitcoin. I guess there are lots of newbies here that can also learn from our stories so there's nothing wrong in sharing them.Op, just as you have been directed, you will find a lot of stories in those threads. The world of Bitcoin is filled with a lot of amazing stories of how it all started so do well to share yours over there also.",

      "body": "I have been asked of this same question before right in this forum and other crypto-related discussions as well. I am sure many of here can be feeling of nostalgia as we remember the many details leading us to get involved with Bitcoin in particular and cryptocurrency in general. I got into Bitcoin back in 2013 when I bought my first 2 BTC at just $500 each...at that time it was already considered very expensive. I eventually lost of my BTC due to revenue-sharing Ponzi schemes which became also popular at that time. In my country, Bitcoin is getting some ground as there are now a good number of people who are into cryptocurrency as we are always one of the first to adopt anything online.",

      "body": "I find it intriguing how a casual discussion may spark an entrepreneurial journey of self-discovery? We can relate to how you went from knowing nothing about Bitcoin to seeing it as a revolutionary force that could change people's lives. Your journey from Bitcoin to XRP is similar to many fans'. Those virtual money might have a very alluring charm.But lets take a closer look at these layers. Your story touches on more than just financial investments. Its about a mentality evolving, about moving from skepticism to evangelism. I commend your entrepreneurial spirit, but I also think you should temper your excitement with some suspicion. A sustained path requires a keen awareness of the inherent dangers and market dynamics of cryptocurrency.",
