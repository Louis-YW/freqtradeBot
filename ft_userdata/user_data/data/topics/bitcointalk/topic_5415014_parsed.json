Some people can do this and download fake app. Quote from: RockBell on September 26, 2022, 08:40:07 PM-spelling, description, and icon.-Read reviewsThe spelling can be very correct, but just little changes. Just like this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5315562.msg56297549#msg56297549The icon can be very different but deceiving, likewise the name. There is nothing better than to go to the official site to download the app. Reading reviews would be of help, but we should be careful too because reviews can be fake at times and some good apps can be reviewed not accurate, just like electrum some reviews on playstore.",

      "body": "One of the most common ones is conducted via platforms such as Telegram and Discord. These places are filled to the brim with scammers who pose as administrators or good samaritans willing to help you out when you ask something in the group. They are a lot more dangerous than the usual spam bots found on the same platforms regarding fake giveaways from fake exchanges, charging you a fee to withdraw your so-called prize. A few months ago, I was approached by one of the first mentioned scammers and was tricked into entering my private key on a fake Dapps website. I was fortunate enough that after doing so, I realized how stupid that move was and quickly withdrew all my funds to another wallet.It's a combination of social engineering and phishing, probably the worst type of scam you come across on such platforms.",

Despite the fact that there is no 100% reliable way to spot fraudulent or deceptive crypto apps, this is probably the only one that can still give relevant results. Reviews, if from reliable sources, provide a fairly objective opinion of the app and are usually helpful in eliminating snake oil that might look like a legit thing but in fact might be nothing more than a scam.",

I quit trusting Playstore when I discovered that fake downloads are possible with them to up the figures. As a noob, I used to get my crypto apps from Playstore, relying on the reviews I read there and the rankings for apps. I don't even type in addresses to sites I visit for serious transactions without getting that from official sources, even that for this forum is permanently saved on my device.",

You will get the names and official websites. And the official websites will have the correct link to the correct wallet (and also ways to check it's the correct one).I would not google search for the official website, since nowadays those also get cloned and get high ranks in search engines.",
