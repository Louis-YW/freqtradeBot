      "body": "Are the team paid only in tokens? Or that's an incentive besides being paid with cold hard cash or bitcoin? Kind of difficult for you to get an application if they're only getting paid with your crypto which is not viable especially if there's no valuations for your token yet. Also, you need to move this to Services if you are hiring a developer. There should be a salary my guy if you want someone to take this hiring seriously.",

Everyone of the team will receive shares of total team token.Those are the projects which, unfortunately so, won't make it. You expect a person to study and further his skillset for good 10 years and you offer a token which might be worth something? Anyone with those capabilities takes money up front of you, or me. I know someone who is fluent in all those things mentioned. I offer this to him and he'll ask for a 5 grand up front.Â  Not so sure about AWS and Azure as those should rather be avoided.",
