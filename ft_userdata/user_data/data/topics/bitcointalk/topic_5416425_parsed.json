OP if i may ask, what are the technical findings you've conducted that makes you derive at saying bitcoin can go to zero? obviously i shouldn't stress myself because i know you don't have an answer to that, but I will tell you two reasons why bitcoin cannot go to zero, first is that bitcoin is not altcoins or shitcoin that exists today and disappear tomorrow neither is it a ponzi scheme, secondly go and your own research on how bitcoin started since 2009 and compare it price to what it is now and clear your doubts, if you ask but it's going dip already, u will tell you it has always been so and will continue, there's rise and fall in bitcoin price.",

You can't expect bitcoin to cease to be in demand in the market as long as bitcoin is useful as a currency and an investment asset, so that should be the basis for why bitcoin isn't going to zero now. Bitcoin would be zero if there was no more demand in the market, but I wouldn't think it could just happen. After all, bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme that easily goes zero when it proves to be.Quote from: udayantha11 on October 08, 2022, 05:15:34 PMTechnically it can be zero at any given time.Currency failures have happened before, but I don't think it can happen to bitcoin now.

Easy: Because there are others who are also willing to exchange stuff for it.What essential do these people find in a digital currency that makes them trade real stuff for it? Easy: Properties they can't gain in any other currency, such as privacy, less transaction costs, censorship resistance, divided possession, instant transaction settlement, but more crucially: Control over monetary policy. But these properties exist given that they collectively use it, and treat it as money. Only that way they can gain these benefits.",

But that is impossible to happen. BTC has been there around and very few people use it, miners move transactions to have a reward, it is a cycle that BTC will move and have a transaction which is why the zero worth is impossible. That is technically what we called the demand and supply, everything relies on the demand and supply which makes BTC becomes valuable.",

As long as the demand for bitcoin is still high and that the bitcoin community is still active, then bitcoin price will never depreciate completely nor end up in zero value. Although a lot of times it’s even predicted as dead, but look at it right now, it’s price is still the highest compared to all crypto coins. So I am certain that bitcoin won’t never fall into zero, instead it will surge high and reach its new ATH once the market turns bullish again.",

And if BTC does meet an unfortunate end, it will likely be slowly supplanted by a better version of it or by another cryptocurrency anyway. It is always possible that some new technology will come along to render bitcoin completely obsolete at some point in the future - but that is true for many things that exist today too. No one knows what the future holds, but it is more likely than not that bitcoin is here to stay for at least a few more decades. Besides, bitcoin has experienced several massive crashes in the past several years, and its value has always recovered significantly. Sometimes the recoveries have been slow, but they have always occurred eventually.",

For Bitcoin drop to zero, everybody in the world have to suddenly agree that it's worth zero. This is the realm of pure fantasy. Bitcoin's price could drop dramatically is something really bad happened, like the underlying cryptography getting hacked. But even then there would be a possibility that it could be fixed and Bitcoin would still be worth something.",
