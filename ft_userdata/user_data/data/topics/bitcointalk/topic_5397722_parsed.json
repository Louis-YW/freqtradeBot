  "content": "Hi all, whats the latest and greatest for eth hash in 2022?Still using ethminer 0.18 and ethlargment. Used to get 55 Mh/s, now its dropped to 35 Mh/s -- this can't be pure from difficulty increase can it?Found current 1080Ti benchmarks still getting 50+ Mh/s -- not sure if they are legitSeeing threads on using t-rex miner, and phoenix miner being the current fastest.Mining specs:gpu: GTX 1080tios: debian 11driver: nvidia-legacy-390xx-driverWhats the recommended miner and hashrate for ETH on a GTX 1080 Ti?",

They get 56 Mh on ETC because the DAG is smaller.But I plan to use these cards for mining other coins, like FLUX, anyway.",

We need an address book to map phone numbers to addresses -- this address book resides in the TLB. Unfortunately the size of the address book has exceeded the TLB size, so we no longer have fast look-ups for the entire address book - parts of it have to be recalculated (cache miss). NVIDIA figured a smaller TLB size was enough to last a while (512kb is enough for anyone). For gaming thats true -- not so much for ETH HASH.So theres no we to go back to full performance unless the DAG size is reduced. TLB is physical cache on the GPU (like CPU L1/L2 cache) so no way to get more with fabbing a new GPU chip.My hashrate is at 37 Mh/s, so there still room for improvement to low 40's Mh/s. Going to try upgrading driver version and cuda version and see if that gets me the last few Mhs..",
