It is necessary for us to know that gambling is a game of chance as you may either win or lose and should be played for fun and not to go too extreme on others whenever you've lost a bet. I see some persons transferring this aggression on their families or loved ones whenever they lose a bet like they will either be very violent on their wives or their children to the extent that any little misunderstanding they take it as provocation. Any one who chose to play gamble should be able and matured enough to handle their emotions whether they win or lose bets.Please let's share our thoughts on this topic",

Looking at the response of reputable members here and their advise is simply the best thing to act upon by locking this thread and contributing to the already existing thread would be okay. I think that should be the next step to be taken.",
