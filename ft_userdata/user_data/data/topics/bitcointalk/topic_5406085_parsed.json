You will only have profit of you hold your mine tokens and sold once the price pump once again.Competition decrease during bear season since many retail miner stops mining so its really good to mine altcoins for accumulation purposes but not to have an income for the present stage.",

If you have inexpensive electricity, then you might consider mining. But now there is no need to rush to buy mining equipment, because it will cost even less.",

Even now there is equipment with a payback of 6 months, even in the worst case scenario it is 12-15 months. This is better than mining unknown shitcoins, the price of which is unstable and can nullify all your profit.",

Most of the market bottoms were during periods of extreme chop and most gave up out of foredom. I also think the market will go sideways and miners will have a stable profit for at least till the end of this quarter. But that may change because of the migration of ETH to PoS and ditching PoW right around August/September.Maybe we would see ETH price against the trend coming out from it? Alternative coins to be a replacement for ETH PoW are also an interesting change in that sideways market. Won't be too boring at least for the miners, see?",
