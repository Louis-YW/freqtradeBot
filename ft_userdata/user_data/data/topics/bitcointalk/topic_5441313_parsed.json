  "content": "Bitcoin Talk Announcement:Introducing Solar2Crypto - The Future of Sustainable Investment!Solar2Crypto is a European company based in Bulgaria that is revolutionizing the way we invest in solar energy. The company specializes in solar plant construction and is combining the real-life business with Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its own token. Our goal is to offer an investment option that generates profits today and is not based on future uncertainty.Our mission is to make investment in solar energy easier and more accessible. We are selling NFTs that represent ownership of a certain amount of power generated by a solar panel. When someone buys an NFT from Solar2Crypto, they are essentially buying a part of a solar panel and the power it generates.We are offering several different investment options, or packages, ranging in size from 100 watts to 100,00 watts. The cost of each package will depend on the amount of power it includes, and the price per watt decreases as the amount of power purchased increases. People can buy an NFT for a minimum of $9.99.After the setup period, Solar2Crypto will start paying profits to investors. The profits will be paid out in two forms: 80% in USDT (Tether) and 20% in WATT, Solar2Crypto's native token. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar, while Watt is a token that can be used to buy goods and services within the Solar2Crypto ecosystem or potentially traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Profits will be paid out on a monthly basis, and Solar2Crypto expects investors to receive a return on their investment within 36 months (3 years), but this is subject to market conditions in EU and the World.In addition to financial benefits, Solar2Crypto aims to make the project socially responsible by using the profits generated by the solar panels to benefit the community. This can be in the form of donating a portion of the profits to a charitable cause or funding community projects.WATT Token:Name: WATTSymbol: S2CTotal amount: 100,000,000 tokensBlockchain: Binance Smart ChainSolar2Crypto will create 100,000,000 tokens that will be a fixed amount and distributed as profit payment each month to NFT owners.

Basically from a legal point of view we can do anything allowed by the law in EUOnly after obtaining an extra permit for conducting the activities, I assume? So you'll still need to submit a request for an \"expansion\"? Or do I understand it wrong?\"[...] as well as any other commercial activity that is not prohibited by law, but when there is a registration or permit regime - after registration, respectively - after obtaining the relevant permit or license.\"I could understand very well if a law allows business entity to work outside the sector they initially registered themselves as, but only after/with extra license. Many companies did this around the world, working outside the initial sector they registered as, but they also have the required permit to do so.But of course I can understand that Bulgaria maybe applied a different policy. Can you please help us by pointing out the specific clause on Bulgaria's constitution which state as you claimed? That you can do anything allowed by the law in EU, such as constructing and opening investment for solar energy farm, with business registered under IT services?",

For example we can construct solar parks.We can sell the electricity to the government company Energo Pro AG as a mediator for power exchange. But we can sell directly to a client, for hat activity a license is needed.I will check in Trade legislation and will sent you the following paragraph",
