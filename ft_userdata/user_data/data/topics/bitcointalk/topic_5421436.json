  "content": "I have a very weird problem.Yesterday I was transferring my Bitcoins out of Guarda wallet (as I had just swapped some Ethereum for it) to my Electrum wallet, with a fee of 6 sats/vB - this was before I looked at the mempool volume.Long story short, now my transaction is buried under 120vMB of other transactions, almost all of them paying double my fee (which would be 12 sats).The transaction is broadcasted, but without RBF as apparently Guarda does not support RBF, so I cannot change the fee and broadcast it again, as my tx gets rejected by ndoes.I do not see the transaction in Electrum. I also do not see it at all in block explorers. This explorer https://bitcoinblockexplorers.com/tx/c56fdc357a22471256302626d9c1da186499b74bad641b688703c89c625d0fd2 used to show the tx as at least \"unconfirmed\" but now its not showing anything.The tx does not have a change output (I transferred all bitcoins out anyway), so I am afraid I cannot do CPFP either.Short of a tx accelerator [and not even ViaBTC can find my tx], is there anything I can do to make my tx visible on block explorers?Yes, the address in the transaction matches the one I intended to send it to.I seem to be able to see it on this particular explorer now, but on all the other explorers I tested, it is not found:- Blockchain.info- Blockstream- Blockchair- BlockcypherEDIT: It's not found again even on the one explorer that worked.What the heck is going on here?EDIT 2: I just imported the private key of the Guarda wallet to another Electrum wallet and initiated the transfer from there. This time I can see the unconfirmed transaction in my other Electrum and explorers. So maybe this is a Guarda bug or something?",

My guess is that's what happened, and if that's the case, all your wallet has to do is keep broadcasting the transaction so that it will show up when mempool clears.Quote from: NotATether on November 16, 2022, 06:23:21 PMSo maybe this is a Guarda bug or something?I know nothing about that wallet, so I have no idea how it broadcasts transactions.",

I waited for the bitcoin transaction to confirm before sending it out, and it somehow worked the first time, but then subsequent broadcasts of the rawtx failed with some \"RPC error\".Normally I just use TradeOgre when I need to exchange large amounts of coin, but if I happen to need to exchange urgently, a wallet with that sort of feature is a nice to-have.

I thought the \"k value\" was a random, but clearly this isn't my area of expertise.AFAIK, Electrum is using a deterministic 'k' based from the private key and the hash of the message to be signed (actual formula, IDK).So it'll produce the same 'k' for same message, thus same signature; but not if the message is different since it'll produce a different 'k'.That's essentially not reusing nonce.
