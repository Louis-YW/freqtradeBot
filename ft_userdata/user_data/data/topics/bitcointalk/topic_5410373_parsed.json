You can explain your situation to your friend and make an appointment somewhere else where you can also have a good time, like a strip bar, a cafe, etc. There are actually a lot of options.",

      "body": "Obviously yes, why risk all the progress I made in 2 months fighting my addiction for a single night out? The risk of getting hooked again is too big in my opinion. I haven't experienced gambling addiction myself or among my close friends, all my information I got is from reading online. What I read is that the hardest step is to try and break the addiction by getting help. Taking treatment is the right way to recovery and requires hard work and determination. There can be relapse during the recovery, but good friends should help us rather than be a temptation. If he really is a long term friend than I would tell him of my problems and I am sure he wouldn't try to convince to still go with him. I think going for a nice dinner and some beers would be a good alternative to catch up and talk about old times.",

Because if I go to the casino again, the gambling addiction will attack me again. Â And I will forget about that 2 month treatment and start gambling again. So I think if the decision is made to quit gambling then it is always better to avoid gambling. Otherwise it will never be possible quit gambling.",

Before family members do know that someone is gambling, the person would have been obviously affected financially.You have to let your friend know that. There are other places you can meet like an eartery, a restaurant, a recreation center or other mind pleasing places, that would be the best to do. If you are undergoing a psychological or medical treatment along, you can tell your consultant or therapist about it, if it is a good idea or not. But I believe he would tell you what I am telling you now. Best to fully stay away from gambling to fully recover yourself from gambling addiction.",

One can always offer something else in return, like having a coffee at a old times joint instead of gambling. Taking such a decision is a mature and a bold step towards consolidating that you are a changed man.But I guess the ideal situations are not always going to work out, so fingers crossed.",

Trying to heal from gambling addiction takes a lot of courage and it needs total dedication. I will just explain to that old friend what I've been going through. No need for me to feel shame because if he's a real friend, he will understand my situation.Changing for the better needs a lot of sacrifices and you should be willing to give up the things that will push you to gamble again.",
