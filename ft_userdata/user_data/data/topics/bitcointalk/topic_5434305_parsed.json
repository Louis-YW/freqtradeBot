If you have this amount and willing to work please contact me back ASAP!Thank you,Regards.Do you think you can just come here and start jabbing with your audio offer. Your first post aboard this platform likely portrays you to be a scammer. How on Earth do you explain this that you just got registered on a platform and what you could do first is to  make a demand of such offer and who on do you think would listen to you. Since you could go to the bank to make payment for such amount of btc then it means btc is legal in your country. Why not get registered on a well known centralised exchange scale through kyc and make use of their p2p platform to make purchase of btc worth the amount you want. I think this would be easier and another too you would be on the safe side preserving your identity as well.Remember the phrase\" not your keys,not your coin\" after purchaseDyor!!",

There isn't many people on this forum who have so much money and probably they're not very interested to sell their Bitcoin for cash. Especially now, in bear market.And which one escrow you're going to use? 10M is huge money and even the most trusted escrow may scam for it.",
