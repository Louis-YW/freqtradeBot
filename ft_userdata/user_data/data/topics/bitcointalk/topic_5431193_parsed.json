But using the forum as a place to quickly discuss and share futures trading signals is inappropriate, IMO. Not necessarily telegram, but we should use other messaging apps, we can chat and discuss faster.",

I know that there are some people who tried doing this and I somehow joined a channel that is doing this. They are not doing pump and dump scheme knowing that they are more focus and sticks on famous pairs which is hard to be manipulated. I'm just a viewer there are somehow the channels becomes a paid channel after many successful signals. I guess it's because they don't receive donations for their insights or they feel that they don't get rewarded. I don't know if they still exist now since I last seen them few years ago. I don't think your plan will go well unless you find a good team that is active and willing to trade with you. Though, I doubt that you will find someone here.",

A newbie offering such service is a dubious one.Better rely on your own instincts in trading, also learn more about futures before getting involved on this type of trading.I am sure, the reason why newbies offering such service is they are trying to offer a bait to naive users, offering possible earning of profits.But we all know that usually, it ends bad for the user who will use such service.

It can be said that it is a paid group and will generate profit for the Op from the profit that the merchant gets. I don't know what Op's real goal is, does he want to provide technical knowledge for free or just want to get income from traders successfully? the purpose is still not clear.",
