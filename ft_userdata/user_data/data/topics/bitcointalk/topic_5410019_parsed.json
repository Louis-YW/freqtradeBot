This is the best description for that.  A client avail a service not partnership.  When we say that,  there should be a cooperation between two parties. This one is like someone avail a netflix service and suddenly called partnership? Come on, floki inu is a shitcoin and this chainlil integ is just a way to attract more buyers.",
