Such as cutting out accounts, buying drops and fresh wallets to replenish a new account.I will repeat again. For people like you, bets are placed on INDEPENDENT BET VERIFICATION, which eliminates fake predictions. To begin with, I recommend that you read the information, and then write.https://imgur.com/goejGQrThere are many independent bet verifiers where a professional bettor can place his bet. And any buyer can be sure that the statistics are genuine. For example, Alpinbet or Blogabet. Check out their activities",

The bookmaker certainly earns every day on the losses of the players due to the margin included in the odds.The Okko neural network builds its own probability of events, which plays against a given bookmaker and outbids it at a distance.I repeat, before you write anything, delve into the topic.Your doubts are understandable and based on a bad experience with similar projects that promise huge profits.For people like us who are interested in betting on an independent verifier, where statistics cannot be faked.https://alpinbet.com/en/dispatch/___/okko",

It's simple you post game predictions and after the end of the game comes and posts the results, that way we'll see the bot in action. It's pretty simple in my opinion.The bot has a trial, using which anyone can temporarily gain access to the group.In the group, the bot publishes signals in live mode, based on which you can beat the bookmaker's line from a distance.After using the trial period, everyone can decide for themselves whether to use the bot or not.It is not necessary to follow the link, just enter \"Okkobet_bot\" in the telegram searchThe bot is not a \"psychic\". It is based only on statistical indicators and probability theory.Apparently you were misled by the fact that we have an affiliate program.The affiliate program works as follows:1. A person buys a subscription and sees the quality of the consultation himself2. If he invites a friend, he receives deductions from his purchase in the amount of 50%3. If his friend renews his subscription in the future, the person who invited him also receives deductions.This is not a pyramid scheme, but a discount when buying from several people at once under the guise of an affiliate program. You invited a friend. Your friend has bought a subscription. When you buy it, you get deductions.Please don't get hung up on this. You are deeply mistaken, focusing on an affiliate program.The neural network is primarily made in order to beat the bookmaker at a distance, building its own probability of the event.The proof of efficiency is that the published tips are verified by an independent betting verifier alpinbet. It's obvious and quite simple",
