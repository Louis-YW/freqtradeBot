  "content": "I really believe in bitcoin and have bought some bitcoin, for self custody, in order to learn more about it. But I’m having a real hard time buying a bigger amount for self custody, and it all comes down to 1 big issue: Either I buy bitcoin by the book (KYC) and become a target for attackers OR I go the full privacy-route (coinjoin, decentralised exchanges etc), with the caveat of locking my family savings in bitcoin forever and not being able to get fiat again (we might want it for a future house, travels etc). Is there a silver bullet to solve this for a law abiding citizen that wants to do self custode and be able to go back and forth between fiat and bitcoin, and at the same time don’t want to be a target for attackers? I have heard the solution from Aantonop of doing coinjoin and jumping k +1 times if regulated exchanges check your last k transactions, in order to deem your bitcoin tainted or not. It makes sense, since if they check all history of bitcoin then no bitcoin will be taint-free. But I wouldn't trust my family savings on that actually working the day we need fiat again. I also might be doing illicit activities according to some laws against coinjoins.And it's doesn't matter that I have my bitcoin in a flawless custody, since someone could still just show up at our house which would be a nightmare.What's a real viable solution here?",

For example, if I was supposed to buy 13 bitcoins then it’s but obvious that everyone will be curious about such high amount of bitcoin getting moved, stored to some addresses, then they will start keeping a watch on it. As soon as there is movement they will start making buzz about it and until the time it goes to final destination! In such case I would segregate my purchases. I will definitely buy it from decentralised exchanger where I don’t need to submit any KYC. Since it is big amount I will try to buy it from different accounts + different connections and different exchangers. I will make purchase on different days too. This will reduce attention from any big amount altogether. Once I accumulate amounts I will get them freshly minted with mixer services.I will follow same process to mix them. Small amounts, different days, different accounts etc. Once I have them freshly minted, like unmarked coins I will start accumulating them on hardware wallet and store Forever or until the time to sell. What do you guys think about this strategy?",

There may not be a silver bullet solution that perfectly balances privacy and compliance for a law-abiding citizen who wanted to do self-custody of their BTC and be able to convert to fiat while avoiding to be a target for attackers.  I believe it all goes down to the existing law and regulations in your country and understanding the trade-off associated with the possible different methods mentioned in this thread to be used.  I think it is best to consult a financial adviser or a lawyer to get a clear understanding of the laws and regulations of your country and also to know the risk associated with each option you choose.",

This is unlikely, especially if we talk about big reputable exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. There's extremely low chance that they sell customers data to criminals. If a data leak would happen, it will be public knowledge and you would be able to react. This is why it's advisable to move funds after withdrawing them from exchange, use a mixer or other privacy tool. This way nobody will know if you still own the coins or not and you will further reduce the probability of getting attacked.Most of the time people become attacked when they brag about crypto to people around them or in social networks.

Privacy has nothing to do with coin inheritance. If you bought coins on centralized exchange, withdrew them to your encrypted wallet and didn't leave the password or seed for your family to find, the coins will be lost. What matters is whether you created a plan for passing down your coins or not.",

Just remember to be safe, meet in a public place, take someone with you so you're not alone and won't become an easy target. This would bring the same challenge as above (buying through decentralised exchanges) with the added risk of actually meeting someone. And even if I could do it by getting bitcoin from people...someday I might need to get a large amount of fiat again in a practical way. Small sell offers on decentralised exchange over a long period of time will not really be a viable strategy. And selling it on a kyc exchange could have the exchange freeze my funds depending on the taintedness of the coins. And also I would tie my house address to a large sum of bitcoin.Quote from: Flexystar on January 22, 2023, 04:43:44 PMIn such case I would segregate my purchases.

Since it is big amount I will try to buy it from different accounts + different connections and different exchangers. I will make purchase on different days too. This will reduce attention from any big amount altogether. I have also had ideas like this i.e. to buy smaller amounts and send it to new addresses in my wallet in order to not draw attention to it. Then no one would be able to know that 1 person owns all these bitcoin. I guess that would be a quite ok privacy strategy. It will just take a while to accumulate, and maybe that's fine. But the day I need fiat, the bitcoin price might be 10x the amount or more. Then it will be quite hard to have a good exit (sell coins) strategy. The only thing you can hope for is that things have changed in a good way to facilitate this for large bitcoin holders who wants to exit in a private wayQuote from: hatshepsut93 on January 22, 2023, 06:01:52 PMYou are assuming that the criminals have access to the full database of centralized exchanges.I just assume that if my house address is connected to my bitcoin purchase then bad people could get hold of this information either by being an employee (or knowing an employee) on the exchange or through the analysis firms which would also know. And the connection will probably be there forever. I don't like that footprint.",

      "body": "The issue you are facing is a common one among individuals who want to buy and hold Bitcoin for self-custody while also being able to convert it back to fiat currency in the future. There are a few potential solutions to this problem, but none of them are completely foolproof.One solution is to buy Bitcoin through a regulated exchange that requires KYC (Know Your Customer) information, but to take extra steps to protect your identity and personal information from attackers. This could include using a VPN, using a different address or phone number than the one you use for other personal accounts, and using a hardware wallet to store your Bitcoin.Another solution is to use privacy-enhancing techniques such as Coinjoin, decentralized exchanges, and other methods to obscure the origin and destination of your Bitcoin transactions. However, these methods may not be fully effective in preventing your Bitcoin from being deemed \"tainted\" by regulators or exchanges and may also be illegal in some jurisdictions.Aantonop's solution of jumping k+1 times is also a valid one, as it makes it more difficult for anyone to track your transactions, but again it's not foolproof and it could also be illegal in some jurisdictionsUltimately, it's important to weigh the risks and benefits of each solution and make a decision that you are comfortable with. It's also a good idea to have a plan in place for what to do in case your identity or personal information is compromised. It's also to consider that no matter how you secure your bitcoin, your house could still be targeted by criminals, so it's important to think about physical security as well.P.S. consider living in places like el salvador, bitcoin lake or bitcoin jungle or other places in the future and never have to change your sats again.",
