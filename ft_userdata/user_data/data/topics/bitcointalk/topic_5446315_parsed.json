If you say it out loud, \"Raul\" sounds totally different than \"Saul\".Raul uses its own private Monero nodes and every transaction is tunneled through TOR.FAQ is only showing what to look for as an example.

      "body": "It is nice you have a good project. This exchange is more of a decentralized UI design and it looks unique and excellent. As earlier asked with respect to other coins been incoperated to you dex, it would of benefit to you and your organization that other coins are also included because the 3 coin some can limit the activities of your dex to just few operations so for a wider and broader community I suggest you look into that as there are many coins out there with large holders which you can incoperate for huge traffic. I also noticed that the out put of the the swap is bitcoin. I want to ask you a question about that. Do you plan limiting the output of transactions on your dex  within the bitcoin chain or it is just for the Start because I know for sure not all would want to get bitcoin as output while some would be swapping bitcoin for another. So how do you explain that?",

I would not recommend Binance Smart Chain due to their overreaching tracking which violates user privacy.- Tron. I believe that it's very popular and you would probably make a good amount from the volume of this and USDT on Tron.- DAI and/or USDT on Ethereum, Tron and any Layer 2 EVM solution that you add so that there is a usd-pegged option. I would not recommend USDC due to its control by Circle and its government-affiliate counterparts or BUSD due to the reason mentioned for Binance Smart Chain, plus it recently de-pegged. I believe all you would need is Litecoin, Tron, one or two of the layer 2 EVM (Polygon is popular) and USDT/DAI to increase both feasibility for low-volume traders and variety for everyone.Looking forward to watching your new service flourish!Quote from: LoyceV on March 30, 2023, 08:41:40 AMQuote from: bettercallraul on March 29, 2023, 02:42:28 AM2la5op74rphtwd4vqla4tvwbghe2hrffuy7yut7wlhufjkazwj2ixqid.onionHave you considered a vanity URL?

And, ETH and Monero are so far so good at the moment because both are all one of the biggest coins around the market. and, I agree, if developer want force to continue adding coins, Litecoin is good, or maybe Doge, because have a low fee which we can do trade regularly if there is no load at all.
