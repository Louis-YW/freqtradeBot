If you see something, say something.I believe the government already have secret programs for UFO's. There are many secret things the government is into that they never let the public know, so I do not really believe that they are interested in people submitting report of UFO's that they are already stuying.",

      "body": "Itâ€™s currently unclear if UFOs actually exist but I guess there have many credible sightings and encounters reported over the years. Reporting these incidents to the government is important. It helps them gather data & evidence aiding in scientific understanding and potential discoveries. It ensures public safety by identifying any potential threats or security concerns. Reporting UFO sightings promotes transparency allowing experts to investigate and analyse these phenomena which may contribute to our understanding of the universe & potential extraterrestrial life.",

      "body": "I couldn't believe it until I saw them myself, at high altitude after midnight, first I thought they are asteroids but then I noticed they move in different directions orbiting each other moving at least 10 times faster than any airplanes I have ever seen, they didn't have any lights, they were high enough to reflect sunlight. I just hope we never see them face to face, have you seen how fe'd up they look? ðŸ¤£",

Irrespective of how secretive the government is on loads of stuff, the government isn't the only one privileged to have UFOs and these UFOs don't get to announce their arrivals. There are also cases where the NASA radar system might now pick up the signal of an UFO, in such cases, it will be ideal to let the general public in on the UFO space, just incase there is something to be studied for the protection and preservation of humanity and systems.We never can tell if another planet of species are looking at another planet with oxygen way better than theirs",
