  "content": "Crypto Beginners are those who have just started to know or learned a little about Crypto or Trading. That's why it's very crucial time for them as they don't have much experience. But a good start can change his future and a bad start can make him disinterested to Crypto or Bitcoin. So here are some of my advices and I know they have much more to learn. 1. Doing Fundamental Analysis: Fundamental Analysis is used to Determine how much potential a Crypto or Bitcoin is. Also by this Beginners will learn how Bitcoin or a Crypto works and what are the advantages or Disadvantages of Crypto. So to predict price of Bitcoin you should know about it's fundamental and it's potential for the future. It's also important if any new project launched and we are curious about it's potential.2. Use Moving Avarage and Chart Analysis: Its a must and common way to predict price of Bitcoin and for this you have to know about some indicators and patterns. You can draw support and resistance level in your chart and can predict the price will pump it it hit support zone or can dump a little or be stable in resistance zone. Also Moving Avarage (MA) will simplify your prediction and will notify you about upward trend or a downtrend. The best app to practice technical analysis is TradingView. You can use some useful indicators for free in this app. 3. Learn from others Analysis: In TradingView you will saw many users are sharing their opinions about market prediction. Some of them are predicting pump of Bitcoin and some are predicting down. They have their own research so try to study their chart drawing and analysis. Then learn from the wining predictions and search faults from the losing predictions. That will help you to grow in a effective way.4. Experience your knowledge with Demo Trading: Its a good choice for beginners to trade with the demo funds before investing real funds. It will help to find out the faults of your analysis without losing real assets. It will also increase the experience of a trader. Some sites are offering Demo trading like Etoro , Bybit etc.5. Avoid Emotional Trading and Always Follow the Trend : Beginners are very poor to control their emotions in crypto trading. Even many experienced traders can't control it. So it should be controlled by practice and patience. Don't go for FOMO(Fear Of Missing Out) buying, avoid FUDs (Fear, Uncertainty And Doubt) and try to know more about Fear and Greed Index. And it's a must to follow the trend because there might be a chance to pump together.6. Learn About Upcoming News or Events:  We all can predict that Bitcoin pumps hard after every Halving. So there are many upcoming news and events available of every project which can determine its price. So we should also look at those upcoming events.",

I will suggest starting critical topics, on the basis of queries, day-to-day asked questions, and current market developments, It will bring more responses.The rest of the things are good as your compilation, I think it's enough to read properly still you can improve it by making it visually more pleasant using Bolding, Colors and different sizes, etc.",

While the demo can help you figure things out, your worries will likely be the same when it comes to live trading.My one piece of advice, beginners just need to start trading with a small budget while developing their trading skills. Also don't expect to get rich overnight and stay away from more altcoins.",

Because in crypto currency to atleast; there are no emotions, no love, no hate; what we see in crypto currency trading are only profits and losses. How to make more profits; how to limit lossesHow to make profits consistentlyhow to avoid losses. To thrive in crypto currency trading, you must first overcome your emotions.",

We don't trade base on our emotions, rather we trade base on our stable motive backup by good trading strategy. Although there are countless barriers that are always on the way to hinder profitable traders like us from triggering our trading position. One principle I enacted was, if I don't see an entry that matches with my strategy, I'm definitely not going to triggered any position, because if we trade base on the trends, we lose out but with price actions, we are opportune to reap significant profits from the market.",

Trading using a demo account is only useful at first but if you intend to develop yourself into a good and professional trader, then take the risk and start with live trading using your real live account. That will create more opportunities for you so you can start to trade for real while using a small amount that you can easily manage once lose. And the moment youâre into live trading, you will start to manage your emotions as well as you cannot trade battling your own emotions. Your emotions will ruin your trades if ever so learn not to involve your high emotions when trading. And as much as possible, do not be greedy to chase quick profits, trading has its own process so learn to follow and trust the process.",

As a beginner, FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubts) are difficult to avoid because these two elements will encourage you to make a decision you're not supposed to make during trading. You'll also become a strong price indicator by taking risks you can bear; not all risks, but the ones worth taking, should be taken in order to achieve perfection and better assumptions in the market's current and future prices.",

As basic knowledge of crypto is as necessary for trading as water for a living. And, you said in this analysis, we keep an eye on new projects too, but my POV is that is not a good idea, as a newbie, you cannot understand the risk involved in trading in new projects and yet they also do not put any impact on the overall crypto industry.Other than this point, i liked your all points, and it is a good effort you made here. No wonder many newbies fall prey to market sentiments and loss their assets. And i think that currently market's sentiments are also making people fall prey to it.",

That's because the current movement of crypto is very difficult to predict.Even if you have good skills, that doesn't guarantee you can always guess. But maybe by following @OP's suggestions, one can learn a lot about the trend of a coin and where it is going. And even if he can't guess exactly, he can at least know where the next move is to adjust his trade accordingly.And don't forget that it also takes years of experience before you can have predictive abilities. So we can only keep practicing to improve our ability to guess where the price will move.",
