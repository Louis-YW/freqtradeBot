Can he simply move to countries where there is 0 tax like (UAE) specifically dubai and setup a company there and cash out crypto over years in dubai bank account and later decide to move to his home country with all that money. Since dubai has 0 personal tax and his home country can't charge tax on it because of non-resident of home country. Is this possible?",

Is it before the tax law implementation or after because you will be in trouble if you acquire after the law is implemented because a simple chainalysis on blockchain record will find out your laundering in the future especially if you became an instant millionaire.Your plan is good if your Bitcoin doesn’t come for any centralized exchange. Your only problem will be explaining to IRS on how you get your capital for your company that funded by your 10BTC since everything will be documented when came back to the US. I think it’s better to live on 3rd world country and use your money there instead on returning back to US.",

Some countries have tax agreements with each other to avoid double taxation, while others tax residents on their worldwide income. For example, if the country you are moving to has a tax agreement with the U.S., you may be exempt from paying taxes on your worldwide income. However, if you are moving to a country that does not have such an agreement with your home country, you may be required to pay taxes in both places. In some cases, this can lead to double taxation and result in higher taxes than what would have been due if you were only taxed once.When in doubt about whether or not you have to file, consult an accountant or tax professional who is familiar with international taxes.",

They're not going to let you get a lot of money without seeing if you've made a mistake they can claim against in most cases (it's a fairly reasonable procedure though considering you were trying to avoid paying it anyway).",

You would have to declare and pay tax on it when you exchange it for something (e.g. fiat, goods, and sometimes, but not always - other cryptos) and make a profit on that trade.",

Since I became interested in the subject I see that there are several forms of tax avoidance, legal as you rightly point out. One of the ones I have seen most mentioned is the creation and sale of NFTs. It seems that cryptocurrencies open a whole new world for tax avoidance, and I am surprised that it has not been discussed more in the forum.",

Is this possible?From what I've heard anecdotally, if you are or ever have been a US tax payer, the IRS will continue to hound you for a looong time, even if you change residence and become tax liable in another country.That being said, if you're serious about tax optimization I'd recommend getting in touch with a professional tax advisor. As pointed out by FatFork, taxes, especially international taxes, can be very complicated, will vary from case by case and can come with a bunch of pitfalls that you don't want to fall into.Quote from: Poker Player on February 01, 2023, 08:36:26 AMI think this sums it up, correctly.

It seems that cryptocurrencies open a whole new world for tax avoidance, and I am surprised that it has not been discussed more in the forum. I'm pretty sure that the tax games and money laundering (the real kind, not the kind of \"money laundering\" that Bitcoin has been accused of in the early days) that NFTs enable are an open secret at this point; with people just keeping their mouth shut about it for fear of normies and governments catching wind of the effectiveness and trying to combat it.",

There are no taxes on cryptocurrencies in Dubai, but there are many other nuances.To open a company and get a license, you will have to spend 10-30 thousand dollars. This procedure takes 3-6 months or more. Renting an apartment in Dubai is 5-10 thousand dollars per month. You can live in a hostel with workers from India and other countries  it's cheaper there. Dubai is very expensive.The cost of flights, accommodation, company registration, tax services, legal services will take you a very large part of your savings.__Dubai is considered a shadow tax zone for many countries, then you will have additional problems of legalizing your income in another country. Your 10 bitcoin idea is not worth the effort.",

Puerto Rico has a policy of %100 tax exemption for capital gains. And this country could be cheaper than Dubai. But you still have to face some hurdles because one has to be a permanent resident to enjoy these exemption benefits. Purchasing a property in Puerto Rico might be the easiest means of becoming a bonafide residence. Depending on your location you kind find other countries that offer tax exemption policies based on the diplomatic relationship between your country and other nations.",

There's a way he can hide paying tax by creating a business in your country and the other one is on a country where it's tax free. Although you need to lie since you need to create a fake purchasing and selling evidence, so you can manipulate the financial report to set the maximum amount where you will not get taxed.Maybe you still need to pay small amount money for money changer or tax, but it do greatly reduce paying tax.",

Well you can do that without moving to any country as well by using decentralised P2P platforms or finding someone who is trusted and can be traded in person in your country itself but I am not encouraging anything illegal or evading taxes.",

But the amount of bitcoin needs to support your expenses in tax-free countries like Dubai. Also, each country has its own definition of tax systems so first find out how many days you have to spend abroad so that your own tax department considers you as a non-resident and doesn't impose taxes based on that tenure. In my country, a person needs to stay abroad for 180+ days to be considered a non-resident. So, find out that information for your country and plan accordingly. Also, many tax-free countries will require you to furnish your income statement from businesses you are running there. Not for tax purposes but to stay compliant with the international anti-money laundering law. So make sure you have a real-world business to back up your numbers. If you get these things right, you are good!",
