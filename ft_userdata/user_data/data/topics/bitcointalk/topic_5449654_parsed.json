You have to let one know of the app and the videos you need so that they can be sure if they can do the task.2. Let them know how much you are willing to pay and how payment will be done.3. Upfront payment for a trusted member. Their reputation will be way more valuable that what you are planning to pay them.",

Next, I've already given you the solution. Let me ask you this:When you play the video, does it need to be continuously running without taking it back or front? I mean, when you said you can play it 2 times, you can't drag the video a few minutes back or front? If you can, then watching it 2 times is enough because you can have your pen and paper and still solve your questions while pausing it and/or dragging it back and front wherever you see your queries being resolved in the video.One more thing, is it allowed to be watched 2 times for free per device?If yes, why don't you use multiple devices and/or use BlueStacks and change IP inside and watch it?There are so many alternatives available that you really don't need to record it, if you don't need it later of course.",

Bought a couple of courses in there and I can go through them anytime I want repeatedly. Maybe you can also explore some alternatives in the long run.Unfortunately, I can't help... Good luck.",
