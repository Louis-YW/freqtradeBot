      "body": "If your plan is making good amount of profits in the bull market, don't waste your time on bounty project since there are no assurance that it's value will sky rocket in the bull market or not even pay you. If I were you, I will just try doing signature campaign that pays regularly and buy some altcoins that you truly believe that can possibly sky rocket in the next bull market. But if you believe that the project that offers a bounty campaign will rise in the future, go participate it. I'm just skeptical with bounty projects right now.",

Based on my perspective, most of the time project are partnership with (Exchange/Launchpad).Without creating a bounty, sometime they can be sold out.",

I think we currently have some good bounties, for example:- [Bounty 3.0] COMBO Network ex COCOS-BCX | ðŸš€ 100k USD Worth of Tokens ðŸš€ LISTED- ðŸ‘‰{ESCROWED} FireDAO Bounty Campaign | 4weeks | 9 platforms | 3 millions $FLM. - ðŸš§ [BOUNTY] Biokript Round 2 - Next Generation Cryptocurrency Exchange- ðŸš§ [BOUNTY] RADA - Making Changes in Football with Blockchain | USDT+$RADA- ðŸš§ [BOUNTY] Soil - The First Regulated DeFi in WEB3Some of the above bounties not only offer native tokens from the project, but also the $USDT stablecoin. Isn't that a great deal, mate?",

Bull market is still far from reality and big projects canâ€™t be predicted as well, you can participate on some bounty now but never expect anything big from them.",

But if most bounties are from shit projects, we have bad bounties. So, it is all depending on the quality of the projects who provide the bounties.I even think that there will be more shit bounties in bull season, the scammers take advantage from the hype during the bull season. They will be easier to attract people because people think any coin is easier to pump in the bull season. But it is the wrong perception because shit coin will never skyrocket, it is just a trap from scammers. So, be more careful to choose bounties in the bull season.Quote from: Jocuserious on July 05, 2023, 05:43:58 PMThere are no good bountys available to earn money right now. So what's your target? When we will received good bounty?Check again the Bounties (Altcoins) board, there should be some good bounties. Just join the bounties that is managed by trusted bounty managers and it is better to choose the bounties paid in tokens/coins listed on exchanges already.",

Majority of them, if not all of them, are simply projects that are hoping to one, get some traction here or two, scam the sht out of some people. And believe me, I'd say projects getting famous through here is past already. They're probably better off getting a solid foundation and providing a framework to whatever project they got, not a paper that says what they \"plan\" to do together with some shtcoin they made.",

So what's your target? When we will received good bounty?Bounties are wasting your time. You can research and find potential projects to hunt for their airdrops. Do on-chain transactions like real users as your proactively on-chain activities to wait for their generous airdrops.You must look at their capital raised and find projects that probably will do good and massive airdrops like Optimism, Arbitrum.Don't join bounties especially if their managers don't escrow the bounty token pool. Project teams can scam both managers and bounty hunters by reject to pay at the end.",

So what's your target? When we will received good bounty?Yes. There is a relationship between the bull market and bounties. I found good bounties in the last bull run. They will pay you more than 100$ or something. My suggestion is to do the signature, article, and video campaign in good bounty. You will receive a good amount of money. When the bear market comes, most of the projects are does not have good profits. That is why they will not pay you during that time.",

I don't think has because last several years bitcoin still stable under $20,000 but many bounties campaign worth with higher payment reward. Right now many campaign have limit budget reward allocation when using stable coins for payment under $10,000 for all kinds bounty participants from signature, social media until Youtube or content creator campaign. Last time when bounty campaign profitable, reward payment allocated 2% until 5% from coins supply and many coins listed on market with higher price. Most profitable for participants although joining with social media campaign and earn more than 100$, right now for social media campaign bounties, payment under $2 and several time I checked most disappointed for participants and looks promising for bounty campaign manager.",

So what's your target? When we will received good bounty?I actually think, that bounties are the most lucrative during a bear market and while the prices for crypto projects are low. Just look at my signature campaign for example. I get 55$ worth of Bitcoin every week. So now with prices of around 30k$ per BTC i \"only\" get 0,0017 Bitcoin per week. A few months back i was already part of that Bounty campaign but back then those 55$ were 0,003 Bitcoin or even more sometimes. So those BTC that i earned there during those times are worth far more now than back then. So in that regard it definitely makes sense to be active in campaigns during a bear market and then during the height of a bull market you can sell those bounty earnings.",
