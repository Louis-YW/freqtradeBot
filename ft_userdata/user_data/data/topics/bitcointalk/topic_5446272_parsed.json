  "content": "Probably not the best place to discuss it, but I figure it's worth a mention here in the hardware section since over the years we have had a lot of discussions about Moore's Law and how much speed we can get out of how small a die on a chip and if it would keep going or would we hit a size / speed wall.He was one of the co-founders of intel and in general a really intelligent person: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_MooreProbably did more to advance ICs more then any other person.RIP-Dave",

Maybe I was wrong.ü§îNo they aren't (and never were) 'Laws'They completely ignored physics limitations.yeah they were more of a way to dumb down speed increases in processing.but much like a car and a gallon of gas there is a limit to how much you can increase efficiency.Ie no standard gas burning car will get 1000 miles to the gallon.and no asic miner will do 1 watt per th for the sha 256 algo.as for 1000 miles a gallonor 1 watt per th being impossible limits that wont be met we can call it Phil‚Äôs Law.üòÄ",
