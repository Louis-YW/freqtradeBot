  "content": "I've been on an incredible journey into the world of Bitcoin mining for the past few years. Starting with just a single mining rig in my basement, I've watched as the crypto landscape evolved. The excitement of discovering new ways to more efficiently mine blocks and earning more and more Bitcoin as a result has been truly rewarding.Recently, I've found a convenient way to handle my electricity bills without having to go through my bank at all. I've been using FCF Pay, a fantastic service that allows me to pay my electricity bills using Bitcoin (although they also accept Ethereum, Litecoin and many others). I was one of the beta testers, but now it's for everyone to use.I've been fortunate enough that my electricity company is among the 21,000+ US companies listed as payees on the FCF Pay service. It's incredibly convenient to use, not just for electricity bills but also for other essential payments like car expenses, water bills, and even my mortgage. FCF Pay has truly simplified my financial management in the world of cryptocurrency mining. You can find more information about their bill payment service here: https://fcfpay.com/bill-payments/#pay",

Otherwise I would be very careful if you want to send crypto to them.-Dave",

Mining BTC requires ASIC which is more efficient than GPU's what I see here is you are trying to promote this site I know someone promotes FCFpay service here but most of them always have newbie posts with attractive words.",

I even read about them in some binance-related newsletters.https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1258158According to the article, the way it works is that you pay in cryptocurrency pairs and then all cryptocurrency transactions are routed through the FCF gateway and an automated conversion process into fiat currency.What I wonder about is why the user advertises to them and there is no referral link or why the website design looks like they are scammers and not a licensed company https://fcfpay.com/bill-payments/#payread some reviews https://cryptopsps.com/reviews/fcf-pay/",

      "body": "I have no problem with people doing marketing for one or two projects, but if they market it with some misleading statements then it can be problematic. I doubt what OP said is really true, considering his post history and track record. OP, you should change how you advertise your projects unless you want to be recognized as spammers.About the project you promote, at the very least give us details on how you do it and how it compares to a similar project. Personally, I don't see the benefit of instant payment with crypto if in the end they just convert it into fiat. If anything, it would add extra fees. CMIIW.",

More than 5 newbie accounts are posting for the first time here on Local Time, and the sharing pattern seems very similar, so I think they all belong to someone who wants this topic to appear first (bumping group), but why?The website design does not look professional, in addition to their Twitter account being banned, and all of this is not consistent with the claims that they have 20,000 Merchants around the United States.",

      "body": "In addition to all the comments mentioned by the members above, this topic seems suspicious. In the first place, I do not see any relationship between Bitcoin mining and the FCF Pay service company. You make the topic as if this service is related to mining and provided you with many services and made mining easier.Even if this service is real, it is for paying bills and has nothing to do with mining and is also limited to certain areas only. How can miners in other countries benefit from this service? The electricity bill payment service is only available to listed electricity companies and cannot operate on a global scale.",
