  "content": "With the price of BTC going down, many crypto experts have come up with different reasons they feel are factors responsible for it's downward slope. Chief amongst those factors is the trending Terra Usdt which is one of the largest stable coins in the market and also has the ability of enabling transactions to process with predictable results and giving crypto investors and traders an option their assets in cryptocurrency without the risk and volatility involved. BTC to USD= 29,678.90 as of time of writing, but  many believe and are expectant that it will rise, after all volatility is every where. Other factors which they believe seem to threaten the balance for BTC are the surging inflation, lagging recovery in the job market, the COVID-19 pandemic in the US amongst others. This could pose a challenge to new investors as they might prefer to wait till there is a semblance of order. But then, will there ever be an order?? https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-crash-continues/",

Chief amongst those factors is the trending Terra UsdtWhy all the gridlocks being attributed to terra luna by the way, i could recall on several occasions earlier this year that there have been news around on bitcoin whales alert and the activation of a old time wallet for a transaction with having a large amount worth of btc, some claim Luna founder release the bitcoin in his possession, shitcoins and the likes but am not moved by all because these were mere news, bitcoin will fall and still rises all by itself because of volatility in demand and supply.Quote from: NeuroticFish on May 16, 2022, 12:01:23 PMI've just read on twitter something I didn't know, and I guess you too; this mess did cause BTC price go down simply because Luna owner has sold 80k BTC:I don't know how true this might have been but i think a single whale released shouldn't make a significant change in price to this extent, but either of the way there must have been an excess supply to have created a low demand whereby the price dropped drastically, this shouldn't as well be a long time dip, this new week might comes with something different.",

When UST started losing it's peg to the USD, the Luna Foundation Guard started selling off their reserve assets in an attempt to stop the breakdown and try to salvage the situation. As you can see from this photo in one of the comments on that tweet you linked to, LFG confirmed earlier in May that they owned 80.394 BTC.",

Bitcoin is not affiliated with any terra, but ust is backed by bitcoin and many other altcoins. If everything is exactly as terra lab says they have sold over 80k bitcoins to try to keep the ust price, then bitcoin's price drop is understandable.",

That's the downside when the assets are dependent on keeping the price stable 1:1. The attacker has flooded the market and made it so that the investments in pools will get unlocked, and since it's pegged and dependent on BTC price, it needed to sell off some BTC to keep it balanced. A more significant amount of money has flooded the market and then dumped it all. It's easy to profit for the attacker, that's for sure. I know it's estimated to have $800m of gain.",
