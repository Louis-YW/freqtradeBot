Localbitcoins went from no KYC exchange to a KYC exchange which makes some people to leave the exchange. Localbitcoins customers reduced, and also the bear market which is another thing to consider.No other reason in my opinion than their business is shrinking.True p2p exchanges are not centralized exchanges, they are decentralized, but I just used it that way for you to understand.",

Many users, myself being one of them, felt sorry for the closure of this beloved decentralized exchange.Arguably the oldest peer-to-peer exchange for Bitcoin, many users bought their first Bitcoin through LocalBitcoin so there are emotional connections with this exchange.Certainly, the decision to close was not an easy matter, given the difficult conditions experienced by LocalBitcoin as a result of the bearish market on the one hand, and the control of Binance on the P2P market on the other hand.",

      "body": "It can be frustrating and disruptive when a service you have been using for years suddenly closes down due to operational difficulties. Having contingency plans and being open to exploring alternative services or solutions in such situations is essential.Keeping a backup plan in case something goes wrong with your primary service is always a good idea. This can involve researching and testing out alternative options well in advance so that you have a plan B ready to go if needed.Additionally, keeping an eye on industry news and trends can help you stay informed about the most stable and reliable services. This can help you decide which services to use and which to avoid, like P2P exchanges or something in your country.It's sad, but change is inevitable, and it's essential to be adaptable and open to new solutions when necessary. While switching to a new service can be frustrating, it can also provide an opportunity to explore new tools and processes that may be more effective for your needs.",

Today I came to know they have stopped their service.Indeed, this was the worst news this year. LocalBitcoins was one of the best, leading, and most reliable P2P platforms in the market, which has lived for a long time for more than ten years. I believe that the reason for its closure is the decline in offers on the platform, which does not cover the burden and expenses of the platform, as it was unable to overcome challenges in the endless cold winter. Still, fortunately, there are other good alternatives where LocalBitcoins customers can now withdraw their bitcoins to another platform. There are platforms that we can deal with without KYC. Still, we have to do our research and learn about the precautions of the alternative platform in the event of an accident and learn about the solidity and strength of its team in the face of challenges, so we don't wake up to the news of its closing.",

I also used Local Bitcoin in my initial days when I came to know about bitcoin.However, later the exchange integrated the P2P system into their exchange, and especially when Binance started their P2P service it was virtually the end of these third party service providers. Why would anyone come to local bitcoin fist, exchange their fiat money for bitcoin and then transfer it to Binance (paying a withdrawal fee too). Binance solved this by introducing its own P2P and making the process simple. Yes, with binance you have to do the KYC but those who trade on binance already have done their KYC.",

That's also true for Binance and KuCoin.  I don't think it was fee issue. Previously, people had to use Localbitcoins + Binance/Kucoin, both platform. When you have the same benefits from both platform and you have to use Binance/Kucoin for trading, why would they visit Localbitcoins? They now can use Binance/Kucoin for trading, p2p etc. Some customers forgot localbitcoins for that and getting new customers is hard for them when Binance and Kucoin has the same privileges and of course Localbitcoins don't have that enough investment as of Binance and Kucoin when it comes marketing. All these hit Localbitcoins together, same as me too lol. I miss that old good days where I could easily make some extra sats by buying/selling bitcoin/usdt. After Binance and Kucoin launched, I barely got some good deals.",

Either way, localbitcoins was interesting for many beginners because they didn't ask for a KYC at the beginning. In the German-speaking local board, localbitcoins was often recommended at the beginning, but that changed with the introduction of KYC. Either way, I agree with you. Binance was certainly also a big factor that localbitcoins had to shut down and is just too dominant in the crypto market. Hopefully there won't be any problems like with FTX at some point.",
