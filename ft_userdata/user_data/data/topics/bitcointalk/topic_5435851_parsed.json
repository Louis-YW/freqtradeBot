It's not new to me the vices of scammers on the internet, it's we that should very be careful of those things that are too good to be true. Many people want to get rich quickly, but is this possible without following due process? I guess not.There has been HYIP many decades before cryptocurrency, and people were scammed for it, and scammers are still using this style in the name of cryptocurrency. People have to be careful about this.Social media is their main target, and that is why many warnings and disclaimers have been issued to those that care to listen. And the closest-fetched one¬†is on the site of \"Onentrepreneur\" where everyone was tipped to be careful of the scams in the name of trust wallets.Source: Beware Of Trust Wallets Scam",

What is surety once it's listed it will grow as most of them are pump dump so even if they get listed the first one's to cash out profits will be the team and so called crypto influencers.So you have been provided with some scams through trust wallet also but once you give them access or invest in these projects you are on the verge of losing your funds which is why I always advise to turn off people adding you in any telegram group without your permission to be on safer side and always investigate about the project and check for the token address to validate it with original one but avoid them at best.",

Also be careful with a wallet where they give that has lots of balance or where you can see the value of it in dollars that it is huge or decent amount in dollars and you have to pay fee to be able to sell that fake crypto but when you send bnb on that wallet then you will see later that the btc you sent are being transferred to another wallet.
