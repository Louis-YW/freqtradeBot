I mean less taxes Also so i Open company and transfer crypto from exchangers It's seems another similar topic of this Best Crypto friendly country?.Any way, I still want to say that before choosing the best country to withdraw a few million USD Crypto, you need to see if your fund is actually coming from a legitimate source. If the fund comes from an illegal source, then I think that most of the countries where there is good rule of law are the worst countries for you to cash out that fund.And if your fund is from a legitimate source then I would say initially you should choose those countries which have low or no tax on cryptocurrency and at the same time from the government rules and regulations to banks all are crypto-friendly. And if you get them in any first-world country then it will be best. Now if you want you can follow this table below-Quote from: https://management.org/best-countries-for-cryptocurrency",

I mean he did filled out a paperwork at the bank for that, but that's about it, nothing really happened to him at all and nobody cared. As long as you pay your taxes, they do not really care all that much about where the money came from, and not like its a secret, its crypto, it came directly from a crypto exchange, its all notified to everywhere, someone had btc, sold it, and withdrew it from the exchange to the bank, whats the secret? So the government said as long as you got that tax, you are fine buddy and let him be.",

And I don't know if everything is simple to use over there as the op is saying, I have not been to any of those countries so I can't have too much input in them. But from afar London is cryptocurrency friendly than USA because since when I have started this journey, I have not really heard of uk against Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but I have heard a lot from USA.

UK is the country you can earn more but the expenses are high as well. If you earn high and spend high then what is the importance of earning of high when it will all go into expenses? If you live your country to UK the only way you can save from your earnings is by limiting yourself to comfort. Firstly you can be squatting for some time so you get to share the bills with your roomies. Also, you will reduce the amount you spend on food, This may cause you not to eat good foods often since you ate managing.",

It's your tax residency that matters. In some cases (like with US citizens if I'm not mistaken) the only way to get rid of it is to surrender your passport and become a citizen of another country.

Just cause they are crypto friendly doesn't mean the tax department's not going to be on their asses. They may not bat an eye while it's still crypto but soon as you start converting them in legal tender they'd be hot on your tail, as in the case with a couple personalities in the past. El Salvador doesn't seem that great either as the country to cash your crypto earnings, for the most part, yes, they have crypto access that allows you to use your crypto willy-nilly but at the same time, i don't think they have the financial capability to actually support a thousand whales cashing out their money on the daily, and not spending it in the country's internal economy mind you. Look elsewhere, the money's gotta be kept still after you convert it into crypto Switzerland is a good choice, French I've heard great things about. Philippines should be a good country too because of less strict laws and a pretty indifferent outlook at crypto.",

I would look into Eastern Europe and a great compromise between costs of living and comfort/security/development. So countries like Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Baltic countries. I don't think you need to look specifically for a \"crypto-friendly\" country if you plan to cash out your coins - all you need is one bank that won't have problem with a large deposit coming from a crypto exchange.",

How would it impact crypto users who make a ton of money from trading etc? Is tax not a problem at all? I never cashed out that much money, but I'd argue that cashing out regularly for a small amount is probably better regardless of where you are, unless you are obligated to pay tax for how much crypto you own. In my country, for example, my crypto is taxed after I make trades or liquidate it to fiat, so cashing a million dollars in one go is going to be a headache. CMIIW.",

I am unsure about Malta but maybe not big different than Portugal and Australia.I don't think it is coincidence why many Bitcoin billionaires left their home-land nations and live in Dubai. They came here not simply to enjoy their rich life but also with some more friendly policies on taxation.Dubai and Middle East are also a hub, paradise of cryptocurrency companies and blockchain events too.The World’s Biggest Private Tax Havens",

Please check the immigration rule to find out how much money you can take out from Singapore. It is the world's costliest country so the amount should be higher than anywhere else. There are multiple crypto exchanges operating from that country so it will be great if you can get some contacts over there and possibly ask for a better pricing than the market one. You can also think of Dubai because registeredding a business in Dubai is very easy and it takes less than a week.
