Also, we can contact Udemy support query about this site?the main audience of the site is for countries which udemy banned them. me my self bought more than 1000$ in courses and just because I was from Iran my account got closed without any compensation (although due to recent lift of sanctions on Iran they should provide access, but I think just banning and taking the money is sweeter).So in short I believe everyone should be able to educate in the field they love , if you have access to udemy just buy it from there and if not we want to help.",

I don't know the original authors or the udemy site can claim copy right issues on your site ? Anyways my question is that are you selling the courses with the same fee as sold on udemy or you are giving these courses on a discount.Still you have a new site and people might not be confident sending money to you, why not vouch one or two users, so they are allowed to buy one course for free and share their reviews here.",
