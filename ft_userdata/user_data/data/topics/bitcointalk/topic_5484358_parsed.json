      "body": "Without knowing too much about the subject, I understand that this is due to pure statistical variability. An improbable but not impossible event that ends up happening, just as there are people who hit the lottery jackpot, however improbable it may be. As of today I see that they are the first mining pool, so it is not so strange.",

      "body": "It’s basically variance. Remeber how we had those 2 hour block times, well this is the opposite. Basically the average is 10 minutes but sometimes blocks can be found in seconds or hours.I don’t think it implies anything, they are a big pool and it’s normal for them to find this many blocks so quickly. I would be more concerned if all of a sudden a new private miner appeared and started to solve 50% of all daily blocks, and we didn’t know who it was. That would be more of a concern than this.",

      "body": "In mining, the chance of finding a block is always the same and is based on your hashrate in comparison to the total hashrate. It is NOT affected by whether or not you mined the previous block or any of the ones before that.This means if you (the mining pool) have 30% of the total hashrate, you will have 30% chance of finding any block at any height. You could get lucky and find block x, x+1, x+2 and x+3 but in the end when you look at the large numbers (per 1000 blocks for example) you still will have mined only 30% of  that total (300 blocks).",

      "body": "The time between block can be modelled by an exponential distribution; for the probability of having 4 block that happens within, for example 3 minutes apart, you would look at the probability of the following: (1-exp(-2/10))^4, 0.0107968364% of the time. Further more, you can multiply the specific proportion of hashrate of the specific miner to get a rough estimate of their probability. Whilst it may seem small, it isn't statistically impossible.You should also consider the fact that hashrate is increasing in between periods, and thereby making this even less of a rarity.",
