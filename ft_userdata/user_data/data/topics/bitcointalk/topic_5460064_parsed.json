What tools you use to view those metrics?  The next one for me is bitcoin halving. Because of the comining halving, you can start to DCA so that when halving comes, bitcoin price will not fall significantly but rise significantly. 2 years after halving are bull run. The 3rd year is bear market.Other things you can check are news and statistical analysis including exchange inflow and outflow. Including the rate miners are selling newly mined coins.",

Anyway what are the metrics you constantly monitor in order to be updated on current market changes? What tools you use to view those metrics?  There are a lot of factors that affect the market price of Bitcoin, and some of these things are unpredictable so I'm gonna say that with all of your metrics, there was no way you could accurately predict the movement of the market or the price of bitcoin, there are always times that your going to lose money. I mean it wasnt actually needed to monitor the market every time especially if you're just investing and accumulating Bitcoin for long-term investment, it would just be useless since you're not selling or buying most of the time, this could be useful if you're making trading as your daily thing, I remember the time when I still trade daily there are times that I could easily earn 100$ just for bucks of investment and probably up to 1000$ easily if I'm lucky but it wasn't easy since you could lose it easily as well. Yours just gonna need to be updated on what's going on in the market, something like articles, news, world economy, etc. and probably look for signals like for example good news that I think could trigger the market, Bitcoin halving event was a good example because most of the time it triggers the market to skyrocket like in the past halving but it wasnt guarantee.",

Just keep buying bitcoins regardless of events and any metrics, buy bitcoin with what you have and keep buying. You do not need to monitor any metrics, just keep your bitcoins safe.You will need metrics to know that Bitcoin is about in bottom range and you can start to do dollar cost averaging. If you can use some metrics and identify the bottom area, it's better to maximize your capital even with dollar cost averaging.If you know that, you can more seriously do DCA around a bottom area and increase your capital size for each DCA time.I disagree if we say DCA means just buying, buying with time and don't care about anything. We must know about Bitcoin cycle, how many years for a bull run, how many years for a bear run with each probable four year cycle.",

Market analysis where the Realized Price Metric mentioned above from @SquirrelJulietGarden is clearly important is valuable, however if you are to become an investor you should also consider combining the Metrics Browser and tools such as the TradingView indicator to gain a broader perspective of market conditions and effectively monitor changes meaning an investor can easily scale up their understanding and decision-making process in the dynamic and volatile Bitcoin market.",

Metrics are only useful in a fixed and certain market, but it will never be good enough in a crypto market that is very uncertain and unpredictable. So I agree on you with this mate. However, I would say that investing when bitcoin price is low, would make the best entry and selling it at its all time high will definitely make you profitable. Otherwise, if you set your own rule, then it will always be hard for you to gain significant profits.",

Investors are people who hold bitcoins for a long time so they buy bitcoins for long term goals. Those who need the latest bitcoin price data are bitcoin traders, traders who use the scalping method will be very updated on data and news. I'm not a trader, I only trade when I'm have good feelling and I only use data from coinmarcetcap and coingeckoI used to have a bitcoin savings program on hold. I buy bitcoin bit by bit from my monthly salary. I didn't use any data when buying because my goal is long term. But the bitcoin that I saved has been sold because I have family needs that I have to bear, and I get profit from my bitcoin savings, maybe I'm lucky because I need money when the bitcoin price is good",
