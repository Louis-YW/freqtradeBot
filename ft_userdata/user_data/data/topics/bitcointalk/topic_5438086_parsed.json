I'd say that this fight will highlight Shakur before he goes for a title attempt against the winner of Loma-Haney fight. If I'm not mistaken, Haney wanted Shakur to be his opponent because their camp is quite underestimating Loma already and they want a good fight.",

So I will have to put Shakur here winning maybe by a knockout or complete domination of the fight.No offense to the Japanese fighter, he had the belt in Asia, beat Nakatani who gave Teo Lopez all he can handle and also fought Loma in his comeback fight. But that is not enough resume to beat the likes of Shakur right now.",

I think Stevenson will become heavy favorite with the odds around 1.10x. I think the odds for Stevenson win via KO would be quite high since the fight will high likely end via decision. We need to look for odds 9-12 rounds, if it's high, it's worth to bet.",

Although in paper it looks like Yoshino is really a good fighter, but he hasn't fought outside of Japan and me too,  I doubt that he can spoil Stevenson.So far no odds yet as this is just announced, but we all agree that Stevenson will be the huge favorite here.And the over/under rounds might be in the 7.5 range.",

It might be an easy fight but he doesn't need to slack, instead, he needs to give some serious training and bring that until he will gonna fights Loma or Haney whoever wins that fight. Chances like this are few and it is as if he was given chance to train with a price before getting in the ring fighting a real fighter of his caliber.",

Still, this is another round for Shakur to break at 135 after all Yoshino ranked in the top 5 on the WBC which is quite impressive. The undercard list is some that is to look at like Damian Knyba and Jared Anderson who are both undefeated heavyweights. Seems easy win as they fight older athletes with more than 5 loss.",

Stevenson might not have the power vs Yoshino, but definitely, he has more experience and the better between the two and going to be the favorite, likely Yoshino will be 4:1 underdog or higher I reckon.",

Yoshino quite had a good record for being undefeated in his local while Shakur is as well but with foreign fighters. This is where difficulty with bettors measure comes from. In general, the japanese boxer's statistics would be somehow set aside since international record is believed to be having a bigger weight not only in sports industry. But this is boxing we are talking about and anything could happen once both fighters starts in the middle of the square. Both has their own trainings and tactics to win over their opponent. So what's more likely to happen , and as we can see in this topic, Shuichiro is just the underdog in this match.",
