Warfare represents a disruptive force that impacts all key components contributing to Gross Domestic Product: labor, capital, and land. The power supply was disrupted during the conflict in Ukraine, leading to significant disruptions in domestic production processes.2. While oil may not be the most critical resource, there has been no viable substitute for its profound economic influence worldwide. It continues to wield substantial sway over a significant portion of the global economy.",

I don't know what to say, but the least I can say is, that your statements are so obvious and there is no need to ask others to confirm them. Because we do have seen the above-mentioned scenarios due to the war between Russia with Ukraine. That war, has caused a great loss in GDP, Oil became expensive, stock market was also affected. And besides that, we have seen many other problems too. The short answer is yes it is true.",

When there is war the neighboring country's enjoy the benefits of selling their ammunition and their cost prices changes over time to the higher in demand of them, including every other things in the country increases tremendously. This isn't a thing to pray for and we should try all our best to prevent and avoid war from resolute within both country's as both affected country could finds it very difficult to get back their normal ways of living because it will affect almost every other thing in the country.",

It was only saved on the future markets.Quote3. War affects the stock market by causing a decline in stock prices.War will definitely cause uncertainty in the market, including stocks, and there would be an absence of precision but instability. So, it will surely be negative on the stocks.",

Nothing will function well because of the impact the war has caused. war brings about inflation, trade disruption, currency devaluation, an increase in government spending, and lots of infrastructural and human damage, so many refugees and IDP camps to mention a few. Oil plays a significant role in modern warfare due to its role in energy supply, logistics, and so on but there are other resources like information, food and water, mineral and material resources, economic and financial resources that also help in determining the outcome of a conflict.",

As Europe was rebuilding their economies, U.S. overtook everyone else and controlled global exports.Without WW2, I don't see the U.S. economy growing as fast as it did from the 40's to the 60's.",

It depleted a country's resources; people lost their lives and homes; food shortages caused famine and the destruction of a country's economy. Ukraine, Libya, and Syria are some examples of what a war can do to a country's economy. But it has minimal impact on a global scale if all the major powers aren't involved. As an example, the Russia-Ukraine war causes food shortages in the Middle East, which causes an increase in food prices, but they are getting supplies from other sources, which prevents any possible famine. If this were a war, we could see half the population die because of famine.",

You probably need to consider the location and type of war that is going on to determine if it will effect the global economy. A war in the middle of a desert without oil is probably just going to end up as skirmishes by possibly poorer country, will not have much consequence outside the local region - except for maybe a few more refugees trickling around and maybe things like a lower supply of diamonds, or other commodities if they mined it. On the edge of Europe, from two big countries, we're seeing some massive impact on supply chains and food security taking place right now. It is very unsettling when more developed countries, even those with nuclear weapons, start getting into unnecessary fights because you never know if something might trigger it to spiral out of all control.",

Well we are over a year from the war now, and so obviously, we have seen the effects already. Last year was bad as it really affected the whole global economy, but this year, it seems that every country has adjusted and settled down a bit and now fighting it's on war in inflation.So maybe there will be more countries that are going to suffer due to war, but there could be some that has altered their outlook as far as the hardship of war and focus solely on how to improved everything thru their governments.And it could be one reason though that Bitcoin will end up at 6 digits for then next bull run as there are a lot of people who might hedge their wealth and used Bitcoin as store of value.",

This is obvious during warfare because the infrastructures are destroyed and companies are short down and affected so when there is no production, that will reduce every other activities around the company which will affect their IPO or stock selling. Wars are very devastating for every economic whether big or small, to avoid war is more profitable than to allow it to happen because it leads to different calamity and it destabilizes an economy and set them 100 years backward .",

You’re right and the list keeps going. War is not a good thing and should not be encouraged. It is better to always end up in a truce than to escalate the matter into a war. War have destroyed many nations in the past and any country that have faced war before don’t always pray for it to happen again because of the everlasting and irreplaceable loss it always does to the people living in that vicinity or nation. An example is the war between the Russia and Ukraine which has not come to an end, another one is the internal war in Sudan that already claimed many lives and left properties. It is disheartening seeing all this happening in a supposedly said to be peaceful world.",
