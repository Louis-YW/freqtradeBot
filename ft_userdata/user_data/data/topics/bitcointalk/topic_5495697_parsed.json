However, there are so much to hate about how governments and banks work on the ground. And those are what I'm particularly against. That governments continuously devalue money to the detriment of ordinary people, for example, is something that everybody should be against. To protest against this doesn't necessarily mean to protest against the existence of a government.That banks irresponsibly risk their clients' money in investments they alone choose and decide is something that every bank customer should be against. But to be against this doesn't necessarily mean going against the existence of banks.",

With Bitcoin scalabilty, I don't see the need of having an extreme Anti Bank. Bitcoin and Fiat could play 2+2=5, a synergy. I hold Bitcoin and I trust myself Control if wealth and some level of privacy doesn't make one a villain. The current system is failing and we need something to help mitigate this. I think you getting it wrong, Bitcoin doesn't really promote Anti Government but doesn't support Centralization They different It's not attacking the government in any way Just granting financial freedom to the public without the need of a central Body. Besides the government in all their flaws are needed Without a central Body The world will fall into chaos,  not everybody are ready to drive their lives themselves.",

I'm speaking for myself here but I HODL BTC but I'm not anti-government and banks. I believe the POV that you are trying to pertain to is that there are people who want the government to stop controlling everything, making it anti-government but that could be a case-to-case basis. It's something that you need to understand that it's not going to be always the case unless your government is corrupt and you want to promote transparency. Using BTC as the mode of payment makes it so that it's publicly available and can be seen. There's a lot of discussion for this.",

You need money to survive, so your salary will still go into your bank account, you also can't spend your Bitcoin in the real world without changing it into Fiat and that Fiat will head into your bank account. Look around you and tell me how many stores are accepting crypto payment? It would have been a different case if Bitcoin is widely accepted this days, I as a person would totally stop using the bank for good but it is not going to happen.Stooping the bank is like stopping the government, the only solution is co-existing, and let's not forget that the government will forever keep hating on any invisible ways of spending money, because of criminals and illegal activities, they won't want such, so Bitcoin money to bank account is inescapable.",

We Bitcoin holders as well are not anti-government or anti banks but probably we just hate it since there were just too many things that weren't right at all, but still, we all have governments in different countries and we are a part of it, we use fiat system that's government and banks right. So we are supporting banks and government for sure, but there were just people on position on the government that is just wasnt doesnt the right thing that is why we hate it much, not to mention that the fiat system is just a huge scheme, but still it is what it is we just cant do anything about it the only thing we could do about it is to adjust on it.Yes, I trust mostly a lot of Bitcoin holders that I know, but for sure there were some limitations on that, if you doesnt know someone then they not instantly going to earn your trust not just they are a Bitcoin holders, remember that there are a lot of scammers and hackers out there, if your install going to trust Bitcoin holders they will take advantage of you and scam you, so we always need to be careful on trusting anyone since hackers and scammers are probably investors as well.",
