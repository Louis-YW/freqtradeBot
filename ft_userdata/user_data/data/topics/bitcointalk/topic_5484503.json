  "content": "New Concern Regarding the Future of Bitcoin and Crypto Industries !I have been reading the recent news and doing a deep research on many complex matters over the last ten years. I have observed that a group of pro fiat alliance is trying to harm the progress of Bitcoin and decentralised digital currency industry. Recently I have notice some thing sinister and it is hidden in the COPA v Craig Wright case currently on hearing in London. If the conclusion the COPA suing is properly understood by the Justice Mellor and COPA win the case then the developers has nothing to fear of Craig but if the case under judged and Craig win the case then there will be chaos in the Bitcoin and Crypto industry. Therefore, I am, trying to find a solution to the later, if anything goes wrong.  As we know that don't trust but verify is the true freedom of crypto currency but governments and the  big financial institutions are the powerful entities we have to overcome. Therefore, it is time for the Bitcoin and Crypto community to be alert in every possible ways.",

Government have tried in the past to kill bitcoin but the more they try, the more bitcoin shows them that it cannot be controlled or get rid of by anyone. This has made the government to see that fact and they don't have any choice than to let bitcoin be, so that they can also benefit from bitcoin potential by the approval of Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin is no longer a baby and nothing Wright can do about it because bitcoin is decentralized. Don't bother yourself thinking on what to do because bitcoin will fight for herself. Just relax and continue with your DCA because it is now that bitcoin will become more popular and increase in value than before.",

That's while Bitcoin is global.I also believe that no one on the surface of Earth at this point in time can wipe away Bitcoin. Bitcoin have come to stay and so shall it. Government cannot single-handedly take out bitcoin from its existence, the fact that bitcoin is an open source technology which is owned by everyone across the globe makes it even more difficult for bitcoin to be destroyed completely.The only thing such governments can do is to ban its citizens from using bitcoin which a lot of countries have attempted and still doing today. However, they cannot stop people from using bitcoin per se and the world will continue to embrace this new technology because the more they try to fight it, the more popular it becomes amongst people.",

Therefore, it is time for the Bitcoin and Crypto community to be alert in every possible ways.  When they say bitcoin is decentralized, this is to tell you that no country, no nation own Bitcoin and no government can fully control bitcoin, the highest thing they can do to bitcoin is to ban it or regulate it in particular jurisdiction but that doesn't mean it wouldn't do better in other part of the world. Look at China for example, in the year 2021 they have ban anything that has to do with Bitcoin which made the bitcoin price to crash because there were hunt down of even mining farms but today, bitcoin is trading at 45k and the mining has been even more decentralized than ever because we used to have more miners from China back then.As for institutional investors, they can only add or reduce the growth of bitcoin which is the price aspect of bitcoin, you can't control bitcoin no matter the power you have in this world. Even you want to plam 51% attack on bitcoin, it wouldn't sit well because you will only be wasting resources and hardfork will be done quick to stabilized the network. Worry not, bitcoin is here to stay and it's untouchable.",

Therefore, it is time for the Bitcoin and Crypto community to be alert in every possible ways.  These threats will not end because the government wants to do everything possible to control Bitcoin. We can overcome the government by avoiding centralised platforms and upholding the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. We should do everything within our power to protect our privacy. Although more draconian laws are been enacted to attack Bitcoin, the currency will always overcome them Quote from: iBaba on February 08, 2024, 06:56:43 PMThe only thing such governments can do is to ban its citizens from using bitcoin which a lot of countries have attempted and still doing today. However, they cannot stop people from using bitcoin per se and the world will continue to embrace this new technology because the more they try to fight it, the more popular it becomes amongst people.There were fears that the ban of Bitcoin by China would have grave consequences on the Bitcoin ecosystem. These predictions never happened because the currency was able to overcome them. Today the community is facing the same threat in the US and many people think that without this country Bitcoin might not flourish. Bitcoin is a transnational currency that cannot be bottled up by one nation.",

We are the people, we should be forming government to serve the people, instead in the modern democratic system only prominent plutocrats select and elect the members of parliament by the votes of the people. about 26 % to 35 % vote get casted. After the election, the ministers become the puppets in the hands of financial elites. This is the problem. We must find a long-term solution to the problem mainly the sovereign debts problem. Bitcoin was invented to help the poor country by diversifying the money global money movements with a decentralised Bitcoin model but Bitcoin and crypto space have been hijacked by those agents and causing problems, this is my concerns.",

COPA has excellent lawyers that are seeping through Wright’s facade. They have presented numerous evidences showing why Wright did not actually create bitcoin such as documents. It shows that Wright may have forged documents so he will appear to be Satoshi. However, COPA also presented credit card statements that shows inconsistency on Wright’s claims.Overall, I think Wright has a low chance of winning. This will not be the last time that someone will claim to be Satoshi or try to take credit of the success Bitcoin has right now.

Supportive regulations have made bitcoin's foundation stronger - while the community and its miners will continue to strengthen the network.So far, governments in various countries will only try to strengthen their centralized systems so that the interest of financial industry players does not completely shift to this decentralized currency. They will try to divert the community's attention to the CBDC - centralize them and keep everything centralized.",

Craig cannot make arbitrary changes and the crypto market doesn't give a shit about what a court in London thinks. Exactly my thoughts.  After going through the case between COPA vs Dr Craig Wright, many questions came on my mind. If Craig is really a threat to Bitcoin, wouldn't the real Satoshi come out to end this madness once and for all? No man will make such a wonderful invention like Bitcoin and allow one scammer to take all the glory. But then, how do we know who exactly is the real Satoshi?Then also, the case and every other battles that has been thrown at Bitcoin has opened my eyes to see that nothing can stop Bitcoin, not even the government. This is not the first time scammers are claiming to be Satoshi and they have all failed. More and more people like Craig will spring up but Bitcoin will remain unaffected. All thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto. We should all relax our minds and enjoy these wonderful invention because Bitcoin has come to stay",
