Anyone know what I am taking about?Remember Bitmex and it’s CEO Arthur Hayes who was arrested. What happened right after? One of the biggest bull runs in Bitcoins history.History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.",

I wonder how the crypto world is feeling about this right now, because I am honestly in shock that he admits to it. I know that they are doing these things and then some, and are expert in playing it safe. But to be accepting the charges? That's something.Hopefully it brings in good numbers for bitcoin, but I doubt it. It may even cause ripples of uncertainties in the crypto space, but only time will tell.",

And whether they're equal or not, I can't see a reason how it would be beneficial to Bitcoin's price. As a matter of fact, the price has already reacted. And it's moving southward. Anyway, these are harsh punishments. And the fact that it involved a cryptocurrency platform must have contributed to its severity. I'm not sure if this was a wise decision on the part of CZ. Probably, if only to make sure that Binance stays afloat in a largely hostile environment, but what if he actually ends up in jail and Binance went bankrupt just the same? All these so-called sacrifices would all be for naught.",

This make more sense now. Iran have always been blacklisted by most financial system probably the reason CZ followed the backdoor of rendering service to Iran through an unregistered  transmitter service. It is politics after all and CZ allowed himself to get involved. I will call it a bad business decision by CZ and Binance considering the fact that they have always been on the US radar for long. Exposing himself and the business he lead to the US government might not end well for him since the US still controls a lot of things. My major concern is how this will affect the entire cryptocurrency market because Binance is a leading figure in this space. Secondly, CZ stepping aside might lead to some form of risk in the future and I will advice everyone to be careful on the amount of funds kept in Binance for now.",

Binance is also reportedly going to replace its current CEO. Apart from that, with the proven accusations leveled at CZ, the crypto exchange also experienced a decline in market capitalization. But perhaps this will not have an effect for long, because the decline in market capitalization is probably just a surprised response from crypto investors. So after this, I am sure that market capitalization on crypto exchanges will return to normal, and may even experience a higher increase in market capitalization.",
