He has been asking for a loan for years, although he has received an answer and explanations countless times.btw. His collateral is some kind of story about the iPhone that he has and he can provide evidence about it. He thinks that holding something worth more than $500 in his hand is enough to get a loan here.ignoring and possibly deleting his troll posts is best for both us and him.",
