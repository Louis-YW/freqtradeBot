  "content": "So I just finished my last year of pharmacy school classes and have more free time now. As a result, I decided to start this project \"Crypto for the homeless\" mainly because I always wanted to get involved with something involving crypto (other than hodling). I also feel strongly compassionate for the homeless because of personal ties to loved ones who experienced it. Anyways, I went out twice so far and handed out some meals. Planning on going out again tomorrow - I was thinking of using a flyer this time with some QR codes and the url for the site to maybe help gain exposure. I definitely plan on expanding this as much as I can.BTC: 3Cdp95cJ2gWTfoH7ydszwxRztPRWgJhxJTBCH: qr0g850dfthha5v2fatmfvvmkz2nmwjqpgnfz0kywrDOGE: DDBHNdxmdZ2QXfDBdY1nC7CTUw4y1kz1ufLTC:

Indeed, if we will have more and more people doing charitable actions using cryptocurrencies then maybe we can counteract the bad image some people may have on this industry due to many scams and failures the market experienced so far. Helping others means that we continue on believing in the future of humanity. Sharing even a little can go a long, long way in providing a lifting arms for people who are really in need. It is sad that even in many developed countries, poverty pushed people to go homeless and with less access to basic societal services. But we can do something about it.",

As a result, I decided to start this project \"Crypto for the homeless\" mainly because I always wanted to get involved with something involving crypto (other than hodling). I also feel strongly compassionate for the homeless because of personal ties to loved ones who experienced it. Anyways, I went out twice so far and handed out some meals. Planning on going out again tomorrow - I was thinking of using a flyer this time with some QR codes and the url for the site to maybe help gain exposure. I definitely plan on expanding this as much as I can.http://cryptohomeless.home.blog - this is the url - check it out! help spread the word and donate some satoshis if you want! thanks!This is an noble cause that you’re undertaking and I’ll definitely promote it on Facebook, and other crypto related groups where I’m active. All the very best for this project and I am sure many people will benefit from it. Also I feel you’ll get lots of donations from the alt community, as I have seen them donate for such causes.",
