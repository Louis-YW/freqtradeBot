It has stopped working, but it is a registered company and you can sue them if they do not return your money to you. Most of the people who were unable to recover their money had KYC problems.Quote from: YOSHIE on May 27, 2023, 06:36:43 PMThere are --+ 26 victims crying here: Topic: Localbitcoins SCAMMERS !!! 26 accounts!!!Tell them to return all Bitcoins to their rightful/owners.I did not understand the point of mentioning this topic because it talks about a scammer who exploits influential accounts on LBC in order to deceive beginners, and the platform has nothing to do with that because the scammer is trying to circumvent the terms of use of the platform.Quote from: RetnuhMacs on May 28, 2023, 06:06:13 AMThe fraud company Localbitcoins already stopped operating, because of their bad reputation.Can you prove that, because according to what I know, the main reason is competition.",
