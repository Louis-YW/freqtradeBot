Until some update asked him for the password and he is still looking for a way to find it out.I wanted to ask you if you know of similar cases in recent years. We all know that in the early years a lot of bitcoins were lost because they were worth pennies, most people didn't even imagine where this could go, there was no HW and things like that. But even though the bitcoin loss rate has been reduced in the last years I am sure there will still be human errors like the one in the quote that will end up with bitcoin loss, which is not bad for the rest because as Satoshi said they are like a donation.Do you know of similar cases?",

In the case you mention, although the person loses access, the coins are in the possession of the exchange, they are not lost.But thanks for sharing the story anyway.",

And also since you mentioned it's mobile wallet then it's not possible to use the wallet file for recovery purpose too (if I am not wrong).",

In recent years, more people know about it but in practice, they can do it very badly and ignore basic steps. It's hard to teach someone and give them enough motivation for doing good practice at beginning. They usually want to experience it by themselves, learn lessons and after all will remember about lessons they already learned.How to backup a seed phrase? It can help someone but can be meaningless with others.",

For most wallet it will definitely recommend you back up the wallet when setting it up and when you wish to proceed without that it actually asks for the seed phrase for most of the time victims usually copy the seed phrase to a temporary place and then after losses it. Biometrics are usually bad way of accessing wallet as you can forget your password after a long time. Nonetheless even with remembrance of the password there is nothing that beats actually backing up your seed phrase, if you use hardware wallets there are some that even automatically logs you out after any firmware update and requires one to actually re import the seed phrase, at this stage even a password cannot recover that wallet I have heard of lost wallets like this in the past, so it is possible",

But: what if he'd lost his device? there are so many things bad about what he did, I couldn't believe it when he confessed me his loss.There is a point in this forum when you can start looking at anyone who says \"not your keys not your coins\" like a spammer with nothing better to say than what is so basic for many, but after knowing that case of my friend I've become aware of the importance of repeating it to avoid newbies making such a regrettable mistake.",
