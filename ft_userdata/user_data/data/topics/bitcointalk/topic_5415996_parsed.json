Well, at least that's what I did 6 years ago when I got Telegram for the first time.

That's what they mean with a telegram account without your real phone.If this service is possible that's because people don't have good security practices with their accounts, anyone can go to their privacy settings > Phone number, and hide the number for all as you can see in the next image.",

It some kind of data leak and OP got the data from the leak. Years ago I was doing something and it struck me that it's possible to get the numbers. There were some bots which allowed to see phone numbers. That time telegram was fairly new. Since then I never thought of using telegram.",

It might be in high demand in the industry but I don't consider it right. If you are doing this under cybersecurity arm for a fraudulent attack on someone or on a transaction then its ok but if not, then, I don't consider it ideal and should not be patronised as it will breed something more than what it currently is.",
