Some strategies work for a certain amount of time and then fail.Most strategies that you come.up with that are successful will only work until enough other people find them or they get a lot of volume/volatility behind them so the market changes.It has more to do with price range or price channel of the asset is trading at over time. So, apparently the bots work best in sideways markets. As soon as the trend of the market changes, that when they stop working and a new piece range has to be set up for the grid trading to work again, or else the trader has to wait until the price of the asset goes back to the price range.Quote from: jackg on August 09, 2022, 04:24:34 PMI'd guess these get listed as doing well as they might've worked for some time in the past but they're still likely gambling and are likely impossible to predict.True",

I think I earned from my trial and try again and unfortunately Ive incurred loss that time. So to my experience, I think its always to do manual or spot trading on your own, especially if you are ready to risk some funds on trading. Im not gonna let a bot handle a massive financial and knowing it could ruin yout portfolio.",

Quote from: Husires on August 09, 2022, 01:28:48 PMbut the system as a whole will still work out of greed.Not only greed but also because of laziness as I believe that some people won't learn on their own but will just use a system like this to do the work for them. Of course the trader will bear the problem because they are the ones that do trading and not the system that the customer is using and obviously there is some sort of a fee to use a function like this because this can come in handy. The only disadvantage of using this is that you won't become good on your own because you are only depending on someone else ability.",

      "body": "The problem with many of these bots is that they only work in either ranging or trending markets. So during a bull run you will see many of these bots in profit. However when the trend settles and it starts to range that is when you are going to experience nothing but losses.Another issue is the large stop losses they use . They take profit early but hold on to their losers until they get break even. Eventually what will happen is they will end up getting their entire balance drained when the loss becomes too large.",

Besides that we still have to monitor our trades so it's better to do manual trading itself.",
