They deleted the topic you posted it and that caused all the posts made in that thread to be removed.As far as I know, you also don't get any notification if your topic is moved to trashcan.",

Is there any special reason for this?Are you talking about this plagiarised thread created by you? If an entire thread is deleted, you dont get notified I guess. And try to avoid spamming too much or you may also receive a temp. ban next time. I even suggested you to stop this in that (deleted) thread as well.",

As I see in the archived version of that post on loyce.club, OP had added a link to the source. So, it shouldn't be considered as plagiarism. The user would be banned, if that post had been deleted due to plagiarism. That topic was deleted probably due to being a low-value post.",
