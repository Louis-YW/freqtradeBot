  "content": "I have been waiting for a open source multi-chain wallet all this while, I believe if any devs are able to pull this off popular wallets like Trust wallet and co won't be that important as the best hot wallets anymore...After going some diggings I might have come across the first of its kind multi-chain wallet and why won't I bring that for my famz on here maybe I am missing out on something? The name of this wallet is called Airgap, it's a fully open source wallet that supports multiple crypto coins, two devices are availabe, a cold storage and normal watch-only wallet..I am not perfect that's why I bring this to you guys, do your own diligence research and please drop your feedback, shine up your lights where there is darkness. Thank You",

Airgap is not the only open source multichain wallet, and it is mostly used in combination with their Airgap vault app as cold storage, and free alternative for hardware wallets.I know few other open source wallets that can be used, one is called Unstoppable.money and it can be used only on smartphones.Second wallet is called AtomicDex, it can be used as a wallet and as exchange with atomic swaps, and this can be used both on computers and on smartphones.Safest option is using Trezor Suite app in combination with Trezor hardware wallet, but this is not free option.",

      "body": "If you're storing multiple coins, an extra investment is worth it IMO. Not to mention some of these apps are unsupported on older devices. Using your main phone might not be a good idea if security is your concern since even play store is not free from malware. Better be careful so you don't lose your money due to some mistakes.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on November 04, 2022, 01:17:03 PMwhere are these coming from today? I'm glad I opened this topic. Thanks, I will check these two wallets out, thanks again. You can search on this forum, usually, a new wallet app will post an ANN. Other sources are from social media like Reddit, or articles. At least that's how I learn about new apps.",

I don't know how to explain but I feel it can help to protect my fund better. I don't want to have a wallet for multi-chains as if something bad happens with one chain, I feel unsafe for my coins on other chains. I should not abandon that wallet because one chain has issues.With that worry, I feel better to use one wallet for one chain and I will more easily to abandon one wallet.",

      "body": "Based on your image it looks like it's an airgap vault from airgap.it I'm also using that wallet. You need two devices to make your wallet safe you can also install it both on the same device the airgap wallet and the vault but it would be useless because the purpose of this wallet is to use it as an Airgap wallet.The best thing about this wallet you can use metamask as your watch-only wallet and use only Airgap vault to sign a transaction.The only downside is that they only support a few coins if you are looking for an air gap wallet that support many coins and token then a ledger or Trezor is your best option.",
