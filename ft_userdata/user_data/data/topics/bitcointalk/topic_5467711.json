The transaction doesn't show in the History tab, only in the Receive tab. It has 21 hours left and it will expire. I have tried to track using the transaction ID but they receiving address is a different BTC address. I made sure that I sent the correct address and my friend copied it using his phone, so I don't think he coppied it wrong.Can the money be recovered with a request that is in the wrong amount?

Check if you see the address that you are referring to. If your friend send the coin to the right address, you will see your coin even before I has one confirmation one Electrum. Bitcoin address can not expire. Even if you want, you can continue to use a single address for receiving payment, but that may affect your privacy.Do not accept unconfirmed transaction, let it has at least 1 confirmation.Quote from: skydragon3747 on September 22, 2023, 01:13:30 PMThe transaction doesn't show in the History tab, only in the Receive tab. Likely either your device or your friend device has clipboard malware, in a way you or him will copy the address, but the device will paste hackers address. Check and recheck address before you send it to someone or before you make bitcoin transaction. Go and check the address you sent your friend and look for it on your Electrum wallet as I explained about it.",

They don't change how much someone can send you and addresses are good forever and never expire. However if your friend sent to the wrong address then there is nothing you can do about that. You have to ask him why he sent to a different address than the one you gave him.",

If you are sending the address through a message, it is likely that it can be replaced by a hackers address.
