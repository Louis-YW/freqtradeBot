This thread came up yesterday which seems a good alternative to battle addiction which is to divert the addiction to another addictive game. Somehow it could be a solution for a while in order for the addict to divert its attention to somewhere else. He could be battling this addiction soon but at least this will be another topic. PS4 is not so bad though. Somehow addicted to PS4 games is acceptable.",

      "body": "there are many ways to overcome addiction at a lower cost and more effectively and it all depends on the level of addiction.as I would say, like when someone is addicted to online gambling and when they want to recover from their addiction, they do the initial stages of closing access to the internet, which means not accessing the internet through anything and staying away from news or anything related to gambling and then venting into other activities that are more useful to divert. mind not to think about gambling and if you have the courage to hide yourself not to leave the house, that is also an effective way.but remember everyone has stages in how addiction occurs. I mean offline or online addiction occurs and it depends on which country he lives in because some countries do not allow gambling businesses so healing yourself from addiction is a little easier if you are in a country that prohibits gambling.",

Thanks.Being open to your family, friends or someone close to you is the cheapest way to resolve gambling addiction. You are only gambling because you don’t have other things to do on your free time that why you get the entertainment you are missing on social to gambling.Having someone to look for you and remind you is better alternative on therapy since the therapist usually just want you to share and talk to your problem as way of solution. Most of gambling addicted friends stop gambling after being socialized frequently in a form of bonding especially with beer. Also being busy on job and having a good salary is other alternative to solve your gambling addiction cheaply and profitable at the same time.",

This is why some gambling addicts would really be just that simply be keeping that addiction for themselves and wont really be tending to tell someone. Self will should be enough and then if it doesnt work then family help would be next in line but if not then therapy would be your option.",

These organizations charge a monthly fee for the patient to live in that place isolated from family, friends and the cause of the addiction. Based on the data they have released, the number of addicts they manage to cure is a very large number, meaning it is really worth putting addicts there to be treated. There are also private clinics for people who have a lot of money to go for treatmentThe fact is that an addict has no control over their financial assets, in most cases that I saw in my country it was like this. That's why it has all the responsibility of paying for the addict's hospitalization in the clinic or in the low-cost hospitalization centers that are created by non-governmental organizations, I'm talking about the case in my country. addiction is a disease like any other disease, so relatives must help in these cases, and in the case of bad luck, the patient in most cases has no conditions whatsoever to manage his money, and they even recommend that he not get it. money, which is why relatives pay all the bills related to treatment",

Of course the number of sessions must be more limited than when paying for a private session, but since you are looking for low costs alternatives, you have to take it into consideration. Probably a session once in a month is possible on this model of public treatment.However, keep in mind the quality of the service has its price. After all, the professional took 5 years of his life, besides further years spent on higher specializations and updates on his career to offer the best as possible to his patients, so you really can't expect he is going to work for free or for cheap prices, unless you go to professionals who don't take their jobs seriously.",

Handling a gambling addicts is considered to be one of the difficult situations to find oneself in, I tell you for free, it's not an easy path down the road. You're right, the therapy recommendations comes with a fee, because nothing is settled free in the space, these addicts ought to pay major fee inother to have relevant responses that's pleasant to the ears.",

Thanks.Most private therapy sessions are very expensive but there are government-owned therapy doctors and personnel's  that you can get at affordable rates depending on the place you stay or your country.But you will need to divert that addiction to something else because it cannot go almost immediately so you can either redirect it to someone else like reading books or watching a movie, pending when you will fully recover from your addition. But personally you can actually do it on your own, if you're determined to stop the addiction habit, you can do it by training yourself by giving yourself some good discipline, you where not born with it, so why can't you stop it on your own.",

Thanks.I'm not really sure why these people should even be gambling if they have no source of income especially for unemployed or students. They shouldn't be gambling in the first place. Anyways, for those who are employed, usually there free therapy sessions that are provided by the company that you can use to assist you with your addiction. But for unemployed, it's best to start it with your own if you don't have any means to reach out for some help from a therapist by just trying to avoid gambling or even finding other hobby to take your time or be busy about. Also, you can try interacting or socialize with other people or even find a job or work to focus on. As for students, just focus on your study, I don't think that you'll be thinking gambling anytime soon if you're already stress with your academics.",

Even in this situation if the person's mind isn't ready to accept and get rid of addiction it won't be effective. A friend of mine went to alcohol de-addiction centre and he was under treatment for about 1 month. This is not about sessions, but it was like giving complete change of life. Within the centre they'll be taught about life, counseling sessions, they'll undergo some personality improvement. When they're within the centre they never think of alcohol and they hate it. The next day he came out of it, he has started to be the same as the past. In my understanding we ourselves should have the acceptance, if not this can go ineffective.",
