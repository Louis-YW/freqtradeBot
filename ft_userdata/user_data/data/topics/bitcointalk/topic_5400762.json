Be carefullCan you provide some more detail, please?  I've never used the Changenow service (fees are way to high,) but they've been around quite some time and I haven't heard of them being scammers before[1].  TrustPilot lists over 7k reviews with 4.8 stars average.  I'll refrain from discussing the reliability of TrustPilot reviews, that's another subject.Are you sure you were dealing with the right site, and didn't get phished?ETA:[1]Quote from: hosseinimr93 on May 30, 2022, 08:20:23 PMQuote from: DireWolfM14 on May 30, 2022, 08:11:18 PMbut they've been around quite some time and I haven't heard of them being scammers before.

The best way to have the more control over your asset is to use a decentralized exchanges like https://localcryptos.com/, https://hodlhodl.com/ which are P2P exchanges. Or go for more decentralized one like https://bisq.network/ which is also p2p. These are better than using a centralized exchanges.",

I don't use such platforms so I can't comment on the performance and quality of the service.I can see that they have a live chat that is available around the clock. Have you spoken with one of their agents about the problem? Speaking about the problem, what is it exactly.  This is their forum representative. The person isn't that active and was last online back in March, but you can still try to contact them and provide precise information about what happened.No one cares about one-line scam accusations btw. You have to do better than that.",

We, as in ChangeNOW, had some issues with BTC, and that took a while but it was fixed. We informed our customers via Telegram group https://t.me/changeNOW_chat as we do for every single change.Your deposit of 0.2906 XMR was made 30.05.2022, 17:48:54 and your exchange was completed 30.05.2022, 19:34:51. That's less than 2 hours, and the delay was caused by BTC issues. Let me know if you have more questions, I would be happy to help and answer. So I guess, OP should make an edit and say that he got BTC under 2 hours after he made a deposit. That would be fair. Or not. Either way, this was not a scam in any possible way.

Every exchange will be processed accordingly, BUT, if the transaction is flagged (as you mentioned, coins are tainter or linked to illicit activity) by an AML check (one of the checks is done by https://amlbot.com/, the customer will need to go through KYC and AML procedures. In most cases, customers can reject to do KYC and still get a refund. [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

IF AML check turns out bad, customers will be \"forced\" to go through KYC/AML procedure, so that is the \"most\" part. If the customer fails to pass AML then crypto stays in limbo, no one will have access to it. There's also a section in Terms of Use that ChangeNOW can donate crypto to charity, but that's for countries that are prohibited by applicable law, not for illicit crypto.",

You can't get these details, I can, so that tells you I'm connected with ChangeNOW. EDIT:If you, or anyone else, wants to check me, feel free to go here https://t.me/changeNOW_chat our official telegram group, and search for @AlmightyshO (telegram name Better Call shO), you will see that I'm one of the admins there. So that could be some kind of verification. https://i.imgur.com/a7I30YX.pngEDIT #2:Either way, the point of my post was that OP got his BTC. There was 2 hours delay. No scam. EDIT #3:If anyone has an issue with a stuck ChangeNOW exchange, feel free to DM me and I'll help you out. EDIT #4:If anyone decides to contact me, regarding stuck ChangeNOW exchange, all I need is exchange ID (it's 14 characters long, sometimes 24 if it goes via SwapZone, for example), and txhash (from deposit). That's it, nothing else. I will never ask for keys, mnemonics or give you links to fill out an online form, or ask for money in return  You're safe with me.",
