What kind of propagandist is going on in your country?)We support whoever is doing the right thing. The right thing is to slow down a full takeover of the World by the evil entity, stop One World Government, and to help neighbors under attacked by the wicked, which is exactly what Russia & Others (whether in other parts of the world, in Ukraine or Russia or both) are used for.Fortunately I tuned to what our Kingdom (which is not of this World) says and I use the information to judge things here... which is all that matter. When I listen, read or go through what people of this World and their nations say I tend to focus on what is right/true and ignore what is not true, what is wrong or bad.",
