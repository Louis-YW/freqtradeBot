Whenever I dey pass by, I often hear people arguing about the Israel and Palestine war, with many people expressing support for Israel and making reference to the Bible always makes me wonder if it is a religious war. They've made it seem like a religious conflict, which is very annoyingWith all the traumatizing videos of the Palestine and Israel conflict I've seen so far, it's indeed to say that the heart of man is wicked. To think that people are supporting a particular side because of their religious beliefs is also very disheartening. Seeing videos of children and adults being killed should not make anyone say derogatory words, ours it's to pray in our hearts for peace and not make annoying comments. Some people don't even know the origin of the war.Â From my understanding, Hamas is a terrorist group that attacked Israel, and in turn, Israel is also killing innocent civilians in Palestine. So imagine Boko Haram decides to throw a bomb at a neighboring country. Does this mean we innocent citizens, deserve to die for a crime Boko Haram committed?My point is this, none of these people deserve to die. I pray that they can come to a resolution and let there be peace.War is not something anyone should make jokes about.Please note that this is my understanding of the war. If you have a different opinion, feel free to share it in the comments.",
