I have seen most of discussions related to Bitcoin price on pessimistic side only. But we should look at all the possibilities. It won't happen because with Bitcoin, there is NO MINT function like smart contract altcoins or tokens.There will be never sudden massive appearance of new circulating supply like Do Kwon did with Terra and LUNA token (now is LUNA Classic LUNC). Without black swan event like this, Bitcoin will hold its price very well.The trading volume of Bitcoin nowadays is big enough to avoid massive dump from market manipulation like what you are worrying.How is the 21 million Bitcoin cap defined and enforced?Quote from: satoshi on February 14, 2010, 03:52:23 PMRight.  Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating.  In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.",

I have seen most of discussions related to Bitcoin price on pessimistic side only. But we should look at all the possibilities. That's unlikely to occur because when the price drops and people get worried, not everyone can sell their holdings. The lowest price might be $1, at least. Maybe the right word to use is 'drop' or 'collapse,' and it could happen, my friend. But let's not dwell on that because the cryptocurrency market is too vast to collapse. It's not controlled by a group of people; it's owned by us within the ecosystem. So, as long as there's demand for Bitcoin, there will be a price that remains, even if the issue of high volatility isn't resolved.",

      "body": "You might mean optimistic. Many are indeed speaking about the good possibilities of Bitcoin in the future like it will rise back to its ATH or it will reach $100,000. Others are even over optimistic that they predict Bitcoin's price to the millions. I agree that we should all be looking at all the possibilities however unlikely they may be. Personally, I've considered this already and if Bitcoin falls to zero, I will become poorer. I'm not afraid, though. I've been poor all my life. That's something I'm very familiar about. I've improved a lot now but I'm betting almost all I have on Bitcoin. Should I fail, I'll just go back to how I lived in the past. I won't have to enter a strange life. But what really makes me strongly confident about my bet on Bitcoin is that it's really hard to fail. I mean look at what's available for us right now. Fiat? Not only is it under the control of abusers, it's fundamentally designed to continuously lose value. And there's no other alternative. So far, there's really nothing that seriously bothers me on my Bitcoin bet.I admit, however, that Bitcoin being an intergenerational wealth is questionable. Technology is fast advancing. A hundred years from now, what technology would be capable of is unimaginable.",

I have seen most of discussions related to Bitcoin price on pessimistic side only. But we should look at all the possibilities. You will definitely get most discussions in a pessimistic mode if it's about the topic of Bitcoin going to zero. Who's going to be optimistic about that topic if it's useless because of it being zero?When it becomes zero, people think that there is no more use on it and whatever purpose it has got is done then we will have to find another the same thing as Bitcoin that could grow in value over time and will also have the use case that we, everybody needs. But are we gonna find something as valuable as bitcoin whenever it becomes out of the league? I don't think that we'll ever find something the same as Bitcoin because it's one of a kind. There have been other projects the same as is but never had been the same or at least close to Bitcoin because it is unique. So for my life if it becomes zero, just have to move on and do whatever I wanna do in life basically will just continue.",

I would be so happy because if the price of BTC is going to be zero I can then buy a million of the coin without using money. Well, jokingly aside, I think you mean what if one day BTC is going to be worthless or just forgotten by the people and is wiped out from the face of the Earth. So what if this will happen? I think the first question is: Will this happen? And I don't think so...that is already impossible.",

But that does not means I'll just throw it away but I'll keep it. Who knows, the price of Bitcoin could increase again and could even rise higher than before.But with the development of Bitcoin as it is now, the price of Bitcoin will not reach zero per Bitcoin even though that could happen. But it seems difficult and I hope you are not pessimistic about it and remain confident that the price of Bitcoin will increase very high in the future.But all possibilities can happen because nothing can last forever in this world. But instead of thinking about things like that, you should use the time now to have more Bitcoins. That will be better for you because you can have the opportunity to make big profits later.",

Those who had this thinking are probably broke by now or struggling to survive.  Well, for the sake of this discussion, I will respond. Normally I grew up with the mindset of not keeping all my eggs in one basket. So, there are other means I will still survive with even though most of my investment is in Bitcoin. My style and decision is to hold it for long, that means I'm already surviving through other means. Those who depend on Bitcoin entirely may not hold Bitcoin and are usually quick to sell unless they have set asides some funds for their daily needs.",

Now, to answer OP's question about what happens to me when the price goes that way, I don't think that there's not a lot that's going to happen, I don't let bitcoin be the only source of my income so the only thing that might happen is that I'm going to have to work harder in my jobs or find a new and better paying one if the need arises.",

This scenario came up on your mind is so hard to come knowing how far already reach by bitcoin and even if there's massive dumping situation will happen still it will not come to the point that bitcoin will go to zero since on whatever situation it may go thru there are still people will buy this.But since you are thinking that and want to ask people here for sure it can affect them so bad especially if they are heavily invested their time,effort and money on bitcoin for sure majority of us will be so sad if this case will really happen since we don't have any chance to earn back thru bitcoin since for reaching zero in value for sure this is totally dead and can't able to recover back. But its really so far to happen so newbies thinking about this to happen should not get worried since bitcoin is already a strong crypto and it cannot be dump as easy as that.",

There must be a strong factor why Bitcoin will be worth 0, such as a nuclear war breaking out and making the whole world experience the death of computer technology and so on.

Obviously we can't sell it to anyone because its value is 0 and no one can access it if something bad like the one above happens.",

Bitcoin is not the typical coin where the project owners could easily remove liquidity or rug pull, that could crash the price as we've seen in some projects. It is an open source and community driven project with no smart contract or hidden code. The highest that can come close to affecting the price is market sentiments, like when there's cases of hack, pandemic, regulations and crypto exchange crackdown. IMO, that's as far as it can go and there's absolutely nothing that can bring the price to zero.",

Yes bitcoin can only get to zero only when it is worthless or many people do not have it in there possession this can only be possible when we have a new cryptocurrency that betters bitcoin or a hard fork of bitcoin and everyone is expected to move to another network and those still holding bitcoin will then have it to be worthless, now the question is will this happen? I don’t think it will ever happen because this current bitcoin network is near perfect of what a cryptocurrency or digital asset should be, we could only see soft forks or BIPs and nothing more. But should that be the case, if it happens then it wouldn’t happen over night it will gradually change to zero and there will be news surrounding it’s fall so I wouldn’t be so shocked, i would have taken my funds off it by then.",
