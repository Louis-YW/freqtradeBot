In a recent highlight of events, the American economist’s bank is set to be liquidated. This comes 6 weeks after Puerto Rican regulators suspended the institution. Schiff will remit $66.7M in deposits & $300k fines as part of the agreementPeter Schiff revealed on Tuesday that he has reached a deal with Puerto Rican authorities to liquidate his bank, Euro Pacific International Bank. This is according to a report by the New York Times.Amidst the probe launched, Puerto Rican authorities noted that the bank was insolvent. However, documents reveal that it did have cash. In the liquidation terms, Schiff assented to the remittance of $66.7M in deposits to the authorities. Additionally, Schiff is to use gold as a surrogate payment means for any cash deficit. As part of the liquidation agreement, he also consented to pay about $300,000 in fines.

Due to the fact that Bitcoin will save him from liquidation. Lol Sounds like someone who has no choice but to a few past cases where crypto critics were soft on Bitcoin.Peter Schiff may still think gold is an alternative for now, but don't forget that holding large amounts of gold will only keep him trapped in taxation rules that are not far from bank rules. So we wait for a new chapter in how he tries to avoid crypto like his critics.",

This is due to the fact that he remains a dedicated critic of crypto. Most crypto proponents used the event as an avenue to remind Schiff of the need for decentralisation in finance.Despite this, Schiff has not relented in his criticism of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. He has especially recently taken to Twitter to slam MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor on his bullish Bitcoin comments. He remains a staunch advocate of gold which he advises investors to go for instead of BTC.Which means Peter Schiff may remain being a permanent bitcoin critic. Quote from: mk4 on August 11, 2022, 06:06:13 AMNot sure if I completely get it, but how is him turning to bitcoin going to help him in this case, or at least prevent what happened?That is true, I have watched the man's interview before, he does not believe in bitcoin because bitcoin is not like gold for him, as bitcoin is represented in numbers, unlike gold, but he forgot that nothing has value unless they got value from humans, and value comes from scarcity and demand. Bitcoin was designed in a way to have value, just like gold. I do not see OP to be related to Peter Schiff criticism too, but seem to be a question which he forgot to also include in the OP, but included in the OP title.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 11, 2022, 09:04:50 AMI have a different opinion. I think that he has bought some bitcoin long ago and hodling. Of course, not for the tech, not for the freedom, instead, purely as investment. I see no other reason he spends this much time keeping an eye on everything that happens with bitcoin (and some more).Maybe he does not want bitcoin to dominate in the future, maybe he just believe in gold. It is possible that he has bought bitcoin, but no one knows that. I think he is just fixated with the gold things and something that are physically valuable and panic with something digital. He will always critize bitcoin for no two reasons, for gold. But bitcoin adoption continues as other critics like him and him continue to criticize bitcoin.",
