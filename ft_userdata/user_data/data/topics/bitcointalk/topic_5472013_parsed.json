      "body": "Why not just use an exchange in doing so? You can do this if Binance is allowed in your country, it's way easier, cheaper and safer than looking for someone to deal with you personally.Because in some cases, there have been personal attacks like $5 wrench attacks and you just want to avoid that from happening. Aside from Binance, there are also other exchanges that you can use.https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/",

      "body": "OP, meeting up with strangers to trade crypto is way more risky than just doing it online. Even if you meet up to exchange small amounts or do it in public places. There is a high chance that you will become the target of robbers, and they will trail you or attack you in less secure places.Remember, Bitcoin is digital gold. There are so many people out there are yearning to have it at whatever cost.",
