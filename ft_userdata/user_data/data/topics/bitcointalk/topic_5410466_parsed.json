      "body": "Aren't you the guy who claims he can singlehandedly influence Bitcoin's price or am I thinking of some other maniac? If it's a different person, I am pretty sure you have made some other ridiculous claims here like being an official Bitcoin ambassador (of a decentralized project), owning an offshore investment/trading platform, offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in your fake ambassador program... But at the same time asking what bitcoin is, what a blockchain is, if bitcoin exists in the blockchain or in wallets, etc.Whoever thinks about working with this person should check out the amount of ridiculousness that comes out of their mouth.",
