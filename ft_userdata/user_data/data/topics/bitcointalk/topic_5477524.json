  "content": "I recently stumbled upon Daniel Schmachtenberger, a macro-economist, macro-ecologist, philosopher and much more. He's given plenty of interviews and talks that can be found on youtube and other platforms.Most interesting to me is his way of connecting the dots in an ever increasingly complex world (thus the \"macro\" in most of his titles). One of his main claims is that by trying to solve a problem (locally) new ones emerge because the focus was too narrow, which in return often creates more (level 2, 3 etc) problems that in the long run make the solution to the initial problem void (or let's call it -EV). In any case, the reason I mention this here in the Bitcoin forum, is his view on fiat money, the ongoing printing of money and the underlying exponential growth rate that will inevitably result in catastrophy. Daniel claims this is not sustainable in the long run and we are approaching planetary boundaries: The planet's resources are finate and linear and thus are starting to be unable to fulfill the exponential rate of growth. One of the main drivers of this system we are all entangled in is the current currency system we use, which enables this insane increase in monetary supply: the central bank controlled fiat money.I'd highly recommend to check out some of his talks, you can give it a start with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&t=260sIf you have any insights on Daniel Schmachtenbergers theories and thoughts or his stance in regards to the fiat system as one of the main drivers for some of societies biggest challanges right now, feel free to discuss and comment. Input in regards of similar thinkers like Daniel is also most welcome.I resere the right to remove any random OT posts or ramblings, so don't bother with spam please.",
