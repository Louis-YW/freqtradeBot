This book which yo would want to write would be of big interest by forum members and I hope you know it would take a good research to put up things in other. I will suggest you take an introductory of generation of financial technology/revolution in a brief description and how it gave birth to mordern day financial technology. This will make your work super interesting to see and do well to conduct an interview with prominent bankers and financial technologist I believe you will get more insight of the evolution of bitcoin and blockchain.This research will give you good edge in bitcoin technology. If I may ask what methodology are you using to get your data. Let the discussion begin here. You have done well to raise this thread.",

Sheesss!!I love your ideas cus you're a troubadour; as a matter of fact, I don't really know how far you've gone with your promotional strength, but I know that you're gonna make something good -- that's if you're serious about it -- for that reason, I'll advise you to use the forum search engines to check out for topics that several experiences have been analysed;, get 'em data at their simplest form and create something profound outta its adopted meaning -- that'll still be connected to it's original meaning. I'm afraid only a few will start saying alot now: that's why we actually make 'em posts whatsoever... 10 years in future if the forum stays alive, anyone would still read this post.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Maybe Alex Gladstein's book \"Check your financial privilege\" is what you look for. It's a great list of unique stories from people discussing how Bitcoin is beneficial for them. After all, these stories are not from 1st world countries as Bitcoin is much more useful for peple in dysfunctional countries like Sudan, Senegal, Kuba or Venezuela. Since Gladstein is a human rights activist, he's always looking for improvements.",

CSW is one fair example of a storyteller, a good one probably because he has convinced a considerable amount of individuals. But we all know he's a liar. So, asking for indubitable proofs like a signature from an address when, for example, you are \"collecting statistics on the largest (B)itcoin hodlers\" is probably a good idea.",

Looking from the outside reflecting on the glass the images behind are two guys who I think I have seen 10 minutes before the transaction happened. Pretending to not notice them I just walk outside past some baker's store and I still glance a bit at them watching me.

I might not know how you want to organize the book, but I think your idea is a good one if it is properly built on and actualized. I have read about some bitcoin maestros in this forum, therefore using the search option is one of the best means of getting some of these inspirational stories. I don't know if it would be possible to identify the biggest bitcoin holders because most of them are anonymous, except for corporate bodies that publish their financial statements. You might not also find their worth in Forbes or other magazines. Stories about those that started bitcoin from the beginning could be accessed in this forum and other search engines. I wish you all the best sir.",

In this case like I said earlier, if it would be possible for xanto to make a brief introductory to digital finance on how it started would be nice as it would arouse the interest of readers giving them the phases and stages digital finance past through before the invention of bitcoin. Then he can be able to state some experience he personal had together with his interview with prominent bitcoin early adopters possibly, he would be able to get the attention of his proposed targets.",
