Since I knew this forum would help me grasp it better and learn more, I decided to bring it up.Transactions include two primary outputs associated with the protocol, depending on the source or the information  pool:1. vTXOs output2. the output connectionI am aware that the output of a vTXO is a psbt binary tree, where each leaf represents a vTXO.Is the connector (binary tree) format the same? Or does it split the connector's output into X dust outputs using a single (virtual) psbt?",

A VTXO is a leaf of the VTXO tree. This tree is created, not by the output of a VTXO, but by a shared output. Think of a shared output as a locking tapscript, which can be unlocked either by the user by unrolling the tree anytime, or by the ASP after a specified timeout.Quote from: Egii Nna on October 19, 2023, 06:22:34 AMIs the connector (binary tree) format the same? Or does it split the connector's output into X dust outputs using a single (virtual) psbt?The connectors follow the same approach, as with VTXO. There is a connector tree. When a new round transaction is initiated, for every VTXO the ASP creates, there is a connector output from the next round. Read more in here: https://arkdev.info/docs/learn/concepts.",
