      "body": "\"Event All in August Roobet\"Material: WoodTools: Special tools for wood carvingType: Traditional Carving Size: 25x30 cmDuration: 10 dayCelebrating the Roobet Augutu event, the theme this time I took from the Roobet event.The front part looks like Roobet with a welcome to the August Event and I include the Red and White Flag (Indonesian flag) because August coincides with the Independence Day of the Republic of Indonesia. On the back, I carved some information about the \"All In August\" Roobet Event, like an inscription that displays information on the August event. Using color paint and wood varnish that makes the carving more aesthetic and shiny.regardstaufik123 VIDEO REVIEWFull Album Carving Processhttps://www.talkimg.com/album/oePRoobet Username: taufik123bech32 BTC address: bc1qcqf82ys3afxx04ga89rgew7hhn75e0hz6cnxcu[/quote]",

It seems there will be more time available for those who have only just seen this post. There are days when I check this post and observe that no one has given it a \"bump\" in this thread. I was about to do that, but not doing it will not only give me a chance to win the contest but also others that already know the contest. It might seem selfish, but that's just the way it is.For now a sneak peek of my entry.",
