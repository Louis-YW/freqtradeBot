  "content": "I've seen a few posts from more experienced members either using or suggesting the use of the \"ignore\" button. At first, this struck me as unnecessary, but as I've been finding my feet and exploring the forum more, I'm starting to see their point.There are so many redundant posts needlessly repeating the same information and/or posts where the poster hasn't just failed to read the whole thread before posting but has clearly failed to read even the initial post. To be clear, I'm not referring to redundant topics, which bug me far less, because an old topic covered again by a new user still provides an opportunity for fresh insight. I'm more referring to the situation where 30 users all produce similar low-value \"answers\" in a given topic.I'm not sure why there are so many posts like this, but my best guess is that it's users either trying to rank up quickly or trying to fulfill their signature campaign commitments. I've got some empathy for both kinds of user but this type of activity is really lowering the signal to noise ratio and getting in the way of meaningful discussion.Although I'm very tempted to start, I'm still reluctant to ignore users because it feels \"permanent\" and I don't want to miss out on their contributions if they decide to change their posting habits. I'm aware that I could remove them from my ignore list in the future, but I also know that I'm unlikely to periodically re-evaluate them and so will probably just leave them there indefinitely.So, what I would really like is if next to \"ignore\" there was a less drastic option that only added them to my ignore list temporarily[1], something like this:That way, I can \"hush\" with reckless abandon and still be assured that nobody will fall off my radar forever. If users started to regularly \"hush\" each other for low-quality posts then a useful per-user statistic \"H\" might be the following:    H = (T / P) ** (1 - S)Where:    T = The number of times this user was hushed in the previous activity window.    P = The number of times this user could potentially have been hushed in the previous activity window.    S = A severity/harshness control between 0 and 1.I imagine that if this \"hush factor\" were shared with campaign managers (no point in paying for posts that aren't being seen) so that they could adjust their payments by it (i.e. scaling the payout by 1 - H), that would make a compelling disincentive for bad posting behavior.Setting \"S\" to 0.5 would be a good starting point, but someone (presumably @theymos) would have to carefully fine-tune it to decide how punitive this countermeasure should be.Edit: [1] After thinking about this more, I think a \"hush\" should last for the rest of the current activity window and not some arbitrary length of time like 10/20/30 days. This alignment reduces the number of edge cases and makes calculating \"P\" simpler.",

We have very clear forum rules as well as very clear signature campaign rules, which are widely ignored and completely unenforced. Here are what they say:Quote from: hilariousandco on November 17, 2016, 12:46:01 PMStaff do not want to hand out bans for unconstructive posts but if we feel that you as a user are continually making very poor or unsubstantial posts due to your paid signature the following bans will be issued:First offence: 7 daysSecond offence: 14 daysThird offence: 30 daysFourth: Permanent banQuote from: hilariousandco on November 17, 2016, 12:46:01 PMIf you are running a campaign and it becomes blatantly obvious to Staff that you are doing little to nothing to stop spam on your campaign you will be issued a PM warning by a Global Moderator that you need to make immediate improvements to curb low-quality posts. You will have 7 days to remove low-quality posters and respond to the message detailing what you are going to do to make changes to your campaign to reduce the amount of spam. If improvements are not noticeable within 21 days of that and Staff do not believe you are doing enough to prevent low quality posts your signatures will be blacklisted from the forum by an Admin and you will no longer be permitted to advertise here in such a way.Even the most egregious spammers are not banned and campaign managers are never sanctioned. If we aren't even going to enforce the very forgiving rules that we have, then you are going to have no luck trying to get this new feature implemented I'm afraid.Here's another suggestion instead:Use ignore. On the 1st of each month (or some other time frame which suits your needs), go to \"Profile\" -> \"Ignore user options\" and copy your entire ignore list in to a spreadsheet. Then clear your ignore list and start again. Repeat. After 3 or 4 months, any user which has been on every one of your historical ignore lists gets added to a permanent ignore list. From the 1st of each month going forward, instead of wiping your entire ignore list you wipe it and replace it with your permanent ignore list. This means that you aren't condemning any user forever based on a single post which you hit ignore on, but repeated shitposts will eventually get filtered out permanently. Going forward you can give a user \"Three strikes\" or something similar before adding them to your permanent ignore list.",

I don't quite see the ignore option as permanent, even though I don't use it often.When scrolling through the forum, you can still see the replies of users you've ignored, and their threads are still visible on the board landing page, it's just dimmed and not as visible as others.The point is, ignored users do not fall under your radar You can always temporarily unignore them to check out what exactly they posted, and if it's more of the same, you keep them on your ignore list. If, however they've improved, you can consider leaving them unignored, or check their profile to check their last couple of posts.Theymos is highly unlikely to add a new feature, so it's up to you to regulate it the way you want.",

Possibly they could be real garbage and I've even heard of users that ignores a whole board.

There user name would be displayed but there posts on the other hand is what you don't find. Hence, in contrast to having them permanently ignored, you can go ahead to unignore them and not get to wait on a time frame.Also, ignore comes with a downside as, should another user quote an ignored users post, you get to see them and if your conscious enough, you could recall to have put them on ignore and maybe go straight ahead to unignore them.We might not need another icon that ignores or \"hush\" someone for a couple of days or months. I'll rather suggest that we have a programmable meter for the current ignore botton. Just as we have on the login page that you could determine how long (either 60minutes or hours) you which to stay logged in but in this case, we could have a weeks or months or indefinitely as an option to select from and have people make there choices on ignore.

Therefore, they stand as potential customers to offered services.Again, these \"HUSH\" would be individually given and there are chances that, not even half of the forum would \"HUSH\" a particular user or even get to share with campaign managers and as such, it becomes statistically insignificant and might not appeal to campaign managers.

How then do we work that?That's what \"S\" is for. If you set S to 0 then \"H\" just becomes a simple ratio. If only 10% of logged-in users hush you, your H (for that activity window) is 0.1 and assuming that signature campaign managers adopt a system of scaling their payouts by 1 - H, you would receive 90% of your normal payout. If you set S to 0.5 then the same amount of hushes (10%) gives you an H of ~0.32 and your payout would be 68% of normal. Not many people have to use the hush system for it to be effective. I could see S being set pretty high initially, and then lowered over time if more people started to use it.I'm not sure how signature campaign managers would get access to these \"H\" values though. I don't like the idea (not sure why) of having it be publicly visible on your profile, so maybe a forum-provided CSV file that gets updated at the end of each activity window? I don't think campaign managers would need much convincing to download and use such a file when issuing payments.",

A hush score, where almost noboby is participating would be pretty meaningless.

Then \"P\" gets incremented every time one of their posts is rendered/viewed by a logged-in user, you just have to be careful not to count views more than once per logged-in user.It's rather simple, but i expect P number for post on first page would be rather high. Some member might only read the thread, then going to latest page.That's true, accounts that tend to post early in a thread would presumably have a higher P value (assuming that posts on later pages are read less). But I don't think this effect would be significant.I'm sure you already understand this, but (for the sake of clarity) it's important to remember that P is not per-post but per-user (i.e. if any one of your posts has been hushed, it's as if all of them have been, but T and P only get incremented once).So, if you didn't hush any of another user's posts (but did read at least one of them) in a given activity window then their T gets left alone and their P gets incremented.If you did hush any of another user's posts in a given activity window then both their T and P get incremented.Once you've hushed a user, you won't see their posts for the rest of the activity window (see OP edit) and so won't be able to hush them multiple times (i.e. more than once per activity window).Quote from: ETFbitcoin on July 25, 2022, 09:57:20 AMQuote from: PowerGlove on July 24, 2022, 03:17:59 PMQuote from: ETFbitcoin on July 24, 2022, 09:49:29 AM4. With current formula, H value is likely to be unstable. IMO using scaling such as log scale is needed.@ETFbitcoin: Yup, I just put in a quick non-linear adjustment on top of a ratio without thinking about it too deeply. If you mean unstable as in \"sensitive\" or \"changes non-smoothly\" then that's by design.It's by design? Ok, but i find it's not useful when P value is low.I see your point, but if P is very low then very few (logged-in) users are reading any of your posts. I don't think that's likely to happen while being in a signature campaign and posting regularly.",

I'm aware that I could remove them from my ignore list in the future, but I also know that I'm unlikely to periodically re-evaluate them and so will probably just leave them there indefinitely.I don't ignore members right away but if I see someone repeats posting spam and low quality post, than I just push the magic ignore button.This is not so drastic as it seems because you can still see they are posting something and you can partially preview their post or temporary unignore if you want to read what they said.Ignore is one of the best features for me on bitcointalk forum, and I would even go one step further and add total black/hide users to make forum cleaner for me.Quote from: PowerGlove on July 24, 2022, 04:46:42 AMSo, what I would really like is if next to \"ignore\" there was a less drastic option that only added them to my ignore list temporarily[1], something like thisThis is not going to happen unless someone creates script or browser extension for that, but personally I think this is waste of time.Like I said before, current ignore option is not permanent and you can unignore member any time you want, and ignore it back again.Quote from: LoyceV on July 24, 2022, 07:06:13 AMHave you tried the Ignore button? Posts made by Ignored users show a Show/Hide link, so you can once in a while \"review\" them when they post in a topic you're reading. Or just wait for someone to quote them.This option never worked correctly for me, or should I say sometimes it works but most of the times it only shows first line of text.I don't know if this is browser related, issue with BPIP extension or something else, but I never deeply researched it.",
