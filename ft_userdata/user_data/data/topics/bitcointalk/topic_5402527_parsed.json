So more dumping means draining their bags so quickly. People are really hungry for Bitcoin in new inflationary era.Updates: 18/6/2022Quote from: Darooghe on June 15, 2022, 10:21:01 AMLiquidation updates on $14000. You can see on below link:https://oasis.app/25977#OverviewSo you can set you takes profits on $14K and make easy money.Don't forget, Whales and Market manipulation agents looking for Liquidation of Celsius platform. So we will see that level, and even we see lower levels around $6k. I was around crypto market for a long time and I can tell you this bearish season is different from pervious ones. Get short positions.And Don't forget this is my personal analysis. It may be debunked sooner or later, I personally have a short position with TP around $13,600 and SL around $28,000. I got this position around $23,000.",

      "body": "I am no longer surprised by anything. Until recently, it seemed that the predicted price of bitcoin below $30,000 from the standpoint of this year was unrealistically low. But now we have the price of bitcoin below $23,000. If in 2018 the price of bitcoin fell from $20,000 to $8,000, now it may well fall to $13,000. I remember that when bitcoin went up to $60,000 and above last year, some argued that it could not go below $20,000. Well, we'll see. Three bearish periods during the existence of the cryptocurrency is not yet a reason to argue that it will continue to be so.",

And what the price does.. we can all see.13k possible? Clearly. But actually both directions are just as possible right now imho.If one wants to buy (since one's crypto winter is other's summer sales), then DCA-ing would be best, really. Don't wait for the price get to 13k (or whatever value) because it may or may not reach that point.",

The overall macroeconomic environment and the level of fear in the market could cause bitcoin price to fall below $15,000, or even below, to a single-digit amount in the thousands of dollars. The US Federal Reserve is expected to decide this week whether to increase the reference interest rate in order to \"cool\" high inflation, and some analysts say that the US economy could be headed for a recession this year. What could happen? Will the world economy fall into a deep recession, or will it simply stumble for a few months and then bounce back? Nobody knows.",

For example, 20K can be the key support area and before reaching the 13 can wait for this level. However regarding the price action of bitcoin since we are still in the bearish phase of the market, I won't be surprised even if we see the lower levels even 10K or lower prices, we should be ready for everything and this situation made everything hard for the holders and especially the people who bought bitcoins on higher prices and especially if they do not have any risk managments plan for themselves.",

Anything is possible and nothing should surprise us, so when asked how low Bitcoin can go, I answer that $100 per BTC is possible, which is actually good because everyone will be able to buy at least 1 BTC or at least half By the way, the OP post doesn't really make sense, nor is $13k a magic limit that some whales want/don't want to reach - nor are people hungry for Bitcoin at a time when food has risen dramatically and hundreds of millions of people around the world will starve.",

People are really hungry for Bitcoin in new inflationary era.I can only say that everything is possible if we look at the history of bitcoin's movement because we can not predict the price easily. Everything can change quickly without us having time to analyze it, which makes many people panic. But let's hope bitcoin doesn't drop below $20k and can stay at the current price and even bounce back up again so that it can be profitable for us. But if $13k or even $8k is the lowest bitcoin price, we can only wait for that moment to come while preparing our money to buy at that price.",

When there is an ongoing trend it is difficult for a total change to happen but only a little can happen with time while trend is continuing. I think for the prediction of this year's price that we are still feeling the move, it may drop even more that we don't expect. The chart from CMC is showing a trend not going to change anytime in a rush.",

Most assets don't normally do a small sell off and recover from it - a lot take 2 or 3 legs to do it.Also if you sell your crypto, you're provided liquidity from the rest of the market and if you can put a buy order below where you sold and have it filled you end up with more crypto.If you sold 100 btc at $25k and bought back at $21k (if there was enough liquidity) then you'll be able to buy 120btc or have $400k left to withdraw after buying back your btc. It is a risky strategy but they might not care anyway if they're just waiting for a reason to leave with their funds.",
