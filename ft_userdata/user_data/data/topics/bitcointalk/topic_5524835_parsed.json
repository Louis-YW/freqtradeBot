The first country now to adopt it has an advantage of it increasing their wealth relative to other countries. El Salvador is an example. On the other side it will force all countries to consider this decision or risk being left behind. We know no one likes to be left behind in this aside the countries that feed off of aids from other countries. For individual holders like me, I also get to benefit from this adoption by more countries as owning and using it will keep getting easier over time.",

I think that El Salvador was a country that risked it and other countries were watching at it. After El Salvador, probably other small and poor countries will create strategic Bitcoin reserves but I think that unless Trump does something crazy, it will take a few more years till powerful nations create a strategic Bitcoin reserves.2025 is too early for global adoption.

Bhutan and El Salvador have Bitcoin reserves. As at November I read that Bhutan holds bitcoin worth $1.1billion, so I don't think its fair for the bitcoin community to neglet these countries who are actually true believer when talking about this.This is not a prediction that should come as a surprise. Many people already believe that next year more countries will welcome the idea of a bitcoin reserve. I don't belive that though because decisions like this have to pass through so many different channels. Especially not the US. Lets not get ahead of ourselves with Trump's \"love\" for bitcoin. At most, only about 2 countries if any will have a bitcoin reserve next year.",

Satoshi has one million in his possession as they stated but I ask we have extra 18 million in circulation why the scare for something like that. We all know this pseudonymous satoshi wouldn’t just dump people and it is confirmed right by how decentralized the circulation of entire bitcoin is done. So I think this is needlesss FUD once more",

At most, Trump might be able to stop further selling of whatever Bitcoin holdings left with them, but the strategic reserve thing if really pushed might first hurdle legal obstacles before finally taking place. If this happens, however, $200,000 is a moderate estimate. The FOMO will certainly be aggressive. But even now, I suspect the rumors are true that there are already countries that are silently investing in Bitcoin.",

If this really happens it could make price of bitcoin go up much and it could even reach $200000. Even though 2025 might seem too soon for something as big as this to happen governments usually take long time to put new ideas into action. It is possible that governments will finally start using bitcoin as kind of  emergency savings and this could have very big effect on how valuable bitcoin is.",

Because the $100k should have been hit by 2025 and that's why aiming for a double or 2x isn't a lot. Although with the understanding that we have, $200k is quite hard to reach if we'd think about it. But the market isn't limited to what we have right now, there is only one way where it is going and that's to be going up so $200k is just another stop that we'll hit while we see Bitcoin goes to the ceiling.",

If he fails to do that, the process of adopting Bitcoin as a reserve will be slow but steady. Bitcoin can hit $200,000 if the US and other nations start hodling Bitcoin.

I do not think it's too early though, for me it's going to be a race between superpowers as who will start it, USA, Russia and China are already into it.Of course the price is going to skyrocket this 2025, we are all anticipating that it could be between $150k-$180k or even higher. But there could be impact on the economy, I mean are you willing to spend it? Anyone though thinks that it will create or increased wealth inequality?

The second is Hong Kong and they really making exceptional progress in the field of crypto while knowing as the second nation of China and I wonder if China make a come back. The 3rd one is Germany's FDP is making a proposal in the elections to make BTC the reserve and if that happens which I doubt will then once again I will mention as two of my last topics said, they made mistake selling those 50k BTC hehe. Poland's presidential candidate back in Nov showed interest to add BTC in the national reserve and recently I heard the news that Switzerland is also urging central bank to add the BTC in their national reserve. These 5 countries if we include El salvdaor, 6 countries is just a start we should make a list of them.",
