Everything is still about bitcoin, but tBTC is not a real bitcoin. tBTC is not another currency, it is only just used to know how bitcoin transaction is, using the testnet version.

By now, you have found out that Electrum is a bitcoin-only software wallet. If you are interested in altcoins, you will have to look elsewhere.When we are on the subject of security, it depends on several factors. A wallet can't be safe if the person handling it has poor knowledge of internet safety. If you don't know how to protect yourself from malware, phishing, scamming, etc., chances are you'll give the bad guys the essentials to steal your coins. You are the most important element of your wallet's security.Electrum can function as a hot or cold wallet. A hot wallet is connected to the internet, while a cold wallet should be installed on a cleanly formatted OS that has not and should never in the future have internet access. The latter is obviously the safer option if set up correctly.",

Can't say anything if you can trust this wallet. As I don't trust the inventors of Bitcoin Cash, Electron Cash inherits my distrust.ElectrumSV was also some shitty experience, mainly because I distrust this total shitcoin even more than BCH.I used those fork wallets in a carefully separated temporary OS setup.

For example, Litecoin and Monero have official wallets afaik.But almost 99% of altcoins don't have official wallets, so, unfortunately, you don't have as good comfort as you have with Bitcoin. A lot of altcoins officially suggest you to use Ledger/Trezor or other 3rd party hardware/software wallets and/or centralized exchanges.It makes me sad to say but Trezor/Ledger or Metamask are your best bet in this case.",

Of course, I'm talking about multicurrency wallets like Coinomi, Trust wallet or Mycelium that have their drawbacks - but they are still completely free unlike the HW you mention, and whose security policy makes less and less sense.",
