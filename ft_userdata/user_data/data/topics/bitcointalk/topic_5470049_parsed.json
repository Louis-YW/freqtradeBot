The role he played also in making Bitcoin a legal tender in El Salvador and being the first country to do so made them set the pace for others to follow and this is significant enough to make Nyib Bukele one of the proponents of Bitcoin adoption among politicians.",

Obviously, that means the ruling party has an unfair advantage over the other parties trying to get elected. I personally have got the impression political donations only  encourage corruption among politicians and their biggest donors, because after the candidate gets elected, those big donors will certainly start to ask for \"favors\" from politicians. It is quite common in the United States from what I read online. Though, when anyone asks for donations here for whatever reason, they will certainly accept Binance Pay contributions, and other off chain donations to help their cause.",

Everyone know the money laundering problem of our country the mainly the laundering are big politicians or the person who have much amount of money which is illegal and high powerful person in our country. They laundering money in different way in my opinion Bitcoin or other crypto currency is the best way to laundering money and many politicians of our country in my opinion they use this way to laundering the illegal money. I don't know surely but maybe that's the most safest way to laundering money that's the reason. All though crypto is banned or illegal in our country but maybe politicians are connected with the world to laundering their illegal money that's why there is possibility to accept Bitcoin who laundering illegal money in other country.",

Not all know what Bitcoin is but if you tell them that you want to donate then that's the interesting part that they'd find someone that can do that for them and take that cash as soon as possible. I don't know about that link that you've provided but it's not clickable and it doesn't work on me. So if the Congress of the US already does that, I've also heard that a part of their revenue bureau in some states also accepts Bitcoin in payment. This only means that many agencies and even political parties and politicians are starting to be more aware of Bitcoin and acknowledge what it can do for them as money and as a store of value.But be wary of those politicians that will ask for donations as the scammers will also do the same thing and they'll portray as if they are representatives of politicians.",

But for the purpose of promotion and adoption,  some of those politicians have made their Bitcoin adoption known and there is nothing wrong with that,  but it is just that many times the actual amount of Bitcoin held may not be made public and only a fraction of the holding will be put to the public.",

Politicians in the US have been collecting Bitcoin donations for as early as is 2018 when Missouri Republican Austin Petersen received about 24 Bitcoin to fund his Senatorial ambition. Ted Cruz is accepting Bitcoin to finance his campaign. The politicians in my country don't accept crypto donations because the Central Bank of my country has placed restrictions on banks transacting on cryptos. Bitcoin is not banned in my country but politicians will always avoid crypto donations because it could be used to witch-hunt opposition parties. The government in power will not accept it because of hostile policies and the opposition will not accept it for fear of indictments. Another reason why many politicians don't want to accept donations is because the government claims that it was used to finance a massive protest that nearly led to a revolution. Just like the organizers of the \"Freedom Convoy’” protest in Canada that nearly crippled Ottawa was attacked for accepting crypto donations. The government of my country called a peaceful protest a threat to national security and sent the military to kill protesters. And they claim that these protesters were funded by the opposition who wanted to destabilize the nation, so every politician doesn't want to get involved in cryptocurrencies.",
