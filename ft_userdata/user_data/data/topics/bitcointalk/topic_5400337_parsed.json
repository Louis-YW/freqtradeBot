They are stored in the blockchain (in form of UTXOs). You only need to properly store your private keys/seeds/wallet files to keep your coins safe. Quoteand is their any better idea then laptop thing except cold storage hardware like Trezor and Ledger NanoYou can use any reliable device that's never  been and will never be connected to the Internet with a trusted and secure wallet software which supports cold storage such as Electrum.",

But make sure that if you want to setup an airgapped device, I will advice you to remove the wireless modules and install Linux OS like Ubuntu, making sure there is no means your hardware wallet can connect to the external environment.

The unamended known vulnerable that can affect hardware wallet is clipboard malware, but that is why it is good to check and recheck the address you paste before sending bitcoin to a recipient.

Plug the microSD card using the adapter into your online computer, transfer the file on the microSD card and slide the adapter's lock/unlock switch down as you can see in the below image to make it read-only so the file can not be modified.

But for nevrche not to get confused, it is still the watch-only wallet that is the online wallet. So far only master public key is imported into the online wallet, that makes it becomes a watch-only wallet. Watch-only wallet can not be used for spending unless a transaction it create is sent to its cold storage wallet for signing and send back the signed transaction to the watch-only for broadcast. While also watch-only can be used to be tracking transaction including newly received transactions without communicating with the cold storage. Cold storage is only used for signing which is very important for spending, without it, the coins can not be spent.",

Remember not to do this with a locked microSD card adapter plugged inside a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 adapter that is then plugged into the PC.  I have this adapter because my computer does not have a microSD adapter slot so I had to adapt.  For some reason, my USB adapter cancels out the microSD lock and lets the card both read and write.  I found out by trying to create a new file on the microSD, and it worked so the lock has been somehow canceled.  Always test the card out beforehand.-Regards,PrivacyG",

However, it will also be more difficult to spend your coin because you will be having to transfer transactions between your internet-connected computer and your cold-storage computer. In general, I would advise to try to minimize the number of times you are accessing your cold storage wallet. Anytime you access your cold storage, you potentially expose yourself to physical attacks. Generally speaking, you may wish to keep modest amounts of coin on an internet-connected device that you may use for \"everyday\" type transactions, and only access your cold storage when you are wanting to make a larger purchase. The above will depend on how much money is involved for each type of transaction, what you can afford to lose, and the value of your time.",
