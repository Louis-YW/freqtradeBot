Too hard to believe the guy has a high-rank account. Sometimes I feel if bitcointalk has a rule that to create a topic/post they must have to buy a copper member,  it would be suitable for these people who are creating new accounts to scam people. It's sure that the account seller will ask for pre-payment and will be disappeared forever  Those who are still thinking to buy an account should be aware of scams.",

If someone is badly off, they could join a signature campaign of $70-$100 a week and earn something in no time. I mean, by the time someone thinks of selling a legendary account, they must be so stupid.Quote from: sujonali1819 on February 16, 2023, 02:02:42 PMI fill feel if bitcointalk has a rule that to create a topic/post they must have to buy a copper member,  it would be suitable for these people who are creating new accounts to scam people. This would slowly kill the forum. Some people create new accounts to report scam, ask specific questions or post complaints about certain services. If you deny such genuine newbies a chance, they won't return here.",

Too hard to believe the guy has a high-rank account. Not impossible to have one or many either. As you know in 2015, there was a hack of bitcointalk database, and a lot of accounts credential was compromised. A lot of accounts didn't change their password. Hacker sold the accounts and most of the current account traders are part of them. I won't be surprised if the guy owns more accounts lol.Quote from: shasan on February 16, 2023, 03:38:31 PMThere is no legit user who can sell a legendary account because from a legendary account the user can get passive income regularly.Back in the day, account farming was easy.

None, so shut up without proof any accusation is meaninglessThe reason is there are a lot of accounts selling scamming history in this forum. And most of them just try to make greedy by saying they have Legendary accounts. And another reason is if you enroll signature campaign with the legendary account, you can earn more than the account price money in a few months. So this is also suspicious for us because you are just trying to sell it which is normally not done by people.",

There used to be a lot of such account selling posts on this forum, most of which were scams. You are also likely to scam other members, because everyone promises a lot of things until they get the money, only after they get the money do they show their true colors.

Btw if you really have a legendary account, I will suggest you keep running the account and try to give some effort here, that will help you financially, and people also will be helped by you.Warn to the account buyer that there are many examples that brought accounts got caught by the forum members, So be aware of it because after buying there is a big chance you will be caught in anyways.",

We did not claim that you are a scammer because there is no conclusive proof, but you are trying to underestimate our minds.I also never encourage buying forum accounts because it is effortless for the original owner to recover it one day through his initial email, the PGP key, or the associated bitcoin address.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5089777.0",
