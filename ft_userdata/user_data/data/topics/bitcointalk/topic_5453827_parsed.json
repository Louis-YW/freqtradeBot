  "content": "Hi,After upgrading CLN to the latest tag, I noticed that my channel info was wrong when using c-lightning-REST, either when using it either through Zeus or RTL. I tried upgrading c-lightning-REST to the latest tag as well (v0.10.2), but it did not change the result. It shows my channel and it says it is open, but it shows balances of 0 for the channel. When I use lightning-cli, the balances are as expected. I do not see any error or warning in CLN's logs. Has anyone experienced this kind of problem before? Could I be missing something or is it likely to be a bug? The latest tag for the plugin is quite a bit older than for CLN,Thanks!",
