Each individual have a different research term and some people will say yes some people will say no.So, it's depends on the conclusion of your research. If you think is good because a few reason you are find from the project, then invest (If no, then don't). If you don't know anything, don't invest.",

Casper is a coinlist project and one of the heavily invested last bull run but since its down by a lot. I think doing dca with that ia also cool. But In terms of developement I think they are quiet among it on social media. More hypes are garnering on memecoins and new L2 like arbitrum, optimistic, zksync and other resurface projects. Mostly other chains are being neglected due to memecoin hype and more people are swarming in than investing on a good one like L1 or casper itself.",

Whats their userbase? Whats their use case? Are they unique and inimitable? what market share do they have (I'm talking about real utilities and traffic, not capitalization)? Because I personally have been in crypto every day for 6 years, I use many services, cex, dex and I have not heard about it. So I give this project a fair valuation of 1-10 mln $ at best. Which means -98%/-99,8% from current price. Not $11B. you even know how much money it is? You really think that startup without real usecase is worth that much? Startup in the world where there are 25 000 alternatives? (that much is listed on CMC, another 200 000 is not)",

What does casper have in their roadmap to justify such a growth? Also are you considering listening casper bag holders as research? I mean you didn't explain the research part, only that random people said that it can do 21x. I can say that eth will do 10000x from here but reading that isn't research or would make it true.XRP and HBAR has their own fans in here too but i am not part of them. And i wouldn't call them any more popular then their marketcap tells us.",

Â The currency is new and unknown, and any decision will be relative and nothing is certain. On the other hand, if you are sure of the integrity of the project that produces the token, I cannot advise you not to make the investment, but remember that there is always an existing risk ratio.From a personal point of view that does not oblige anyone else, I can say that I completely lack confidence in most of the currencies of new projects, with the exception of a very few that are still finding their way.",

I don't have much to say about its price or capitalization, but I think it will stay in the top100 or better positions in the future.",

Well, I look a little on the project and they are still around especially the founder and the devs, they are making updates, still engaged on the community, has progress regarding one project being built on their network and a lot more. It's easy to say it decrease engagement but that's understandable for a lot of projects at the moment since we aare still on a bear market. Memecoins, roll-up tokens, tokens that are having airdrops are just the noisy one these days. I think Casper can still get back up and this isn't a financial advice but rather my own opinion regarding them. To OP just take responsibility on your investment and if I were you, just dog more onto what you think is a great investment rather than investing on it blindly.",

The good thing if casper is still actively developing its project. It's not yet added into the major exchange site like binance and coinbase. The chance for casper to go to the moon is still there. I hope that my to wait my casper will be paid off in the future. It will be so bad if the price will never surpass 10 cents.",
