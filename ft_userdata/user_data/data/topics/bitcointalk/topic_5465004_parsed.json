  "content": "It's not new to us that the rate at which everyone uses banking Apps on their phone has grown rapidly due to the recent spike in digital banking like Opay, Palmpay, Kuda, Moniepoint and other related micro banks and this is due to their fast transaction unlike the commercial banks that sometimes delay payment, these banks save you when you want to make fast local transaction without having to wait, they are pretty fast and some don't charge for fees while some do but limit the free transfer you can do in every 24 hours.There is a challenge with these Apps and one of them is when your phone is mislaced or stolen, the first thing they do with your phone is to find a way to unlock it if it's locked and if the phone is not passworded, they go straight to your mobile app to drain the account balance. This is how they do it and it's in two ways:Accounts that are Tier 1: This is an account where KYC is not done or BVN is not requested and most of the time, the maximum balance you can have in your account is 300,000 naira and the daily transaction limit is 50,000. What they do when a phone is misplaced or stolen is they try to enter the app by forget password and request for one-time password(OTP) to set a new password, since KYC is not requested on this tier account, it will be easier for the person to recover the password from the sim and gain access to the account and transfer all the money on the account to another person until the account balance is empty, most of the time, they send it to POS person and collect cash.Accounts that are Tier 2 and above: These accounts are usually KYC, BVN are been requested to use these accounts and above with daily transaction of #5M and unlimited max balance of Tier 3, and documents are required for the usage. When a phone is misplaced or stolen, anyone who finds the phone will try to get access to the mobile APP the same way as that of the Tier 1 through forget password by requesting for one-time password(OTP) through the sim card but even if the account is reset, BVN number will be requested but that doesn't stop anything. They can use *565*0# to request for the BVN to get the number and that's how easy it is to get into these virtual bank apps.To verify, dial *565*0# and you will be charged #20 for your BVN, this is not magic, it is from Nigeria Inter-bank Settlement System(NIBSS)How to prevent this from happening:1. Make sure that your sim card is pin protected, this way it will be difficult to get access to your Sim when the phone is on, even if they are able to unlock the phone, the sim will remain locked and that gives you the advantage of making sure that your mobile wallet remains inaccessible.2. Make sure to always password your phone, some phones are easily jail break but it is better than not having anything at all, this can give you time to do a welcome back before they get access to the phone.3. Always have less money on this virtual app to protect yourself from this kind of emergency, this can help you in case the banks try to run away because there has been a lack of transparency from them, especially Opay and Kuda.Stay safe, stay healthy.",

I think any one who comes in contact with this article would be enlightened enough to know what to do when it comes to securing their funds while using banking apps. Of a truth these micro finance banks can not be trusted with our funds as virtually all of them are office-less  and their is every tendency that if they run away with funds now they can not be located that easily to get back a refund of customers funds. If you can, do away with keeping funds in your microfinance bank app or if possible a little token for emergency or transportation expenses. Although they are most sort after as a result of their speed in transactions but one needs be careful as well.Sometimes,it is best one takes the risk of getting gadgets if possible or if their is availability of funds at disposals to secure your details and information. Separating your sims can best be done if you are majorly into online activities that requires otp.  Get a smaller phone without internet connection with your simcard so you could be receiving your otp there while you walk freely and lastly, mind the  way you press  your phone in public places because you do not know who is watching you and possibly making you a target of attack.",

I can easily use 10 to 21 characters easily.I normally use fingerprint in my phone and I thought not is the best because fingerprint makes things easier and faster. And many when the phone is misplaced and got stolen by all those rogues, they would withdraw or transfer all the funds in the app and also use the app to borrow more money from app again and making the owner to pay un-necessary loan. There are other prevention one can take immediately ones the phone is stolen. And the faster you do the faster it can be secured.Once your phone is stolen, take any person phone that close to you at the moment and call your sim y customer care service and told them to lock your sim card.

Is there a device that can be used to perform such criminal act.",

I have been using this privacy screen guard for a while now and works perfectly just as you said. If the person close to you does not have a direct contact into your phone, they can’t see what is displaying on your screen. This privacy also protects your eyes from direct screen light from the phone’s screen.

For faster access, fingerprints are enable which can be very dangerous in a case of a stolen phone. If someone have known your password earlier, they can easily add fingerprint to it without your notice. Your funds can even be sweep away without a case of stolen phone. Privacy and security should be paramount in this technological age.",

I go like response on some of your tips dem. No go dey expect transparency from centralized service providers dem, your local banks no get transparency so wetin come dey give you idea say all this online banks go get. Sha not having large sum of money in those apps na the surest protections wey you fit give yourself. Make your money dey your local banks and you dey transfer am to online banks dem when you wan spend am. To add more security, no dey hold money for banks self, store dem for your crypto wallet and the trade to naira whenever you need funds. Of course emergency funds go dey your account but no dey store much as you dey lose self if you dey hold Naira as dis one wey be say dollars just dey grow anyhow.

Also take ur protection a step further and hide ur bank apps for your phone, no make an easy for dis thief dem atleast make dem work for am before dem fit steal anything. If you no get phone wey get double space wey be say you fit move all your important apps dem to the second space den download those apps wey dey help hide apps for fone and hide your banks apps.

      "body": "Well, this is really a good advice and one I thi0nk we should all adhere to, I myself have been using visual bank apps for quite some time now, I have actually been using opay for over two years now without any issues since I rarely lose or misplace my phone, but still, I perfectly u understand the risk involved with usage of such banks, this is why I only keep a tiny amount of money on my opay account, and this money is always money that I am ready to spend in few hours or the next day, I have account on major banks where I save tangible amounts..But then, a little observation here, for many of us who use banking apps for transfers and confirmation of received money on our phones, if we misplace our phones or lose it, and it is not passworded or locked, can't the person who picked the phone use the same process used in accessing the visual banking apps, to access the major banking apps on our phones?I think the safest thing here is to never leave your phone unpassworded or unlocked, this helps in the sense that when we lose it, and the picker of the phone is not able to guess the password to unlock it, he or she will have no choice but to flash the phone which will automatically delete everything in the phone leaving the picker with no access to our major and important information.",

      "body": "Security on sim cards (pin) and 2FA authentication on those Apps are very important in this case because that is mostly where they would run most of the shit if they gain access to your phone. Aside from being hacked when you lost your phone,  The issue with most of these online Apps is they are not that secure, and Based on the increasing number of hacks I have seen recently I don't even fucking keep funds in those Apps because I don't trust them and I could get drained at any time despite the level of security you got.  Even the traditional banking Apps upon the level of security they have when you approach the customer service unit you would see several complaints about funds being hacked, so I only use them to carry out transactions and at the end of the day move my funds back. Mostly these hack issues are a result of inside jobs, The people working inside the bank or with these money firms leak customers' details to those hackers out there hence increasing the rate of hacks experienced in Nigeria.",
