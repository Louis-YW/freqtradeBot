Maybe you can check this thread by @LoyceV LoyceV's Bitcoin Fork claiming guide (and service).And probably this is the only thread that you will need to read to be able to claim other coins, if they are worth by this time.Best of luck.",

For BCH you need to have BTC before block 478558[1] hence you need the private key of the address where you own your coins.Note that you do not need any bitcoins for this process, so before extracting the private key, send all the bitcoins to a new address, extract the private key, and then download Electron Cash[2], import that private key in that wallet.If you tell us the name of the wallet you used to receive bitcoins, the answer will be more accurate, or search Google using this formula.Code:Extract <wallet name here> private key[1] https://blockchain.info/block/0000000000000000011865af4122fe3b144e2cbeea86142e8ff2fb4107352d43[2] https://electroncash.org/",
