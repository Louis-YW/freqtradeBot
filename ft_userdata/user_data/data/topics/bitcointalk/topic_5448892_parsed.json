  "content": "I'm planning to invest 50% of my savings in BTC next week. That equates to 1 BTC at this point.I know that any investor will call this stupid and reckless.However my idea is that I will overcome the worst case scenario, which is BTC going to 0. My parents own properties and losing 50% of my savings will not cripple me. Because I will inherit real estate at some point anyway.I estimate the chance of BTC eventually 30x'ing about 50% so I am willing to take the risk. So it's 50/50 between 30x and 0. I will take that bet.However, I am concerned about 2 scenarios.1) Malware on my laptop/smartphone (I know that my data are all over the internet). Some key logger could find out about my password for an exchange, and steal my BTC. Half a year ago I was the victim of credit card fraud, most likely because a key logger stole my card details.2) Government lawsuits vs the exchanges, resulting in either confiscation of my BTC or resulting in a total ban of converting currency to BTC. Which would kill the value of BTC. I purchased a ledger device to avoid the scenario of FTX.In order to optimize my chances of avoiding scenario 1, I think I need a new smartphone or laptop. Which will be used strictly for management of crypto.Is a laptop better than a smartphone? Does it need to have specific characteristics?Am I missing some things?",

It sounds like you are not planning to do that, since you have bought a Ledger hardware wallet.Given that your bitcoin will be safely stored on your Ledger, then having an airgapped computer doesn't really add anything to this set up.

In that case, that computer cannot be airgapped - obviously it will need an internet connection in order to interact with an exchange or another person in order to purchase the bitcoin.I don't see how there is an other option to buy BTC. For this purchase we are all exposed to the internet.The laptop I am using at this point (MacBook) is about 7 years old. I am going to need a new one anyway. So in that regard I can buy a new one.However it will be necessary for postgraduation courses and it will be exposed to the internet. That is not safe. Also, about 6 months ago I was the victim of online credit card fraud on my current laptop. I had made 1 payment with a visa card online. A hacker has gotten to my card details and made a payment with my visa card in a foreign country. Insurance paid it back to me.So this laptop is not safe and I don't know if any other laptop is safe when my email address linked to the exchange is the same one.I have installed malwarebytes but it did not find any breaches when I ran it. Buying a new Macbook just for managing 1 BTC is very expensive. And I would need a second one for work anyway.So I considered buying 1 new laptop for work, and 1 new smartphone just for purchasing BTC. I'm not planning on trading a lot.Please let me know if this scenario is unsafe:I buy a new smartphone (for example Samsung) just to purchase BTC. Most likely in incremental amounts to test it.When I get to 1 BTC on the exchange, I transfer it to my ledger device via my smartphone which should not be exposed to malware as it is new.I leave my BTC on the ledger and keep it hidden, along with the seedphrase. I'm planning on never typing the seed phrase on any laptop or smartphone so a key logger can't get a hold of it. I'm not planning to connect the ledger to the internet a lot. But at some point I will have to, right? For example to check the balance.Or to convert it back to currency when I want to.If BTC ever gets to a large value (above 10x) I can purchase an air gapped device to leave it on.I have never used Linux and I am an internet safety noob. It is one of the main reasons why I have not invested in BTC earlier. I was worried that a hacker would eventually get a hold of my details.QuoteIf that's the case then yes, it is good idea to have a clean computer which you only use for bitcoin and not for daily browsing or anything else, since this will minimize the risk of downloading malware.

But I have never used Linux and it makes me uncomfortable. 1 mistake and I am done",

I wouldn't wait until you have 1 BTC on a centralized exchange before you transfer it out though. You can transfer it in smaller amounts incrementally to your Ledger. You'll pay a little more in fees, but it's worth it for not having to store your BTC long term on a centralized exchange while you wait to accumulate enough. Also less risk of losing everything if you make a mistake with one transfer if you are transferring smaller amounts repeatedly rather than all at once.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 15, 2023, 08:11:51 AMI'm not planning to connect the ledger to the internet a lot. But at some point I will have to, right? For example to check the balance.Correct. You'll need to hook up your Ledger to your computer when you first initialize it in order to download the latest firmware and the bitcoin app software, and you'll need to hook it up any time you want to spend coins from it. You don't have to connect it just to view the balance on your addresses, however.",

I have a backup phone I use for only my wallets and I have my mobile wallet there. I only go online with it to search information or visit my social media handle. I do not click links and I do not install any other things in the phone.Am I still at risk?I believe something points the attention of hackers to my device and if I avoid those things that point their attention to my device I am safe.Am I getting it totally wrong?",

The price to pay is quite cheap compared to the uncertain risk you're facing if you regularly connect your device to the internet. At the end of the day, you can't guarantee that there won't be a new attack vector other than spamming links, phishing websites, etc. Heck, who knows some hackers could manage to hijack your DNS and use one or two exploits that allow them to control your device remotely without you noticing anything.

You will have a seed key when you will create the wallet and you can import the seed key in Trezor too. You just need to store your seed key secretly and safely.

You could be browsing on any normal website, click on \"play\" of any video you wish to see, have a pop up appear and it is already too late.I keep getting calls from foreign countries. Random people who seem to have my phone nr. This has been happening for a while. Obviously I do not answer.A few months ago when Roger Federer retired from tennis, I commented on facebook that I would like to attend his last game. I did this with a fake account that is not linked to my real name. Half an hour later I received a phonecall from the UK where that game was played (I do not live there) and the day after I got 2 more. So somehow people on the dark web can even link a fake facebook account to my real name and my real phone number. I'm not an expert but I assume this is based on the IP address being used by both accounts (the real FB account and the fake one)A month prior to that someone had made a 1000 British pound payment in London with my visa card, that is inside my house and I had used exactly 1 time online. No details were shared with anyone. I was a whole battle with the insurance company to get it back. I had done nothing wrong.So no I do not feel safe online. With regards to hackers, I believe that one of the most important safety measures is to make sure that NOBODY knows you invested in BTC or ETH.Eventually if the word speads, it will catch the attention of bad people. I don't know what they can do to your internet connection, but I believe they have options just by knowing your name and address.To get a better idea, this website allows you to enter your email address and immediately tells you if there have been security breaches https://haveibeenpwned.com/Mine has 10 of them, and it also says when and where it happened",

Ledger devices use a BIP39 seed phrase, as do almost all current hardware and software wallets. You will have no trouble importing it elsewhere if you need to.Just note that you should only do this in the situation where your hardware wallet is lost, damaged, broken, etc. Importing your seed phrase in to another wallet is risky, and has the potential to negate all the protection your hardware wallet provides.",
