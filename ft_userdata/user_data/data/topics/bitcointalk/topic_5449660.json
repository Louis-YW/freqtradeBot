See this post for the differences:Quote from: Xynerise on April 24, 2018, 08:00:01 AMFor P2SH-P2WPKH addresses (Addresses starting with \"3\")Just add p2wpkh-p2sh: directly in front of your  private key. For example Code:p2wpkh-p2sh:5BitcoinPrivateKeyThis should generate the corresponding p2wpkh-p2sh bitcoin address.For P2WPKH addresses (Bech32, starting with 'bc1')This time we'll add p2wpkh: in front of the private key.For exampleCode:p2wpkh:5PrivateKeyThis should generate the corresponding Bech32 addressDid you try to create a New Wallet in Electrum?

Because when I create my address that time I use VanitySearch 1.11 to create the address. and I don't know that the address I create is an uncompressed one. So, there is no way to spend the bitcoin from that address?",

This 2021 transaction with 0.001 BTC (your entire balance) as fee hasn't been confirmed yet. This guy paid 1 BTC ($19k at the time), and it still took more than a year for a miner to manually include his transaction. Doing it manually poses the risk of messing up and losing the entire block reward, so I get that miners aren't too happy to include non-standard transactions.See:Quote from: gmaxwellIt was the wish with segwit to prohibit the use of uncompressed keys. But there was a concern that problem's like OP's would arise from incompetent buggy software-- potentially involving really large funds losses.  In an abundance of caution these the rule was made initially standardness-only.  It has turned out to be less of an issue than had been feared (the OP's is the only sizable case I've heard of, at least).I think the best thing to do now, is doing nothing. Just keep the private key for many years. It may at some point become possible to move your funds (for instance by the time block rewards are so low your transaction fee is worth the risk). Until then: HODL",
