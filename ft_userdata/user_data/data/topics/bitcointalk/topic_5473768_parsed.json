If you have a VPN enabled, playing with servers and disabling might help as well.Even without vpn everything works perfectly. probably the url of vod was not correct and that was why the error message was sent to him and I believe by now he has ratified the problem and have access to the to the site. And there are sometimes network also caused such error message to occur. If the network is not too strong or bad you can't visit some site because they used strong network to browse. I have not experienced BPIP site is down in a day. When I browse it, it works fine move smoothly.",

I normally use Google Chrome to check it and it is working fine from my end. I just checked your profile and everything is intact. You can check the internet protocol and the IP address or you can change device to check it again. Everyone here has said it is working from their sides and it is only you having the problem then the issue is from your site. I wish you good navigation time in the forum.",
