  "content": "I hope someone can kindly advise me and anyone else reading it what is the best thing to do in such a scenario.After buying a new PC (Windows 11), I set up Electrum once again after going through all the correct procedures.On my old PC, I had my coins stored in a default wallet. So what I did was set up a new wallet on my new PC (this time I gave it a name) and imported the seed (if that is the correct, phrase). So I typed in my sixteen words and the coins appeared in this new wallet.I now have the novelty that I can see them on both the old PC in the old default wallet and the new PC in my named wallet.I plan to eventually move my coins to a Trezor wallet. But is there any way I can disable the old default wallet in my old PC, before I get rid of the old PC entirely?",

There are recovery tools that can recover the delete files. The best thing you can do is to create a new wallet in your new device, make a transaction and move all the fund to that.",

Yes, you are correct, I checked and it was 12 words. I think I had 16 words in my first ever wallet.I will do as you say, as I understand about double the risk of being hacked. It is just a shame I will have to pay transaction costs for moving between two wallets on the one computer...Many thanks for your helpful reply.",

You need  to use  eelectrum to transfer your funds to the trezor wallet.The fees are high now... but I would move my coins as fast as possible, as it is safer.Create a new wallet with trezor and click receive to see the address and transfer",

Just use it, it is safe.It just has some privacy problems which are not big deal to securityI prefer ledger, but you are fine with trezor.",

      "body": "Deleting the wallet file from your older computer doesn't guarantee that the file is 100% unrecoverable. You can either remove and keep the HDD aside, supposing you're planning to get rid of that computer, or attempt to overwrite it using software specified for this operation. I know a couple but don't remember them right now; a quick Google search would be enough. Unless you prefer to create a new wallet and move all your funds there. However, I don't see the point in doing that since you mentioned in your previous post that you've already bought a Trezor device. Move your coins there and you'll be good to go, if the high fees are concerning you right now, lower them and in the worst case scenario, you'll have to wait a few more hours.",
