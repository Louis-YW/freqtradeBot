  "content": "hey allI know it is a long thread, but I think this is the way to do it, as I do not want anyone to say I have not said everything.Anyone who is serious should read it all before giving their opinion. Please respect the effort and hard work to present the scam accusation in full detailI found the following on this link Blackjack.fun Casino Review | Honest Review by Casino Guru there is written - Blackjack.fun Casino is operating without a valid license. correct or not the Blackjack.fun owner did not want to show if it is correct or not  Now let me please explain why I opened this Scam accusation threadmost of the players I saw on Blackjack.fun  free roll tourney tables don't know how to play Blackjack. That is fine and not a problem and good for the casino. They even don't play according the Basic Strategy which would give them best chance to winI am quite an expert in games and also Blackjack. I love Blackjack. I saw Blackjack.fun here in the forum and went there to check it out. I saw some free rolls with a prize of 1 USDT for the winner. I started to participate and what I saw was shocking that a casino OP will offer such an ugly BJ table design. even worse was that I saw missing details. many users complained about a bug I surely also saw. This bug was frustrating for every participant. I decided to offer my help and feedback to the OP and posted my feedback in his Bitcointalk thread. I have not asked for an incentive because I like to help. I give respect and ask for respect in return.The following link shows my first posting with my feedback. Please read it as I do not want to fill up the post with to much text as there will be more to come. Also the answers of the OP.I will do it step by step and in chronological order.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63082551#msg63082551after my posting a member posted and was frustrated about the bug I mentioned and many other users complained already and it was not fixed and it is not fixed till today. Shame to the OPhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63083204#msg63083204My response to the last poster and his complainthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63084685#msg63084685Next is the response from BJ Fun OP, who thanks everyone for the helpful feedback.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63087696#msg63087696here my answer to OPhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63087756#msg63087756Next post of mine thanking the BJ Fun OP as I saw he fixed an important bug I pointed out to him and pointed another helpful idea outhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63089248#msg63089248A user asked me in the next post why I wanted players with zero chips to be removed from the tables. I replied with my reasoning. If OP would read it he also should understand why to implement ithttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63092985#msg63092985My response with some more feedbackhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63093594#msg63093594BJ fun OP posted and thanked for the feedback and even offered a tip for good feedback. I add - whatever good will means to himhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63094251#msg63094251Here I gave new feedback and bug and the old bug was still not fixed and very frustrating for every participant.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63098768#msg63098768Here is the post from the guy I replied to regarding the zero chip players still at the table, thanking me for the answer as he now understands it and also knows that other operators are handling it accordingly.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63103722#msg63103722Next is my response to the above post. and also a question to all readers - where can I see the tournament rules for these free tournaments in beta? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63104141#msg63104141Here is the SHOCKING answer from a member and BJ Fun promoter. I hope we have some readers who know the BJ rules, just for info there are many different BJ rules as the casino OP can create the rules according to the house edge he wants to offer. This shows how unprofessional the BJ Fun OP is, as he does not even know that it is a must to add BJ rules and let users play without the rules he uses. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63104687#msg63104687Next, I answered about the rules and pointed out another important bug/glitch. I also mentioned that there are other bugs/glitches.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63105056#msg63105056Here I reported some more glitches and bugs and all these bugs were against the players. Saying this means that these bugs are not in favor of the players and does not make sense to exploit.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63107409#msg63107409Next the BJ fun OP announced a 200USDT freeroll. only for invites. I asked and PMed for an invite and he accepted.Next what happened I wanted to participate in another free roll I saw only a KYC site form BJ fun. I wondered why that as I did not asked for a withdrawal. I had 24  USDT and some TRX in my wallet.I PMed the BJ fun op and asked why  I got the KYC to see and cannot go to the tourney site? His answer - What is your username? I gave him my username, even though it was different from my Bitcointalk username. I had nothing to hide as I was only being helpful all the time.His answer then:Ahaa, you got it because you abused the bug in blackjack tournaments of course. As you saw other players complained about you.What was the bug and how did you reset the timer? So what happened was that I found a glitch (I will explain in more detail soon) and a few players complained about me and BJ Fun OP showed me the KYC which means he actually banned me from playing. strange and unlogical action.I explained him the glitch in PM and it showed me again that he has no clue about blackjack and the glitches he has in his software.He insisted that the KYC will stay until I will fill it out. Why should I fill it out? I did not ask for any withdrawal. So I did not fill it out. He even posted my username in thread. Sorry this is again very unprofessional and should not be done.According to all of those PMs I posted this in threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124133#msg63124133here he exposed my table username in thread. Lets see what all his game providers will say when they get to read thishttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124227#msg63124227Here is my very direct response to him.https://bitcointalk.org/index.phptopic=5106215.msg63124315#msg63124315another user posted then this regarding the Curacao license and I asked the BJ fun OP to show me the license so I can go and verify it but he never answeredhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124335#msg63124335my answerhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124374#msg63124374my next postinghttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124405#msg63124405BJ fun OP announced the start of the 200USDT tourney with adding a not so nice sentence at least I did not like ithttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124721#msg63124721my answerhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124756#msg63124756a user complained about the 200USDT tourney as it has same bug I and many other users  reported and it was not fixed. Who would offer a 200USDT tourney with so many bugs? IMHO only the one who knows the winner in advance. My 2 centshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63124941#msg63124941so the tourney then was canceled hmmmhere I told to OPI was not in for the money as I just wanted to help. any Legendary user is welcome to propose to whom to give the about 30 USDT as a donation and OP should send it there if he really does not want to steal the money https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63125271#msg63125271Next post of mine, as I promised to bring it to you in chronological order.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63125292#msg63125292answer to BJ fun OP to stop his BShttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63125303#msg63125303the last posting of mine and anyway BJ fun OP closed the threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106215.msg63125325#msg63125325Please let me now as promised explain the glitch I found and got the KYC = I see it as a ban.Playing as always at a 1USDT free roll tourney and the emphasis is on 1USDT and not 100 or 200USDT tourney a player used a glitch where he could reset the timer of 18 seconds until he will play his hand. now you will ask what was his advantage? His advantage was because the other glitch that I and many others reported in feedback was not fixed. He by resetting the timer for 18 seconds again and again in the last minute of the game he did not give me a chance to bet my hand so he won against me and he also won the tourney in this case as I checked it.I did not report the player and I did not report the glitch. I did not report him because I was not sure if he knew about the glitch or if he just happened to find it while playing me. I just kept the card sequence and game situation in mind and looked for it so I could reproduce it.I was playing now to find the right game and hand sequence and by doing this you cannot play a tournament to win it. just for info.And finally I found it and tried to reset the timer and it worked. I have now reset the timer again and again and again and not just 2 times but for 1-2 minutes I think. it was not in a game or hand situation to win the tournament. OP can check it as he admitted.I did it because the player who used it before was at the table and i thought he might complain in chat. no one complained in chat. so i thought if he does not complain he knows the glitch and wants to use it again. but if he complains he is clean. But only a few players complained, as I later found out from the OP, but I do not know if the user who used the glitch is one of them. I did not report it as I wanted to find it again to be sure it was not a one time glitch. but then I was KYCed by OP and he claimed that I won all the money 24USDT by exploiting the glitch. HaHa as firstly he could check it in all tournaments I played and game history and secondly why should I do it for 1USDT? I could wait for the 100USDT and 200USDT tournaments. let me reiterate that i was not in it for the money but OP actually stole the 24USDT and some TRX into his own pocket. as I don't accept this i asked him in PMs to do the following? You still owe me 23-24USDT and some TRX. I already suggested in your thread to donate this money to someone in the Bitcointalk forum. I would prefer one of the Legendary users to say to whom to give it. There are 3 I respect very much and would prefer one of them to accept this task.@Royse777@JollyGood@TwitchySeal and again this after he admitted -Nobody is forgetting your 24usdt and some trx or something. since you did not forget the 24USDT and the trx, why did you not contact for example legendary user @Royse777 and ask him if he wants to help? he could open a free giveaway in the games and rounds subforum for the one who guesses the bitcoin price in a week from now. just an example, but this would be a good start for us as you can show your good will. That is all for now. I know it is a long thread, but I think this is the way to do it, as I do not want anyone to say I have not said everything.Anyone who is serious should read it all before giving their opinion.Thank you for reading all if you did. Everyone is welcome to post or prove to us that Blackjack.fun has a valid licenseI will contact also all his game providers to see if they can show me the valid license they surely have from Blackjack.fun if there is oneBTW maybe I should mention that in one of last PMs the Blackjack.fun OP offered me 100USDT if I give him a written list of bugs and what to change. I kindly declined it as I don't trust himhere one of many users complained including me about this bug and till now not fixed. Only this bug is a game killer and not fixed. I did 3 screenshots of his complain in chat. This was not long ago https://imgur.com/a/rtNknWball this because of what? I really don't know. because 24USDT and some TRX? this cannot be after the helpful feedback I gavethere must be a reason",

Here's what I see. 1. you tried to help by reporting some stuff in their thread. Good action by you. 2. They didn't take into account all your suggestions.3. You exploited the bug yourself, self admittedly.  Whether or not it was trying to reproduce or exploit it still happened. 4. You were asked for kyc after this action and unable to participate. At this point you become aggressive towards the site and decide to be an ass and open a scam accusation. Sound about right?From my experience with Blackjack.fun I do not think English is their 1st language. It may not be yours either but I understand you pretty good. Instead of opening an accusation because you were asked for kyc, you should have maybe tried to pm and communicate further without acting out. Maybe get them to understand what and why things happened. If that didn't work, pm their campaign manager and see of he can get the owner to understand. It's only a scam if they don't allow you to wd. If you ask to wd and pass kyc and they don't send your funds, then it's a scam dude.",

You admit that you found a glitch which means they have basis for an abuse. They have the right to exclude you on their promotion base on their own discretion. What I’m just confused right now is why they lock the ANN thread after you create a series of negative post towards them.They are not cheap scammer but rather you are just angry about their action towards your account which you admit that you exploit a glitch on their newly developed game.",

No one holding you from verifying the validity yourself.fair enough and thank you for reading the accusation in full. it will be a pleasure to answer all your questions with respectthe glitch I found was not the exact glitch which was used by another player against me. it was similar and I need to play a lot to get to the situation and if I get to the card constellation I was looking for I try it. as it is a free roll I did not care as I only was spending my time to find the exact glitch. you can call it overkill but I call it perfection as I am a perfectionist.now please understand the timing. I did not report it as I wanted to be sure  and as it was not the exact card sequence the player used against me I want to play ( again it is a free roll for 1 USDT  and not 100 or more ) and find the exact card sequence. but I could not play or reach the site as it was KYC what I reached. then after asking the owner in PM what happened he asked for my user name which I gave him without any problem and then he said ahh there were players who reported me. since then I see KYC and I even did not ask for a withdrawal!please understand if I would like to exploit this or any other glitch I would not give any feedback or explain the owner the glitch I found. those are free rolls for 1 USDT come on what could I steal there?but yes someone I did not report is enjoying it as the owner who is also the developer did not fix it and does not know all the glitches. if I can find it he also could find it. something stinksnow to the valid license. to make it short I don't need to check it as the owner should prove it if he is a valid owner of a license as a casino ownerthanks again for your postingcheers",

I talked always in thread and in PMs straight forward and helpful and he always tried to not answer or to insult my intelect with his stupid answersanyway I thank you again for the kind conversationcheersSorry, I got the notification of your reply yesterday, but I was quite busy at that moment so I just glanced at it and then went straight to bed after. I didn't want to sound that I am cornering you, but I think you misunderstood the point here. I think there are two ways to see this KYC situation, from the customer [you] and from the operator [blackjack.fun], but both brings similar result regarding KYC: that you have to do it.From customer's perspective, although it's true that you did not ask for withdrawal [whereas the KYC article said you'll be asked for KYC when you deposited exceeding 2,000 EUR or requesting withdrawal] and thus shouldn't trigger KYC from those clause, there is another clause in their ToS that allows KYC request simply because you start betting on their platform, and that they're allowed to suspend your activity until you do so. I've explained it here on #11, if I may further shorten it to the bare essential:Quote from: https://blackjack.fun/provably-fair/toc5.2. [...] In order to start betting on the Service or withdraw your winnings, we may require you to become a verified Customer which includes passing certain checks [...] We reserve the right to suspend wagering or restrict Account options on any Account until the required information is received.So yes, even if you did not ask for withdrawal or made a large deposit, you're still subjected [as you're agreed] to KYC verification whenever the platform deemed it necessary [on this case, they deem it necessary because they suspected a foul play].From operator's perspective, as briefly brushed above, they require KYC because you triggered their alarm, you're caught cheating on their system by exploiting bug [your true intention aside], this made them worries and require KYC to get a better detail of this \"abusive\" user and to prevent similar situation to happen again in the future.Both lead to a situation where you have to do KYC. I understand your confusion that you did not ask for withdrawal and thus [you think] you shouldn't be asked to perform KYC. However, the clause on their ToS allows them to ask this from you, with or without withdrawal and high deposit.As for why the operator \"give up\" on KYC, I believe it's actually a good-will and solving a situation. You refuse to perform KYC, they require your KYC, you both in a moot point, so they offered a way out: don't do the KYC, take your balance and leave. As for the 100 USD for listing every bug, that's them rewarding you for bug bounty, many platforms have this kind of bounty, even this forum has it.  You wanted to find their bugs, and there it is, the bug you found so far are rewarded by them, certainly it can be considered as a good will?Quote from: JackpotRacer on November 15, 2023, 07:34:17 AM[...]BTW all those lies and action for about $30 which I even did not ask to withdraw as I told him I was not in for the money I just wanted to help as I love the Blackjack game and was happy to see Blackjack.fun offering itUmm... sometimes we need to realize that we've overstayed our welcome, our presence and help is no longer needed, and it's best for us to leave.",

Because from what I get from reading your last posts [and this thread] you seemed not wanting to be there anymore too.Everybody win, case closed, no scam happened.sorry now you misunderstood itI id not ask for any withdrawal why should I do a KYC at this point? no reason IMHOwhen he understood that I will not give up and will do a scam accusation he wanted to pay me without KYC and even offered 100USDT if I will give him a written document with all bug a I found. I did not want the money I just wanted to go on searching for bugs as there were many and wanted to check especially the one who used the timer reset against me to see what else he has in his hat he behaved very impolite and disrespectful and I cannot let him get away with that. I talked always in thread and in PMs straight forward and helpful and he always tried to not answer or to insult my intelect with his stupid answersanyway I thank you again for the kind conversationcheersSorry, I got the notification of your reply yesterday, but I was quite busy at that moment so I just glanced at it and then went straight to bed after. I didn't want to sound that I am cornering you, but I think you misunderstood the point here. I think there are two ways to see this KYC situation, from the customer [you] and from the operator [blackjack.fun], but both brings similar result regarding KYC: that you have to do it.From customer's perspective, although it's true that you did not ask for withdrawal [whereas the KYC article said you'll be asked for KYC when you deposited exceeding 2,000 EUR or requesting withdrawal] and thus shouldn't trigger KYC from those clause, there is another clause in their ToS that allows KYC request simply because you start betting on their platform, and that they're allowed to suspend your activity until you do so. I've explained it here on #11, if I may further shorten it to the bare essential:Quote from: https://blackjack.fun/provably-fair/toc5.2. [...] In order to start betting on the Service or withdraw your winnings, we may require you to become a verified Customer which includes passing certain checks [...] We reserve the right to suspend wagering or restrict Account options on any Account until the required information is received.So yes, even if you did not ask for withdrawal or made a large deposit, you're still subjected [as you're agreed] to KYC verification whenever the platform deemed it necessary [on this case, they deem it necessary because they suspected a foul play].From operator's perspective, as briefly brushed above, they require KYC because you triggered their alarm, you're caught cheating on their system by exploiting bug [your true intention aside], this made them worries and require KYC to get a better detail of this \"abusive\" user and to prevent similar situation to happen again in the future.Both lead to a situation where you have to do KYC. I understand your confusion that you did not ask for withdrawal and thus [you think] you shouldn't be asked to perform KYC. However, the clause on their ToS allows them to ask this from you, with or without withdrawal and high deposit.As for why the operator \"give up\" on KYC, I believe it's actually a good-will and solving a situation. You refuse to perform KYC, they require your KYC, you both in a moot point, so they offered a way out: don't do the KYC, take your balance and leave. As for the 100 USD for listing every bug, that's them rewarding you for bug bounty, many platforms have this kind of bounty, even this forum has it.  You wanted to find their bugs, and there it is, the bug you found so far are rewarded by them, certainly it can be considered as a good will?Quote from: JackpotRacer on November 15, 2023, 07:34:17 AM[...]BTW all those lies and action for about $30 which I even did not ask to withdraw as I told him I was not in for the money I just wanted to help as I love the Blackjack game and was happy to see Blackjack.fun offering itUmm... sometimes we need to realize that we've overstayed our welcome, our presence and help is no longer needed, and it's best for us to leave. I try to make it short and as I respect you I wanted to answer youyou ToS comment is ok as it is written there and he has every right to ask for it. this does not mean it was ok and fair to ask for it in my situation. Blackjack.fun owner is insulting my intellect and of all others here and I don't accept it.when he received complaints from other users about me he did not know it was me  as he did not know my username at the table. that he let me see the KYC after he got complaints this is the way he works and this is fine. but after he asked for my username and he understood the situation he still did not want to remove KYC and this was not ok and fair as he could check the game logs but he did not till now. he was so impudent to ask me for the glitch and I explained it as my conscious was clean and I did not exploit any bug. he even offered tip for bug reports.I hope it makes sense and I could make my point clear.thanks again and cheers",
