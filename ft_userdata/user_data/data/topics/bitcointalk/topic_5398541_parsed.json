You only will be getting a sending address from a other User that have also a wallet ! If you want to send coins to somebody you need the address from that User that the Wallet and the Network knows where to send it.Lets say the sending address is somebodys receiving address .For the private Key you should be normaly can export it or shown in the settings somewhere , depends what kind of wallet you are using also .",

The compatibility depends on the device of the user and the wallet version, newer versions would not work on certain devices.• This could be an issue with the version you're using. The feature should possibly still be there, not just with the same layout as now recent releases.• Browse around the software and look for the option. Or rather than getting it to behave as expected, get a wallet that's already doing that.Multiple posts in a row is against forum rules.",

So you are using an old version of the Bitcoin wallet and this wallet actually does not generate seed phrases, unlike other wallets.About the greyed out \"Sending addresses\" it's not greyed out you need to slide it to the left to be able to go on that tab.
