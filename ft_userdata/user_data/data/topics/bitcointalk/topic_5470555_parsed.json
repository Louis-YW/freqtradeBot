After their deadline when you are confident that you will not receive the repayment only then it seems logical to tag.But again if you do not tag then the same user can try to take more loan from another user like OP and some other threads where I saw they did.A lender is always at the risk to lose his money. I have no idea how it is worthy.",

I have no idea how it is worthy.Minimizing loss is also one kind of profit. If anyone receives a negative tag obviously will not get any more loans and will not trade any reversible payment so the user can't scam more money even after a heart and soul try. For example, for this loan only 2 people will lose about 700$ but if I can't take any action then the user may scam others too.Anyway, I got partial repayment so I have withdrawn my action. But if again see the same I will tag again and create a scam accusation.",

Now for me I don't mind if he had any other loan since I know him from my local board and from our telegram group of bitcointalk Pakistan board members. So for me I can trust him for this $200, and I believe he would return the amount on the said date.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 16, 2023, 06:37:29 PMI read your terms and I think this is a border line and many will not be even go to support the flag.

Which I still doubt if he has defaulted on any loan yet.Quote from: shasan on October 16, 2023, 07:04:58 PMI got partial repayment so I have withdrawn my action.

Once that is gone, he will have no point of coming back to this forumPerhaps @shahzadafzal can also add another neutral tag, showing that he has another loan from him.",

I also didn't read the terms in full, which was my mistake.That being said after Shasan informed me I paid back the other 50$ loan instantly and the case was solved.Though I would think it's better to inform the person first instead of tagging right away, people make mistakes.Long story short, if you don't read the terms, it's on you (me).",
