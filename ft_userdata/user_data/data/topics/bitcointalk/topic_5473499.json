Did you play less? Any thought or opinion on that? Feel free to add your answer on my survey ( I will add my answer on a second time ....  )Now that the price is dramatically increasing I can surely play more as the amount of BTC which usually in casinos is displayed in some sort of FIAT money makes me play more with the same amount so the BTC price when in increase it keeps me playing more,as simple as that.I always love when the price increases and when I am prepared when I have BTC to play,I usually always have some sort of crypto to play as I always have a mining machine mining coins for me no matter how not effective they may be,I simply love to have coins at my disposal to play exactly during such time.",

I don't care about shitcoins or shit stable coins. so yes, the poll is correct   at least to me. In this case I don't care what people do with other coins or FIAT when there is a btc price change.",

Right now if we lose some amount of BTC from our total BTC or we spend it then it is bad for us because currently Bitcoin shows a lot of hope that Bitcoin will go to a much better level in the future. I will only bet with BTC on matches that I will win and on matches that I have a low chance of winning I won't bet with BTC at all because I don't want to lose BTC at the moment. I have some virtual dollars in stock I am confused whether I should gamble with those virtual dollars or invest those virtual dollars in bitcoins. If I stop betting with Bitcoin then those virtual dollars will be useful for my betting.",

BTC price itself don't really affect my gambling habits (directly at least) but there is some else that does. It is the transaction costs. When the tx costs low, I can send btc to the casino for a cheaper price and that makes me play more frequently. It makes more sense to deposit money while the cost of making a tx is cheaper obviously. However, btc price can sometimes affect the tx costs because the higher the btc goes, the more popular it gets and the more popular it is, the more people rush to the exchanges and that drives the tx costs up. So, I can tell you I often don't like to gamble when btc is going up. In these situations btc prices affect me in a negative way indirectly.",

If anything, I would say I am more prone to rolling dices when the price stays stable enough and there are no many news around how the price is going up or down. Perhaps, if I was more into centralized/decentralized stablecoins It would be easier for me not to worry too much about the price of Bitcoin and also roll dices without checking the price for months. Anyways, It is difficult for me to imagine how an increase in the Bitcoin price could push anyone to wager more. It must be pure greed.",

Like for example when you bet with 0.002 in btc when the price is at $36,000 and you won back even at 0.002 but while the price is now $40,000 because of sharp volatility. So when the winning of your bet lands in your balance as 0.002, the value will be higher than what you bet with. This is the advantage to play with btc at a higher volatility alongside other advantage you have mentioned.",

If they have bitcoins to fund their account with, they are good to go. The passive gamblers, that is people who gamble less often like me will be concerned about the price of bitcoins because we are not used to loosing to gambling and any bitcoin we loose during a time when bitcoin is performing well will hurt very much.",

Feel free to add your answer on my survey ( I will add my answer on a second time ....  )I do not think that anyone should gamble their Bitcoin away when going up or down. But we are only human and I cannot say that I have not ever gambled in my life as well...Personally, I play more when Bitcoin is going sideways, just out of boredom. But when Bitcoin goes up, I also feel like splurging a bit, so I might gamble during ups as well. During down price movements, I feel it is better to not do anything with my Bitcoin, just because it seems like a huge waste for when it goes up again.Although there is a psychological point which makes Bitcoin more disadvantageous to gambling, than with say, paper money. Its because all we see is a number going down or up. We do not see the physical representation of that value. Which in turn makes us more willing to spend or waste more money.",

Did you play less? Any thought or opinion on that? Regardless of the BTC price, it won't affect nor have any impact on my gambling habit. If playing on a crypto-gambling platform, in most cases, there's a feature where currency can be shown in fiat value. Therefore, you can control your bet on a fixed fiat amount whatever the current exchange rate to crypto is. Besides, gambling is gambling and I believe for most crypto-gamblers, BTC price is not really a big deal. We have noticeably seen an increase in crypto-gamblers over a period of time. That growth alone is enough reason to believe that fluctuations in crypto price don't matter for most gamblers, either beginners, casual, average, or hardcore ones.",
