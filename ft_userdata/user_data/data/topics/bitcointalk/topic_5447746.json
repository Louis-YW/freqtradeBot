  "content": "This is pretty interesting..“The Bitcoin Whitepaper Is Hidden in Every Modern Copy of macOSPOSTED APRIL 5, 2023 BY ANDY BAIOWhile trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.I’ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them. The file is found in every version of macOS from Mojave (10.14.0) to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isn’t in High Sierra (10.13) or earlier.See for YourselfIf you’re on a Mac, open a Terminal and type the following command:open /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdfIf you’re on macOS 10.14 or later, the Bitcoin PDF should immediately open in Preview.(If you’re not comfortable with Terminal, open Finder and click on Macintosh HD, then open the System→Library→Image Capture→Devices folder. Control-click on VirtualScanner.app and Show Package Contents, open the Contents→Resources folder inside, then open simpledoc.pdf.)In the Image Capture utility, the Bitcoin whitepaper is used as a sample document for a device called “Virtual Scanner II,” which is either hidden or not installed for everyone by default. It’s not clear why it’s hidden for some or what exactly it’s used for, but Reid Beels suggested it may power the “Import from iPhone” feature.In Image Capture, select the “Virtual Scanner II” device if it exists, and in the Details, set the Media to “Document” and Media DPI to “72 DPI.” You should see the preview of the first page of the Bitcoin paper.Screenshot of Image Capture utility with the Virtual Scanner II device selected, previewing the first page of the Bitcoin whitepaperBut WhyOf all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? The filename is “simpledoc.pdf” and it’s only 184 KB. Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.There’s virtually nothing about this online. As of this moment, there are only a couple references to “Virtual Driver II” or the whitepaper file in Google results. Namely, this Twitter thread from designer Joshua Dickens in November 2020, who also spotted the whitepaper PDF, inspiring this Apple Community post in April 2021. And that’s it!One other oddity: there’s a file called cover.jpg in the Resources folder used for testing the Photo media type, a 2,634×3,916 JPEG photo of a sign taken on Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. There’s no EXIF metadata in the file, but photographer Thomas Hawk identified it as the location of a nearly identical photo he shot in 2008.Photo of a weathered hand-painted \"6\" sign and a sticker reading \"Warning! Alarm System\" on blue painted woodIf you know anything more — about how or why the Bitcoin paper ended up in macOS or what Virtual Scanner II is for — get in touch or leave a comment. (Anonymity guaranteed!)Update: A little bird tells me that someone internally filed it as an issue nearly a year ago, assigned to the same engineer who put the PDF there in the first place, and that person hasn’t taken action or commented on the issue since”.https://waxy.org/2023/04/the-bitcoin-whitepaper-is-hidden-in-every-modern-copy-of-macos/",

Today, we discovered that there was a copy of Bitcoin Whitepaper in modern copies of MacOS, it's really funny and strange simultaneously. Say whatever you want but I think it was done for two purposes: 1. For futher PR and marketing, news websites will publish articles about this story, that will promote apple and bitcoin at the same time but apple is a hero here.2. Apple products mean high security for a lot of people, bitcoin has that reputation too. By including Bitcoin Whitepaper in macOS, it can be perceived as a message that there is a strong bong between Apple and the idea of security & privacy.Yeah, this may sounds crazy but why not?Quote from: FatFork on April 06, 2023, 07:32:46 AMI expect Craig \"Faketoshi\" Wright to take a legal action and file a copyright infringement lawsuit against Apple now.  It's immediately a lost game for him.",

Anything done for PR would have found its way to the internet quickly, sometimes it would be made out to have leaked inadvertently, but there would be dozens of news on it.• This is a loose but plausible reason for why it was done. Maybe not a company wide policy, but the engineer behind the code might have had that in mind when using it.",

It wasn't Apple who confirms the existence of the whitepaper on macOS. macOS 10.14 Was released on September 24, 2018. If they had any marketing strategy behind that, They wouldn't remain silent for four years. C'mon. I am taking it as a positive sign from Apple.Another Image is rotating on Twitter which is this;Of course, this is not real. But, This would be good to be true.",

I don't think they are holding a lot of Bitcoin as of this date, but you are right that they are really interested in it, which is why they have included it in every copy of macOS. I believe that this will really ignite the passion of Bitcoin lovers and as well grab the interest of greedy investors. Things seem to be in favor of Bitcoin and its price may soon rise above 35K.",

There is also an image found in the same folder where the BTC whitepaper can be found, though the image is unrelated to BTC, strange, or maybe all these was just done for some fun.Searching online, i heard this isn't the first time that someone found this, but it did not get so much attention from the media, though this news is not everywhere for now, but i expect this one to be published in many news outlets. There are many interpretations to this, but we cannot know the exact truth because i don't think Apple would comment on this, nor would the engineer who did this too, but good development for BTC, so anyone who has a macOS since mojave should go and read the BTC whitepaper.",
