      "body": "It is very important to drink a glass of cold water because all the organs and cells in the human body need water to properly function. Many people may not be aware but the water in our bodies helps us as it delivers oxygen to every part of our bodies. More then 60% of the body is made from water, which is why we need to drink about a gallon of water every day. Our bodies would not survive without water and our kidneys along with organs of the body would begin to fail. Dehydration is also not good for our bodies. Dry skin can damage skin cells and cause a different types of skin disorders. The many benefits of drinking water should be considered when selecting your next beverage when going out to eat. Having a cold glass of water can be the difference between that morning's coffee or coca cola. It will be better for your body, with less sugar which means less fat.",

I can't wait for the ice cubes to melt, it's easier for me to drink a glass of filtered water in the morning, is it really worse than melt water?I haven't come across this belief before... But my guess is that natural ice or water, just like fruits/vegetables are rich in what people call minerals or nutrients, and people are advised to take them in Â empty stomach especially early in the morning as they are not too heavy or mixed with things that can make you feel heavy/sick after consuming them. With \"nutrient & mineral\" rich light food or drink, the effects on the body is noticeably quick as your body is able to focus on the good things it needs to make you feel good and light... rather than weighing itself down with toxins and heavy foods",
