So you can log in and have fun with the people who still remain there.This forum is not supposed to be a social media platform in the modern definition of that term, besides the obvious forum format that keep toddlers on computers away, this is an place which actually seeks to encourage activity and meaningful discussion. It is not the typical place where you can shitpost around without consequences and people will be okey with it.That is my personal opinion, of course.",
