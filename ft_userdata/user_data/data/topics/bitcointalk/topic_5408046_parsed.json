If i spend money on ASIC miners, is this long term? please guide.That is a very generic question which can accommodate a lot of answers.I am giving you mine here,which is if you go for ASICS,I think you need to start small and if you don't want a big noise nor big power consumption there are some manufacturers that make really good ones with really low power consumption and heat for ASICS which only consume from 100-400 Watt which is nothing compared to big fatty ASICS that do well over 3000 watt.For the GPU rig you have a lot of flexibility as you can start small and expand as you see fit or as you see that you have new money to pour in to your rig.It is a good idea to buy efficient cards in terms of power consumption like the Rtx 3060 ti or 5700 Xt which are some of the most efficient ones.As I said you have the advantage of starting small here with just one GPU and then decide what to do,this is not possible with ASICS.",

When you said Asics, if you buy an Asic, is it to mine BTC or altcoins?For today, is not easy to recommend you to buy GPUs because ETH is probably coming to end of POW and nobody knows which coin will be profitable, or if any coins will beAsics to mine altcoins, like ETH asic, I think is very risk at the momentIs you want to buy Asic to mine BTC, I think it's more stable and soon or later you will have return, but again, we need information, depends of how much is your electricity rate.",

Asic (a small setup) or GPU rig (big setup)in terms of noise and heat and power consumption? what do you recommend. About the noise , i think there will be not much difference from ASIC to a GPU rig.Same goes for the heat , but it depends what kind of Hardware you have or get.For the power consumption a ASIC will take more as a gpu rig .",

If i spend money on ASIC miners, is this long term? please guide.Modern asics are designed for industrial mining. They are very noisy and consume a lot of energy. You will not be able to use ASICs in an apartment, and there will be noise problems in a private house. Noise suppression box for ASIC gives cooling problems. For home mining, video cards are optimal.",

If i spend money on ASIC miners, is this long term? please guide.As others said too general of a question.  What's the goall of the set up long term income, quick profitability and then try to flip.  What electric set up do you have.  How noisy of a rig could you handle.  Mining straight bitcoin or alts to hold or to immediately flip into fiat?  Generally speaking I'd say start with a small set up of each and work your way out from there.  You will learn a lot of how your objectives will change as ypu start mining.",

If it’s in your bedroom then I would go with GPUs because ASICs are crazy loud and you cannot sleep or live in the same room as them.However if you got room in your basement and aren’t good with building computers then you should just go the asic route. Basically plug in a PSU and network cable and you are all set. Nothing else to configure except your pool info.",

They go on Craigslist and see some ASIC for cheap, they find out they can make like $5 a day with it while only costing $50. Only later to realize that it uses $10 worth of electricity to make those $5. Very common mistake with most people.",
