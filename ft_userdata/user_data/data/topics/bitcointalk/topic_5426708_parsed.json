      "body": "I do not use two apps for telegram on the same device, even on mobile that you can use app twin and Android 12 support app twin for telegram, I still prefer to use a single app for my telegram accounts.Use one telegram app for it and add the accounts you want to add to the telegram app. If you want to use the second account to join a channel , click on the second one in a way you can see the messages on it, the second one would be the one that would be used for the channel.If it is the first one that you want to use, change it to the first account to join the channel. This has never been an issue for me both on mobile phone and computer.",
