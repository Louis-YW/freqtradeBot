Firstly, you made this topic in the wrong board.Secondly, you can't just giveaway your sMerits to someone and ask them to give you merits back in return, its not a great idea and you may even get neutral/red feedback from users as a \"merit farmer\".Thirdly, I think you are not a merit source to provide enough  merits to good posters yet.Quote from: digaran on January 17, 2023, 01:36:03 AMLike can one just beg for merit There is already one legal begging thread in the reputation board and thats enough https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405705.0",

I believe you should create some rules to support this and i want to believe you understand the qualifications that helps maintain a merit giveaway thread considering you're not a merit source, though if you can state that other merits source or any other member could also help out in the process, and to the statement you made for a reciprocate I won't adopt or encourage such since the merit system isn't built for that purpose of reciprocation, you only give when you see something that interests and touch you with a good information or idea, one must not be force or compelled to do so, which means your purpose for the creation of this thread is for merit reciprocation which is obviously bad and unethical enough to the forum standard, lastly consider we already have enough threads about merits giveaway and I don't see anything new or unique from what you're presenting here or better than other existing threads.",

Maybe only one, but it is not explicitly written, although I would say it like this : Anyone who understands the following post is a candidate for merit Quote from: Ucy on January 17, 2023, 02:11:12 PMYou are quite smart. But \"corrections\" will only happen when *Bitcoin Master* deliberately stops posting on crypto/Bitcoin related things. So, people don't need to panic and begin to act foolishly. I want things to be fairly predictable to members who have been following my price prediction and trust that I will continue to be consistent and reliable as long as my CREATOR is with me, and I'm sure HE will never leave me.  But such members will likely need very convincing proofs (especially considering we are in trustless environment)... proofs so convincing that no one anywhere in the world can find fault in. I actually want them to take enough time to observe the Predictions of Bitcoin Master and be sure he is telling the truth before they can trust him. By the way, we will continue to witness the most precised and reliable Bitcoin price Prediction in the world from him. One of the main reasons for all these is for the World, Bitcointalk forum and cryptocurrency space in general to know I have truely been given the Authority and Power to be a Moses and Elijah to them, and guide those who want to be guided away from the gripe of Pharaoh/satan to the Promiseland/Paradise. The journey has already begun & True Cryptocurrency will be used an alternative financial system. There are people who are trying to draw us back due especially to the fact they consume and believe things from the World. Don't forget that Pharoah/satan will always try to use them as traitors are used to take people back to Egypt/slavery. It's important to note that this one is a journey that encompasses all Nations/tribes/races... That is, both Jews and the Gentile.  The CREATOR is so Merciful, Lovely and Kind. All Glory and Adoration be HIS HOLY NAME. I need everyone to focus and understand what I'm doing. I notice it's easy to continue to convince people with Miracles. But remember the good works also. The proofs are numerous but we will provide more to ensure that no one is left behind. However, it's written that \"many are called but few are chosen\". Be sure to be part of the chosen and never miss this. Miracles yesterday, merits today, who can guess what's next?",

      "body": "Interesting. I just noticed the merit topic was moved here. I wonder when and why . Well, I'm not too interested in the merit system, I only became more interested after reading a little bit about it. So I thought maybe I was a little stingy with mine and I need to giveaway the few I have for quite something now to newbies who I usually see and interact with in the section I enjoy posting in(that's off topic section) . In regards to reciprocation of the kind gesture, the ones who reciprocate could do exactly what I do for them, which is meriting any good quality post of mine (or even others) they can find and that in my opinion is a sustainable way to give them out as we will continue to have more merit to giveaway. I guess I will have to totally abandon earning any reward on this forum so that I can do my job in peace. Quote from: leonair on January 18, 2023, 10:07:14 AMIt is not the right board for distribution your merit. and your trust list shows us your post is not quality full  and you are Part of the Spammer.  you have 3 marit earnd in 120 days which is not enough for you to allow in any signature campaign that's  why you have made a new trick to earn merit. am i right @Ucy  What trust list? Can I see it? What range of quality are you looking for, high/good or low/bad? And what do you define as spam? Post you don't like, or what exactly? Don't you think I could easily earn alot of merit in a short time and participate in Sig Campaign if I send my posts for review or do other things people normally do to earn merit? Unfortunately, that is not my kind of role. I prefer to focus on my role which definitely benefit the community/forum. But if you say you benefit nothing then you benefit nothing from me.Edit: I saw the Trust list you are talking about. Just noticing that today, and to be very honest with you they mean absolutely nothing if they are not true. Nothing wrong in claiming I can move the price of Bitcoin if I can actually do it, and nothing wrong in asking people to donate if I'm able to do it. And they may donate part of their profits from the price movements. They are big accusations (especially spam accusation) and need to be proven.I leave Judgment to my CREATOR anyway. .By the way, it's not a good idea to judge those above you. He That judges me is the LORD. Mere mortal with logs in their eyes can't see properly to judge right.",
