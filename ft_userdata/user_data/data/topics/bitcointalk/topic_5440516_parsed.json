AI Has nothing to do with mining of any sort... Personally I'd at least pick a tech forum that has a more general audience vs one that is focused on mining.",

Can anyone give a practical solution.The idea to build something good and far more superior than the existing AI is actually there but we need the talented/passionate/qualified coders and rest of the community working together in harmony to build it, with the idea originator or the head guiding them. It could take less than a week to develop something that will shock humanity if it's built in harmony while the head guides them.Idea originator is currently working on his own team just incase no one in this forum is willing to be guided by him",
