  "content": "Firstly, I'd like to share some images below and then I'll begin.Profile of the user: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=768660Well, I don't know where to start from or even which place is the best to put this thread into (please move it to the appropriate area if this is not a Meta stuff). Actually, I saw some users giving merits to some posts of this member in a matter of seconds or minutes, with each user doing the same thing but with a good interval in between (in terms of dates). I don't know what brought this to my attention, but there are many users here on the forum who got merits unusually. I can bring many examples (like we saw some account farming busted in the past years).I have no hard feelings against anybody, be it the merit gainer or the giver. I'm curious to understand what made these people give him so many merits in a row (highest was I think 50 merits spread and given by indah rezqi and The Sceptical Chymist each).",

I don't wonder why someone would suspect other users especially since every user has free speech, but opening up a court table for something that can be resolved in PM I don't think is necessary.2double0, it's okay to spend sMerit on posts you think are quality regardless of whether your intention is to help that user's ranking or just merited their thoughts. I don't think there's anything wrong here, and maybe you should just close the thread and forget about it. Also The Skeptical Chymist is a very generous merit source over the years, he has thread about his service where some users can ask him to review posts and in the past he has done that for me too.You can probably find reason why one of them did so I guess it's perfectly fine as long as the merit they spend on quality posts even if it's subjective from one user to another.

Something to end up with zero merits leftIt's this post:Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIf they complain about amounts, tell them to complain to me. It's best if sources try to exhaust their source allocations, even if it means giving posts higher amounts than is typical. If you have 150 source merit and you only see 3 merit-worthy posts in a month, then I'd rather you over-give each of them 50 merit than let the merit expire. That way there are more people capable of sending merit, and the \"merit economy\" is less top-down.@OP: as a Merit source, I guess I have a slightly different perspective on Merit than most users. Source sMerit feels like a \"burden\", and no matter how hard I try to get rid of them, they keep coming back! I'm now at 81 source sMerit remaining, and I think that's less than the average I've had for the past 6 months. There's also a couple thousand of \"my own\" (earned) sMerit on top of that.",
