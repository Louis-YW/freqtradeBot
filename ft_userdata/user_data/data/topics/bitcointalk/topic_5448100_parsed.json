Gamble but consider your spendings on it as an entertainment expense. Got luck on your side and won? Good. If you don't you still had fun.If you mean strategies such as martingale and its variants, certainly not. No strategy is going to beat the House Edge. The problem with this is that some people put too much hope in gambling as a good way to make money, when it is a sure way to lose money in the long run.Gambling should be seen as entertainment, as you say, where you can occasionally walk away with extra money, but the money you use in a given session should be seen as money spent, like going to the cinema or going out for dinner. If you want to make money you'd better buy bitcoin or make an investment, but people are not patient enough and expect to win a jackpot at roulette or similar.",

You're not guaranteed to find the opportunity for arbitrage betting and the gambling aspect is taken out of the equation because you're returns are guaranteed when you place the bets.Gambling inquires inherent risk and there is no risk if you know the precise return.Traditional casino games have a built in house edge so you know the return over time. The immediate return remains unknown.",

If you don't you still had fun.You are right that people should gamble and only see it as fun and entertainment, but there are strategies used in gambling. If you are a gambler, you use only small amount of money to gamble, or an amount of money like less than 5% of your weekly income to gamble, it is still part of strategies used.Anything that you are doing not to fall into big losses that can devastate your life is a strategy. Also some people read about things like martingale strategy and many others, they are also part of strategies that can be used in gambling. But you are not wrong that no matter what, gamblers should see gambling as a means of not making money, they should see it as fun and entertainment only and they should not use more than the amount of money that they can afford to lose.",

I mean I wouldn't mind people exploring whatever \"strategies\" they think works or found, it's part of the fun if they really wanted to (just like how it is in most games), but since gambling directly deals with money most people (if not all) use said strategies to assume that they'd win money (at least majority of the time) and if they don't, well, they forget often that gambling is simply just for fun. Just the fact that House Edge exists is enough to say that a user isn't going to win against a casino at all really.",

If you don't you still had fun.Gambling can really turn to be a problem for those who feel they can actually gamble just to have huge profits and this habit will definitely turn out to be an addiction if the huge profits you are chasing is not coming as expected. Gambling in a general sense could be seen as a fun even and I can tell you that there is no technically strategy you can use to actually become a successful gambler rather that will land you a successful chaser of your losses, it all depends on luck because the more you try to win big if you are not lucky you can end up loosing big so it's better to flex it and see this act as a fun event and don't ever gamble more than what you don't have if not you will ruin yourself through this act.",

Let us say wining in total, because a gambler wins does not mean the overall result will be win, it can be loss later. I have known many days that I win very well and because of that I have more energy to gamble more and finally lose that day. This has happened to me several times. We should not take gambling to be beyond entertainment because house edge always existing. I get what you mean though, I have lucky days too, but they are the days I do not gamble that much, I win and I leave the house immediately.",

Casino games are for fun and I don't know what strategies we can make out there when there's the house edge that would favor the house in the long run. Martingale is one of the most popular strategies that gamblers used but I am not really sure if these gamblers are in profit in general since they started the strategy. In sports betting, we can analyze and have a vast knowledge of the sports we are following, but that's only it, there are no technical strategies that are directly aimed toward beating the house.",

With some strategies you can get a kind of advantage but nothing that really dramatically changes your chance of win there are several known strategies such as martingale, d'Alembert, handicapping in sports and others. however, knowing them has certain advantage but won't give you a sure win on your bets. if you think your strategy is working and you're winning, better get out while you are on the positive side. because if you will continue, you will soon find out that you are already losing what you won from your games. so yeah, there may be gambling strategies but it will only work for certain period. and if you will not follow your instincts, you more then likely go home empty-handed.",

I did some strategies in the past from dice to roulettes and blackjack, but I always end up losing it all.

If you don't you still had fun.Well one strategy that i just realized is that if i would gamble on wrestling (and i mean WWE as in show wrestling). I should bet the one with lowest odds and therefore highest multiplier.And hold on you say, isn't that predetermined? That's the beauty of it. Technically that makes every match 50/50 to me, as i can't use my insight to predict anything. Then why in the world i would settle for lower multipliers? Obviously this would not guarantee anything but it would give me slight edge over the people playing low multiplies, assuming they don't have any insight either.Only way to get real results in this is somehow to get inside Triple H's head who presumably decides who wins. But without that it would make sense to only bet on the one with lower odds.",
