  "content": "Hello Everyone,  I am new to mining and been doing a ton of research of what to buy and what to look out for.  I'm looking to buy a ASIC miner, but really don't want to pay the mark up.  Eventually I would like to mine all the types of crypto, but have to start off with something.  For example, IceRiver looks good, but on their website they are sold out. If I look on eBay there is a huge mark up on them.  Any advice where else to buy?  Do I trust the https://www.asicminervalue.com/ telling me that Akminer, Nhash, Jingle Mining, ect are trusted resellers.  Is there some where I should follow when the latest ASIC is released or a mailer list to get on?  It appears to be ahead of the game is to buy as soon as it is released.  Looking at this a just a fun hobby.Thanks in advance.",

Your seller solves these problems. If you are buying for home mining, then you do not need customs documents.",
