There you will be able to see a lot of early developers and users, who possibly have emails and websites linked to their profiles which you can use as a jump-point to ask further questions.None of the current Bitcoin Core crop (except for luke-jr) were around in this time period.",

I have, for example, read 15 books on Bitcoin and know that many interesting events (some of which happened on this forum) have not been discussed. Hence why I thought would check in here to see if people had some thoughts.",

Sometimes I do be surprised of people who also be discouraged for not learning bitcoin with seriousness.",

Just as recommended you can get all that you want from this board since you looking foe were to get the best achievement of early developers and the Bitcoin early journey till the present time, I am sure if you press hard to make extra efforts outside this forum, I am sure you will find a handful of information and data that will support the success of your research.You may not be able to meet the early Bitcoin developers one-on-one but you can easily find whatever information you will need on the internet with the right search tools.",
