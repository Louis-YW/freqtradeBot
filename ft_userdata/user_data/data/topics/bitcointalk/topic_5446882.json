Still, even if you use loan money to invest in good business there is still a risk, the business might fail and been in good debt or bad debt will be meaningless, because a debt is still a debt.",

So my advice is it's better to live without debt and have no burden in everyday life.Indeed, some of them are quite successful by using loans to manage their financial side of the business they manage or they are lucky in every way.",

Depending on your financial status, if you are rich and the money you are borrowing to invest can be repaid even if your investment does not perform as expected, then you can go ahead to borrow, it is a good debt in this situation. If you are poor and you cannot afford to pay back the money you intend to borrow for investment if it does not go as expected, it becomes not advised as it will be a bad debt.",

If the loan becomes due for payment and we say the bitcoin market is still bearish, the pressure to pay back the loan will definitely cause the loanee to sell of the coins at a loss. Bitcoin is assured to grow in profits when it is hodl for a very long term, so the ability to have patient to hodl for long will be from money that wouldn’t be need in short term. So the duration of the loan repayment will determine whether it is a bad or good debts",

This market fluctuates over time, there are people who come to it to make short-term big profits but still lose money, but there are also long-term investors who are not too concerned about debt to invest.

The car being bought for business purposes could get stolen or something else, but God forbid. I am just trying to say that if we are in debt, it's definitely required that we repay the loan, and if the results we expected in our business to enable us to repay the loan are not what we are getting, it can result in a bit of a challenge in repayment of the loan. But I'm curious why someone would take out a loan to buy clothes and shoes.OP, I get your point, which makes me think that \"Taking a loan to acquire more liability is not a good economic plan\" should have been the title of your topic. For example, when someone takes out a loan to buy a car, they will need money to buy fuel, money to buy engine oil, money to repair the car, etc.Taking a loan to do business is not bad, but using a loan to acquire more liability for oneself may even add more debt to the person's financial stability.",

If that person doesn't have other source of income and any means to pay the loan but just relying to bitcoin then I can say that it's a bad debt.Calculating all of the interest rates until the price increases for bitcoin and then the time of selling, I guess that profit won't be that much or could just be break even.Quote from: Zaguru12 on March 30, 2023, 10:50:05 AMQuote from: alastantiger on March 30, 2023, 09:10:42 AMThere are bad debts and there are good debts.

You said that when you loan to purchase something that would appreciate in value, it is considered good debt right? Why asking for Bitcoin when it also appreciates in value?Volatility you said? Isn't Real Estate, Precious metals and commodities volatile? Bitcoin is just more volatile than those 3, but their price is decreasing and increasing as well. Now to answer your question, I consider borrowing money to invest into Bitcoin a good debt because the price of it appreciates. I tried this already just a few months ago when Bitcoin is at it's bottom. I got a loan from a cooperative here, and I'm paying it monthly. To cut the story short, I'm now in profit because of the price increase of Bitcoin.",

Bad debt is easy, debt is used for consumption matters, now there are also many types of consumption here, ranging from basic needs to debt just to fulfill lifestyle, it's as simple as this.

The value and benefits of this type of debt give us the opportunity to own useful assets and create new sources of income in the future.

Taking loan becomes a problem when the person doesn't have a monthly income or a salary job that can help him pay up the loan before the time duration elapses, if he is not investing the money.

Let's take for example,bitcoin halving will be experienced next year and if by early next year,you take a loan to invest in bitcoin to pay back by 2026. This is a good loan because after bitcoin halving, the bull run comes in and at 2025 bitcoin price will get to ATH. When you sell off your investment you can make much profit and pay back your loan still have enough funds with you to start a new bear market",
