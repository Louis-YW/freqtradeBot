  "content": "Youtube video link where I discuss one out of two of bitcoin's main problems:Problem 1: Coin distribution problemProblem 2: Scalability problem.I discuss problem 1: https://youtu.be/QNKMpxZ2um0So far the basic idea is to use \"signed hashes\" instead of \"most powerfull hashes\".And the new/additional consensus rules that I have come up with so far are:Basically I term/call/coin this new system: \"Skybuck's Signed Hash Blockchain system\"Going to paste this text as it was described in the video above, maybe later I will work on it some more,right now I am looking for feedback and critique if you think this system will work, or if you spot flaws and weaknesses in it ?!PEER CONSENSUS RULES:PEER CONSENSUS RULE 1. THE IP THRESHOLD RULE WITHIN A 10 MINUTE TIME FRAME.PEERS WILL ONLY ACCEPT NEW BLOCKS WITHIN A 10 MINUTE TIME FRAME/PERIOD, WHERE THE BLOCKWITH THE LOWEST IP ABOVE THE IP THRESHOLD WINS.PEER CONSENSUS RULE 2. THE LONGEST BLOCKCHAIN WINS.THE LONGEST BLOCKCHAIN WINS/IS SELECTED AS THE MOST VALID BLOCKCHAIN.PEER CONSENSUS RULE 3. IF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT BLOCKS ARE DETECTED FROM A SINGLE PEERTHEN THESE BLOCKS AND THE PEER IS DISQUALIFIED AND THE IP THRESHOLD IS INCREMENTED + 1.PEER CONSENSUS RULE 4. DISQUALIFICATIONS SHOULD BE BROADCASTED THROUGHOUT THE NETWORK, BASICALLY THESE WOULD BE THE MULTIPLE BLOCKS. PEERS (GROUP A) THAT IGNORED THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS SHOULD INFORM THE PEERS (GROUP B) (<-THAT HAVE DISQUALIFIED THESE BLOCKS OR THESE PEERS) THAT THEY (GROUP A)(THE PEERS THAT IGNORED THESE DISQUALIFICAGIONS) DISAGREE AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON A SPECIFIC CHAIN AND IT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO INFORM (GROUP B) OF WHICH BLOCK OUT OF THESE MULTI BLOCKS THEY SELECTED, SO THAT AT LEAST (GROUP A) CAN KEEP THAT CHAIN IN THEIR MEMORY OR MAYBE THIS CAN BE DONE LATER.PEER CONSENSUS RULE 5. IN CASE OF THE DETECTION/DETERMINATION OF DISQUALIFIED BLOCKS, WAIT UNTIL IP THRESHOLD+1 (BASICALLY EITHER DISQUALIFIED BLOCK IP THRESHOLD +1) OR MAIN IP THRESHOLD WHICH EVER IS HIGHER. IF THE PEER DECIDES TO DISQUALIFY THESE BLOCKS THE PEER SHOULD MARK ITSELF AS DISQUALIFCATION-RE-SYNC-NEEDED. PEER CONSENSUS RULES 6. IF THE DISQUALIFICATION-RE-SYNC-NEEDED FLAG IS SET THEN ON INCREMENTATION OF THE IP THRESHOLD THE PEER SHOULD RE-SYNC ITSELF WITH OTHER PEERS THAT MAY HAVE ACCEPTED THESE MULTI BLOCKS AND ASK THESE PEERS WHAT THEY NOW BELIEVE IS THE LONGEST CHAIN... MAYBE +1 IS A LITTLE BIT EARLY... BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MANY SPLITS ACROSS THE PEERS, MAYBE THIS RE-SYNC THRESHOLD NEEDS TO BE SET A LITTLE BIT HIGHER LIKE +5 OR +6 OR +10.THIS COULD BE CUSTOM SET AND REALLY LONG TERM IS NOT THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM.SO THERE MAY HAVE TO BE A PROTOCOL WHICH ALLOWS PEERS TO ASK ANOTHER PEER:WHICH BLOCK DID YOU ACCEPT AT A CERTAIN IP THRESHOLD, OR ANOTHER IDEA COULD BE:WHICH BLOCK DID YOU ACCEPT FOR BLOCK NUMBER X, X BEING THE BLOCK NUMBER WHICH WAS DISPUTED AND MARKED AS DISQUALIFIED.

I tried to improve the text somewhat by seperating the consensus rules with an extra space, I was also unhappy with the layout, however this idea is fresh from the mind, one day/few hours old and could definetly use some more work. However I share it immediately in case something strange happens to me, like airplane landing on my building.2. The all caps is because I record this on a youtube livestream, not all watchers might be using high-resolution displays, it can also be beneficial to watch video at low resolution to be able to skip through it more fastly.This is indeed an old windows 7 machine from 2012, though it's rock stable concering the OS, the 3D chip is indeed damaged cause of overheat, nothing I can do about it, when Ryzen 7000 comes out I may purchase it, but for now this old hardware usage does not matter much for developing ideas.3. This should be common knowledge... the initial few blocks were analyzed by somebody.. and his conclusion was... multiple machines were used... try and google this... I have little interest in proving this... I take it as a given... doesn't really matter that much... the point is mute... mining pools are a reality.4. Not sure which words you mean, this may be indeed my sense of humor.I am not sure what you are referring to in the first 3 minutes, perhaps this is my personal oppinion about why bitcoin failed and is a failure, if you disagree with this statement then I can understand that, but I think you are wrong to say that I am wrong, bitcoin has been mine-pooled and thus it's initial vision failed.

Very interesting feedback so Satoshi Nakamoto did originally consider an IP-Addressed based blockchain, but for whatever reason unknown to use decided not too.The argument stated is that it would be subverted by those with access to long ranges of IP addresses.This may be a valid concern with the current design. I can indeed envision a situation where subsequent blocks are all produced by the same IP block range.A solution to this concern is to RANDOMIZE the IP Threshold based on a RANDOMIZATION algorithm.Thus would solve this problem, and allow the closest/nearest IP address to be accepted by the network, preventing and entire IP range of dominating the blockchain for a while.",

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.I will let you think about that.Perhaps now you understand why the bitcoin to dollar price is tanking/sacking... going down to zzzzzzzzzerrrrrrrrooooooooooo.I give up for now, trying to find a better coin distribution system.Because even with Skybuck's ideas in an ideal/fair world. I think computation above shows that the 10 minute time window is the real culprit... and is too slow to distribute coins successfully across the world.",

Pool mining is not part of the official bitcoin protocol and it's not a good technical solution for the bitcoin idea. What I am trying to explain in the video is that pool mining is dangerous and there may come a day when the pools will all join together to destroy the system. They will have that power. There is technically nothing stopping the pools from doing this. So far now this not happening is based on psychologically and expected economic profits, not technically and therefore it's technically dangerous and a ticking time bomb. I now agree with you that the title was somewhat optimistic and jumping the gun, after analysis I come to the conclusion that it only improvements the coin distribution of bitcoin, it does do something else interesting, it's much more energy efficient. So based on these two points I have changed the original title.Original title was: Solution for the bitcoin distribution problem.Modified title is now: Improvement for coin distribution (problem). Side effect: Energy efficientFinal title will be: Proof of Signature + Lowest address wins coin distribution  + Energy efficientto more accurately describe the ideas in these texts and the video.2. Good point, maybe I will try in the future, but for now I am exhausted and came to the conclusion the 10 minute time windows is the main weakness in bitcoin original system design. I do concur that as long as the mining pools do not join forces the mining pool could be a solution for people to acquire some modest ammount of bitcoins. So an adhoc solution it is for now.3. I know of power/prove of vote or power/prove of stake or something like that... not sure if it uses signed hashes idea however most likely it does use a 5 or 10 minute time window and is most likely limited in that regards and has the same distribution flaw as bitcoin 4. I did include some graphics at the start of attempt 2, to at least explain the Signed Hash idea.5. My conclusion for is bitcoin's original coin distribution method/10 minute time window is heavily flawed, it's now being kept alive by an adhoc solution: mining pools where there is a danger of total system collapse if they join forces/pools.A caution/featuristic conclusion/solution would be to speed up the blocks/time window... or maybe indeed incoorporate mining pools into some kind of official protocol specification, but in such a way that a major/above 50% is technically impossible.But I will leave that to either somebody else or another time, I am butting out of this discussion/idea for now, but I do believe Signed Hashes might be a little/small improvement towards a better cryptocoin system. It at least gets rid of the \"computation horse power\" and \"global warming\" so there might be something to it, but for a different reason: less energy usage.I also thank you for your feedback and how to improve. I liked your none-white-line point based critique/feedback, easy to read and easy to process/respond too.",

I appreciate you recording for over 3 hours today, but I don't have the time to watch such long videos. What I can do is reply to forum posts.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:20:46 PMHowever after analyzing the original bitcoin time window I do come to the conclusion that the 10 minute time window in bitcoin is a major flaw and a major weakness.Interesting hypothesis. Let's see.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:20:46 PMLet's see how many blocks bitcoin could have distributed over the last years since it's inception:2022 - 2009 = 13 years.So that is roughly13 years x 365.25 days per year x 24 hours per day x 60 minutes per day / 10 minutes per block = 683.748 lucky persons.So less than 1 million people, closer to 500.000 people would have been the luckyones.... and the rest would be left without coins and would have to beg or buy from the lucky ones.First of all, you're overcomplicating things again. The number of mined blocks as of now is 750642. You can look it up on your own node using bitcoin-cli getblockcount or open a block explorer like https://mempool.space/.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:20:46 PMThere are roughly 7 billion people on this planet if you believe that number.So let's compute the \"coverage\" of this planet wide population in percentages(683.748 / 7.000.0000.000) * 100% = 0,00976782857142857142857142857143%Alright, so you figured out that if every single person was mining, due to only 6 blocks being mined per hour on average, not everyone can get a block reward.However, we have mining pools. They pay per share, so I can mine for 10 years, never submitting a winning block to the pool, yet still get paid perfectly fine according to my hashrate in proportion to total hashrate.Mining pools, actually fix this problem.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:20:46 PM(What this means for bitcoin and other cryptocoin systems with this 10 minute window):So the conclusion for now is that bitcoin is for the lucky few, the elite, the upper class in an ideal bitcoin distribution scenerio, best case scenerio.That's a wrong conclusion, as there are mining pools (see above). Everyone can mine, even with a little USB stick like the Compac F, pointed to a pool will get them around 100sat a day. They might never find a block, but they'll sure as hell get their daily payouts (been there, done that).Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:20:46 PMSo I stand with my initial statement that bitcoin has completely failed in it's objective of fairly distributing the coins among this world/population.Besides the fact that this wasn't its only / main objective, actually it wasn't a Bitcoin objective at all to distribute it evenly among the whole population. I think it's easy to understand that mining is the most fair way to distribute coins in existence. The more power you put in, the more coins you get out. It sounds pretty fair to me. Why should someone building a farm, investing millions of dollars in equipment and installation, get as much daily coins as someone just buying a $200 Compac F?Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:20:46 PMPerhaps now you understand why the bitcoin to dollar price is tanking/sacking... going down to zzzzzzzzzerrrrrrrrooooooooooo.That's absolutely not why the exchange rate has dipped. Remember the graph looked very much like it does now, dozens of times, just with lower peaks. But the exponential growth, followed by a drastic crash, is something that's been repeating over and over since Bitcoin's inception. And every time people said 'now it's surely going to zero', until they understood.Anyhow, if you believe other coins are performing better, due to a better 'distribution scheme', choose a bunch and look at how they're performing against Bitcoin in the current bear market. Most coins have lost against Bitcoin, actually.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:38:59 PM1. Pool mining is not part of the official bitcoin protocol and it's not a good technical solution for the bitcoin idea. What I am trying to explain in the video is that pool mining is dangerous and there may come a day when the pools will all join together to destroy the system. They will have that power.First of all, they cannot 'destroy the system'. A few pools could collude to censor transactions and stuff like that, but the rest of the Bitcoin world would notice, dismiss that chain and all the work gone into it would have been for naught. Wasted energy and money.If pools were able to collude to destroy Bitcoin, they would destroy their very income stream. It's like saying 'employees are a bad idea because they can kill their boss' or something like that. If they do it, they're without a job. (and probably in prison)Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:38:59 PM3. I know of power/prove of vote or power/prove of stake or something like that... not sure if it uses signed hashes idea however most likely it does use a 5 or 10 minute time window and is most likely limited in that regards and has the same distribution flaw as bitcoin PoS is a whole other can of worms; I suggest you inform about both systems thoroughly before jumping to odd conclusions. The path of enlightenment takes time and effort. This is not meant as an insult, but as an encouragement to continue studying. Lots of stuff will clear up for you, I'm sure, with time... Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:38:59 PM5. My conclusion for is bitcoin's original coin distribution method/10 minute time window is heavily flawed, it's now being kept alive by an adhoc solution: mining pools where there is a danger of total system collapse if they join forces/pools.If you're interested, you may want to look into decentralized mining pools where there's no central pool admin who could decide to collude with another pool. Also consider reading about game-theoretic reasons why pool centralization is not desirable and miners themselves are motivated to switch pool when they see their pool getting too much hashrate.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:38:59 PMA caution/featuristic conclusion/solution would be to speed up the blocks/time window... or maybe indeed incoorporate mining pools into some kind of official protocol specification, but in such a way that a major/above 50% is technically impossible.Solving the challenge of an entity owning / controlling 50% of hashrate is an interesting topic, but it's been discussed before and is totally off-topic now.Quote from: Skybuck on August 22, 2022, 03:38:59 PMBut I will leave that to either somebody else or another time, I am butting out of this discussion/idea for now.Don't feel discouraged. I appreciate the effort and enthusiasm, but it has become clear to me that you've just got a lot of catching up to do. Most people do, myself included, so don't feel bad about it. I hope you could learn something from our replies and find topics to dig into a little bit more.",

I think computation above shows that the 10 minute time window is the real culprit... and is too slow to distribute coins successfully across the world.If you think 10 minutes block time is too slow, you also should think how to significantly reduce orphan block on lower block time.",

That's why pools exist.Lowering the block interval means higher chances to have orphaned blocks, and thus, lower security with the same hashrate.",
