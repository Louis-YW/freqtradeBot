  "content": "Hello guys.Without wasting time I'll just go down to business. When the bad habit come to mind what's that or what are those mental images that comes to play in your mind? As for me the mental image that comes to mind is a cage. Yes, bad habits are like mental cages that limits us in some certain ways. Take me for instance, I smoked a lot and it began to interfere with my personal and professional lifes. I found it difficult to have a good relationship with anyone, my boss at work, my family and friends started losing trust in me. I was gradually becoming a certified bum. But I'm thankful realization stepped in, and I had to go back to my drawing board to fix my life.I just recently stopped smoking, but the cravings and the hunger to go back to smoking is just too much to bear. Although I came up with an idea that's kinda working, but it's not actually helping with the cravings and that's a battle I'm still trying to win. I started locking myself up in my room and I don't go out for nothing.. if it's not work-related then I'm not interested in going out. I also had to break contact with some certain friends and whatnot. It hasn't been easy these past few months, but I believe if I can finally overcome this hunger to smoke then there's nothing I cannot do.Your life's blueprint is in your hands, work with it.Please feel free to say your mind.",

      "body": "Yes, bad habits really can't make our lives better. I've never smoked and do my best to keep fit, though my husband prefers eating fast food, smoking, drinking Cola every day, etc. He gained a lot of weight and it led to various health problems, including ED. Of course, it made him lose his confidence, especially when he had to buy viagra online. Until it happened, I tried to persuade him to change his lifestyle but never succeeded. Now we are going through this together. I monitor his nutrition and we train together. Also, he reduced the number of cigarettes to one per day (which is great in comparison to 20/per day). I do hope he will return his confidence soon and will keep leading a healthy lifestyle further.",

      "body": "That’s great that you have quit smoking and I understand how hard it was for you. Quitting smoking is a worthwhile goal of many people so you are ahead of the curve here and your body is thanking you silently for putting putting down this bad habit you had for so many years.Therefore, it’s great to feel good about your amazing accomplishment but you can never let your guard down. It’s good to remember that you still have to work at it one day at a time.",
