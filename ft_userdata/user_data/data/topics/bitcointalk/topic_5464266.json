But actually, if you look at the potential for bitcoin in the future, I don't think you need to worry or worry. Because it is certain that the market price of bitcoin will rise again. Moreover, in the next year bitcoin will face a halving cycle, and after that it is usually followed by a bull run market which is bound to happen. So basically beginners who are investing in bitcoin don't need to worry about the state of the bitcoin price which is currently experiencing a decline. In factthe price decline that is happening to bitcoin as it is today, can be used as an opportunity to buy bitcoin again, which is then held for the upcoming bull run market.Quote~SnipDecision making is also critical since we need to see each situation will occur and if we rush to decide without even thinking the whole point for sure we can lose our funds on simple mistake.Yes, you are absolutely right, when the bitcoin market is experiencing a decline, usually beginners who don't know the potential of bitcoin in more depth, there are two possibilities for what they will do. The first possibility is that he will sell his bitcoin assets, because the fear will go down. Then for the second possibility there are those who survive to hold on to the bitcoin assets they own. But for now, I'm sure most beginners won't make mistakes, such as selling their bitcoin assets at a loss.",

We must be in the market long enough to witness many market crashes together with fud and also witness market recoveries later to understand that fud does not kill Bitcoin and Bitcoin market.After having enough experience, we will become more calm when facing with market crashes and FUD. With our experience, we will be smarter, less greed and if we don't have opened positions with leverages, future tradings, we have better ability to be calm against market massacres. No education is enough and can help a newbie quickly gets that emotional and psychological control, it takes time and own experience.",

Sometimes it seems that this is precisely what such volatility works for—to shake off newcomers. How will these people know they made a mistake? Only when they see the growth of Bitcoin, but their reserves will be at zero. Maybe some who are very hesitant will sell everything, but others will get a good experience and understand more about the value of Bitcoin.",

There's only one simple principle that I always follow, and I'm consistently profitable with it: buy when the market dumps and sell when the market pumps. This process occurs frequently in this highly volatile market.The thing is, if people panic, the price becomes cheaper, and that's when whales take advantage of their influence. Later, they can easily pump the market to make quick profits.",

Everytime is a good time to buy if the asset is a good one, but buying the dip is far more beneficial in the long run.Getting in when prices are low also indicates that you're not solely influenced by the price or fomo around it. Such people are more likely to make a better decision than others.Edit; this is my post number 5000  Been an amazing short chat with you all.",

However, if you are going to closely analyst it, well it's a good thing that this happen this downturn.For once, the price is going to be cheap and at a discount, second, as I have said, learning curve here, you are going to ask yourself whether to buy and what you are going to do? yes, you are going to HODL on it. So that is another lessons, you need to be a long term to be able to make money in the next bull run.",

Imagine if a newbie bought a Bitcoin last week and the dump that happened recently will make that newbie think and question himself about buying Bitcoin at the wrong time. This is why as a trader you are not expected to go all in when buying Bitcoin, you can divide your funds into two parts and use one part to buy Bitcoin and the second part to buy when the Bitcoin price dumps more. We must know this in our minds after the bear market comes the bull market.",

But because we are already exposed to this kind of situation, we know what we are going to do next and that is to hold and calm. Perhaps they will know when they will find it and if they'll think differently. Many newbies have already done the research, they are new yes but their understanding is quite huge already. This is a huge advantage when you do a dip research before investing in something. It is very important and for us not to get surprised by whatever will happen in the market.",

Patience needs to be formed in beginners when facing a market that is fluctuating downwards, they must be able to control their emotions in order to save the value of their assets.The right decision will bring big profits, when the market is moving in a negative direction, you should increase the number of assets while the price is cheap. The Bitcoin market that moves in two directions always gives a different feeling to Investors.

I personally didn't see this coming to be honest, I thought the lowest Bitcoin price will get to in a long time is 29,000 dollars after reach 31 and 30k. But this can be an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a lower price. Now we have an opportunity to buy Bitcoin for 26k instead of 30k. That's like a 4,000 dollar discount.  Every time Bitcoin dips is an opportunity to buy at a relatively cheaper price It's a discount because we all know the price will still go up, it's the actual time that we do not know, but what's certain is that it will go up. So in as much as I would love Bitcoin price to get to $70k ASAP, we have to see every dip as an opportunity to to exploit the discount if you have the funds to buy.",

It's not really easy to see your money dropping, but beginners should have believe that the dump is just temporary and with time it will bounce back. If you are a professional, I see no reason why you should be scared of the dump because it’s not a new thing. Everyone that has spent time in cryptocurrency will understand how it works, and they don’t have to panic. It's annoying when I see professionals panic when bitcoin dumps. They have the experience already, and they should know it will bounce back no matter how it dumps. So I am encouraging the newbies just joining cryptocurrency to have patience in the current market conditions. They should just keep on having patience, ignore their wallets, and stop checking them frequently.Quote from: avp2306 on August 23, 2023, 09:07:35 AMFund management if they can able to grab for another funds they can set aside their funds experiencing some down turn and use an extra money to play with the market again and earn. You are encouraging the newbies to grab extra funds to play with the market, but I believe that’s a really wrong idea. The market is currently really dangerous, and don’t be surprised if the market ends up playing with them. If they have extra funds, they can just invest more and ignore it, but don’t try to play with the market.",
