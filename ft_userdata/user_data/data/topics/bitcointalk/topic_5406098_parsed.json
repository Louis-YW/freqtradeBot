Honestly their site doesn't seem to be very unique or impressive - anyone has a credible explanation who is behind the price rise of that OWL token?!Probably because more users are using the gambling platform and they prefer to use OWL token on the gambling site. There can be ways the token is promoted on the gambling site that makes people using the gambling site to buy it. As people that are using the gambling site increase, the token market worth will also increase, thus the price as well.If I will have to invest, what I can first consider is marketcap, I like high marketcap coin. Although, the coins or tokens by the gambling platform may not that decrease during bear market, but what tells us that such token will significantly increase during bull market? We are in the bear market with no further significant downturn, I expect people to more invest on coins like bitcoin so to take part in the bull time. On gambling platform, I prefer to use coins like bitcoin or stable coins like USDT. I use USDT most during significant bull market and change back to bitcoin after significant bear market like this.",

Is it more or less the same thing just in Crypto?Just like any other cryptocurrencies, it's good to buy on these tokens when the market is down, although of course there needs to be some caution taken into consideration as these are not your regular cryptocurrency, and it highly depends on the performance of the platform that it represents. I don't see any point in investing on these casinos through their tokens. I can invest on their bankroll sure, but their tokens? That's an entirely different story.Quote from: Get-Paid.com on July 13, 2022, 09:17:03 AMAnd why OWL keeps on going up in price? Honestly their site doesn't seem to be very unique or impressive - anyone has a credible explanation who is behind the price rise of that OWL token?!Â I'm pretty certain you know the answer: manipulation. It's highly improbable for a relatively unknown token to appreciate in value in the midst of a bear market, and the only way it can get some volume and attention to itself is by means of artificial growth achieved through pumps. Not saying that OWL is shit, it's just that it's a relatively unknown token at this point and that any interest that it garners is probably from artificial sources looking to lure people into buying it before they dump their bags onto these new buyers. But again, who knows? It could be anything at this point.",

Is it more or less the same thing just in Crypto?I don't think it is the same despite it looking like that right now.I think that those tokens are only well known to people who use any of those three casinos you have mentioned there.Personally I only knew about Betfury and didn't knew about the other ones.If they pay 76% on a year and they pay in BNB-Binance token that sounds like a good option to invest there,of course if you have excess money that you don't know what to do with them.These tokens also I find them at a really low number of rankings based on their market cap in the website coinmarketcap,respectively over 3000 BFG and over 4000 TFS which shows that these are not well known coins,and we never know how they will behave in the future,that is why you have not read much about them in the forum.",

      "body": "Wouldn't really consider those tokens on the same level or at least attribute the market that they have as the same as the market of Bitcoin. Those tokens are for casinos after all, and the market that they have is rather different from the investors and users of Bitcoin, not to mention that they're relatively less known compared to the big tokens. There's also the possibility that it's artificially manipulated since it's much easier to control the market for these kinds of tokens imo. Plus, the token seems to be used on the casino itself for benefits, so that may be a reason for the increase in price, though it may just be temporary in the end due to a temporary increase in the amount of players/users.",

Perhaps, their recently concluded airdrop in CMC, CEX listing, staking, and the ability of their players to earn in-game OWL token are one of the many reasons why OWL token is hovering around $1. I mean they have done all sorts of promotion, advertising, listing and all other shits that might attract people to invest in their token. However, it might also be a cover for token manipulation either, which raises their value despite of their use-cases.",

And also Betfury token BFG is better for Investment. It is also a good casino site. And they provide high APR staking reword. so we can earn from staking by bought BFG and also if that token price pump. then it will also give us huge profit. In my opinion OWL & BFG can be bought",

Whales target things sometimes randomly and it usually makes the price go up and suddenly crashes when they cash out of the market, i do think it's both beneficial of you are looking for a short term investment and also can be seen as a bubble.",
