  "content": "A NEW LAYER 2 CHAIN TO REVOLUTIONIZE HEALTHCARE AND THE BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY.After much anticipation, Solve.Care is excited to unveil its revolutionary Care.Chain — the first permissionless and decentralized Layer-2 blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for healthcare. It will improve healthcare access, delivery, management, and payments, by taking advantage of the benefits that Web3 provides.Care.Chain is part of the full-stack Care.Platform. This platform is the result of over six years of dedicated research and development, aimed at driving the decentralization of healthcare. With Care.Chain, healthcare providers, and enterprises can build and scale their Care.Networks in a way that connects patients to their care providers anywhere in the world in a peer-to-peer manner. It allows for clinical, administrative, and payment transactions with zero-knowledge, and enables compute, storage, indexing, and querying in a secure peer-to-peer network.Care.Chain is the final piece of the puzzle in Care.Platform’s top-down layered ecosystem. It introduces revolutionary new concepts to the blockchain world, which we highlight later on in this post.The traditional healthcare industry is facing a significant challenge due to the inadequate existing Web2 infrastructure that cannot meet the needs to achieve a seamless and equitable healthcare system. Even the current validation concepts in Web3 are not suitable for adoption by healthcare enterprises:· Proof-of-Work protocols (Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin) are a long way from scalability, are very expensive, and require a lot of computer computation.· Proof-of-Stake protocols (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Cardano, Solana) are currently having a hard time with being compliant with enterprises and government regulations.Even recently, the CEO of Coinbase tweeted on how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wants to ban retail investors from engaging in cryptocurrency staking.Care.Chain has a solution to the industry’s demand and that is a carbon neutral, highly scalable, reliable, and secure block validation through a totally new Proof-of Concept. Care.Chain introduces Proof-of-Competence (PoC) — making it a Good Actor Chain that is run by validators with healthcare licenses and certifications. PoC is a completely new designed solution for healthcare needs (security, compliance etc.). Basically, it is a chain with proven competent validators (Proof-of-Competence). Our Validators must have professional credentials and be a licensed entity (doctors, hospitals, pharmacy etc.).Care.Chain provides an on-chain trust layer with trustless security and zero-knowledge proof variability. It also has an inbuilt event stream architecture with self-sovereign data, identity, and application, making it a smarter trust layer that’s more than just an immutable distributed ledger.The Care.Chain solution removes power asymmetry and gives patients ownership over their healthcare decisions while being able to protect their privacy.Zero-knowledge technology is important because it provides an additional layer of privacy and security to digital transactions. With traditional authentication methods, like passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs), a user’s sensitive information is stored in a centralized location, which can be vulnerable to hacks and breaches.ZK technology, on the other hand, allows for authentication without revealing sensitive information, which can protect users against such attacks. This technology allows users to prove they have certain information, such as a password or private key, without revealing that information itself. It also allows data to be handled securely both on-chain and off-chain.Care.Chain’s Zero-knowledge PoC concept is powered by the Care Event Virtual Machine that is fully EVM compatible. That means it can easily plug into and integrate with other popular EVM Chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, BnB Smart Chain, Cronos, Fantom, and many others.Care.Chain also has support for Multi-view NFTs (Care.NFT). These are multifaceted Care.Cards can handle both shareable information and private information, as well as allowing for the interoperability of data between cards. They can now be owned in a way similar to that of an NFT with the added ability of handling data, logic, consent, and permissions. Because of this, they achieve better compliance for greater enterprise adoption.Care.Chain is highly secure and stable, with no single entity having control over it. It addresses the complexity and standard requirements of healthcare companies. It enhances healthcare services for individuals regardless of their geographical or economic circumstances.As our ecosystem gains adoption and our Care.Platform progresses, we will continually further decentralize the platform by making more and more of it open-sourced. Care.Chain has the potential to improve the lives of over 4 billion people suffering from top 10 diseases, spending over $9 trillion on healthcare worldwide.As we achieve global adoption in the coming months, the number of users on the platform is expected to rise exponentially. This, in turn, will drive more demand for the SOLVE utility token in the Care.Chain. The number of Care.Networks will also rapidly increase the utility and expand the use cases of the SOLVE token.The SOLVE token is native to the Layer2 Care.Chain network (like MATIC, IMX, LRC, DOT) so there is no need to worry about token migration, bridging, or swapping.Developed by a team of highly experienced pioneers in both healthcare and blockchain, Care.Chain introduces revolutionary technology which brings web3 to healthcare enterprises and beyond. With decades of experience in their respective fields, they’re at the forefront of the intersection between healthcare and blockchain technology.Most blockchain protocols are built from the bottom up, creating a network and looking for real-world solutions for their technology, and as a result, fail to obtain real-world use cases other than receiving and sending transactions.Ethereum currently holds 59% of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, and if you include chains that depend on Ethereum’s security, it rises to 89%. That makes it the most widely adopted network for decentralized finance. Most other DeFi blockchains have very minimal usage and are filled with vulnerabilities. DeFi protocols, as victims, accounted for 82.1% of all cryptocurrency stolen by hackers — a total of $3.1 billion — up from 73.3% in 2021.That’s because these developers are looking for real-world solutions for their technology. They focused on the tech first, then only looked for problems to solve. Most solutions are currently focused on Cryptocurrency solutions which limit their capabilities, leaving them in a closed crypto bubble.Solve.Care plans disrupt the healthcare industry in the same way Ethereum is revolutionizing the financial industry. Our Care.Platform’s robust ecosystem serves many purposes within the healthcare space and will host multiple networks all powered by the SOLVE token.We approached the market by identifying the root causes that plague our healthcare system first, then identifying and developing the technology to solve those issues. Care.Platform was built in the same way. We used a top-down approach, and we are now introducing the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle to enable Care.Platform to support the decentralization of healthcare.SOLVE ECR20 tokenCare.WalletCare.CardCare.NodeCare.ProtocolCare.Marketplace**CARE.CHAIN**Our top-down approach in building Care.Platform ensures that all components of the platform are working in unison towards the goal of improving healthcare coordination, and allows for rapid adoption and scalability. In contrast, a bottom-up structure could result in disparate and disjointed systems, making coordination and adoption more difficult.Solve.Care has a clear goal in mind and is bringing adoption of blockchain to the real world. We have already achieved so much. Solve.Care is the first company to utilize digital currency and blockchain technology in healthcare for value-based payments. We also developed a Diabetes Care.Network for our client Boehringer Ingelheim, a leading German pharmaceutical company, to help with the care of patients with type-2 diabetes. This is just the tip of the iceberg.In keeping with our tradition of trailblazing, Care.Chain is the first-ever healthcare-dedicated layer-2 chain. Moreover, with its innovative concepts, Care.Chain complies with healthcare regulatory standards, operates quickly, is eco-friendly, and is cost-effective. With Care.Chain now launched, its utility as a layer-2 EVM compatible chain for scaling and securing the healthcare industry will hasten the widespread adoption of Web3.You can explore the Care.Chain ecosystem and learn more by checking out our Gitbook page , Roadmap, and Website. Say hello to our community at our social media outlets like Twitter, Telegram, Medium, Reddit, and Discord.Stay tuned for more updates as Care.Chain revolutionizes the healthcare industry, and follow our progress on how Care.Chain’s revolutionary layer 2 EVM PoC chain is setting a precedent for the entire blockchain industry. The next step towards mass adoption of decentralized healthcare has begun!",
