  "content": "Bitcoin Beats Fiat BTC Playing Cards - Geyser Fund Campaign--->https://geyser.fund/project/bitcoinpokercards<--___________________________________________________________Slumberjack's 1st Edition BTC Playing Cards [SOLD OUT][see promotional images below] This 100% custom playing card deck is the first, limited edition run! The theme of the cards, Bitcoin Beats Fiat, was inspired by @markzellers Poker Chip set. After talking it through, we thought it'd be fun to have a deck of cards compliment the chips for all the other Bitcoin poker enthusiasts.Â I'm making this first run available to my local poker buddies and fellow BitcoinTalk'ers to gauge interest and see if there's a market for something greater. The ultimate goal is to expand this product into a second edition, different colored for mass production. I'll likely pursue a crowdfunding campaign with Geyser Fund (the BTC version of Kickstarter). More on this to come.***This first edition will be limited to a maximum of 50 decks.******limit 2 ended!***The order date will be no later than April 19th for any preorder. Potentially earlier if the 50 go quick. These first 50 will receive a signed and numbered tuck box for added authenticity. Turnaround time for an order of this size is around 10 business days. The goal is to receive the decks before the Bitcoin Conference, May 18-20. If you plan on attending the conference, and you pre-order decks, I'll plan on bringing them with me and have them for you at my Bazaar Booth.Here are a few details about the order:Mintage : 50 - 50 SOLD / 0 REMAINING***limit 2 ended!***Material : High-quality linen materialSize : Official Poker Size (2.5\"x3.5\")Qty : 54 Custom cardsPrint : Full-color print front and backPackage : Custom Tuck Box, matte finishPrice : 0.001BTC / deck + shipping costBTC Payment Adress: bc1qq6lyfwqw8pau8t7z8rkdxgrnhgn77dkzv2avcvAfter payment please DM me the following information :TxID :Qty of decks :Shipping details : use privnote if possibleShipping cost [Includes Tracking] :US Lower 48: 1-2 decks - $4 (~14k sats)Worldwide (USPS 1-4+ weeks): 1-2 decks - $17 (~60k sats) (I can ship to minerjones or others for a lower rate by request)Please reply to this thread with preferred number(s)  Editions Available :Code:Deck Â  Â  Reserved By1  Â  Â  markzellers2  Â  Â  xSlyy3  Â  Â  markzellers4  Â  Â  xSlyy5  Â  Â  Cryptogreatdane6  Â  Â  minerjones7  Â  Â  sold8  Â  Â  sold9  Â  Â  minerjones10  Â  Â  moparminingLLC11  Â  Â  cyrus12  Â  Â  geophphreigh13  Â  Â  cyrus14  Â  Â  tweetious15  Â  Â  sold16  Â  Â  sold17  Â  Â  sold18  Â  Â  sold19  Â  Â  sold20  Â  Â  sold21  Â  Â  tweetious22  Â  Â  henkcrytotank23  Â  Â  sold24  Â  Â  sold25  Â  Â  henkcrytotank26  Â  Â  geophphreigh27  Â  Â  Hookzup128  Â  Â  Hookzup129  Â  Â  av8rjeff30  Â  Â  tread9331  Â  Â  PeakDK32  Â  Â  mortare33  Â  Â  av8rjeff34  Â  Â  mortare35  Â  Â  bitdaryl36  Â  Â  buckrogers37  Â  Â  geophphreigh38  Â  Â  sam39  Â  Â  sam40  Â  Â  PeakDK41  Â  Â  sam42  Â  Â  buckrogers43  Â  Â  sam44  Â  Â  sam45  Â  Â  lewis46  Â  Â  Kryptowerk47  Â  Â  Kryptowerk 48  Â  Â  Slumberjack49  Â  Â  moparminingLLC50  Â  Â  tread93",
