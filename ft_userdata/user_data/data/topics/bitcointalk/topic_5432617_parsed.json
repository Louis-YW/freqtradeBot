I'm here to tell you that you don't actually need a new year's goal(s) and resolutions. You can have a continuation of last year's goals or a continuation of last year's resolution. I believe you shouldn't throw away your old goals for a new goal until you are positive that it cannot be accomplished beyond a shadow of a doubt. Avoid the trend of abandoning your old still achievable goals for a new one.Your opinion please?",

Actually its not like you are required to do that, but can be view as a challenge to yourself to accomplish it within the year. Thats how resolution works. If ever didnt do it then its fine, cause not all can do or completed it.",

      "body": "I agree with you, Instead of rushing to set new goals and resolutions, the new year should be a time for reevaluation of the goals, resolutions and plans you made for yourself the previous year. Reevaluation is to assess the commitment you had towards achieving that goal and to know if your priority changed with time and if it has affected achieving the goals you set. The goals you were close to achieving last year should be the goals you plan to start with achieving this year before action to achieve the new goals.",

      "body": "If you have a goal,you must keep on chasing it until the goal has been achieved, to abandon your goal because it is a new year means the goal is not important in your life,if not you will stay focus on achieving your goal, no matter how long it takes. OP, i thought when a new year resolution is made,it is on things you were doing as a habit that you don't like to continue with,for instance,this year 2023,I will not go to work late or something. Anyway its all the same habit or goal.",

To have a list of our goals in 2023 is a good idea, it will be a guide and a reminder.However, there is no need to list everything, just list the main goals/targets. I also have many goals but I usually list the main or the big goals only.Sure, having a plan is a must. How we can achieve the goals/targets in 2023 if we have no plans?We also need to determine the minimum targets, it is necessary to motivate us to do harder efforts. If we have no minimum targets, we sometimes never think to optimize the efforts.",

You try again next year, that's what it should he other than, discarding them for a new one and the trend continues...It's best you lay your approach in a pattern that allows you to check what were the factors that hindered your archiving of last years goals, resolve that and you just might attain that goal while, you set the course for another.A feeling of accomplishment always puts the mind in a mood that would definitely bring you closer to future goals.",

I for one aim for enlightenment and growth or better put, change from within. To shed weight, remain focused on getting the best and contributing my quota in the right proportion to this forum and to all pertaining to my life in general. I really gained a lot here and have tried to inculcate some of the lessons in my financial management as well.Healthy daily habits will lead one to great achievements. Cheers to a new year and to new improved goals!",

Make it stay on the path that has been set so it doesn't deviate in the other direction.I also have my list in 2023 that needs to be achieved. For now I still have a goal of collecting bitcoins until it reaches 1 BTC, maybe this will be achieved in 2023.",
