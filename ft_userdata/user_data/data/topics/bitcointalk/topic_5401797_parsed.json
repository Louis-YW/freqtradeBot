  "content": "It seems that governments are increasing their regulatory efforts after what happened with Russia \"evading sanctions\" and the recent Terra/LUNA crash. Day by day, we're seeing centralized exchanges requiring additional information in order to comply with KYC/AML as much as possible. There have been rumors that governments will target decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to require them to comply with KYC/AML laws. While we know this is impossible at the technical level (due to the decentralized nature of such exchanges), it's easy enough to prosecute the developers if their identities are publicly known across the web. A decentralized exchange requiring KYC will greatly defeat crypto/Blockchain tech's purpose in my own opinion. It will bring back the middleman which is the single point of failure crypto was meant to avoid in the first place.What do you think will happen with DEXs if governments require them to comply with KYC/AML laws? Will they cooperate or not? If they don't comply, will that mean using a DEX be considered as an illegal practice? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

But with the Luna debacle, it just gave them another reason to chase DEX. However, it is still how they are going to implement it as we all know that it's not or at least hard to because of DEX protocols. So it shape everything, as DEX should be anonymous by nature.",

KYC/AML was not a new thing. This is a common thing that may come soon. it's just the matter of time until dex may be forced to implement KYCQuote from: Abiky on June 08, 2022, 11:39:46 AMWill they cooperate or not?

They will and why not? rather than going to the jail or pay some fine to the regulators. The worst thing if the platform may be shutdown by the government. IDEX has been giving us a very good example when government was forcing dex",

      "body": "Without any doubt, governments will force all cryptocurrency exchanges to comply with KYC/AML rules. It's just a matter of time. All exchanges are located on the territory of certain states and for their functioning they will be forced to obey the established rules of this state. Otherwise, they will be forcibly closed. The state and its government have many levers of influence on any business structure. Moreover, the KYC / AML rules are issues of global security and their observance is controlled by specially created interstate structures such as FATF and the states themselves are forced to obey them.",

Anyway if it was really forced, maybe existing ones would need to comply or close down but there would surely be DEX's out there that would pop out that would avoid or not comply at all. It'd be illegal depending on the law, but they might find a middle ground or something about the creation of the law.",

The government was sued etherdelta creator and yeah it's dead. Dex will have the same faith like etherdelta if these dexs were not comply with the regulation. You did or you gone to the jail. Even if the platform already announced to be decentralized but it's having developers behind it that can be traced by the government easily.

If they don't comply with KYC/AML laws, governments can easily take down the server for good. Only tech-savvy people or those with a little knowledge about smart contracts, will be able to still use the DEX directly after this happens. But the average person doesn't know this, so shutting down the web interface would mean bringing down mainstream adoption for good. This will be a never-ending battle as governments try to prevent people from using crypto as much as possible.Decentralization needs to prevail in order to curtail governments efforts against freedom and financial independence. As long as decentralization wins, it will be impossible to enforce regulations at will. Just my thoughts",

I've thought crypto/Blockchain tech was all about decentralization and censorship-resistance. Blocking access to some tokens would make the aforementioned \"DEXs\" no different than any ordinary centralized exchange. While it's still possible to trade directly via smart contracts, not everyone knows how to do it. With censorship on the web interface, governments will be able to successfully enforce KYC/AML laws. That wouldn't had been possible if the interface was hosted on an alternative network that's decentralized by design (eg: Maidsafe, ZeroNet, etc.). Regulations seem to be increasing in the crypto sector, so we haven't seen the worst yet. Who knows what will mainstream governments do next? Just my thoughts",
