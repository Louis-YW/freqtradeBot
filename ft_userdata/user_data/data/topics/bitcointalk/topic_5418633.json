In the past, there are some pools which have same owner groups, had enough total hash rate to run 51% attack. Fortunately for Bitcoin network, those mining pools wisely to not do such attacks.You can compare how to collect enough hash rate with Proof of Work from mining rigs, mining pools to collect enough hash rate with Proof of Stake from stakers. I am sure the procedure would be more easily with Proof of Stake. There are more complicated things to run 51% attacks on PoW network than on PoS network.The estimated cost of 51% attack using NiceHash price: https://www.crypto51.app/The estimated confirmations of altcoin networks which are equivalent to 6 confirmations of Bitcoin network: https://howmanyconfs.com/You can easily see how strong and safe the Bitcoin network is. By that I imply, why do Bitcoin miners, investors want to move from the strongest, safest to a weaker one?",

      "body": "It can move, and actually, it does have forked to Proof-of-Stake, which failed miserably: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoinpos/The reason why reasonable people don't want it to switch to Proof-of-Stake is because they're reasonable. Proof-of-Stake, if you didn't know, comes with significant downsides. Here's a useful thread: [Megathread] The long-known PoW vs. PoS debate.Also, the TL;DR differences between these two mechanisms:Quote from: me, stackexchangeProof-of-Work 1. Entrance of new voters can't be forbidden. All that's needed is energy and machines that are capable of calculating hashes. Therefore, a miner who once owned 1% of the hash rate, can't make sure he'll maintain his percentage forever. 2. You can't try to cheat without being punished, because you're spending energy. For example, if a malicious miner, who owns 10% of the hash rate, tries to reverse a transaction 6 blocks deep, and fails, his real cost is equal with the income he could have had if he had chosen to mine bitcoin; he spent energy for nothing. 3. It's very difficult to steal the units that contribute to the security of the network (e.g., ASICs, GPUs etc.)Proof-of-Stake 1. Entrance of new voters is down to the stakers' permission. A staker who owns 1% of the total coins in circulation (presuming the total supply is fixed) can retain the same voting power overtime, if he just chooses to hold them.  2. You can cheat without being punished. That's known as Nothing-at-stake problem[1].  3. It's much easier, compared to Proof-of-Work, to steal the units that contribute to the security of the network. For instance, say an attacker hacked an exchange. He'd instantly gain a lot of voting power. One more core difference is that Proof-of-Stake doesn't give a solution to the Byzantine Generals' problem[2]. That's why it suffers from producing consensus, and that's why it's commonly referred to as \"subjective mechanism\"[3]; not objective as Proof-of-Work.   [1]: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2402/what-exactly-is-the-nothing-at-stake-problem  [2]: https://web.archive.org/web/20090309175840/http://www.bitcoin.org/byzantine.html  [3]: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity",

To maintain the decentalized nature of Bitcoin POW should remain. POS looks childish, unlike the POW that requires mathematical knowledge and good amount of power to mine a block. This is actual work and it's more secured than the POS. I think it'll be difficult for the government to regulate bitcoin with POW in place and easier if BTC uses POS.",

Until now, apart from the limited supply leading to the price increase, decentralization is the biggest beauty of bitcoin that no other asset class has.That is a very nice insight from you which is a fact also Apart from the tendency of Bitcoin being highly centralised if it is moved to proof of stake, there is also going to be a problem of too many forks of Bitcoin.If there were supposed to be migration of Bitcoin from proof of work to proof of stake it should have been done early enough when the network was not so large but with the large network of Bitcoin today any attempt to do that we throw the miners into big confusion and the resultant effect will be up to three forks of Bitcoin.It is a very fearful thing to behold. Bitcoin can undergo many changes, but migrating from PoW to PoS is one of the last things we will see if it will everly happen.",

Enery problemIf Bitcoin moves to PoS then I'm sure it won't be approved by many. After all, PoS only creates centralization which no longer results in anonymity. Control can be disconnected at any time. And don't expect Bitcoin to be like Ethereum which miners now don't like. Bitcoin must remain PoW and whenever it must remain PoW, we only have Bitcoin consistently whereas when other altcoins move to PoS then it does not apply to Bitcoin. The electricity bill is just talking about having stakeholders have complete control and that's not what Bitcoin is all about.

Why will it remain PoW? It's a more secure and less centralized option, the arguments were already noted in the thread. Since it's not merely a whim, I think people should try to push for the PoS. Take GPUs, for example, which are getting increasingly more power-hungry. They, let's be honest, are usually used for leisure, as not a lot of people do the kind of work that requires a very powerful power-hungry GPU. They do get more powerful with every generation, but that leads to increase in energy consumption. I don't see people calling to ban GPUs or ask gamers to play less demanding games and buy simpler gear.",

At least 51% of miners need to provide their consent and remaining 49% can fork out. This is how it can be done. However, considering how big the miner network is for bitcoin, I don't see it happening ever. At least not in our lifetime to be honest. Also moving to pos means the network will be more centralized and miners will loose their investments that they had done on their mining gears. So I doubt if a consensus will ever be reached.",

You need a lot of money invested to be able to stake it. 32 to be exact. That's almost 50k usd! You could solo mine bitcoin with less money invested. People who cannot afford to stake alone use big pools and this makes all stakers centralized in 2 or 3 biggest pools. I've read that over 30% of ETH staking deposits is in one pool and this can grow in time. You don't want this to happen with bitcoin.
