  "content": "I'm in a happy mood for now and intend to share a little joy with all of you. Forums have taken me to new heights of bitcoin knowledge, nothing is more interesting to someone who has already achieved success in investing, although everyone's level of success varies. Bitcoin has changed my life to be more financially independent, the few $ I invested initially today has given me so many blessings and I have reached a very fulfilling stage.I have been planning this for so long and my faith in bitcoin has paid off, today marks four years since I have been involved in bitcoin investing on a regular basis. I have a promise with my wife, that one day I will build a house and buy a car to support our journey in life, even though she never knows how long I have been investing in bitcoin, but as a good husband I explain the details . Today he has enjoyed tangible results from the Investments I made in the previous four years.Although I didn't buy houses and cars using bitcoins directly, which makes me very happy because I get fiat from investing in bitcoins and to be honest it's very difficult to build houses and buy cars if I don't prepare my finances well. While I was more fortunate to know bitcoin, compared to my colleagues who initially doubted bitcoin.Bitcoin has changed my life to be more prepared for the financial system which is increasingly difficult to maintain its value and because of today's bitcoin I managed to build a small palace for us to live in with my wife and children. This is really a great achievement that I got in bitcoin, how was your experience?",

Usually it's your determination that leads you to this level because in some cases there are people that decides to venture into bitcoin investment but couldn't controlled their feelings and emotion towards watching seeing their investment sink down to bottomless part without taking action to recover some investment.Since you have decided to bear risk and have patient then you enjoyed the fruit of having patient. There are lots of numerous testimonies that have been shared here about bitcoin and we return all the thank to the Founder who put up this unique idea to create bitcoin for the World.",

I envy your fortitude, OP, because you've obviously seen Bitcoin at $67,000 without being tempted to sell. Is it true? Four years is a good line for holding, but after the high price, it's been two years since Bitcoin can't pick up this price, can we say that you are in a good win?In any case, I think your height will now be $100,000 or more. Stay on your goals and don't give up. I see many people here on the forum whose lives are changing because of Bitcoin, and I hope your goals lead you to success in the same way.",

If you say you have bought houses and cars, only investing for four years in which the bitcoin has done x7, what you say is either a lie or is that you started from a very large initial capital.Using https://dcabtc.com/ we can see that $100 monthly invested during those for 4 years would result in $7,769 as of today, which is not enough to buy houses and cars.And if we put in $100 a week, which many people on the forum can't invest, we get $31,984 , which gives you enough to buy a car, but not houses and cars in plural.The return using DCA has been good but not magical, as you try to make believe.",

At this point i don't know how i can afford all these with BTC, and i don't really care, i'm just happy i can use a censorship resistant currency, and i can keep a part of my money all by myself without a third party, all by using a self custody wallet.",

This is really a great achievement that I got in bitcoin, how was your experience?Your story is encouraging and a motivation to everyone who wishes to develop consistency in investing. For someone to have been consistently investing in bitcoins for four years requires a lot of discipline, commitment and sacrifices because within that four years it is very impossible to say that you faced no kind of situation that threatened your resolve to continue investing till you achieve success. Your attitude is one to be copied. Your patience finally paid off and I am happy for you and your family. If bitcoins got you a house, It has the potential to get you more houses, properties and a comfortable life for you and your family with proper planning, patience and knowledge.",

Going on OP's story, having a house and a car are the things that we want to have when we settle and start our own family. And by having these possessions with the help of bitcoin as you've made profits from it, it is going to be remarkable forever in your life that you'll never forget the journey that you've got as you invest in bitcoin.

Then I thought perhaps OP also trades Futures or has been on DCA. Whatever approach OP used, it's a welcome development.

It’s a different story that we all have regretted this once ever in our life. I do have plans since 2-3 years and continuously saving bitcoins (Satoshi ideally) and trying to forget how much amount I have in my ledger. This can help me get to my goals quicker. Still far away from owning full bitcoin. Hope so everyone on the forum stays here until we get old and still talk how we did it.",

But like you have stated, no one can ever please the human mind to full satisfaction. For me I just feel if anyone is actually lying about what he or she posted it is left for me to choose whether to believe it or not and not to criticised what he or she has shared, and by the way if the Op in question is actually lying, I think he is actually telling it to himself alone as no harm is to done to anyone in what he or she has said.",
