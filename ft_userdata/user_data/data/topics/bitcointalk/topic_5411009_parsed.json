  "content": "I have been following NFTs on twitter for a while now and a couple of creators have come to my attentionI don't personally have the fund to invest, however thought this might be interesting for anyone that does.I have linked their collections to this post as neither has a huge following as of yet, however I feel they both deserve more and these would be great projects to invest in from ground level.Here is the first one (photography): https://opensea.io/collection/flicks-from-lagosThis is a beautifully crafted photography collection, and we have seen photography be very popular in the nft space as of late. The collection is going for relatively cheap now as well so there is definitely value to be made. There is only one location on this, but as he states on his twitter, he is always building his collection, and this one would be a great investment for anyone looking to gain a quick buck in value.twitter handle: @ogbeniyardHere is the second one (poetry):https://opensea.io/collection/provocative-poetryThis a poetry collection about the corruption in our world at the moment, there are 7 poems here with completely different themes and structures. The creator has been advertising the entire collection on twitter for as little as 2.5 Ethereum, and in my opinion this collection could be worth six figures in 3-5 years time. This is a great time to get in on a revolutionary piece of work. twitter handle: @PoetryaProbityLet me know what you think of these collectionsThought I'd leave them here for anyone who enjoys investing in NFTsPeace",

      "body": "Honestly, I'm not really interested in NFT, because people buy pictures up to millions of dollars, which is a waste of money, just for a picture, why do paintings don't sell on NFT, if you think about it using logic , what's interesting about all of this? The NFTs at Opensea, all are almost the same, I've even seen someone install ID cards, from all countries, and include photos/addresses. Of course, many will misuse this phenomenal thing, to make instant money, from selling NFT. What I know is that they display someone's identity to Opensea, don't they think that in Opensea, if the image has been uploaded, it will not be able to be deleted from the device, it's a pity in my opinion.",

So many popular NFTs have been loosing its value and it becomes something useless for now. NFTs were not utilized and it's only PNG that being used to fool people to invest in that shit. I personally will never deal with any NFTs especially NFT wallpaper lol.",

If there are still investors that are very optimistic on this, I think those are the ones that are good in flipping. They look at the price at the beginning and if there's a potential because of the team and other stuff that it can offer.That's making them interested and doing these investors a favor if they see those factors that is sellable in the nearest future. Anyway, I've made not that much with it or I can say that I'm close to a failure or no luck with these NFTs.",

If the NFT you hold does not have a type of scarcity and high demand it will only be a waste of time and money. If I have funds and must have an investment in NFT or in crypto then crypto is the more efficient to choose. You may own NFT by pegging a high price and selling it on Opensea then compare it to crypto listed on major exchanges. You can find faster selling speeds in crypto but in NFT it doesn't necessarily sell quickly.",

      "body": "From what I observed, NFTs related to collectibles is much risky to invest with. It needs hype and there's no big reason why should we collect those unless a big fan or just want to simply collect it. Even those NFT's related to popular personalities aren't that hype. I know there are NFT collectibles that got hyped before but it's only few.It's really risky to invest in NFT nowadays as it requires lots of factors to consider before placing a money with a specific NFT.My suggestion is not to stop being a NFT fan. Just continue to follow those you prefer and use your best skill in terms of DYOR before putting money. You should also looked for other worthy investments outside NFT instead.",

Maybe ask those people to add some narrative and see how NFT collectors would respond. It appears people buy the story behind more than the actual art that goes into these pictures. Take it from the guy who sold his selfies that were taken everyday for years.",

I think that you shall instead to think about what utilities shall be added into your NFTs rather than try to think that anyone willing to buy your NFTs. These days any NFTs that related with photography is not having any value. I think that it's better to stick into the NFTs that have intrinsic value. I think that if there are bunch of photography NFT in the opensea. It will be so difficult to sell it.",
