Do you think that they want the Nazism that the US has introduced and supported in the Ukraine?Russia's involvement in Nicaragua is nothing compared with what NATO and the US have done on the European side of the world. Not only that, but with the US trying to revive Hitler-ism/Nazism, who is right?Modern Russia is not the same Russia as the USSR. Force doesn't work. Free trade is what works, and that is what Russia has been doing these last two decades and longer. Now the US is using Ukraine and Nazism to attempt to destroy a threat that doesn't exist. Ukrainians don't like to see their land destroyed any more than anybody else. But the smart ones have moved to Russia (and elsewhere) until the US and its Nazism have been driven out of the Ukraine.",

We never hoped it would spread off to other nations should most not assist in terms of military power and other terms and with that haven't been done, we could still hope for the best. Bringing troops and war machines into Nicaragua is just wow! Although the story is yet to be verified but still, It could be possible that Russia is trying to do what the West was already planning to by trying to absorb Ukraine into NATO.Well U.S haven't violated nothing with Russia except for the economic war fair through sanctions and that's okay. They are world power and they must try to end the war by some means and making it impossible to finance the war is one means but it seems Putin was damned ready as all plans have proven abortive.Let's just hope it doesn't come to the worst and this could be just a face-off. It's really threatening though and having some defence line doesn't matter much!",

Perhaps their own current failures in Ukraine have led them to consider that maybe in aiming for perfection, they were over-reaching, and that they should bring back the puppet Trump because, although not perfect, he's 'good enough' from a Russian perspective.",
