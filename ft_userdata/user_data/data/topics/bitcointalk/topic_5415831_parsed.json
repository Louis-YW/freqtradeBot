It's more like generic \"fast transfer, small fee, etc.\" Then people call it hype until it become useless. Although based on CMC it just increased by 11%, not bad though but until when? Probably it will get dumped after.",

It's more like generic \"fast transfer, small fee, etc.\" Then people call it hype until it become useless. We're talking about LCC, right?  I'm having a hard time following what exactly it is that's going on because of all the links and links to other links OP posted, but LCC as an altcoin doesn't have anything unique about it except for that hive functionality that operates like a mining/PoS feature, I guess.  Its price is low, as are a lot of altcoins that have a supply of hundreds of millions to billions, but like the rest of them they'd be useful if merchants would take them as payment.I've seen that \"unnamed exchange\" place pop up a lot whenever I'm browsing new cpu-mineable coins just for fun.  That scam accusation from examplens is well over a year old, and it looks as though the exchange is still in business.  Anyway, none of that has to do with OP's problem, which I'm still not comprehending 100%.  It sounds like he's been locked out of the LCC discord....?OP, could you give a TL;DR to a feeble-brained member like myself (who's probably not drunk enough coffee as well)?  I'm curious, because LCC is one of the small number of altcoins I'm interested in.",

Judging by previous OP's references, he talking about LNC, initially a Litecoin Cash fork. For example his post in the ANN thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5117428.msg60886276#msg60886276 where he puts a link to Coingecko listing also only trading pair LNC/UTIP on scam unanmed.exchange.Also, this is useful information for you in this case:Quote from: LighningCashDev on August 20, 2022, 06:26:39 PMQuote : \"Starting blockchain height -----> will be the same as Litecoin Cash when LightningCash will be launched and LCC holders will get LTNCs\"^^^ At first, LightningCash was supposed to be a Litecoin Cash fork. I was just starting to play with the bitcoin source code back then. I asked Tanner from LitecoinCash's team to help me ( Lead Dev ) , and he did.[/size]The original and official ANN, on March 6th 2019 ( LightningCash - CPU only - Fastest bitcoin based cryptocurrency ) : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5117428I decided to create a new genesis block, so no LCC, or LTC holders could claim...To the OPI always like to see a developer develop their idea, but from what I've seen, this whole thing the OP is talking about is a complete fiasco. an obvious example of why most altcoins are called shitcoins.It happens that you lose control over your accounts. I am talking about your case from (or before)  04 February 2021 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5268916.msg56423001#msg56423001are you sure you have enough capacity for a project like the one you envisioned? only knowledge of coding is not enough for that.",

I figured there probably was, but I did initially grasp the part you explained--I think I got sidetracked in my brain thereafter.  T'was too early in the morning for me to be critically reading and posting on the forum.
