Real world games and routines?I don't see when the season will be but it's a principle I've ever known that charts and market prices will return to the past even though the time is not known.At least I'm not too worried because this is a natural occurrence about a common theory in cryptocurrencies.

The market is going down but I don't think that this is going to be ever reached again. People have started to call the lowest during the last bear market and $3k they say is possible again. But going from $500 to $1k, I don't really think we'll be back there and even $3k.

In your post you don't seem to detail too much as to why you believe we're headed back to <1k$.The shock you're seeing right now is because of panic selling. My guess, (as worthless and speculative as anyone else's) is we're doing to see ~15k and then some stabilization. There was a correction that was to be expected with the global economy on the downward trend, but anything you're seeing now is just hysteria driven panic selling.

Don't go dumping if you have BTC but instead look on the bright side, isn't it amazing you can buy cheap BTC now compare to it when it was staying at the ATH price?I find it amusing and entertaining everytime there are people who complained about the market situation when it's in bearish season.

Had a good chuckle when reading that.Regarding his response why pay $18K for a Bitcoin when you can buy a car? Most people buy equal amounts of stocks. What do they get out of that? Pretty much nothing.Only reason they buy it, is to sell to someone else at a higher price. A car is a depreciating asset.",
