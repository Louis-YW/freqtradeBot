Such effect could like happened to bitcoin and the price might dip more or surge more.Because the price went against your production? Some people will have different prediction. I posted this some hours ago:Quote from: Oshosondy on August 17, 2023, 04:29:05 PMI hope people can see now that $30000 is becoming the resistant price. Bitcoin dropped below $28000 today which is indicating bearish market. Let us see what would happen, but I am still bearish until bitcoin got below $26500.I may be wrong, but this is my guess for now. Now this is it:After several weeks that bitcoin was unable to go beyond $30000, you supposed to know that bitcoin price may dip. I was expecting the market to have gone like this when bitcoin decreased below $28500 the last time, but it increase back to $30000. When I saw it at $29400 again, that this will happen is very possible and it happened. Quote from: SmartGold01 on August 17, 2023, 10:14:08 PMWhat is possibly to happen in the market, more dip that's seeing below 20k or something similar?And is this another sign for bear market?I do not know. This second half supposed to favour bitcoin is what I think. Sometimes if bitcoin wants to increase, it can begin like this. But I do not know the direction it is going to right now. We have to watch the market for few days before we can determine where it may go.",

The pressure appears external to that extent but speculation has raised us and can bring us down if people are forced to close positions to gain dollars and repay their leverage, thats why leverage hurts and creates volatility its not as solid as it appears.   So we have to find hard ground now.  Low is the yearly average I note and perhaps of wider significance is this now challenges the 200 week average area and how we hold or handle that long term momentum is what really matters for the rest of the year.",

I have always thought that Elon's companies have already sold all of the bitcoins held in their treasury on 2021 - 2022.In any case, it appears that Tesla has 10,725 bitcoins left in their balance sheet according to some articles, the speculation should presently be if Elon will give the command to sell them also. This will be head shaking because clown Elon declared bitcoin a long term investment on 2021 and he said that Tesla will accept it as payment.",

A decrease in the price of Bitcoin can always have an effect on all altcoins, including even the most popular altcoins, and this has become a very common sight in the market because in the past this was the case. And if their post says there will be a price spike in the next 72 hours, that means everyone should take advantage of this dip by buying what they can before the intended increase occurs.QuoteBut to my surprise seeing that bitcoin already gone below the predicted price, although I can't still argue the fact that price can be manipulative and something positive could hit the market and, instantaneously changes direction just as it did happen now. Such effect could like happened to bitcoin and the price might dip more or surge more.That could be true, although it could also be the other way around because the spike effect would be most noticeable when the majority of people take advantage of the current conditions to buy Bitcoin. Moreover, the price is still very close to $25K which is the most unpredictable price level this month for Bitcoin and I am more than sure that the price range seen in the current market will not last that long in Bitcoin this month.QuoteWhat is possibly to happen in the market, more dip that's seeing below 20k or something similar?And is this another sign for bear market?This does look like a sign of the next bear market, but I think more optimistic that this can also be a kick-off for Bitcoin to make a jump as their post says and I also believe more in what you said above because I think it is also more logical for the current state of Bitcoin.",

It's all just perfect manipulation and the news is just an excuse to legitimize dumping. With bitcoin down more than 10% and the altcoin market being severely dumped creating a certain amount of panic, people are getting scared and I think it's time to buy. When people are afraid, we should be greedy.",

This will be a temporary thing because no one can manipulate bitcoin price for long. At as when OP wrote this thread bitcoin was 25k+ but presently it has gone to 26k+ which shows that we will have a pump in the price soon. I was expecting the dump in price but not as dip to the extend since bitcoin has been sitting on 29k+ for the past three months. A dump is needed to have a pump and I believe that soon there will be a good news on bitcoin that will pump the price. This is an opportunity for us to stash up more bitcoin to our portfolios for the next bulk run.",

And it seems that the panic has subside though. It has settle down a bit and I think it can go back to $28k at the end of the month and there will be no more drops.",
