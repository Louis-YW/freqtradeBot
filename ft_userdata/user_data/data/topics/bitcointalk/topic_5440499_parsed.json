  "content": "This is really cool by me even though am not yet a father by marriage. This child is super brilliant in my school where I teach, though his stories is pathetic, he was given birth as premature and his mother die during delivery. For good two and half years he could not talk, he has speech impediment. But after a while he begins to talk little by little as God intervene. His father ran away from the town after impregnated the girl, remorse has it that he die trying to cross border with his friends through smuggling, so his history has be difficult to traced. The child was later sent to his grandma to stay with, grandma suggested he to street hacking of pure water, cashews nuts and broom for his education.When I received all this stories, I begins to monitors the child welfare, buy some books and change his uniform. I notice is one of the most brilliant pupils in class, his performance are super adorable and he always came out the best.So I went to the grandma, to discussed with her on the child welfare the grandma says he has no future for the child because herself can not carter for him, and his mother do not listen her as a young girl, that the boy's mother disobey her as only child, so she cannot do anything at this her old age.I decided to offer to take the responsibility, though it might not look easier as I think but is worth it, this child is better than being a waste. Our community chief has given concept for me to take over the responsibility and take the child to stay with me, and God has being faithful, I pray I see this child through his destinyhttps://i.ibb.co/W6SXf0T/1676748645763.jpg",
