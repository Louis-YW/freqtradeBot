  "content": "When FIFA world cup gets started, you will see flags of Brazil and Argentina everywhere in Bangladesh. In urban area, almost all the roof will be full of flags of favorite team while in the rural areas, it's a bit low but still the chaos is everywhere. Most people buy jersey of their favorite team. Everyone watches the matches with their friends, social media is full of Brazil vs Argentina chaos. In fact, the main topic of the country is World Cup and Brazil/Argentina.I personally love Football the most but I don't like all these chaos other than cheering for my supporting country.I would appreciate if you shared how your country take the FIFA world cup, how much excitement is there. It would be better if you attached your country name.",

      "body": "I think the way people enjoy football and fan support has evolved over the years. Right from when I was a kid, the issue of popularity between Brazil and Argentina was a hot topic for fans the world over especially when we had Pele and Diego Maradona to always keep us excited.Â In Africa, there's no point in supporting other countries when your country has qualified, but it doesn't stop us from commenting or appreciating the likes of Messi, Ronaldo or even Neymar Jr.",
