  "content": "Every crypto development team accept bitcoin needs to implement a form of interest free, zero reward staking to stabilize the liquidity of all coins accept bitcoin.  All wallets other than bitcoin need to have a function within the wallet to “freeze” an assigned amount of coins. The function is initiated by holder of the coin. The time period should be for either 30,60,90 days. Longer time periods could do very weird things to the market but 30-90 days will greatly reduce risk and provide great value to price of coins. the user just selects how long and amount of coins and the wallet simply releases the coins back after given time period. so each wallet would have liquid and frozen coins like take 90% of your coins and lock them up for 90 days to show the world your not selling them.There needs to be new category on coin market cap showing amount of frozen coins with the standard being how many coins are frozen for at least 60 days. This statistic would be listed right next to circulating supply, max supply, volume, etc.The lack of interest payments for staking removes all the tax nonsense, removes all regulation, and other headaches with implementing defi and staking. There is no financial product provided you are just allowing the users to temporarily freeze the coins to increase stability of the market and put a quantified value on hodl'er %. The reward is increase in price of asset.THIS GIVES A NUMERICAL NUMBER VALUE THAT REPRESENTS HODLER% THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE.The stat could even be called  “hodl’er %” or \"frozen coins\"Each coins website would display the 30 60 and 90 day frozen coins. This would effectively rank the coins by risk. its essentially a certificate of deposit that pays no interest.Just build something within the wallet that freezes the coins then releases them after 30,60 or 90 days. send the data back to be collected and tabulate how many coins are frozen. This solves tons of issues. so in the wallet you would have liquid coins and frozen coins.I just read the white paper a couple weeks ago and did the whole who is Satoshi 3 day binge (peter todd is my official guess the \"to be specific\" post right after Satoshi is just not how you talk unless you posted the post above)This idea about locking up the coins to lower risk was screaming at me the whole time from the very beginning. You need the crypto to be way less liquid or at least show the hodler %. ALL THIS HODL'ING WITH NO REPRESENTATION OR VISUAL STAT TO CONNECT IT IS CRAZY. why doesnt this exist??? Am I THE crazy ONE?i know theres no current way of doing this it would need to be developed this is a new idea. would easily skyrocket all coins if there locked up for periods of time all initiated by the user. if it cant be done within the wallet the coins could be sent to address that simply return them after 30 days time. many angles and ways to do it. think outside the box people.",

It's bad for privacy and it's unsustainable too.If other people want to invest in Bitcoin, they must do research about fundamentals of Bitcoin, and have belief in Bitcoin future, so that they spend money to invest in Bitcoin. They don't need to rely on me, my signed message, whatever like your proposal, to believe that Bitcoin price will grow up more with time.Holding is not only factor that contributes to price growth. You can see many altcoins with many altcoin holders, but their prices fall with time like 99% fall from ATH or previous market cycle or even died.",

Massive abudant supplies, and very limited supplies but massive abundant or fake shortage supply, it does't contribute to altcoin value.Value must come from its utility, use case, security of its blockchain, safety of user fund in transaction on altcoin blockchain. Altcoin blockchains fail to provide it to users and values are low consequently and unavoidably.With altcoins that have abundant supplies, they try to cook their users by buy back and burn programs.
