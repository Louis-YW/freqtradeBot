Your TX dropped by most node (after 14 days or purged due to many TX with higher fee rate), which is equal with never sending your BTC in first place.I've seen a third option: the node force closed the channel, which forced a CPFP at much higher fee back into my own wallet.@OP: If you have change from the transaction that opened the channel, you can do CPFP yourself. Send the change to one of your own addresses with a higher fee.",
