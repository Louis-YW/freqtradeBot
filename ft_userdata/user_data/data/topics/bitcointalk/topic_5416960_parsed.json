But don't expect too much further think of other solutions or some plan B to get out of this trouble where you might gonna get some charges based on your crypto activities.",

AFAIK, they have an exchange and most exchanges have minimum amount to sell/buy. 1 XLM is just worth $0.11. Do you think that it will be allowed easily by that platform?I don't think so because you lack from the probable minimum amount of exchanging that they have. The best that you can is not to think about it anymore and forget them with your account.",

I always use wallets whose private keys you can control. To be able to close the account, you should move out the XLM to another address, which I think is possible.",

Delete a history of your wallet with past transactions which are recorded on a public ledger?You should know it is how blockchain works. Data is recorded publicly, stored decentralized, and can not be erased by anyone. When it was confirmed, it will exist on the network globally.QuoteI have to close it for fiscal reasons and I can have a very negative impact due to Blockchain behavior.With blockchain, if you don't want to reveal any data about your IP, your balance, your wallet address, don't use it at beginning. Especially don't use custodial wallet like Blockchain.com wallet.QuoteI have a wallet with 1 Stellar XLM and Blockchain doesn't allow me neither to sell it, to send it nor to close the wallet.When you use a centralized service, you must check their minimum amount for deposit, withdrawal as well as trading. If you deposit an amount that is smaller than the minimum, it will not be displayed in your account and on many exchanges, they emphasize that you will lose it. Exchanges have to consolidate small inputs from users and use it to proceed withdrawal request of users later.And you won't be able to trade if it is smaller than the minimum for trading.Some articles for you:- Does Blockchain.com charge fees for depositing and withdrawing crypto? . Min withdrawal for XLM is 10 XLM.",

Within the Stellar system, there is an Account merge operation which could do the job, you can learn more at https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/list-of-operations#account-merge.
