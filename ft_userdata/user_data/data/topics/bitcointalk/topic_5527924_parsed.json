You’ll keep making the same mistake if you don’t start investing now. Since you’re new, I’d suggest keeping it simple, and that is invest in Bitcoin’s future by holding it. Also, it’s also crucial to educate yourself more about Bitcoin, so you won’t panic whenever the price dumps.From what I see, it seems like you’re experiencing FOMO since you decided to invest when the market is bullish. So I guess take your time, learn more, and don’t let emotions drive your decisions.",

QuoteI want price of Bitcoin to reduce so i can start my investment, anyone knows when the price of Bitcoin will fall so i can begin.  You might never have the opportunity to buy if you are waiting because the price may never get too low as to where you want it to get.

You are not late; no time is too late. You missed out on the chance when you could have purchased Bitcoin at a low price; now you have the time to correct your wrong before you will also consider today to be another late time.

It really depends on what you mean by knowledge, but for someone who wants to invest only, I would advise that you know what you are investing in. You have to know what Bitcoin truly is(Not talking about the technical part though). You have to understand that, the price goes up and down, but a long term plan will definitely benefit you. You also have to know how to make a purchase (i.e how to buy from an exchange), and you also have to identify and choose the best method to keep your investment. You wouldn't want your investment to go missing along the line due to wrong choice of storing your investment.QuoteI want price of Bitcoin to reduce so i can start my investment, anyone knows when the price of Bitcoin will fall so i can begin. From what I know, there is no general alarm or memo that is been passed around that the price of Bitcoin will dump today, or will pump tomorrow, though there can be some speculations based on activity that we all think might affect the price. But, you can not always depend on speculations though. So, let me just make it simple, no one knows specifically when the price of Bitcoin will fall.QuoteI did not take my opportunity when i was introduced to Bitcoin and this forum, what should be done to correct my mistakes or am i late? For Bitcoin, get something doing that can give you enough income to set out your Bitcoin investment funds. It's only never too late if you hit the ground running and accumulate some good fractions before your retirement or whatever time that pleases you, but remember that long term plans benefits more.And as for the forum, it's never too late as well to maybe learn or acquire the basic knowledge that you seek in starting your accumulation. You can ask further questions in the beginners board if you find anything confusing, or also read through this thread as a similar question has been asked before  Is buying Bitcoin too late?.",

Bitcoin is a high risk investment still and what you should learn is the proper rules of investment and safety for personal finance. If you can't afford the risk of the value of your investment being reduced for even perhaps an expected period of time then maybe you should invest little to nothing on Bitcoin. Many people don't consider the risk but it's actually one of the most important factors.",

If you really want to invest in bitcoin, you don’t have to wait till the price of bitcoin reduces before you invest; just learn the connect and know the risk and other things that are necessary, and you are good to go because nobody knows when the price will reduce; it can be anytime, and it can rise past your expectation at times, so to me, don’t mind the current price. If you have the money, just invest in bitcoin. If you failed to invest at a time in which you had to invest, you may use the money to do another thing because you can’t keep money, so you would rather buy and rest.",

Basically, investing in Bitcoin does not require much knowledge, but here it requires experience to make the right investment.Because here only knowledge will not allow you to psychologically balance with the real market. But if you can balance your psychological state with the market with knowledge about Bitcoin's previous history and some technical issues, then I would say you can be successful this is really exceptional.Now if I talk about the general mistakes what newbies do here, \"most of them invest when bitcoin price was in high I mean in this time when market greed level is on high, And this is the common mistake you can do\" But the investment time is on bear season which also follow a cycle like bull season, you can find the gap on the chart analysis.Btw, suggestion to you if you want to make investment for long-term then you can took also DCA scheme on your plan which is best for risk management",

You're the only one that can answer that question.If you feel that you have the basic information needed already then you can start investing. Just take note that the chances of you losing your money is higher since you're a newbie. You'll learn more from the experience that you will get.Quote from: Audrey Simmons on January 27, 2025, 09:04:25 PMI want price of Bitcoin to reduce so i can start my investment, anyone knows when the price of Bitcoin will fall so i can begin. You can't just ask that because also don't know when the price of Bitcoin will go down. I should say learn more first then build your own strategy. Save up some money so that when the bear market comes (search what bear market is), you will have money to use to buy Bitcoin at a much lower price.  We all want the price of Bitcoin to go down as well, but as of now, most want it to go up so they can maximize their profit.

There's no early or late in investing. Both have pros and cons. As for the mistakes, it's pretty normal since you're new. Opportunities come way faster than that of other asset classes, so if you missed one, don't dwell about it and focus on getting others in the future. I'm sure there will be new opportunities coming. Just be patient for it and speaking of patience, that's the one thing that you must have if you want to invest into crypto.",

You can't bring back time, and many of us here might be thinking that we are also late. However, it's better to jump in right now even if we are in the bull market. At least you will gain a lot of experience, learn how to invest or what strategy you want to used, i.e. DCA method.",

DCA (Dollar Cost Average)It's simple and not complicated  all you just have to do is pick an amount you can afford to invest in a specific interval( depends on you), you must be willing to  do it consistently  and hold for a very long period (this is very important) . The purpose is just to spread your entries and could worth it than just waiting to buy when the price falls . No one can assure you the price will fall but if it does you have  opportunity to buy low as well and if it doesn't,   you already have an additional advantage and you'v yourself for the up  .

If you truly want the price of Bitcoin to be reduced before investing, that means you are not ready to invest in Bitcoin at the moment. You have to wait much longer, towards the bearish market before you think of investing in Bitcoin.The reason for waiting for Bitcoin to be reduced in price before investing, and Bitcoin is too expensive to invest in, is mainly the reason so many individuals miss their opportunities to invest in Bitcoin. I want to be aware of that, to know which road to follow. Because it's like many newbies have that mentality that Bitcoin is far from their reach, not knowing that one who has a long term investment plan on Bitcoin stands a chance to have a return of investment(profits) in the future",

I did not take my opportunity when i was introduced to Bitcoin and this forum, what should be done to correct my mistakes or am i late? As a newbie that want to invest in Bitcoin the first thing is to know  the methods in which you can aquire Bitcoin and correlate it to the actual fund you want to invest and the best method that will enable you to invest with the actual amount of money you wish to invest in bitcoin. For instance you should know if the money will be able to buy Bitcoin in lump sum or DCA.The way Bitcoin is going now I think the best thing to do when you have a limited fund is to invest by DCA because you cannot actually get the exact prediction of when Bitcoin price will drop to the bearest minimum that you are targeting before you will invest. You are not late, you can still correct your mistake now by starting to invest by DCA with that fund in your hand because Bitcoin is embedded with unlimited potential that can give you great profit in the future if you plan to hold it as a long-term investment",
