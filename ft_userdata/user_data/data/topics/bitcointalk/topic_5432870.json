Is it a ban? Not really, but what's reality when people believe everything that's on TV?* They can ban mining and say it's done.** Of course, while most businesses will leave to mine elsewhere, some may use VPN and such and still mine it.* Stopping all the bitcoin related traffic on the internet... I don't think it can happen without completely shutting off internet* Getting all countries agree to act together ... I will not live long enough to see that happen.

My country also ban bitcoin, they prohibit its adoption as a means of payment/currency but we are legalized to trade it. Full ban are becoming rare for bitcoin, that's because governments are still thinking about profit from it. Yes of course about taxes they can make a lot of money on crypto taxes instead of banning bitcoin or crypto completely.I think it's hard to expect all the world's governments to come together to agree on total ban on bitcoin (unless bitcoin and crypto become a real disaster for everyone and every country) which is hard to imagine being real. The government might be able to impose stricter rules on big mining companies, but of course it's difficult to stop mining. There will always be miners as long as they make profit even if the government tightens the rules.",

In my opinion, they can’t in totality ban bitcoin. But they could make it illegal therefore dissuading the minds of people and making it harder for people to use bitcoin. We don’t need global help to ban bitcoin. There are a whole lot of global problems that could do with some global attention and help right now and bitcoin is nowhere near one of them.Thankfully, there are some countries that are crypto friendly",

However, there's nothing much that happened after a while as the market reshaped after a slope and picked from then after the Chinese ban that saw many exchanges leave China, including Binance. Today, whenever I hear a country is trying to ban Bitcoin I ask what is there for them to achieve other than noise. For all I care, India can go ahead and flex its muscles. Nothing much will come out of its noise.",
