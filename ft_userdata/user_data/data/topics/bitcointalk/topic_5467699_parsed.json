The only prove that can be used to know who Satoshi really is if he reveals himself to the public.When he has not reveal himself, see anyone that are involved in the progress of bitcoin as Satoshi.Not everyone wants to have their identity laid bare before the world. Especially people whos face would be known by everyone in the world. Fame is a lot of anxiety for some people, while for others its a dream come true. Take Grigori Perelman for example, a genius mathematician who changed the world forever by solving one of the 7 millennium problems. He would rather stay away from cameras, paparazzi and interviewers. Or the guy who invented Flappy Bird. He could have become very rich and famous but decided that he did not want that.Those kinds of actions might seem completely insane and out of touch with reality to us, but such people exist.I see no need to create conspiracy theories about Satoshi Nakamoto.",

If they created it, then why would they do everything possible to bring it under control?Quote from: https://theintercept.com/2018/03/20/the-nsa-worked-to-track-down-bitcoin-users-snowden-documents-reveal/It turns out the conspiracy theorists were onto something. Classified documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden show that the National Security Agency indeed worked urgently to target bitcoin users around the world — and wielded at least one mysterious source of information to “help track down senders and receivers of Bitcoins,” according to a top-secret passage in an internal NSA report dating to March 2013. The data source appears to have leveraged the NSA’s ability to harvest and analyze raw, global internet traffic while also exploiting an unnamed software program that purported to offer anonymity to users, according to other documents.Quote from: dzungmobile on September 22, 2023, 10:24:21 AM~snip~Or NSA and CIA have no cooperations in the same nation, USA?Of course they cooperate, but they are still two different agencies that have their own working methods and areas in which they are active, and it's not like they really interfere in each other's work if it's not absolutely necessary. In addition, the agency we are talking about is still much more secretive and deals with some things that are much more shrouded in secrecy than other agencies. That's why it earned the nickname \"no such agency\".",

Just wait for someone or entities that can show a strong proof that can expose the real identity of the Bitcoin creator.

In which the former NSA cryptanalyst Jeff Man, said \"QuoteMan concluded that even if they did, it is likely we’ll never find out the real story behind the world’s most popular digital asset until it doesn’t matter anymore.\".Means, now, we know that, Satoshi is the real founder because he is registered here on BTT and also have a lot of BTC in his possession. Which makes him the only founder of btc. Did NSA have any founder registered on this forum? No, they don't which indicates that, they are just after the btc technology and wanted a way in to make it centralized and to make it a property of USA. Which is not good. Overall, now things are not in their hands and I am happy for that and according to the stories in news you have shared they are making this sha256 encrypted techniques for encryption of messages of attacks. If I did not interpret them wrong. Means, they were not trying to make btc or some coin even the content of the mint white paper mentioned in the article does not says much about btc.",

The concept or vision of a decentralized currency might not be the idea of Satoshi but it was him that implemented the idea and came up with something unique. This theory has some claims that look valid but they can also be a coincidence. The names Tatsuaki Okamoto and Satoshi Nakamoto might just happen by chance. Some of the proponents of this conspiracy theory such as Nic Carter and  NSA cryptanalyst Jeff Man might just be attention seekers. It is Satoshi Nakamoto who created Bitcoin until these Faketoshi prove otherwise.",

One thing they have acknowledged is that they cannot control the BTC blockchain, but now they also realise that they should not ignore this opportunity while they can fill their pockets with a huge amount of money. If you still do not understand, then allow me to explain it more.They are dealing with the ETFs because they want to use them as fuel so that they will accept them at the end of the halving or when the bullish cycle starts. By doing that, the market will take a boom and BTC will go beyond its limits.They cannot control the blockchain because the validators and the authenticators are scattered all over the world, and they cannot overtake the whole blockchain. Even if they ban the use of BTC or blockchain in some single country, the blockchain will still keep going. They cannot make others join their club so that they can make it centralized by controlling it using others. Because other validators will not join them.",
