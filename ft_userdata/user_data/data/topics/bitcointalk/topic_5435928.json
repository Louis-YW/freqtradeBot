I'm not aware of any good news about Bitcoin, but the price seems moved so strongly, breaking its previous resistance.  It could be because the next year halving, but it seems too early. If the trend continues, Bitcoin price will break ATH later this year so it does not make sense IMO.

If it is manipulation, it will not last long. However, the current crash was caused by bad news. Although there was no good news, Bitcoin experienced significant movement at the start of the new year. But we are unlucky and begin dumping.",

Half of that seems to be recovered, still...What's going to happen next is hard to tell. Clearly after big pumps some cooldown (even slight drop) periods can easily follow. Even more, we're basically still in the price range of the bear market, hence it's not that clear it's over yet. On the other hand there are voices calling that 25k is at hand and the first cooldown will be only afterwards.So, as I said: hard to tell.",

That doesn't seem to me like news that would affect bitcoin price that much. I think its more about small correction after bitcoin price going up 25% in the last 2 weeks that everyone expected. Regarding whether this is a start of bull season, I don't think that we are out of the woods yet, and its too early to tell anyway. If we keep these levels for some time then we can be more optimistic but I wouldn't celebrate just yet.",

Because we have faced this situation many times during the bearish season, I think the market still has a big chance to back in 16k/17k  again or below it. Yes, it is true that according to many market analysis Bitcoin is likely to return to its bull-market in the halving of 2024. But I think until our Q1,Q2,Q3 of 2023 I don't think the market will give any such signal. But for its starting, I think we have to wait from the very end of 2023 to the end of the first q1 of 2024.",

It's just that someone assumed earlier this year that the magic started when the price increased surprisingly and people thought this would be a bullish start, but this is just a cycle.indeed, if it happens that the bitcoin price reaches ATH at the end of this year, this is really unreasonable, while bitcoin's track record will start to increase and continue to rise in price after the halving every 4 years.for the next price drop it will surely happen after a lot of bad news has come out about bitcoin and it will surely touch below $19k price.but for me the bad news won't apply and it won't matter if the bullish time comes, but I don't know when.",

So for now, it would be better to be careful of being caught by it. Investing would be a good idea and so is waiting for a more clear trend line. The actual increase, I believe, is more anticipated next year but that is not to exclude this year. The only point is to not hope that much just because the market was from a bad situation and it is just now wherein it is having signs of recovery. Would be a long way to go I guess before this market fully recover. But ofcourse if it would as this early, then that would be better.",

I'm not aware of any good news about Bitcoin, but the price seems moved so strongly, breaking its previous resistance. There is no good news specifically for Bitcoin at this time, as well as recent bad news that also does not exist for Bitcoin so that Bitcoin is still able to maintain a price level that is much better than last year's decline. Even though currently the price of Bitcoin has also started to be under $ 21K again, I still think that the next increase can still occur in the near future for Bitcoin. Because in general there's been some good news coming out for the crypto space at the moment and it could definitely be a good leverage for Bitcoin right now.QuoteIt could be because the next year halving, but it seems too early.

I also don't think for ATH at the end of the year on Bitcoin, but it's not unreasonable that Bitcoin could be at a price level very close to ATH at the end of the year if the price increases outweigh the falls. Because the price resistance of Bitcoin this year will probably be so different from last year that I don't think Bitcoin will be at $19K or $17K anytime soon.",
