Do you mean the .dat files from Core wallet?Assuming that the application is clean and that you are not seeking suspicious targets through it, who do you think would need it if he could ever use the core wallet and extract all addresses and see all transaction history?I do not trust your intentions of issuing this application, and I suspect that it is malicious, but I am not a specialist in codes, and I cannot prove this technically.I do not advise anyone to use any program to deal with any of the confidential data of Bitcoin savings, including the wallet, seed words, and any files that allow dealing with these savings. Please stay away from those online scammers!",

      "body": "Just who the fu*k is this? Just because you want to remain active you talk bullshit and rubbish. I'm talking about a small program that can be run offline and what i just did in the code was to look for strings in the .dat file because there are lots of people claiming to have .dat files that they sell online and some ignorant people do buy them but little did they know that they are buying a file that has been tempered/altered. Most scam actors do put their emails there and how i came up with this idea was when some lady told me she has some files with btc but have forgotten her password. instead of downloading the blockchain network that may take months before getting the transactions and balance right and then trying out the passwords you can use the program to just search out for strings As simple as that. so don't come here to say what yo don't know. i think the moderator should check out for people like you who knows nothing but to bad mouth other people good deeds.",
