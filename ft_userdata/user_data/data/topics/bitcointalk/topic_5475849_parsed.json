      "body": "Well, it will depend on the trader. For me, I don't use stop loss on every trade that I make. Because I have a separate account for my live trade, meaning I will put some amount or capital in my trading account, the account came from my storage trading account, as I called it. In short, I have two different accounts used for trading: one is for storing my capital to be used in trading, and the other is the one I used to execute the trade. The set-up is that I will put some amount in my trading account, say $100 worth of bitcoin or BTC/USDT pairs, and from that, only the $100 worth of my money will be going into the trade, so even if I don't stop the loss, if the equity reaches zero, only the $100 worth of my asset will be lost. That's how I manage my trade. I also don't use stop-loss often because, of course, there is a downtrade, so I want to see if my trade will be really wrong or not. In summary, it depends on the trader as to how he will trade, whether he will use stop loss, take profit, etc. If your strategy works for you, then it's good, as we trade on our own accord.",

But if you are a good trader and does not use  leverage in trading, then setting a stop-loss does not make sense. It only limits your potentials and capabilities to trade, that is not good at all in the long run since trading is all about enhancing your skills and working strategies.This is the reason why I don't trade and use stop-loss. Although that may be good for novice traders to avoid losing a lot in trading, but let's just accept the reality that as traders, we need to combat those losses in order to end with successful trades and that will only happen if we pursue trading despite the fact that we can lose a lot from it.",

I don't see why you would avoid SL altogether even if you're confident with the coin that you trade, since that confidence can't give you future insight to begin with. It is a also bit unwise to think that by conquering fear you mean not using any risk management tool available for you.

I was also against Stop loss and never used before 2021. If you remember BTC crash due to china fud , I was holding many coins that time and suddenly BTC dump from 43k to straight 30k and you can imagine what would be happened with altcoins. My portfolio had fallen very low that time and then I felt the need of stop loss.Stoploss is one feature and it's positive or negative impact depends upon the trader strategy. If we 100% sure about about any token and also if token dump then we could hold it (we have extra fund to trade other comfortably) then no need to use stop loss. Traders usually trading in volatile coins and this why stop loss is necessary.",

One thing I noticed about using stop loss is that if I put a stop loss at 10 dollars from the target price, maybe after the 10 dollar loss, my coins will be out of trade. The problem here is that after falling a bit below $10 the market goes back up and then we have nothing to do. Because our coin was already trading at a loss of $10, if we had been patient with some risk at that point without using a stop loss, the market would have gone up again and we could have reversed the loss. It's mainly because of this that I don't use stop loss now and it's probably a good decision for me.",

Those folks who have spent time figuring out how the market moves and how to play their cards right. They know when to jump into a trade or bail out, so they'd know when it makes sense to use stop loss.If you're new to trading I don't think that the stop loss is a good option. To use it effectively, you need to have a solid understanding of how the market works. If you're still getting the hang of things, using stop loss might end up doing more harm than good.

Now, I see the reason why you are not too comfortable with using stop loss. Stop loss is just to help you manage your risk and nothing more. I personally will make use of it to minimize my risk because I can not just watch by while my balance liquidate if things goes wrong. It has less effect if you mainly trade bitcoin because you can not compare bitcoin trading to other coins in terms of volatility. The shitcoins have caused you huge losses but I can confidently say they also made you some profits before you decide not trade on them again. In fact, shitcoins are the best to trade with if you aim to make quick profit and also ready for the otherwise of it. Bitcoin offer less risk with lesser profit, each has its price and you can either take less risk to earn less or take higher risk to earn high.",

In my opinion, it's quite the opposite. Let me explain. The more you practice something, the better you get at it. Playing guitar for example. You put all your finger on the strings after you see it. Even after seeing the strings, you may miss 1 or 2. But as you practice more, you create a muscle memory. This helps you to play the guitar without even looking at the guitar itself. You can even play it in your head without the guitar itself. We can say the same this with trading and SL. As a beginner, if you keep practising this, when you become good at it, you won't need to put SL anymore. Because you can just create a calculation in your head and open trade based on that. Also, using SL helps a lot in emotion control. As we all know, emotion control is a major thing when it comes to trading.",

Besides, this strategy never helps us to earn a profit but just helps us not to lose too much and still save some.
