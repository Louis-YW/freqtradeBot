  "content": "I was really pissed what youtube has turned into lately so I was trying to find alternatives for every day use and watching videos.Best option I found so far for desktop computers (Linux, Mac, wind0ws) is youtube client called FreeTube.Interesting thing that FreeTube is totally free, open source community made app, that respects privacy and accepts Bitcoin donations (so far they accepted 0.06738718 BTC)!What advantages I noticed compared to using Youtube in browser?- No Ads, and no adblockers.- It works much faster and it takes less resources, so it's great for low spec devices, raspberry pi, old computers, etc.- Subscriptions can be made without account, for following channels and new videos, live shows, shorts.- Open source and Private.- Bitcoin donations accepted.FreeTube Githhub page:https://github.com/FreeTubeAppIf you like FreeTube consider supporting developers with Liberapay or Bitcoin donations:QuoteIf you like FreeTube, consider supporting the project by donating to one of the following Cryptocurrency addresses:BTC: 1Lih7Ho5gnxb1CwPD4o59ss78pwo2T91eS https://freetubeapp.io/",

FreeTube seems like an excellent choice for those who value privacy and want to support an open-source project. The list of impressive advantages you've mentioned, such as no ads, faster performance, and resource efficiency, clearly demonstrates why it's a compelling alternative to the standard YouTube experience.I hope there will be a version for Android mobile as well.I'm going to try it out for myself and see how it works. I'm always searching for new and better ways to use the internet, and I believe it has the potential to be a valuable addition to my workflow.It's impressive that there's an option to subscribe to channels without an account. I'm currently using and testing this.Windows x64Thank you for sharing this valuable information with the community!",

      "body": "Edit.  I initially thought this was a completely separate platform like Bitchute is and then realized I was wrong.  Privacy focused YouTube front end alternatives are a perfect way of splitting the audience into preferences.  The YouTube app is definitely more user friendly and has minimum bugs but offers zero Privacy.  Alternative front ends can offer a way for viewers like me to watch their favorite content while not sacrificing their beliefs.I believe it is important to suggest not only to donate to such alternatives but also to donate to your favorite viewers if you can.  After all.  Although annoying, a lot of them earn through Ads on YouTube.  No ads means less revenue for them.There are finally other platforms rising above what used to be the standard.  YouTube for uploads.  Twitch for streams.  There is a need for change and I hope we are in the middle of one.However.  Unfortunately the one to rise above them will most likely NOT be an alternative free of ads and focusing on avoiding censorship and current standards.  There are a lot of alternatives and most of them accept Cryptocurrency donations.  But most of these alternatives died due to lack of interest from the people.Let us face reality.  The bigger portion of the world will continue to use platforms similar to YouTube even if Google drops into a pit.  I want to see the day FreeTube and such alternatives rise above every thing else.  But I doubt I will.",

Correct me if I'm wrong.You are absolutely right, the idea is great but I do not think it will pull most creators to that platform as they can not benefit from the platform. I do really think, they should adjust their working mechanism to enable subscribing to YouTube with bitcoins. This system of monetization will bring in content creators who will also be paid in bitcoins. This will increase Bitcoin users across the world",
