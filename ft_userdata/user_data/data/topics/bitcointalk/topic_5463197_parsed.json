  "content": "Sorry if the topic title is sort of \"Gloom and Doom\", but it's a genuine question. I came across this write up about BlackRock when I was randomly browsing the internet on topics about the history of different VCs and asset managers,QuoteMeet BlackRock, the company that owns the world and the “fourth branch of government” with $9 trillion in assets under managementBlackRock made headlines last month after the company spent $6 billion to buy single-family homes and turn them into rental properties, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. In most cases, BlackRock even paid more money above the sellers’ asking price, killing the dream of homeownership for the middle class.In just 33 years, BlackRock has grown from nothing to becoming the world’s largest and most trusted asset manager and the company that owns the world. The firm has also become an increasingly influential Wall Street player in Washington, DC, and a revolving door between finance and politics. Today, at least three of BlackRock’s leaders now hold prominent roles in President Joe Biden’s cabinet.Given the company’s habit of forming shadow cabinets ahead of presidential transitions and its involvement in the new Federal reserve programs, Bloomberg went as far as calling BlackRock our “fourth branch of government.”https://techstartups.com/2021/08/10/meet-blackrock-company-owns-world-fourth-branch-government-9-trillion-assets-management/Here's a research paper opening a debate if BlackRock, and other large asset managers, are \"fourth branch\" OR actually \"first branch\" of government, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Ertl4/publication/372824190_BlackRock_Co_Fourth_or_First_Branch_of_Government/links/64c96a2ab7d5e40f331ad0f2/BlackRock-Co-Fourth-or-First-Branch-of-Government.pdfOK, now that we have the same understanding of what BlackRock actually is and what they are capable of, this is what they filed in their registration statement for their ETF,QuoteIn the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin network, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its sole discretion to determine, in good faith, which peer-to-peer network, among a group of incompatible forks of the Bitcoin network, is generally accepted as the Bitcoin network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trust’s purposes. The Sponsor will base its determination on whatever factors it deems relevant, including but not limited to, the Sponsor’s beliefs regarding expectations of the core developers of bitcoin, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies, as well as the actual continued acceptance of, mining power on, and community engagement with, the Bitcoin network, or whatever other factors it deems relevant. There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork, and the Sponsor’s decision may adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result. The Sponsor may also disagree with Shareholders, the Bitcoin Custodian, other service providers, the Index Administrator, cryptocurrency exchanges, or other market participants on what is generally accepted as bitcoin and should therefore be considered “bitcoin” for the Trust’s purposes, which may also adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htmIs it actually possible that BlackRock could co-opt Bitcoin by, hiring their own developers - probably even hire some of the Core Developers, incentivize a hash war, convince/buy into the economic majority to cooperate, start a fork, and declare their fork as Bitcoin?",

If they wanted to do that they could have simply picked another coin or started their own from scratch, there is simply no financial incentive to do such a thing, they would have not only to buy the entire thing first but then to convince people that their fork is the real deal, so if they would have this power to convince people why not use it from the start?Second, if they or somebody else is capable of doing this and the whole community chooses their fork for the financial aspects it means Bitcoin has already failed or rather we have failed Bitcoin.Btw:QuoteBlackRock made headlines last month after the company spent $6 billion to buy single-family homes and turn them into rental properties, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

However, prevailing community driven ethos and its highly established principles and practices, make it highly unlikely to alter its intrinsic nature of decentralization or manipulate it. The robust community involvement and their adherence to its well established norms within the Bitcoin ecosystem acts as substantial barrier against such efforts.",

However, I also believe that for them (as well as many others) Bitcoin is nothing more than a means to make a profit, which means that they will do everything to make that profit, regardless of all the possible negative consequences for Bitcoin.However, the fact that the Bitcoin community has been talking about BlackRock for months (mostly positively) speaks in favor of the fact that for the majority it is not too important what and how BR will work if they get approval, but whether they will succeed in pumping up the price of BTC so that many can reach their exit point.Unfortunately, we have long moved away from the most important reason for which Bitcoin was created, so the question arises whether we should now worry about what many have been wishing for for years, which is that the biggest players join the game.",

They manage a volume of approximately 9 trillion usd. So with this kind of money under the belt, when a company decides to join the crypto bandwagon, it's risky as hell. With this kind of money, they definitely hold a very strong position to manipulate or even destroy the entire crypto ecosystem. A decentralised network scattered across the world might not have the power to fight these mercenaries. If they decide to do bad to the bitcoin network, they can achieve their goal.",

Tell them to chase the same thing, Bitcoin. What do you mean by they will be your eternal slaves when they die? Are you one of those idiots who look at the rich as sinners who will be thrown into the pit of hell in the end? It takes more than a mind to be in power, if poor people are put in the seat of power and money they will mess things up more than those who are already running things. Are you seeing what the youths are doing today? People are losing their minds, bad things are looking like the right things to them, all I'm saying is, do not be the judge of these people, there is always more to everything we think we know.",

The only logical explanation for me is that they are also waiting for some unequivocal sign that the bull run is starting before they direct significant funds into BTC.",

Because when governments see something like bigger threats from Bitcoin, they will do more regulations to constrain it. Especially when they launch their CBDCs which are centralized and will not be supported by Bitcoin communities.BlackRock is only one of institutional investors, they are not the first and will not be the last. I don neither overestimate nor underestimate effects from BlackRock.",

To me, though, it still seems dubious that BlackRock is actually going to get their ETF approval from the SEC, so I guess we'll see how influential they really are.As for their potential power over Bitcoin, they're talking about a hard fork situation, which IMO seems unlikely at this point, and, more importantly, considering that many people around the world don't know about BlackRock, so its influence is very limited regionally, and also since lots of Bitcoiners care about decentralization and independence from authorities, I don't think we should worry about BlackRock using its resources to fork Bitcoin and win over the majority.",
