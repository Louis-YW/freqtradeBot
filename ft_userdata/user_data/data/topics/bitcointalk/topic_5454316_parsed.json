  "content": "This is the story ...OKX's suddenly raised the minimum deposit amount of BTC to 0.0002 without any informing and I have 2 transaction sending to my account, one is confirmed and one is in pending on the network. They're both 0.00019xxx (around $5), which is less than the current minimum deposit amount of BTC now so they refused to make the transactions credited to my account. The matter is they've never sent email to inform their customers about this raising since April (I still got deposit transactions credited which was also 0.00019xxx in April so I believe they've just changed it recently). After this case I am considering to switch over to another exchange as I think what they've done is not fair. Anyone still using OKX should take caution about this new minimum deposit amount as once it happens they are not willing to help you to get your funds back (I have tried to contact their support).June 13th 2023 Updated: Eventually no one on OKX is willing to help and they don't combine depositing 2 payments which sum is over 0.0002 so beware of the minimum amount, 0.0002 BTC is around $5 not a very small amount.",

If you want to deposit on exchangs, make sure you check the address because it could have been changed. Make sure you also check the minimum deposit because it could have been changed too.

He sent $5 and to cancel the unconfirmed transaction (send the coins back to his wallet), assuming his transaction is flagged as rbf, he will need to spend ~3-4 dollars minimum in fees.Some may argue that 1-2$ is better than nothing, but what I would do is to contact customer support and see if they can help in crediting the sent amounts to my account balance, even if it's less than the minimum required.",

Did you check the 'minimum deposit amount' right before you made a deposit? or you just assumed it was still the same as April and just went for it?If it's the latter, I wouldn't blame it on OKX. Truthfully, not paying attention on your deposit page 'right before' you deposit will likely expose you to mistakes such as this therefore jumping ships may not help much unless you fix this habit.For an entirely different reason though, better switch/lessen your usage on OKX if you do not want to KYC with them because they are one step away from implementing mandatory verification and who knows if they'll be nice enough to let KYC1 people to withdraw first.",

Not about the TOS but just the typical words that we see when we're about to withdraw or deposit. There usually those amounts posted there before we do any of those. But, I could also be wrong that it's not a negligence on his part and it should really be blamed to OKX for changing terms without informing anyone with a blast email of the terms for these amounts have changed. Because if he just did checked it out first and read a bit, not the TOS or updates but the notes that's there before doing the transaction of depositing of how much the minimum amount is, I doubt it that he'll proceed with the deposit.",
