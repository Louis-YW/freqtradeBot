  "content": "I don't know how I make decisions as a boy.  My father is a military man. He has served in this military sector for 25 years. His term of service is almost at an end. After two months he was going to retire from the job. He will get retirement pension after his service life in the military sector and he has many plans based on this retirement pension.  His first dream is to build a house with this retirement money. But right now in my country all the materials needed to build a house are very expensive so building a house right now can't be a good decision. And I don't feel safe keeping his pension money in the bank because earlier there was inflation in my country where some banks went bankrupt. So right now I am not able to give him any proper advice as a boy. But one thing I've been wondering for a few days is if I invest half of my father's retirement allowance in Bitcoin, am I doing something wrong?I feel like if I invest half the amount in Bitcoin for a year after receiving his retirement allowance, I might be able to hand over more money to my dad at the end of the year.  Hope I get proper advice from you.",

From your thread, your dad and the rest of the family are heavily dependent on the pension, putting that into a volatile asset is a risk, one you have to think long and hard before making.• One year is a relatively short space of time. If you're going to invest in Bitcoin in the hopes of getting a return within a short period of time, you could very well be disappointed. Life situations can also come up before then that would require you to liquidate earlier.There is also the flip side where Bitcoin rises significantly within that period and you actually can give him more money.Consider the risk to reward ratio before making your suggestion.Using spare money to buy Bitcoin gives you the liberty to easily wait through price dips and not panic sell.",

That is a special quota and almost every country follow this norm so it is anyway irrespective of your nationality. If this is the case then go ahead and spend some money on bitcoin but do ask your fathers permission for the same. He must be very delightful about it and have his consent no matter what is the situation in your house. If everything comes to an agreement then I don’t think anything or anyone can stop you from investing that money for the good reasons.",

But what caught my attention is that you are able to control that money and your father does not have full decision-making power over it.No one can give you useful advice according to the little information about your father's situation because I consider that money is his right and no one has the right to take a decisive decision about it, especially since a person of retirement age may not have enough time to benefit from an investment in Bitcoin or any of the digital assets.In general, if the amount is good, it is better to discuss with your father about his needs for the coming period and about the size of the amount that can be deducted to invest in Bitcoin. The idea of ​​investing in Bitcoin is not bad in any case, but it is always preferable not to venture into investing in what we fear we will lose, given that it is your father's money and not your money.By the way, your father's idea of building a house is not bad if you have enough land, and it is suitable for a person of his age and status.",

Both possibilities are open. Now you and your dad need to decide whether to gamble with his hard-earned money. If I were you, I wouldn't have touched half of his money for sure! I would have probably used 5%-10% of that money to invest in Bitcoin. The basis of investment is - never to keep all your eggs in one basket. So diversify. Invest in Bitcoin, invest in Gold, invest in tax saving instruments, invest in stocks that pays out good dividends. That's how you will create a parallel source of income for him. But don't invest half of his money into Bitcoin for God's sake. Don't gamble with retirement funds, ever. period.",

For the investment decision, I think you are open-minded and close to reality which shows that you are really interested in planning a good future. My suggestion to OP is not to go for all in at once I think you should start DCA with a specific amount regularly it is a more safe and precise solution for the investment purpose. Also take your dad in confidence first before making any decision because as it's the money of his whole life service so, that's obvious he should know how his Son is gonna utilize it to provide them with a secure old age life.Analyze market.Learn about.Start DCA.Make You Dad feel proud on you.",

Many banks are going bankrupt, high inflation and various other problems make people a little frustrated in determining where to store their assets comfortably and safely. But if it's just to maintain the value of the asset maybe keeping it in gold is pretty safe from inflation.But because it looks like you and your father have a different problem background. i.e. you likely don't just want to save and secure the value of that asset (father's pension). But you hope more to be able to expand your father's pension money so that it can become more in a certain period of time (1 year). And you might think that if you kept half of it in bitcoins that would be possible. But for me it is too high risk.Because retirement money is money that's actually pretty hot. In the sense that this money is really needed to meet all the needs of your father and your family from the time your father started retiring onwards. The point is that this money is actually not money that you and your family can afford to risk losing. because the money is certainly needed for the long term needs of your family.And remember that bitcoin price fluctuations are not easy to predict. in the next 1 year the price may experience a significant increase and it could also be the opposite, namely experiencing a deep decline.Have you and your father ever thought about starting a business with the pension money? at least you and your father can have the opportunity to make a profit from this business to make ends meet. and then you can put the remaining unused profits in bitcoin investment for the long term (more than 1 year).",
