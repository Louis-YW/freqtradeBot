It's possible that he is dealing with some personal issues or just busy with other things.It's also possible that he may have been suspicious when you asked for a down payment. Given that your reputation on the forum is relatively unknown, it's understandable that some might not feel comfortable trusting you with money upfront without using escrow.Also, as _act_ has already mentioned, it would be helpful if you could provide the username so that we don't have to guess.",

Do well to seek the expertise of a reputable member here so that you will be protected. As I see you are a new bie and the other too is a new bie. Here, there is actually every tendencies that most of these newbies account are scammers looking for unsuspecting participants to get away with. So in your on best interest, do well to do the needful and protect yourself.Lastly, get evidence of your conversations and transactions to back you up.",

It's better to hire a escrow to safeguard the interest of both the parties involved.I think he meant about a honest person who has a newbie account rank in this forum, of course escrow is a must when the user has no reputation, but as you said it could be trusted when he already had done multiple successful transactions. However each user has their own preference to judge the trustworthiness, just like a person think $50 is big, while the others think it's small.Quote from: Stalker22 on April 28, 2023, 07:57:03 PMHow can you say that there was no money involved.

If I were loabiti33, he might already find someone and don't want to reply the others because it's wasting time for him.Quote from: lucifur on April 28, 2023, 12:57:54 PMAlso as I mentioned.

If you need a service you can create a topic and give out the details. You can state there that you won't do any business unless each party agrees to use an escrow. That way you will guarantee that you will only be getting applications from those who accept your terms.",
