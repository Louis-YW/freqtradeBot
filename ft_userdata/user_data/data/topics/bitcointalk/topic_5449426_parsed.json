  "content": "Una good morning oooo my country people. I dey new for Bitcoin talk so I say I come hail una. Since I take come,I just dey take my time to study the forum. Recently I just dey observe our local board, I con see d good work wey our people dey do for this forum and dem dey help well,well. Out of all the local board, na only this our own na e dey active pass for the forum and e dey jolly me for body. I even dey see the good work wey some people like  Satoshi princess, Igebotz, cryptopreneurbrainboss and some others dey do to dey help make sure say this board dey active and with good quality posts. I too go do my best to make sure say I still contribute to make our board better. Actually, I just noticed say we never get moderator unlike other local boards Dem get. I know say our board still dey new and e never reach one year since Dem give us local board. But abeg make Dem still try add moderator for us abeg make e for reduce some kind ugly post for this our board although I know say we dey try grow am Sha.Another thing again we I observe na e be d matter weycryptopreneurbrainboss still talk early this year about our subthreads and childboard. I really like the idea,e go make sense and go dey very important. If una observe well now, our local board just dey mixed up with different thread everywhere and everything just dey mixed up. If newbies come here, them go just confuse and no know watin Dem dey fine at all. According to cryptopreneurbrainboss and from my own observation,some important subthreads and childboard wey we go need for our local board go include.1.introduction (about our local board, newbies, and some important thing wey Dem go need to know)2.polities( governments, elections)3.our Economy (Naira,market,food,school)4.security(news, security update)5. Bitcoin Nigeria (cryptocurrency,trading,the market)All these one go make sense at least for now because I noticed say almost all the post wey Dem don create for this our local board, dey revolve round these matters. So abeg watin una talk about this matter. I no know how possible e go dey abeg make Dem help us correct d disorderliness for our local board. Thank una once again abeg make una drop comment watin una think.",

      "body": "This whole issue is what makes me shy away from the our local board, I mean its just like the board now is obsessed with new account that don't care to read the rules before jumping into rapid posting and for certain its like the number of new account that are being created these days in the forum is all Nigerian which is good from one perspective at least its a sign that more people are obviously hearing about bitcoin and want to be involved in it but the issue is that when you arrive in an institution there are always rules and regulations guiding the that platform and its paramount that you must obey or you get punished so in truth this board urgently needs a moderator or moderators because the load of shitpost that is here to clean will certainly be too much for one moderator. So I will just advice all person to just please adhere to the the rules stipulated here because this whole matter of shitpost and disorderliness in our board will time coming all be met and dealt with.",

But abeg make Dem still try add moderator for us abeg make e for reduce some kind ugly post for this our board although I know say we dey try grow am Sha.We just dey start, we never reach better one year or even get better discussion wey fit stand one months and discussions still dey continue for the thread. We never achieved any major milestones wey we go say the board dun stand strong, everything wey dey happen now na just community members dey run am. We no even get better spam like dat wey global moderators no fit handle wey we go say we need local moderators. We no even get better topics wey person fit highlight say e no get better merit to use apply for merit source. All this things go come in their necessary time but as for now, we're too young to be demanding for much.If you dey ask for subboard wetin d board go be about wey no fit enter this general board for now. We never even get better 5 Bitcoin related discussion so dat one no be case. Anyhow sha I no go lie, we dey try and na we all dey put hand together run am. Procedures wey we fit adopt to help keep the board active and clean na to dey take matters into our own hands. We fit dey create self moderated threads and they delete the spams ourselves when we see am. Report off topic discussion or spams to moderator and them go answer. If you see duplicated thread, report am to moderators for delection or DM the person to lock am etc. For now na we dey incharge and e go dey like dat for a very long time so make we own am.",

Despite English being widely spoken in their country, they often conduct activities in their local language with bounties. The project can extend to other sectors as well not only exchange .We can explore ideas beyond our current circle and seek investments from influencers we know to bring them to life. It doesn't make sense for Nigeria to have a significant investment in cryptocurrency without a creative presence.",
