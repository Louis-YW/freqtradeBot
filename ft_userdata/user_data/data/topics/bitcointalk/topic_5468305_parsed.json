      "body": "Bitcoin made it possible for undeserved and unbanked people to join the global financial system. People can do their transactions without any banking system with minimum cost. Millions of worth of assets can be transferred with less than 10$ in transaction fees which was unimaginable in traditional banking system. It creates the opportunity to develop new ideas and business like decentralized exchanges where you can trade directly without the need for any banking channels or you can use lending service to lend your money to earn interest or use it as a collateral and take out loans. The more time passes by the more potential and possibilities it reveals to the world... Anti crypto policy taken by banking system shows they are resistant to change and threatened by the disruptive nature of cryptocurrencies.",

      "body": "Yes, bitcoin and blockchain take time to develop and implement, apart from that, people also need understanding in using bitcoin and securing their wallets. Things like that require a long process and time. If you look at the history of fiat money, it had a longer journey before it was finally used for world payments. I think Bitcoin is still very young, it still needs more time for the entire ecosystem to become more established and eventually be used effectively. What about legacy bitcoin, segwit, and lightning, these are developments so that bitcoin can be implemented and make it easier for everyone",

What do you think?One of the best benefits of cryptocurrency that I love is sending money with cheap transaction fees. In a traditional system Transfering money from one country to another makes huge fees but in cryptocurrency, you can transfer money to every corner of the world you want and if you transfer a large amount the fees are like nothing means very low fees and Also this is a fast process which takes place within seconds. Another benefit is that the traditional banking system leaves or ignore people from developing countries who are from a poor family but cryptocurrencies take them out of that system and provide them with the best system and make them the owners of their own assests.",

What do you think?I think the same, we are really an early adopter and I did not realize that until a member here made a topic --> imagining what he will be like the last halving Where he asks us to imagine and once I started to imagine, I came to realize that we are also will be counted as early adopters, even though we are not the first users of BTC or blockchain technology. I always thought that those who have accumulated a hell lot of BTC in the early stage are the only early adopters, but I was wrong, we are also early adopters, which means, that time is the only thing that tells or helps one to tag someone an early adopter. Because we will be early adopters for those who are living in 2100 but for us the early adopters are those who lived and used the BTC from 2009 to 2015. BTC is still growing, and it still needs a lot of developments which means there is still room for growth.",

Well, Here When it comes to cross-border transactions I recently found a very weird personality who was continuously supporting Bitcoin over the traditional Banking system, and after a very weird announcement by a Bank, He said bye-bye to Bitcoin but who cares an idiot left. While discussing the payment mode I will never discredit Bitcoin by comparing it with any other cryptocurrency I would say it is just Bitcoin which is reliable in the crypto space for any type of transaction you want, Anonymous, Transparent, Cheap, Fast, Direct and Custodial or any other you can think of. I think no one dares to challenge as there is no one except BTC who can do it in a better way, by fulfilling all the requirements.Quote from: Faisal2202 on September 27, 2023, 04:22:37 PMBecause we will be early adopters for those who are living in 2100 but for us the early adopters are those who lived and used the BTC from 2009 to 2015.

Exactly, You are never late to Bitcoin at least for a couple of years even when it crosses $100K milestone, as per the regulatory crisis and the acceptance of Bitcoin on the Universal level for the replacement of the USD requires decent time, better to hurry as everyone wants to the early adopter from the early adopters. It's an FCFS-based opportunity (But it isn't for a Single Cycle) for multiple cycles.",

Hmm, For that I won't answer you and quote any proof the time will justify that and it will bring up the potential reasons why people were supporting this narrative with Bitcoin. I'm pretty confident because at least we need a universal currency in every age, as it was Gold before USD was replaced and now Bitcoin will How and Why for that a small hint for you is...Quote from: Hamza2424 on September 23, 2023, 08:18:48 AMQuote from: JayJuanGee on September 23, 2023, 05:44:21 AM__SNIP____SNIP__As the blunder we did before cant be repeated under the influence of any upcoming Superpower.. At least this is what I expect. I did check out your post but the narrative with the replacement of the USD is not for the store of value it is going to be our need. Needs cant be replaced with alternatives they must be fulfilled.The point you are talking about is completely another approach, I do consider most of the investors are jumping into the market with similar intentions profit booking avoiding inflation, and blah blah, but at the end of the day, they need to recognize its main power with regulatory support and recognize that why they really need it. You are going to see the glimpses of this narrative in coming few months..",

What do you think?Actually btc is a great fintec project. I suppose that btc can be an enormous testnet, which is created to test new fintech solutions. In general, I think that there are going to be new crypto projects, some of them can be later adopted by digital fiat banks. So, btc is a great project, but the future development of cryptocrrencies dosn't depend solely on btc, fiat banks and other fintech solutions also influence the industry.",

What do you think?Just remember though that Satoshi took inspiration from others cryptocurrency way before he developed and released Bitcoin. He just sharpen it up and make some changes and that's what it is today.Not sure what you meant by creation of jobs, but if you are talking about blockchain yeah, but it is still a small market if I'm not mistaken. As the adoption is very slow in this particular technology. But as far as being one of the best asset, bitcoin is slowly making it make although there are still investors who doesn't want to take the risk because of it's volatility.",

Innovation in start-ups, the creation of jobs, and new means of subsistence for individuals. However, I concur that we're still in the early stages. We have to continue being careful as a group so as to help others. We need to keep trying to get people to understand, accept, and regulate in the right way.

Satoshi created the first crypto blockchain rather than discovered it, I think.I agree with the op that it's still a pretty early adoption stage and that the achievements are already amazing, though. But as for development of various crypto projects, I think that if it's additional infrastructure for Bitcoin and perhaps other cryptos (exchanges, wallets, things like that), then yeah, it can develop further. But if it's development in a sense of the diversity of altcoins and their missions, I think we've already seen that the hype didn't match the reality of things, and while occasionally some useful-ish things appear, most turns out to be rubbish.",
