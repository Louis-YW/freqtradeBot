Yes, it's definitely a scam. I've been hearing about fake USDT mint and trading platforms for a while now. But I'm not sure this is the same as what you're talking about. They will often contact you via Telegram or Whatsapp and provide you with a username and password. As if by accident. When you log into the website, you'll find that there's an unusually high amount of USDT (of course it's not real) which you won't be able to withdraw. They're using old techniques but coming up with new names everyday for scamming new set of people.",

I also think greedy folks are more likely to fall victim to this particular type of scam. Scammers would always try to up their game using different and new techniques to try and fool their prospective victims. This particular scam is new to me as I havenâ€™t exactly come across this type before. But it screamed scam from the beginning as why would you be sent a wallet supposedly containing a huge amount of assets that you have no prior knowledge of?Receiving a text from a strange number with a luring offer to give you money does not just happen.

The scammer needed to be credited with the need to log into the account as soon as possible since someone else could do it earlier. Time limits, with the words \"urgent\" or \"offer ends in 15 minutes,\" simply will not let the opponent think, and greedy people very often peck at such bait. I saw a friend send all of his money because he thought he won an iPhone by reading an ad and thought he was extremely lucky.People need to introduce psychology lessons in the very primary grades, since scammers very often use the emotions of people who cannot assess the situation in time.",
