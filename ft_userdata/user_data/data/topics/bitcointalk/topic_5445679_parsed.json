  "content": "It is not like everyone is going after crypto gambling but after COVID-19 the business of online gambling has increased more than offline gambling. Although fiat online gambling users are more than crypto ones, they tend to visit an offline casino after a few online sessions as they miss the atmosphere of an offline casino. Whereas cryptocurrency casino users would always be loyal & habitual which makes them more addicted to gambling than a fiat gamblers. Below listed are the three reasons which I think make them more inclined.1. Immediate gratification:One explanation could be the immediate and continuous enjoyment that bitcoin gaming offers, whether you win or lose. A cryptocurrency can be swiftly converted into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies, as opposed to traditional gambling, which typically calls for cash or chips, what I am referring to here is offline gambling. This feeling of immediate satisfaction can increase excitement and encourage players to keep playing.2. Anonymity:The amount of privacy gained by gambling with cryptocurrencies is unbelievable! Non-KYC platform, which is common may make some people feel more secure since they can offer a level of secrecy and security that more traditional forms of gambling cannot. This sense of anonymity may make it easier for individuals to engage in risky or addictive behaviors without fear of being judged or identified.3. Thrill of volatility:We are all aware of how unpredictable the cryptocurrency market is, with prices varying quickly and erratically. Some people may become addicted to the \"high-risk, high-reward\" mentality as a result of this volatility. Even though it may result in severe financial loss, they may get high from taking chances and placing large wagers.Do you guys think my assessment is to the point or do you think there are more reasons related to cryptocurrency gambling addiction? Please go ahead and reply to this thread. If you have a valid point that I think is related to this thread then I would add it to this topic.",

It would be complex and would vary from individual to individual. I will agree that the more accessible, instantaneous and sometimes, more anonymous (I say sometimes as most casinos will ask for KYC if you play with any significant amount and therefore the experience is not really anonymous) nature would enable addiction more than what fiat/offline gambling would.",

This sense of anonymity may make it easier for individuals to engage in risky or addictive behaviors without fear of being judged or identified.Most bitcoin and other crypto gambling sites today are requiring for KYC. In my country, on fiat casino, you do not even need KYC because all about you can be traced to your bank. I was wondering why no KYC is not needed for gambling in my country in fiat gambling sites, I later realized that no privacy and no anonymity as your bank account is linked to your account on the local gambling sites. The local gambling site will instruct you to use the name that correspond to your bank account for registration.Quote from: elevates on March 20, 2023, 02:52:19 PM3.

Please go ahead and reply to this thread. If you have a valid point that I think is related to this thread then I would add it to this topic.Well some of the reasons are cool but I don't think Anonymity is the reason because reputable casinos are driving gamblers to KYC making them disclose their identify which is not the purpose of cryptocurrency.Personally I think one of the major reason is the speed of deposit or withdrawal without any third party. That could be addictive that because nothing encumbers a bettor from depositing so a gambler is at liberty to always refund anything he runs out of coins. The speed of deposit delivery at 1 confirmation is more comfortable than playing through fiat.",

Here the most important thing is that gamblers are tries to remain anonymous. Many people emphasize deposit and withdrawal system. It depends entirely on the gambler's own self. Moreover, I used to do gambling by Fiat Money in 2012. But since getting the advantages of Crypto, i never returned to fiat till today.",

Yes overall it is an advantage of crypto itself, for me it also doesn't really matter about it because the average person does gambling for pleasure and the results of gambling itself including me.But for me when using crypto to play gambling the sensations that are given are more interesting and when using crypto which has a high value it is crazier and very ambitious.but whether addicted or not in my opinion is the same, because before I switched to using crypto as a gambling tool I was already addicted to gambling.",

This sense of anonymity may make it easier for individuals to engage in risky or addictive behaviors without fear of being judged or identified.Anonymity also depends on the regulations set by each casino. Even though the casino uses cryptocurrency as payment, KYC will be applied when a user withdraws a certain amount. True anonymity cannot be obtained completely, the application of KYC also avoids money laundering practices.Any gambling can be addictive depending on how it is done. If gambling is only for continuous profit, it becomes the wrong goal. Each bet will not have a winning streak, there will be a break from a few losses. if you don't have any strategy then you will likely get addicted and continue to spend your spare cash.",

But anonymity is probably the main thing that crypto gamblers consider for gambling because we can use crypto without depositing it through our bank account. This will protect us if there is \"control\" from the bank at any time so that they will suspect that the funds in the bank are being sent to the gambling account.And because of Covid 19, online fiat and crypto casinos are more known by gamblers. And crypto casinos offer something different from online fiat casinos in that users can gamble from their homes and hide their identities without doing KYC. But the casino can implement KYC in all crypto casinos. Even if we don't want it, the casino can do it anytime.",
