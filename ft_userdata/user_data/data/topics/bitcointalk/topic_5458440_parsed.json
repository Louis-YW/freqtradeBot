Which is already scam and also from that it might be happened scam again.This is a suspicious seller, and his rank is a Newbie, and he does not have any good reputation, and I can be sure that once anyone buys a Stealth PayPal Account from him, he will take it back and lose the money. It is clear that he chose the bitify.com platform because it has poor support. They do not review the listings and do not solve the problems of their customers, and do not return their money in the event that they discover any fraud by sellers, and this is what I concluded from the reviews of 2 clients on Trustpilot about this platform, which seems to be a suitable environment for fraud due to the lack of censors, so I hope that anyone will not deal through this platform and not deal with any sellers who do not have a reputation or a good rank in the forum and the dealing is must be done through a good and well-known escrow as well. Buying these financial accounts is not a good idea because they can be stopped at any time or restored by the scammer.",

If you did anything illegal in order to obtain an item, then you can't trade it on bitcointalk.org. Anyone found breaking this rule will be banned.Quote from: theymos on August 07, 2019, 07:06:24 PMTrading the accounts of these services is not allowed. Report anyone selling them. Newbies will be permanently banned; established members may be given warnings before being banned, but the relevant posts will be deleted.AWSN26UpworkServices are added to this list when we come to believe that essentially no trades of such accounts are following our rules, which prohibit for example selling hacked accounts, accounts requiring KYC info, accounts created using stolen identities, etc. If you have a really strong argument for how you're selling these accounts without violating our rules, create a topic in Meta explaining in detail, and we may consider either removing the service from this list or giving you a one-time exemption.This list only applies to sales of accounts, not invites, codes, etc., though sales of the latter items must still follow our usual rules.I am going to try and report the account as it's proven to have gone against the forum rule. In their post history I see they made another post that the mods have not yet probably seen.",
