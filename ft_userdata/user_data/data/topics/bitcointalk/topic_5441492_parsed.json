If you are going to have less than say 1,000 dollars or the equivalent you can use a mobile wallet or a custodial, but for larger amounts you should buy a hardware wallet, which is the safest way, but from what you say it doesn't seem to be large amounts.If you want to store, say 50 dollars, download Mycellium wallet on your mobile or another similar wallet.",

For small amounts he can use one mobile wallet or another. For larger amounts, be it 500 or 1,000, a hardware wallet is worthwhile.Besides, it would be good if he could say what his plan is. Because if he plans to buy 50 dollars but to hold and he plans to keep buying 50 dollars every week, maybe he should use a HW from the beginning.Quote from: mk4 on February 28, 2023, 04:07:54 AMI actually thought OP was referring to liquid-staking derivatives until I saw his username.Lol.",

      "body": "Based on other members’ suggestions, you might want to choose an open source hardware wallet. Trezor is one of the most popular ones among bitcoin users. You can find a list of open source hardware wallets here: LIST of Open Source Hardware WalletsIf you have a limited budget, you can use a lightweight bitcoin client like Electrum[1] for desktop or Bluewallet for mobile. Just make sure you verify[2] the signature of electrum to avoid malicious software.Another option is to set up an airgapped wallet with two separate devices: one online and one offline. This way, you can create, sign, and broadcast a bitcoin transaction[3] securely.But this approach is a bit complicated than the previous suggestions from above. Nevertheless, just pick the method that suits you best.[1] https://electrum.org/#download[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5240594.0[3] https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlQuote from: LSDadventure on February 28, 2023, 03:13:15 AMI was introduced to LSD but I am more interested in buying Bitcoin first.LMAO.

If you having low amount for frequent transaction, you can use Electrum.If you want to hold big amount, either for long or short time, buy hardware wallet. If you can use cold storage it is safest too because the private keys are not online.

Electrum is okay,  trezor is okay to deal with bur if your are using other wallets aside, you can use the easiest you can handle so as not to have issues in the nearest future. Do well to save your key phrase where only you can assess at anytime you need to do so. Another thing i would advise you to do is to avoid clicking on links you have no idea about because of lately, hackers have been on the spree sending out random mails to potential victims so they could get details of their wallets to undo them by stealing their assets. Once their victim clicks on the linking, automatically the victim grants them assess to their system which becomes vulnerable to the hackers hence they steal your information. Storing your assets offline is a bit safe.",
