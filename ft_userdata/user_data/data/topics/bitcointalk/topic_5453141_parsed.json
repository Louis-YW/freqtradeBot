  "content": "I read a tweet by Ledger - (1/2) Technically speaking it is and always has been possible to write firmware that facilitates key extraction. You have always trusted Ledger not to deploy such firmware whether you knew it or not.I don't use ledger, I was just looking for discussions on how bad the new terms of service of Metamask and for me this is seriously a security flaw that could cost people's money, I can't feel disappointed why these services chose to ruin their reputation after building it for years.",

Also, it is better to move the topic to the hard wallets section.As for the news, I do not know about the firmware that facilitates the extraction of the key, but there has recently been great criticism of the recent update to the Ledger wallet, which allows the seed to be sent to selected addresses for a paid service. These things could constitute a major security vulnerability that will harm Ledger's reputation.",

To elaborate, code can be written to make it do whatever you want it to. But with Ledger firmware, there are layers of protection and governance in place to ensure that no attacker (even internal) has the ability to publish malicious firmware. Ledgerâ€™s security design and threat model ensures that your private keys are handled with your security in mind.https://donjon.ledger.com/threat-model/But they have still failed to answer the more pressing questions.Quote from: malcovi2 on May 18, 2023, 02:04:16 AM I can't feel disappointed why these services chose to ruin their reputation after building it for years.In short. Getting greedy for more money.",

They are doing such stupid PR moves one after another. I guess it reflects how stupid their latest recovery product is. I wonder what makes them do such idiotic things in the first place. You'd expect them to be a bit smarter after being in the industry for years. They are correct that people need to trust Ledger to some extent if they want to use their product, but there is no reason to trust them anymore after they explain that they can and will back up your seeds over the air.

CMIIW.Ledger still lives on the fame it acquired in the past, where Ledger and Trezor earned reliability as safe HWs, but both are in the doldrums. Ledger even more so, I would say. But acquired fame doesn't last forever, and with the bad reputation they are getting, where one can see a lot of videos lately on social media of people breaking their Ledger and people on this and other forums not recommending it, I wouldn't be surprised if their revenue declines and go out of business in a few years.",
