  "content": "This post should have been made some weeks back, But I didn't find time to, i am glad i finally did it.Ive read from this forum, and even from other sources how people purchase items with payment in Bitcoin, some even claimed to have paid for services like medical bills, school fees, travel documents in Bitcoin, I always wondered how this users get this service providers to accept their payment in Bitcoin even when some of this businesses have not openly or publicly announced that they are accepting Bitcoin payments.Some weeks back, i.e., in the month of June, I got tired of spending money always on public transportation and decided I will buy a new motor bike to move around with, i managed to get the required amount in fiat which is about $650, i had this money on my bank account and called on 2 of my friends to accompany me to a nearby motor bike dealer.After discussing and reaching agreement with the dealer, I opted to transfer the agreed amount to the dealers bank account since I don't have fiat cash on me, the dealer wrote down his bank account details and handed it over to me to make the transfer to, I then logged in to my mobile banking app and tried to transfer but I discovered I couldn't, I tried several times but couldn't, I told the dealer and he showed me a nearby bank and asked me to go and withdraw the money, it was a lot of money to withdraw from an ATM, but I still decided to give that a try since i can not transfer, i got to the ATM and discovered I cannot withdraw too, something was definitely wrong with my bank account but why today ?I got really furious and contacted my bank's customer support through a phone call, after about 15 minutes of waiting, I was connected to a lady, i told her my issue and she said to give her some time to check my account, after about a minute, she began apologizing and asked me to be patient , that the issue with my account will be resolved within 24 hours , \"24 HOURS !:o? i shouted, I have an urgent transaction to make right now, how can you tell me to wait 24 hours from now?\" She then sad \"Sir, we are sorry for the inconvenience, please look for another means of carrying out your transactions for the day till issue with your account is resolved\", I got really angry and hang up the call.I asked the dealer, \"what are going to do now?, dealer said maybe I should go and come back tomorrow after issue with my account is sorted by the bank, i cannot afford to go and come back tomorrow because I have an important appointment all through the day, infact, that day was the only spare day i have for that week, if I don't buy this bike today, it means I will have to wait till next week and I cant afford to wait that long, just as i was thinking.....I looked up and saw a local Bitcoin P2P exchange opposite the dealers shop, then I went straight to the dealer and asked him, \"Do you, or rather, will you accept payment for the bike in Bitcoin?\", First, he hesitated, and then asked me, \" are you into Bitcoin?\" i said \"yes, what about you?\" he said he used to hold some small amount of Bitcoins but sold it and yet to buy again, i then told him, \" maybe this is a good opportunity to hold Bitcoin again\", after keeping silent for some seconds, he said \"Ok, lets do it.He provided his Bitcoin address, I didn't have Bitcoins worth the amount needed on my personal wallet, I logged into my binance trading account where I was sure I had up to the required amount of Bitcoins needed, i him Bitcoins worth $650, ( though the agreed price was slightly below that), transaction got confirmed in about 5 minutes, he was extremely happy even more than I expected, he wrote the receipt, he signed, I also signed, he handed us the receipt and asked to be my friend on Facebook, i said ok so we exchanged Facebook contact, he handed us the key to my new bike and thanked us so much, he was really excited that I began to wonder the reason for his over joy, then, just as i was shifting the gear of my new bike to zoom off, my mind shifted too, and I realized I just helped a fallen Bitcoiner get back on his feet again, then, I understood his excitements and why he asked to be my friend on Facebook.Then, ZOOOOM, ZOOOOM ZOOOOM......ZOOOOOOOOOOOO I fired away with this thought in my mind --->\"my bank failed me, but Bitcoin came to my rescue\"",

Back to your experience; I believe it's a win-win situation for you and the seller. You've now scored higher than someone like me who hasn't done a direct Bitcoin exchange for goods. Again, you will always look at that bike beyond what it's. It will continually remind you of your sojourn with Bitcoin. You're the real Most Valuable Player!Besides, this also brings to the fore how determined Nigerians are with the issue of Bitcoin and the entire crypto space. It's also going to be a plus for this forum creating a real local board for Nigeria. @Theymos, kindly take note.",

Prolly somewhere along the line we might not be fascinated anymore when one makes a purchase via bitcoin, because by then it would be a common medium of exchange; your motocycle looks great by the way.",

Ok. As we can see from an excerpt from this story, bank money transfers are nowhere faster, especially when it is very necessary. I want to draw attention to the fact that the bank doesn't allow you to handle your money at any time. But wait, it's really your money and you own it, if someone else can restrict you from using it?not your keys cash, not your coins money.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on July 05, 2022, 01:35:29 PMHe provided his Bitcoin address, I didn't have Bitcoins worth the amount needed on my personal wallet, I logged into my binance trading account where I was sure I had up to the required amount of Bitcoins needed, i him Bitcoins worth $650, ( though the agreed price was slightly below that), transaction got confirmed in about 5 minutes, he was extremely happy even more than I expected, he wrote the receipt, he signed, I also signed, he handed us the receipt and asked to be my friend on Facebook, i said ok so we exchanged Facebook contact, he handed us the key to my new bike and thanked us so much, he was really excited that I began to wonder the reason for his over joy, then, just as i was shifting the gear of my new bike to zoom off, my mind shifted too, and I realized I just helped a fallen Bitcoiner get back on his feet again, then, I understood his excitements and why he asked to be my friend on Facebook.Back to the question of bitcoin's speed. Isn't 5 minutes long enough to buy or sell something for bitcoin? During this time, you can just have time to prepare all the papers / documents or a receipt, as in an excerpt from this story.Do you really need a speed of 10-30 seconds?P.S.I read Fivestar4everMVP's story with pleasure and congratulate him on motor bike. I like stories when bitcoin really helped someone and helped out in difficult times.",

Where the Bank makes you complicated with all the obstacles and rules that hinder the transaction rate, then the solution above appears as another solution, namely making payments with Bitcoin.

That's a huge amount and you can buy a private plane, a house and maybe a remote return for private facilities if these days are still saved.We have almost the same story, the difference is when I offer Bitcoin payment for an old motorbike but the seller is not interested in Bitcoin.
