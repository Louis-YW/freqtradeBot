For those students who don't want to be disciplined by their teachers and will later attack the teacher with their cult group after he has disciplined them. I will not blame them but rather I will blame the school authority for admitting such hoodlums and wayward students into the school, and if such report comes to the school,those set of students should be expelled because it shows that they are bigger than learning.Quote from: collinscoinz on May 11, 2023, 11:50:07 AMsome student not read any more thay said schooling is a scarm,what a generatio and were are we going the 419 boys has overwhelmed the genuine ones,trusth no longer exist. Actually, from my own understanding if you have attended the secondary education, there might be no need to go to a tertiary education with the way life is getting difficult everyday. Inflation and bad government is also contributing to the citizens hardship. If you can  learn a skill,it will be better,than wasting your time and funds without securing a good job after studies. You will end up begging on the street or doing a low class job because of bad government and high rate of unemployment.",

The government needs to create basic amenities that would assist members of society to live good and peaceable life. Security of lives and properties, employment, and educational opportunities should be some of the responsibilities of the government. Parents have the responsibility of raising their children based on acceptable moral standards. They should also work hard to provide for the basic needs of their children so that they will not lack the necessary support that will make them excel in life. Parents should be good role models that should act the way they want their children to behave. Every adult is responsible for his success and failure. You cannot blame anyone for your failure in life. Hard work and determination should be the guiding principle of everyone that wants to be successful. There is no shortcut to success so engaging in crime to make money will lead to jail term or even death.",

In some cases environment and biological relation and interaction shape the outcome of someone life and even at a level we are thought about the various contribution of external factors to the destiny of anyone. That being said, you are very correct also to place the destiny of any individual in their own hands and that is the real fact since we have equal 24-hour allocation daily to make out whatever we want in life and our future and whatever direction we take determined the outcome of the person life.Opportunities come to all and what we make of them is what matters, and also focus can change the faith of things in any direction so everyone must be sure of what their focus is in life.",

All the things you have mentioned are all choices that have been made by these people. So you can say that the outcome of someone's life depends on the choices they make. When your choices and actions align, you will get results, but when your choices and your actions do not align, the results will not be what you want. Some people make bad choices because their actions are easier to align with for quick results, but it is not the best because the future should be considered always whenever a choice is to be made.",

If we're not seeing the type of growth that we're wanting, we should change what we do. It's not an easy thing to be done but if you don't want to get stuck from wherever you are right now. Change is constant and the only thing you need to do. One factor that results to those that you mentioned is technology. I guess everyone have an idea as why technology is being dragged on this.",

      "body": "my answer is yes everybody is responsible for the outcome of his or her future, despite that it might not go as planned but a good they say is better than Riches, Bro you should understand that your choice and decision in life helps you to achieve what ever thing you want, there might be stumbling blocks or circumstances that may be beyond your control but you have to overpower it with your sense of humor in other not to be a victim of circumstance, I know that it is very difficult to make the right decision and adhere to them but we have to try because that the only to get it eight bu this being me to come to the conclusion that every human being know what is right but the ability to put it into practice becomes a problem. The major influence to the future of either man or woman is mainly attributed to these factors below:1. Friends2. The internet2. The social media4. The EnvironmentFriend plays one of the major role negatively or positively, positively a friend give you information that will continue to be of benefit to your future, for instance somany of us here today in Butcointalk forum was introduced by a friend and today they have been benefiting in one way or the other in this forum if not anything the knowledge of Bitcoin investment, wallets, ways of sending, receiving bitcoin and all the transactions involves in it, practically most person that was introduced by friends has been ranked higher than them so such is life, negatively a friend might influenced you by bring up ideas that will be of no good to you but in this situation you determine what happens and your decision is final because whats good is good, whats bad is bad the difference is clear so you choose wisely.The internet has used as tool to either learn good or bad depending the site you visited and the information you get there, somany ponorgrapic video addict toady started with the use of internet, this is also attributed to internet fraudsters all of this started from one day but note this is a matter of what you really want, the internet has helped individuals with good information on how to be successful in life and how to go about it gradually, today we all are here discussing about Bitcoin internet is the major role player.The social media has done more harm than good to people and that's why I advice parents to advice their children on the need to be mindful of social media when making use of it, avoid viewing some content that contains unethical video which might portray danger to the moral of the child this is also applicable to adult, friend request acceptance depending on the particular social media should be strictly on people you know and even on acceptance you mind what you discuss with them because this might endanger your life and also your relationship so be wise.The Environment we found ourselves might impact us negatively and this is by imitation, somany people today are member of occultic group not because the wanted it but because of the environment the find themselves either by intimidation from the cult group or even self decision by the person involve wanting to be like others knowing fully well that it is a wrong road to trade, this always happen in school hostels, but in all your decision to become a better person or bad fellow depends on you.",

Ignorance is not an excuse, if you make a mistake, you will have to pay for the price of the mistake. This is why we need to be very wise, seek for opportunities to better our lives. Example is the social media, some people engage in it just to pass time, while others are using it to make money and better their lives. We should not let past experiences or other people's shortcomings to stop us from aspiring for a better life. Giving excuses or blaming others or the government will not better our lives, because people in similar predicaments have made it in life. J",

The way I see it, regardless of generation, everyone is responsible for their own future. There simply are no excuses most especially nowadays when things are easier for anyone to improve themselves. If one makes a mistake, they still have a lifetime to fix themselves. What it all comes down to is a person's determination and thirst for knowledge and self improvement. Blaming just about anything for one's own misfortunes instead of learning from them is the worse thing there is that a person can ever do. Unless a person decides to stop looking for things to blame and instead start looking for ways to work around the difficulties in his life, the road to success will never open him.",

We live in a terrible world where the impossible and aberrant are becoming accepted and praiseworthy. You should not be intimidated by the happenings in the surroundings in which you live if they raise red lights that will lead to abnormalities in the society in which such acts will be questioned. It is claimed that a parent is responsible for giving birth to a child, but the child's character and characteristics are determined by his close allies, ranging from family to friends to society. Every child is responsible for his or her own fate since they can tell the difference between good and evil things at a certain age but ignore it and choose to go astray.Regardless, there are several factors that contribute to a child's waywardness into a life of disobedience and misery in the future. If we can control such factors, we will have a limited detrimental impact on the child's future.",
