      "body": "If you restore the Electrum wallet from the seed phrase, the Lightning channel should be recoverable. Because the seed phrase is used to bring out all the private keys and addresses associated with your wallet including those which was used for Lightning channels.If you restore your Electrum wallet, the wallet will regenerate all the necessary private keys and addresses including those which was used for the Lightning channels. Your Lightning channel's state is stored on the blockchain, and the private keys associated with your channels are executed from your seed phrase. Your existing Lightning channel information such as channel balances and channel state should be restored with the rest of your wallet.",

My basic understanding is that the amount contributed to a Lightning channel is on-chain, but the channel state is stored offline (channel peer-to-peer) to avoid the on-chain transaction fees. Given that, how does Electrum know how to find the offline channel state based on the seed phrase alone?",

Given that, how does Electrum know how to find the offline channel state based on the seed phrase alone?Seems like I misunderstood. But IÂ  guess there is some confusion in your understanding as well. The lightning network is 2nd layer scaling solution of a blockchain. The channels are funded with on-chain transactions. But when you participate in a lightning network, those transactions, balance, and channel states are off-chain. It's a 2nd layer blockchain. The lightning network transactions are not on the main blockchain. The lightning channel state is stored locally within your Electrum wallet software. So I guess Electrum doesn't find an offline channel state based on the seed phrase alone. Wait for the expert guys. I have to learn more about these things as well!",

I was able to export a QR code backup by right-clicking on the channel -> 'Export backup'https://talkimg.com/images/2023/08/13/GDibd.pngElectrum says it can be recovered by scanning the QR code from the Electrum mobile app.Note that I use a BIP39 seed and was still able to create the Lightning channel backup.Cheers.",
