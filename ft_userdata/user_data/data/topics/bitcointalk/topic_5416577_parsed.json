Of course, that is my region.. @igebotzEdit: The OP does not appear to be a serious person; he has been moving around looking for PR managers for project promotions with no job details.",

How would I apply for a job I might not have the skill to do. And sometimes I am scared of people that announce that their project is not a scam. What are the job specifications and qualifications?",
