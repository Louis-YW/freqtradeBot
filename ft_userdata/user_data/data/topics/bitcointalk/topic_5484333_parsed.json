The Biden Administration Wants To Create A Registry Of Bitcoin MinersMy first thought: What could possibly go wrong with a war-hungry and war-supporting government, which is in great debt to have an updated list of all Bitcoin mining operations on its soil?  It could perhaps come in handy if a war on Bitcoin is declared or new revenue sources need to be found to finance the pursuit of freedom and democracy.  Let's get to it.  Quotethe Biden Administration announced an emergency data collection initiative targeted at bitcoin mining operations in the US via the US Energy Information Administration, an \"independent\" sub-agency of the Department of Energy. It seems that the Biden Administration is identifying the electricity usage of the bitcoin mining industry as an emergency that is threatening grid stability throughout the US, as is evidenced by the name of the survey; \"Proposed Emergency Survey - Cryptocurrency Mining Facilities.\" Here are a few interesting points from the article:- They require that all mining facilities respond and fill out the survey as it's required by law.- The companies need to submit their addresses and points of contact.- The companies must state if they are mining Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work coins. We all know this is bullshit, as Bitcoin is the target here.- The companies need to state how many facilities they have in the US and provide precise coordinates. - Mining companies must state the number of miners, their models, and the number of produced hashrate. - EIA also requires information about how much electricity is being consumed.- They need to name their electricity service providers.Source:https://tftc.io/eia-bitcoin-mining-survey/Official survey announcement: https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php?ref=tftc.io",

The government under the leadership of this elites are just increasingly trying to control the life of everyone directly or indirectly. what exactly are all this details that are required from miners going to do for them, the taxes people pay isn't enough for them, now it's to indirectly control Bitcoin related stuffs that is their sole desire. I pity the citizens of the US who discriminate others who migrates to the US for greener pastures, because if they start getting informed on how they have been manipulated for so long now they will seek freedom or even what to leave such places. Imagine the US government succeeding with this enactments and as a result makes a rule that will seem so hard for bitcoin miners to keep mining Bitcoin, that will be a catastrophe in the Bitcoin world and with this intention can indirectly manipulate the market to their favour. All I wish is for all their indirect fights against Bitcoin to fail but anyways we will keep watching and playing our role in Bitcoin for it to keep getting stronger.",

You can say miners may move to other locations, but it is not so easy to do that, due to the cost of electricity, logistics and personal reasons.However, the purpose of this attack isn't for miners to pack up and look for other locations, i believe it is an attack on privacy, both for the miners themselves and soon for the tx's they mine, because they could make it a requirement that miners should not mine and should censor tx's from blacklisted or sanctioned addresses.",

With energy crisis over the past couple of years, more countries are making such moves with strict regulations.Not only there is a need to keep an eye on this kind of energy consumption but also the governments want a \"source of revenue\" as they smell taxes!The problem is the history of such governments. Apart from what was mentioned in OP, we should remember what the US government did to MARA pool, forcing them to censor transactions which is a direct attack on Bitcoin.Knowing miners, they could force them to only connect to \"government approved\" pools so that they can first increase the hashrate of such malicious pools like MARA pool and successfully attack Bitcoin that way.Quote from: Pmalek on February 06, 2024, 06:18:54 PMQuote~ that is threatening grid stability throughout the US~ - The companies must state if they are mining Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work coins.

Especially when mainstream governments have long criticized the \"high energy consumption\" of PoW. The Biden administration in the US, has been most critical about Bitcoin and crypto in general. I think this has to do with countries (eg: Russia) using crypto to avoid sanctions. Now it wants to regulate the industry heavily to prevent this from happening. Or should I say, prevent people from enjoying the full benefits Bitcoin provides. Fortunately, the current US government initiative only applies to companies.
