      "body": "This is not just a normal prediction, but the space CEO really has a point right there; this is already beginning to happen. Robots are already gradually taking over the tech industry with their programming skills, which are little to no different from what humans are doing. They have been said to be even faster at getting work done and detecting problems where there is a perfect solution for them. Most companies are now replacing their customer support agents with AI's. When you call or need any assistance, the AI will be there for you, and they get things done up to some certain level. Unless the issue is now more complicated, they will redirect you to the banking sector, which is doing this right now. They now have a robot that helps them attend to customer complaints through their app or designated number. How long do you think it will take them and the programmer to perfect this AI to the point where they will not be needing a human agent to get issues resolved? Currently, there are fewer people working on most companies support systems, and due to this new AI technology, many might have been transferred to other departments or fired due to their attention no longer being needed.",

While we can't deny that AI can handle tasks that don't require human involvement, it's unlikely to completely replace people in the workforce. However, we need to embrace these changes and the best approach is not to complain, but to enhance our skills so we aren't left behind in terms of opportunities, because AI is capable of handling some of our tasks.We appreciate that AI is making our work easier. However, we may not be aware that if we rely entirely on AI, it could replace our jobs. So, even though Elon's statement might be exaggerated, we should think about this chance. We need to find ways to avoid negative consequences when AI becomes more prevalent.",

AI can certainly do more in less time to turn code into game storylinethose McD's kiosks may look complicated. but just attach motorised wheels underneath and they can self remove themselves from public space and a replacement drives into its spot when one fails. McD's are already working on robot chefs..did you know that all them ready meal burgers(90second microwave) are 90% cooked and packaged at a factory are not cooked and packaged by humans. McD's just has to emulate the mass production factories, but on a individual scale where they just cook til finished rather than stop at 90%.. self cleaning toilets is a thing too. as are roomba's and other floor cleaning robotsif you think that the mcD's kiosks, roomba's are hand built by humans.. you might want to look at a electronics factory. machines build those kiosks",

It is clear that AI is already causing a change in the labour market. At the very least it will make jobs disappear and change the way others are done, but it remains to be seen whether all human labour will disappear or not, and in any case it will not happen overnight. If the change is very radical and many people become unemployed, a universal basic income will eventually be introduced.",

I believe his prediction on AI effect in the future has some merit on it considering how human become more lazy due to technological advancement.I doubt robot can replace human in terms of socialization problem but AI technology might dominate the manpower industry especially the call center area and other work that can be done through the use of internet as source.",

But there are many jobs as well, where AI will eventually replace humans. Especially those jobs, which are repetitive in nature. For example accounting! I have personally led a team to automate the entire bank reconciliation process for a large international travel company in the past. Now that entire function of bank reconciliation is just manned by one very experienced person who check the contras thrown by the system. Which used to be a department, is now manned by only one person. So there will be many jobs that will get eventually replaced by AI in future. So I feel a strong urge to regulate AI.

It does not matter to humans; they can't have feelings, they can't sense fear or the terror of death, and they can't have the instinct to survive in disasters like humans do.I don't think Elon is some guy who has full information or ideas about AI and how it can replace humans, but I do agree that he has seen things we don't, he must have experienced technologies we haven't even heard about. But in the end, AI is just a program that is designed and manufactured by humans and will need maintenance and grading.And do you really think that the friend or ROBO friend that Elon is suggesting to have for his son will be a genuine one?
