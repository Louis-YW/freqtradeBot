This thread is supposed to be services that pay in Bitcoin so you should follow the rules and respect it too.This is a second batch so it means that you already manage to get a first batch of applicants, with that in consideration, You already paid the first batch and it will be good to know if that is in Bitcoin. Wish you luck.",

The fact that he answered in the thread and ignored your post proves that it's some shady deal. What's there to hide really? Either it's a shitcoin, but he knows he'll get more response in the main service section so he keeps quiet about it or moderators will move the thread, or it's a scam and he doesn't want a backlash before he's even able to launch.",
