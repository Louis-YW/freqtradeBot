  "content": "How Bitcoin Can play its role to overcome the Financial CrisesIntroduction:In this Topic, I will try my best to cover some advantages like how BTC playing its important role in the era of Financial Crises. Financial crises can be giving hard times for economies, where plebs have to live hand to mouth but what the negative point here these people have lack of education About Bitcoin like their pro’s and con’s and leaving people and organizations in searching of their stability and safety. In this modern era of digital world, Bitcoin is putting an important effort as a game-changer, where most of the poor people getting help from Bitcoin during their financial crises. So, Let's try to explore Somehow Bitcoin is becoming a key player in these hard situations of financial crises.Bitcoin's Special Feature as a decentralized Currency:How BTC playing its role as a decentralized currency? Just Imagine if real money wasn't controlled by the government or any big organization of country this imagination relates very well with Bitcoin Currency. So, there is not control of any government or big institutions over Bitcoin currency, this is why Bitcoin known as decentralized and trusted currency which makes it a Good and trusted choice when traditional money is in risk. That is how both are different from each other.You can also read this blog if you want to have more idea about decentralization and centralization and their pros and cons. Centralization and decentralization Safe and trusted Digital Asset:Why People used to call Bitcoin In sense of \"digital gold?\" Because whenever regular money gets non-trustable like it drops its value, on the other hand Bitcoin can be a safe currency place to keep your funds in the form of asset. It's limited in supply, which makes it feel stable. It also makes it value depend on the market sentiments. Like people can set their goal in this field after adopting it. They just need to focus and set clear goals weather they want to enter in this field as trader of holder. I suggest newbies when they enter in this field start from holding some assets and try to know different techniques from seniors. After that they should take positive action. Easy way to Send Money Across Borders:During financial crises, where plebs live hand to mouth from those, some of the people rely on money sent by their family members working in other countries and doing work in BTC and earn from it they are supporting their family members all across the border adopting transaction the form of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is one of the great example for this because it's a quick and low-cost way to send money across borders, instead of traditional money although we know regular banks aren't working so well.Easy to get access to the money services:In some places, the regular money system isn't reliable so far as bitcoin. But even during the financial crises, people want to get access to basic money services easily. Bitcoin can help out through all the way for making transaction at low cost from here to there easily because all time availability on the internet and through smartphones makes it more important which making it easier for more people to get the financial help throughout the internet whenever they need help or support from their family members.Blockchain technology Making Things Transparent and Honest:We need to Know how blockchain making transection honest and transparent. So, let’s just Imagine if each of our financial transaction was recorded for everyone to see like where is money actually coming from and where it is going, and then no one could be able to make any changes in it after transaction has been done. That's what Bitcoin's technology or blockchain technology called. It helps keep things honest and transparent during financial crises, like making sure that relief money goes where it's supposed to which is thing very positive point. Like no one can do scam with your money until you make any false transaction from your side.Easy way for securing you money: When there's a financial crisis or thing get tough, people might want to move their funds somewhere safer so that they can feel relaxed and easy. Adopting Bitcoin and moves their fund into digital world makes it easy because it doesn't care about borders which mean everyone can move their fund into the bitcoin in the form of their secured assets. It lets you move your money quickly and privately where no one has any kind of hold on it due to its decentralization benefit.  Conclusion:Bitcoin is becoming one of the safest and important technique during financial crises in this modern era. It is helping to provide stability, honesty, and financial freedom to people funds where no other one has any access to their assets, even though Bitcoin also has some challenges like price fluctuation. So, it is obvious that Bitcoin is changing and getting most adoptable day by day like how we deal with financial crises in this time.As we know how uncertain financial times around the world happening, we need to pay attention like how Bitcoin can help us to overcome in the financial crises and tough time. It's not all about making it a trend somehow, it's a big rotate that we all need to think about and adapt to by giving it time and having knowledge, spreading knowledge about it. So, what we need to do? We have to give our time to this field to overcome our financial crises. The key is that how much we give our time to this field we learn that much about it.",

      "body": "It's not that easy to send anymore because most of the time, you're still going to convert your bitcoins to cash anyway and with more people aware of bitcoin as a means to make money, I think that taxation of bitcoin sent across borders will be an inevitable thing to happen. But you're right it's definitely a good thing compared to the alternatives. Regarding safety of funds, that still depends on how you secure it, if you're lackadaisical about your security and just store your bitcoin in an exchange like Binance or in any wallet where you don't have the keys to the wallet then you've got the most flimsiest of security in your coins.I don't think bitcoin alone would be enough to save you from a financial crisis, remember that there's going to more things happening around during a financial crisis, if you don't have a large or colossal bitcoin nest egg, then you're going to still feel the pains of financial crisis because you're going to need a job which is lacking when there's a financial crisis.",

People from venezuela, argentina, lebanon uses bitcoin to send money to their friends and families in times of financial crisis in those countries. Cross border payments is a great usecase that bitcoin has till your government figure it our and impose high taxation for such transaction. However there are many ways in which bitcoin can asist you fight financial crisis. It's not widely accepted in global market so use it in local business where banking sector is in crisis can be great idea.",

It can help alot to overcome the financial crises and notional level crises as well because each person will be giving his best at the end of the day to overcome their own crises. if i'm not wrong i can give example of Elon musk like he is running mutli-compines to diversify his portfolio. if we look at his starting point like from where he started his journey. He started from some but not really some and know he is the richest person of the world. Because he started diversification of his portfolio to run multi-business  at the same time.",

However, this feature can save btc value only if the inflation is caused by excess money printing, while other causes which lead to excess amount of money in the financial system are present in cryptocurrencies too. First of all, it's the control of money value by tycoons and global banks: they can launch and stop inflation without printing money, just by releasing some little parts of their assets. If the overall fintech system moves to limited amount of money, this type of inflation will remain possible.",

We have the example of El Salvador and the Central African Republic, where Bitcoin did not help improve the economy after its official adoption.Bitcoin is very helpful for people in getting rid of their financial crises and transferring money across borders easily because of its decentralization and unique features, but this is the same reason that makes it rejected by governments. Governments never want to make money available in a decentralized way so that it can be obtained easily and can be transferred across borders easily. simply... They want everything under their control so Bitcoin is not useful to them.",

If you diversify your capital into altcoins which have different categories with different risk levels, you are making bad choice.Altcoins can have big growths but are you sure what you pick for diversification will help you get profit or it will die like thousand of altcoins in history. If projects you invest in die, your portfolio diversification is bad.Quote if i'm not wrong i can give example of Elon musk like he is running mutli-compines to diversify his portfolio. if we look at his starting point like from where he started his journey. He started from some but not really some and know he is the richest person of the world. Because he started diversification of his portfolio to run multi-business  at the same time. I don't think he does it to diversify his wealth. He works like a workaholic man and want to achieve big things for his ambitious targets. He is rich but I think at his level, he minds more about what he can contribute to the world, human civilization rather than trying to get richer.",

Bitcoin's history is very short and it was born when the 2008 crisis began to recover, with 0 rates. It has not experienced a major crisis since then and in those that have occurred, such as the COVID and inflation with rising rates, it has reacted poorly. So, I am not so sure that if we get into a crisis like 2008 or the crash of 29, Bitcoin will go up while everything else goes down. What I do believe is that if, as a consequence of the crisis, rates are lowered, when the Bitcoin starts to recover, it will probably be the asset that will rise the strongest.",
