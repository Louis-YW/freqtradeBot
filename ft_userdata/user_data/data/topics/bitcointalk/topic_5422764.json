I haven't watched the entire interview, just some short cuts of it, but it seems she's just saying Bitcoin is here to stay and will even grow much bigger in the years to come. Although, she says , there will be institutions who would take a step back and reassess, relearn, and reevaluate things, that's basically bullish on Bitcoin as it would mean getting to know Bitcoin more and be more comfortable with it. And, as OgNasty said, that's probably what she really needs to say right now.But that's what everyone should be saying right now if only to counter the media narrative which seems to suggest that Bitcoin is falling. Indeed, Bitcoin is being adversely affected by what's been happening in the crypto industry recently, but lest everybody forgets, FTX is not Bitcoin. Gemini, BlockFI, Voyager, Crypto.com, Binance, Coinbase, and so on are not Bitcoin. They all may fall one after the other but it doesn't actually affect Bitcoin itself.",

I think its very possible mate, 8 years from now bitcoin will be really scarce ,creating cbdc by many countries cannot affect the bitcoin price since bitcoin is more decentralized above them all. Many people still want to hold a more secured currency compared to cbdc where it can be possibly subject to manipulation by every country so not trustworthy at all.",

      "body": "I used to think that ($1m by 2030) but I think Bitcoin will grow a bit more slowly than I had expected. There are lots of bad optics around bitcoin due to misinformation and just general lack of education on Bitcoin and Crypto, including how they are completely different.I think that education will take a long time to spread and that'll slow Bitcoin's growth.I now think Bitcoin will reach $1 million maaaaaybe in the 2032/33 bull run but more likely in the 2036/37 bull run, when I think it could hit more like $1.5 million.I think we'll probably only see in the $400,000's by the end of this decade.I'm projecting (read: guessing) the next four bull runs through 2037 to be something like $150k-$200k, $400k-$500k, $800k-$1m, >$1.5m.To hit $1m in the 2029 several things would need to happen.- Large corporations would have to totally come on board and decide to hold some of their cash on hand in Bitcoin. This started in 2020 but didn't spread terribly far yet. Probably a few smaller governments decide to hold some assets in Bitcoin, like say selling some Gold to pick up some Bitcoin.- The environmental opposition to PoW needs to be settled which means educating the masses and especially politicians on why PoW is good and how it helps out society and is not a danger to the environment and rather than preventing movement to clean energy it actually helps move the world to clean energy.- LN needs to develop further and fix any major current issues so that it is ready for the average Bitcoin owner to use it.- Amazon and other major retailers need to start taking Bitcoin on-chain and over LN.- People need to get educated about what makes Bitcoin unique and why it isn't anything like any other crypto.- But most of all the uninformed take by the masses that Bitcoin is some scammy risky thing that people lose money on needs to change. I don't know how that changes. I mean I once showed a coworker a few years ago the long term Bitcoin chart and how it just keeps going up and even after that, sometime later, he said all Bitcoin does is go down. I was incredulous haha. The fear center in the brain overrides the logic center so easily. As long as Bitcoin continues to have major crashes after bull markets it won't matter how many stories there are about people building long term wealth with Bitcoin and it won't matter that Bitcoin keeps going significantly higher each bull market because the only thing the outsider observer remembers are the crashes. So for Bitcoin to hit $1m in 2029 I think the 2026 bear market period would need to be much gentler than in previous cycles so that people don't spend 12-18 months hearing in the media about how bad Bitcoin is doing and seeing constant claims that it is finally over and will go to zero.",

She's hoping for roaring 20's because of the geopolitics happening today so she bets her bottom Bitcoin and kept buying coinbase.",

      "body": "Regardless of who said this and why, the $1 million price is still easily achievable even though it may not look like it when we are in a crash/dip. One thing we've learned from the past is that bitcoin is the only stand alone market in the world but it still is affected by major global economic events. For example right now the Western economy is in ruins, the more they try to increase the interest rate the more they are trying to keep it alive artificially. But they've already increase it 5 times an the effects of it are starting to fade away without them being able to decrease the energy price (eg. oil and gas) so now they are facing both inflation and recession.The point is that as soon as this game with interest rates stop and the economic crash completes naturally, we can start seeing the bitcoin price go back up again and this time due to the fiat like dollar tanking hard, the bitcoin price would go a lot higher than what we'd expected and a price like $1 million would be nothing by then since $ is not worth what it used to any more..",

But I don't think bitcoin necessarily controls its own destiny in regards to it's price. Competition from other alternatives are outside of bitcoin's control. Government digital money being one of them. those things haven't even gotten going yet at least not in the usa but if they ever do then that's another thing for bitcoin to have to overcome. people value convenience and bitcoin is not so convenient for actually using it to buy things. you can't even use it on ebay.  another thing is, i want my purchasing power to be stable, i don't want it fluctuating in us dollar value.",

The crypto community itself is far from perfect, with all the crypto scams, token/shitcoin/NFT scams, all the greedy, naive people, who are searching for the next big thing, pump&dump scams etc.I would say that a 100K USD Bitcoin price is really achievable by 2030 and this would be great.
