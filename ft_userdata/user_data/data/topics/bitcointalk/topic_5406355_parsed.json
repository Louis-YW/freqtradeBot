It's better if you are investing your money in gold for the to make it stable. How come you didn't even aware if the volatile market like altcoins are very profitable if you can manage it so well. Altcoins have been dumping to the bottom. You can only speculate once it recover and it can give you huge return. The risk is also very high as well as the profit.

Good or bad idea. I would like to call that not an easy task to be done by someone new in the crypto. Old altcoins have big mcap while the new altcoins have low marketcap and the chance to growth for the new altcoins are still big.",

If the project is really good and has potential, then youll take advantage of being the early bird investor on that. But there are lots of projects that didnt survive because there is no product and use cases, even they got a new project they still failed to deliver and ending up losing investors fund.But you cant go wrong on old projects that are just experiencing a mild bear scheme since we are on the consolidation phase. Still worth to invest if you find its price more appealing now.",

I think the problem raised here is not clear enough to give specific advice. Because I see in this market there are many things like the OP asked the problem and vice versa, new or old projects are not how I search but based on criteria such as the ability they solve to find opportunities. festival. And going deeper, you will look at the market potential that the product brings, and of course, the factors surrounding the fundamental analysis of the project cannot be omitted, as well as looking at the market condition. How it worked, whether ongoing issues could provide opportunities for participants. So, always look at problems from different perspectives, both positive and negative, and balance the benefits and risks that they create.",

New projects bring gigantic profits but old projects bring Profits but not as hugh as new projects because the old ones have already hits their target and they later dump inother to recover back.

I think it's a very bad idea because the new altcoin of the new project is a product that really needs more marketing and also promotion to become famous so the potential for profit is very little when compared to the old altcoins that already have value in the market. Just imagine with the current conditions when creating a new product to be known by many people, of course it is very difficult, right? So it's better for you to just choose an old altcoin that already has value such as ETH, BNB, and also others that are clearly good.",

That is not a better idea, because while it may work and you may make a very large profit when the market recovers, the risk is very high because you don't know anything about the project, and many people have not heard of it for reputation reasons. It is better to invest in an already known project that has a price drop due to the bear market, as there is a good chance of recovering after the bear market ends.",

It is both right and wrong, which is both good and bad. I see that the project is also new here. It is not the criterion by which we make judgments. In the small aspect that we talk about trending projects, they will increasingly lose viability. in the market. We've all seen that the majority of projects in the crypto space are underperforming, and the index is less likely to demonstrate capabilities as well as drag the market into action. So, by finding a project according to some specific criteria of profitability, we will know whether the project itself is good or bad or if our skills are bad or good in this market.",

Of course since they are cheap, you can get 10x or higher with altcoins. Problem is which altcoin? as most of them are just meme or shitcoin so it's really hard to pick which one, it's like looking a needle in a haystack. And I would say that you have some element of luck too to be able to invest early on this good and solid altcoins and then make money out of it, in the future. So yeah it could be true, but it's not that easy. So for me the best thing is to just invest of solid altcoins in the top 10 and then wait for the next bull run in 2024-2025.",

That's not necessarily because there is no guarantee that the new project can provide better returns than the old project.If you can figure out which new projects might explode upon release, you'll make a big profit, but if you don't, you'll run the risk of holding on for longer.Investing in any project will have risks, depending on how you can control them.Only use the money you can afford to lose if you want to invest.That's what you have to remember.",

It was you who could decide but to tell you that the majority of these new projects can't be trusted. Though I few of them are legit but can't say they are sustainable and reliable projects for long-term investment as many of them are just about to die after the accumulation and hype. I don't want you to believe and be fooled by those sweet promises as they are likely scams.  Research is vital but I suggest you take a look at old projects rather than these new things.",
