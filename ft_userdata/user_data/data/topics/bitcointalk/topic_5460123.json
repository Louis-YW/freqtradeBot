Knowing that he is from the USA, that will even be more strict AFAIK.He already used PayPal and in order to open an account on it, an ID and selfie or KYC in short might be required, so he shouldn't be scared anymore to do another KYC if in case it will be asked again. But I see that the reason why they don't want it is because they want to avoid being taxed. It's not a good idea to evade it. It's illegal. So it's better to just comply with the law.Your suggestion there is still great if in case he want to continue. There might be P2P sites who accept this kind of deal and then there is also a section in our forum for these matters. The OP can hire an escrow if he ain't dealing with the respected members of the forum.",

Furthermore, let's say the friend has sucessfully bought the BTC's, for what purpose are they giving it to you? if it's a gift, it should also be tax-free. If they're exchanging something like an item for the BTC's, that could be a taxable situation.",

If you want to ensure the fund's security and feel safer with the centralized platform than bro there are some top-tier exchanges offering the Paypal transaction to buy crypto but few of them may offer without KYC trade, still, I would like to prefer the P2P trade.P2P = Local coin swap.Centralized= Bitflyer, CEX.IOFor the tax, I am not sure what are you talking about.",

Because he might even have problem moving his funds there to another one. I think one is to have that money from his PayPal moved to his bank account and withdraw that from there and look for an OTC market and have that funds deposited on your wallet.Another option is after withdrawing money from his PayPal -> bank account is to look for people that's willing to do a P2P deal.",
