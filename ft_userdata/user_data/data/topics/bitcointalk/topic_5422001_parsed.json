It's non-custodial and give you full control over your fund. It's also open-source and we can be sure that there's nothing hidden going on behind the scene. Before sending any fund to your wallet, make sure that you have download electrum from its official website and verify your download. Also, keep you seed phrase offline in a secure place, so you can recover your wallet in the future.",

It would be preferable if you could purchase Ledger, though I don't believe you should do so right now considering your Bitcoin balance. Simply protect your device from attackers, regardless of the wallet you use. I've been using Electrum for a while now, and it's the best non-custodial wallet apps I've found so far. I've recently started using Ledger to secure my funds. So keep this in mind for the future.",

Since you are just starting out, those wallets are good enough, but the best wallets is hardware wallet because they are offline when not connected, but I don't think you can afford this type of wallet right now, so just stick with Electrum or mycelium, which ever is more interesting to you. Quote from: DaNNy001 on November 17, 2022, 05:37:25 PMOne thing I discovered from the exchange platform is that the buying price is higher than the selling price.This is the norm, buying price is always higher than selling price, to me, this is one way to discourage people from buying and selling off immediately, as one can not do this without incurring some loss, though the main reason for this is in the buying and selling orders placed by traders, those are buying are placing orders at a lower price while those selling are placing orders at higher price, this the major reason why you sell at a bit lower price if you sell immediately after you bought.",

This is a proven and reliable wallet that the BTC-community has been using for a very long time. The only thing I would recommend to you when using this is to install Electrum on a separate PC or a separate OS and use the PC or OS only to run this application. This will keep your wallet safe from being infected by malicious applications, or at least reduce the likelihood of it.The thing you found is a common occurrence in any market for any product. Whatever asset you choose, even in traditional financial markets, there will always be a difference between the purchase price and the sale price. Moreover, different sellers will have different prices.",

So all you need to do is just copy your Bitcoin wallt address from Electrum wallet,  log in to your Binance app, paste the address, then send the Bitcoin while you ensuring you send above the minimum amount.
