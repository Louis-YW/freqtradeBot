Price action or pattern recognition is the same everywhere and applies to any asset class for trading in the same way, the principle is the same. Only the psychology and behaviour of different asset classes vary, which is why some might not be as thrilling in results as expected but that will not change the principle of the usage of the price action and the application on the trading chart. This also applies to altcoins and all charted markets.What I can say in addition is that anyone who wants to use price action should endeavour to know it well and use it on the higher charts for a better outcome, and also add other trend trading strategies or a breakout strategy to it, so that it can better confirm the condition in case you are trading a noisy market.",

The market whales, manipulators know about patterns too, maybe understand about patterns more than newbie and amateur traders so they will direct tumhe chart to their favorite patterns. At the end, they boost the market to an opposite direction than it should move according to patterns.",

      "body": "Their names do not really matter, it is important for people to learn the meaning behind the name. If you look at a name you get nothing, it's just a name and means nothing without you explaining what it is. But, if you talk about what head and shoulders is, then people know what it is. I haven't seen it there but maybe I missed it and even if not that's alright it's not a great one anyway.All in all I would expect people to be a bit more careful regarding this and I think it's going to matter a lot when the time comes. Surely we are going to end up becoming a lot better and that means we are going to be doing some stuff that will change things in the end. However, we can't really make sure it can change a lot, it's going to be a tough situation.",

This also applies to altcoins and all charted markets.Can you explain more and what do you mean by \"not as exciting in the results as expected\"? Tracking patterns alone without taking trading volumes into account will lead to the failure of the strategy, and the volatility of Bitcoin is far from following a specific pattern on the short level, and perhaps it is only a confirmatory indicator.Quote from: Franctoshi on August 01, 2023, 08:57:19 PM Trading chart pattern at a major support and resistance can change one's entire trading life, especially the reversal patterns double top and double bottom plus H&S pattern. If you can explain with some examples, that would be valuable. I wish to add examples from bitcoin trading and not from forex or stock markets.",

This pattern usually happening on shitcoins that do rug pull. Am sure only the professional traders would even use such cup and handle pattern to initiate trade, because a movement that doesn't show sharp rise or fall for me, is one that should be waited out before considering trading unless I choose to ignore and just trade at the moment. Am not of the idea that trading should and must be done after consulting the price patterns on a given day. Instead, am more atuned to make potential traders sharpen up their skills by adding the knowledge of studying price patterns to make a conclusive analysis for educational purposes, for future trade investment or in an advice scenario.",
