This requires a deep understanding of our own values, priorities and goals, as well as a willingness to take calculated risks and pursue new opportunities.In terms of and potential, some may argue satisfaction that investing in cryptocurrency provides an opportunity for financial growth and reaching one's potential. For example, if investing in cryptocurrency it is important to approach it with a balanced perspective, avoiding greed and management while still focusing on long-term goals and risk management strategies because we all have a \"fine line between being satisfied and living below our potential.\"Another key factor I think to avoid wasting time in business is adaptability and being willing to pivot when necessary. This means being open to feedback and being willing to make changes to strategy or approach if you are not seeing the desired results making adjustments as necessary to avoid getting stuck in a business that isn't working and moving toward success more quickly.",

How can you explain financial contentment to someone successful and what do you think it is?There is a lot a thin line between wasting time and patience. How can we know that we are not wasting our time doing a business? There’s this thing called Sunk-cost fallacy, which basically describes the act of keeping on working for a project that has long been dead, or working on something that has no hope of ever recovering, because “you’ve already put so much effort into making it work you might as well push it through in hopes that one day it will”. If one day. You find yourself doubting if what you’re doing, especially if you’ve been doing  it for quite some time with no progress or result is even worth it in the first place, then you’re probably wasting your time and it would be more productive and beneficial to quit at it than to keep up with this stupid needless work.As for being contented, you’ll feel it. Sure there’s a fine line but you know what you’re capable of, contentment isn’t necessarily sticking with what you got, but being happy with it. If you’re happy with what you have, then you’re content. If you however aren’t happy and is just putting up a façade to fool yourself that you’re contented, then you’re not!These two ideas apply to everything, most especially with business. If you’re working on something that’s not showing any form of progress or advancement even after you’ve put so much effort into doing it, then it’s sunk-cost, and if you feel like you could still do more, then you’re not content, but you’re ambitious and as long as your ideas and dreams are within the bounds of reality, you’re good in everyone’s book.",

How can you explain financial contentment to someone successful and what do you think it is?There is a lot a thin line between wasting time and patience. How can we know that we are not wasting our time doing a business?Contentment is when someone has attained a certain level of wealth without being envious of other people's wealth that surpasses theirs, yet they don't give up on still chasing possible means of expanding their wealth. Being content is not what should make someone not to do better than they are supposed to. Some people just usually give up on trying and settle for what they have so far, because it seems the higher they go, the harder it becomes for them, so they just feel reluctant, and sometimes it's also a decision they have taken not to be too wealthy but just to live a comfortable lifestyle where they can be able to meet any of their needs.I told my friend that I want to be one day announced as part of the richest men in my country, but he told me that there is no need for such wealth; he said he doesn't want much but just a comfortable life with his family. So, I think people have different desires and decisions about what they actually want in life. Apart from that, some people easily give up after they have reached a certain level. I have big dreams, even if I cannot archive all my dreams, but the worst thing is not having any dreams of what you want to archive in life. As I have said before, people really have different dreams and desires that drive them.Talking about wasting time and being patient, yes, they are two different things, of which patience is what needs to be exercised when you have already done something and are expecting it to one day pay you off so well in the end, but it has to do with something that you are so confident about that truly it will pay off, otherwise it will really be a wast of time. For example, a user asked in this forum how he could make $50 every week, and one of the reputable legendary members asked him to do good posts so he could rank up so fast and begin to do a signature campaign. That was good advice, but if the guy had an idea about the advice he received, that would have been counted as hope for him if he truly believed he could work hard to do quality posts and rank up, but if he was not confident enough that he would be able to do such and decided to reluctantly try his luck, it could be seen as a waste of time.Wasting time may also be accounted for by someone who is not even doing anything at all but rather just depending on someone who has promised to help them. Just my opinion.",

Many people experience similar difficulties when faced with the prospect of stepping into foreign territory, even if it has the potential for growth and advancement. The fear of the unknown, the comfort of the familiar, and the inertia that comes with routine can all contribute to the difficulty of change. People tend to gravitate towards what feels safe and predictable, even if that means missing out on new opportunities. So consciously challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone, and you will open the door to new possibilities and experiences that can enrich your life and career.",

It isn't easy to become a physician and there's also money practicing it, and she just set it aside. But she's said to be happy and contented. Who are we to say she's wrong?I guess we simply can't assign monetary value to everything. I, too, am a university graduate. I almost finished all my academic units in my masters.

My experience is the opposite. People who are content with what they have do better financially, because they don't try to get into risky investments, they don't buy stupid stuff to impress the neighbor and things like that.Not everyone would like to become a billionaire and buy an island, especially when it requires effort. Normally if you are doing well financially, you will do even better if you are satisfied with your life and your wealth is a complement than if you take wealth as an end in itself, always aspiring to be richer and richer no matter what you have to give up to get there.",

How can we know that we are not wasting our time doing a business?There is also a subtle difference between expecting a lot and being greedy. I think, people who start a business must believe that \"effort will never betray you\" so that their patience waiting for a worthy and reasonable result will not break. Conversely, greed can make you give up in the middle of the journey and too quickly conclude that \"life isn't fair\" because you compare it to the success of other people who are better with the same effort.In my belief there is a wise saying, \"you can imitate the efforts of others, but maybe not with the results either\".",

For example, when you take calculated risk, you're been patience because you have already calculated the possibilities of your investment and 90% sure of it been successful but when you just take risk without it been calculated then you're just wasting your time.When doing a business, you should be able to know the difference  between things that are just wasting your time and things that need you to be patient to get results.

How can you explain financial contentment to someone successful and what do you think it is?IMO, being contented and living below your potential goes along with each other. Because when you're contented, that simply means you don't want to step up your game a few more steps from where you're at currently. There's always a room for improvement because life is a continuous learning. Therefore, I can say these 2 comes along together and the reason why some people are like this, is because they are afraid to take the risk, afraid of failure, and afraid of responsibilities. So, they're trying to keep up the pace where they're comfortable at.Quote from: Stepstowealth on May 12, 2023, 04:57:52 PMThere is a lot a thin line between wasting time and patience.
