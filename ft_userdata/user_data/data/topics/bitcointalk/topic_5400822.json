  "content": "A lot of work goes into planning, researching, and writing good posts. So, I can understand why newbies get all worked up about the criticism and feedback their posts may attract. I believe that each individual has a unique way of reacting to criticism. For example, some may act defensive, offended, show appreciation or just totally ignore the criticism or feedback. Before I share my four (4) tips on how I handle criticism or feedback on Bitcointalk talk, let me echo the popular advice given to newbies in the forum. I'd quote Mr.right85 because I love how he puts it.Quote from: Mr.right85 on April 03, 2022, 09:48:01 AMBe open to criticismEvery perfect system is often one that has been tested by series of criticism and when they don't break you, they make you. In your need to be better, never expect only kind words from most persons or anyone, its the first step to disappointment and brokenness. On this, I say you should grow a thick skin like THE PHARMACIST and LOVESMAYFAMILIS would say and instead of being bittered, learn to utilise and apply them to be better.Below are my four (4) tips on how I handle criticism or feedback on Bitcointalk Forum.1) Provide a little bit of contextI try to give additional information or offer a relatable perspective when I observe that the critic or user providing the feedback has misunderstood me. 2) Research on key pointsI carry out a research on the key points raised by the critic especially when I observe that the criticism or feedback given shows that the individual has domain expertise. 3) Rewrite and ReviseIf my research proves that the points raised are valid, I either rewrite or revise the topic from top to bottom. This time, I focus on the key points. After which, I upload the file to a private folder on Google drive.4) Ignore ButtonIf I notice that the user is just trying to humiliate or embarrass me for no just reason I put them in my ignore list.How do you deal with criticism on Bitcointalk forum?",

In this forum and the outside world, one needs to build a thick skin to be able to absorb and accommodate critics build on it to become solidified in the field, and in no time those noticeable mistakes of the past become your building ground for growth and you too can become helpful to others that make similar mistakes in the future.",

It is important to clarify whether the criticism is meant to bring improvement or to cripple you. There are healthy ways to go about constructive criticism, like helping you to do better. Often times though, when people want to shut people down or hinder people, they will use the latter. Be prepared to deal with it.",

I won't hit the ignore button because a user criticizes me but I can effortlessly do that if a user becomes an annoying troll. There are users who derive joy trolling others and attempting to get under their skin. Such users, you ignore.In all, just keep being your real self and let others do their thing. Don't pander to anyone. No one can claim they're loved by all. That's not possible.",

      "body": "When people criticize, it is an actual sign you are making a step in life, because criticism can never be excluded, and thats why it's good to always learn how to react when people criticized us. And these your point seems to be a good clue for all forum members irrespective of rank. One thing i personally have noticed is that, if you do something, people will criticize, if you don't, people will still criticize, so its better to do and be criticized.The other thing is, we should all have an open mind to criticism, because what doesn't break you, makes you, just like you said. Because on this forum \"bitcointalk\", we all have a goal and vision here, so never you let the criticism of Mr. A or B break you, but rather make you to be that better person that this forum will be proud of someday.##Always agree to learn what you don't know ##Thanks",

And maybe by having a more mature view on the forum.I was criticized in many occasions by people more technical than me, just because I tried to help, but, because I was not knowledgeable enough, I failed or made mistakes.Meanwhile I've learned a lot more, I've learned from some, I've put others on ignore (it helps sometimes ) and .. \"grew up\".Now I know that everybody has the right for having an opinion, no matter how wrong that is. Now I know that different people have different standards.",

This was because I was scared of criticism. This fear was aggravated when one of my post was called a shit post by a member, I felt like abandoning the forum. Although I am still frightened about criticism but I have grown to understand that everyone have different views and perspectives about a given topic. I have learnt to accept their perspective if they are valid and make mine more comprehensive. Critics has also made me to check and recheck the source of my information before posting. One of my thread was discredited because I used a credible source that promoted propaganda. Although the topic was nice, but the critic proved that my thread was not from a reliable source. Hence, for you to be bold and face critics, ensure that your information sources are reliable.",

We must never forget that feedback, whether positive or negative, is simply a reflection of how others perceive our words. If the feedback is negative, it is for us to learn from it, adapt, and become a better speaker, writer, or communicator. This will help us learn to handle criticism more effectively. Don't let the negativity drain you of your self-confidence, let it motivate you. Remember that the goal is not to be perfect, but to be an effective communicator, that's what's important.",
