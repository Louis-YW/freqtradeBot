Buying an electric vehicle can also save you tax now days. People who make that kind of money do know various ways to save tax. If you are salaried class then income tax is taken care by the company. If you are not then you would need to file it yourselves.",

Niether have we mate.  Most of these people have a dedicated CA who works for them and manages their taxes. Going by the calculation system for such an income the New regimen would be better suited to tax, but this also depends on how much they want to show as income.Crypto tax comes in when you show the capital gains. Unless you are selling any you would not be getting into any taxation.",
