Betting for the favorites doesn't mean it will always win.There are just two faces in sports betting, win or lose, there's no maybe there. You lost, get over it, and try again another day. And if electronic games are being manipulated by a higher power then it's up to you to avoid them. Don't force yourself on betting on something you don't know and rant about it afterward. Move on, change sports, or stick to the games that you have knowledge about to enhance the winning chance.",

In-play bets may seem simple, but they are easy to lose, I hope you know that? Taking 15 in-play matches would have little likely chances to win. They only seem simple. Quote from: MainIbem on March 23, 2023, 01:18:26 PMHave you experience the manipulations over vFootball betting?There is no manipulation about it, all the matches are fixed as usual, but you have to predict who would win during each match. No manipulation because any person can choose any odd. If you have been playing virtual bet very well, some matches are even repeated, they are fixed, but in a way you can win too. On virtual matchs, the time play are not more than 30 seconds, so it can be addicting, you may first be winning, but if you continue to play, the betting site may later be favour. Gamble responsibly.",

'coz on our perspective, you're probably wiped because you chose a losing bet? Either you lose or win, these are the only outcomes, except for draw. It is impossible that you have a winning bet and still ended up losing because of what you are saying 'manipulation'. Think of the instances and review your bet, it is also possible that you made the wrong bet since you have mentioned that you had difficulties with placing your bet. Unless proven, this will just be an accusation.",

I don't think there is any strategy to win vfootball because if you place your bet a on club that you think is strong,you might end up being disappointed with the result. If you bet on the right club that is to win the game,definitely you are going to win. There is no manipulation in the matches when it has started. My cousin won big with vfootball and when I asked d him he said he has studied the clubs that if they play against each other will win the match. He also admitted that it couldn't believe that he will win but he just tried and his luck brought him the win.Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose",

Maybe you are not experienced with vfootball. In virtual betting, the odds changes.Maybe you don't know but virtual matches are determined by algorithms and random number generators so the \"manipulation\" you think you experienced is just how the system has been programmed.",

Some says that smaller leagues are the ones who are prone to manipulations so the key is to avoid them and focus only on the bigger events because they are more stricter and guarded to ensure that the game is going to be fair and fun. Betting on favorite team doesn't guarantee a win but the opposing team can sometimes win. Same thing can happen in the virtual betting.There is no problem with them but the problem is us because we think they are cheating us. Virtual betting still have their own advantages.
