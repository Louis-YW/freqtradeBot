Since these weren't mentioned here, would you be kind enough to PM me with your budget and a small outline of your expectations? It's ok if you don't want to discuss these things publicly but these details are important. I hope that makes sense.",

I must say writing is fun for me but for me to write, I must know exactly what the project is about and how best to present it. I will not be best in technical writing and presentation but outside that, feel free to PM me with details of the project and also the budget you have available.",
