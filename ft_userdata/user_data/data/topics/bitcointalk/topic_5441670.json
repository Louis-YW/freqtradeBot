Do you expect us all to know the Armenian language here by default (or is it Russian) because I did not find a switch to English or any other language on the site?I also see the Bestchange logo on your page, but I didn't find you as a partner on theirs. why did you put it on your page, is it an attempt to falsely portray trust?",

But the domain name=our company name was created in 2019 and in Armenia we are known as a trusted exchange and one of the old in our country. So by changing it we will lose our brand.And also we believe not the name does the company but the company does its name. Cryptocurrency's field is under development in Armenia. Thus there isn't much users in Armenia, but a lot of people interested in crypto and we help them to know more about blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, trading and of course help to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.",

I understand, if you're already established in Armenia, that's good to hear. With that having said, good job on what you're doing in your country for taking people on board with crypto.It's not an easy task to do and with under development, there will be a lot of eyebrows raised with what you do probably with other countrymen that don't like crypto.Needless to say, good luck with all the process and development and I hope someday to see Armenia together with your exchange becomes world renowned.",
