  "content": "Metaverse is no longer just about playing games or interacting with friends in virtual reality. People are now actually buying lands, building homes and living in the metaverse. And while doing so, they are taking up their hobbies with them.As golf happens to be one of the major sports in the world, its presence in the virtual space was sort of mandatory. That’s why we have Metashank — a virtual universe dedicated to the game of golf.In a post-pandemic world, people have become inclined more towards technology and are using it for everything from staying connected with friends to playing games online and trading digital currencies.So, virtual golf has to be a part of their online lives. And what could be a better technology than blockchain to make it happen.Blockchain, and other advanced technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence, have made it possible for developers to create a virtual universe, generally called a metaverse, which is kind of a digital replica of our own world.You can practically have everything in the metaverse that you have in the real world. This includes a virtual golf course to watch, play and enjoy the game without the need to ever step out of your home.A Virtual World with Golf CoursesSports have changed a great deal over the years. Now, many sports that once were played only outdoors can be played and enjoyed indoors as well.Golf is one such game. To know how exactly it works, let’s take the example of Dr. Shank’s NFTs and Metashank.Dr. Shank is someone who is a hardcore fan of golf, but he had to leave the game because for some reason he couldn’t go to an actual golf course over the past couple of years.But, then came the concept of Metaverse with a chance to play golf again without the need to leave his home. So, he is now building a first-of-its-kind digital universe centred around golf.Dr. Shank’s Metaverse is all about golf. It will virtually connect many popular golf courses around the world, enabling fans to watch and enjoy major tournaments virtually and players to play in a virtual golf course from anywhere in the world.Like any other metaverse, Dr. Shank’s Metashank can be accessed using a VR headset and other similar tools. However, the participants will need to have Dr. Shank’s NFTs in order to enter the space or access golf courses and other features.What can you do in Metashank?Though Metashank is primarily focused on golf and is created to enable golf lovers to play or watch the sport from anywhere in the world, there is a lot more you can do in the metaverse.Just like our real world, Metashank will have cafes, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, and much more, where you can have quality time with your friends and/or family.Other components of Dr. Shank’s Digital WorldThe main component of Metashank is Dr. Shank’s NFTs or Eagles, which are creative images built on unique designs and with 60+ digital items.You can mint Eagles on the official website and use them to access the metaverse and play games in top golf courses around the world.Other components of Dr. Shank’s ecosystem include Shank GLOF (a virtual network of top golf courses), Shankoin (the native digital token of Dr. Shank’s Universe) and Shankers DAO.
