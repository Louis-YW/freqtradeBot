With many of its former developers leaving, and that actually hit them as investors also leave them because these hacks or outages are not doing good for any project like solana.",

Frankly, Solana had big problems even before the FTX crash, in the form of blockchain stoppages. Solana is still in beta stage, as far as I remember. With current situation there is a big chance that Solana will not die completely but will share the fate of projects like EOS, which also had pretensions for some development and competition and in the end those plans were not destined to happen. As a consequence, it never again reached the price peaks that it had before.",

But the community and it accepted on Magic eden, and even ranked up #2 under opensea back then (now there is blur.io which placed on first place NFT), i think SOL still can make it on next bull run. I love with their fast & cheap fee while doing transaction, not just like ETH which the fee is still huge enough to buy coin/token.

Let's look at the fact that cryptocurrencies other than speculative purposes cannot be applied to life, we have thousands of altcoins with thousands of paper solutions. However, there are still no projects that can be applied in practice. Stop believing those false promises, altcoins are what developers use to get our money, and we need to be more vigilant and do the same with them.",

What an optimistic attitude you have. First of all, would like to know for sure that Solana is not waiting for some hardfork or full flush of accumulated coins by big funds, and then we can already speak about recovery and conquering of former tops. The time is such that those who buy Solana at a low price, hoping for growth, may face the same surprises as LUNA buyers, who thought that the asset, which fell in price by 90%, is a profitable purchase, even if it is risky.",
