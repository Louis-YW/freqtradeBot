Most of this shitcoin are just money making projects for the devs. All we see is just copy-paste. Just read through their website's homepage and tell me you haven't seen hundreds of projects claim the same before. Where are they now?Probably hiding under the PoW protocol to do something different. A project being PoW or PoS is not enough to justify the project. As you have said, is there something new? Or are they doing old thing in a new and unique way?It is not difficult to copy an Open source code and make little or no modifications to it. You need to be care because the bull market is knocking, and many junky projects will evolve.",
