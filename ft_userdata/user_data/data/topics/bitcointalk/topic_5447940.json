  "content": "The ability to completely transform the way this world operates might get changed because of Bitcoin. I believe apart from financial security it may change today's life which is the difficulties and uncertainty of the future. Everything happening around Bitcoin now is only a building block of progress and innovation. For me, Bitcoin is my guide in the pursuit of financial freedom and supremacy.Why do I feel I am on the right path? Staying curious, staying informed, and staying optimistic are the three pillars of my success now and will be in the future too. I know my future is bright as I was one of many who liked the concept, and who dared to dream, in the end, acted on my beliefs. For me, Bitcoin has been a force to be reckoned with as it has been disrupting traditional financial systems and empowering individuals like me to take control of my wealth.Why do I think Bitcoin is unstoppable?As it is decentralized and immune to external forces. It is a more valuable asset than a bar of gold. To everyone who is seeking financial freedom and protection against ongoing inflation, Bitcoin is the best investment. As fiat has always been a shady currency.Finance is always Risky!Bitcoin privileges come with a unique set of difficulties and uncertainties, much like every innovative technology. One of the big concerns is losing everything that you have invested. It has been more than a decade and Bitcoin is still going strong. As a newbie be prepared for the ups & downs. Always do your own research and then make a decision. Ultimate Goal!My ultimate goal can be only achieved through Bitcoin. This will happen when I go to any big store and pick up anything without thinking about how much I have in my wallet. I am not someone who is looking for a Lambo. I am someone who is going after complete Financial independence.Do you believe in what I believe?",

As fiat has always been a shady currency.Bitcoin network is unstoppable yes, but Bitcoin application and acceptance isn't.  It only needs a notice of regulation from the authority to make Bitcoin transaction illegal and all the centralized exchanges and company that is involved in Bitcoin will stop its acceptance or operation.  It maybe used in an underground trades or dark market but the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin will definitely stop once the authority prohibit the transaction of Bitcoin.Bitcoin mainstream adoption is not untouchable, it is still affected by the government regulation, the only reason why Bitcoin adoption grow is because the government is being lenient to Bitcoin users.Quote from: elevates on April 07, 2023, 01:24:20 PM Ultimate Goal!My ultimate goal can be only achieved through Bitcoin.

I am someone who is going after complete Financial independence.Do you believe in what I believe?   I have my ultimate goal already, a coin that has a limited supply and that its value is increasing as people are buying it, which is the reason bitcoin price is increasing as people are demanding for it. My plan is not about making bitcoin available as a way to spend in the public, I wish fiat to remain in that position. I can be able to just convert my bitcoin to fiat and spend if I want to, while I also have the privilege to save bitcoin. I see it hard for me at times to spend my bitcoin because I know it's value will still increase, but I can be able to easily spend fiat or convert it to bitcoin.Quote from: BitDane on April 08, 2023, 07:36:14 AMWhat if Bitcoin price stagnate?  Do you still think that it will be your guide to pursuit financial freedom?Can the price of bitcoin be stagnant? No. Although I do not advice anyone to believe that bitcoin can give financial freedom, but it can give the freedom that the centralized system can not give, it gives the freedom that fiat can not give, which is the freedom for you to be able to fully control your own money by yourself and not by any central body.",

It has also promoted privacy and decentralization which has made people break loose from the manipulative power of Central banks and the government. The volatility of bitcoin is an advantage and also a disadvantage so it is advisable to take and embrace it.I also share your idea of not wishing to be stupendously rich. The reason for the suffering and poverty in the world is greed. People want to acquire much wealth to spend on pleasure which are just temporal that is why they want to invest in products that promise huge profit in the short term and they end up being scammed. With Bitcoin, you have a reliable investment but you need patience and foresight.",

I invest in Bitcoin because I have faith and trust that this will give me benefits and rewards someday and fortunately, it gives me more than what I think. People see the potentiality of Bitcoin and that is why they invest despite the risk. But don't get too dependent on this stuff, we can somehow become financially stable without Bitcoin as well. And talking about adoption OP, it can take time (years) before we reach that level. Accepting Bitcoin is still on way far from getting the #1 payment option as only a few stores are accepting this across the globe.",

So as some who seeks and truly desire to have and preserve my wealth for years to come, bitcoin is a viable investment option. Following the OP's argument, another upside for me that has strengthen my belief in bitcoin is that we are now seeing an increasing number of adoption as a legitimate asset class. It only means one thing, its value and stability will over time keep  increasing, there serving as a potential pathway to financial independence for those who embrace it.",

There's a reason we're also very optimistic about bitcoin and its security right now even it's always been linked against traditional money but I'm not sure it will outperform but then again I believe bitcoin for some obvious reason is decentralized and financially free, a little bit not believe in the bank because this is always a concern that the bank can go bankrupt.More secure devices are hardware wallets, exchanges don't fully trust or put any money there.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on April 08, 2023, 08:46:08 AMYou mean total adoption?
