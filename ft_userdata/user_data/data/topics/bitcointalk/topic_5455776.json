What can we do or should do, or not do as Bitcoin supporters at this time?Isn't it an old adage though? even if there is no Binance/Coinbase vs SEC, we shouldn't put our money on exchanges as that is a bad practice. It's just more magnify now as there is a case that is being brought to exchanges.Regarding your question on what we should do, the best thing is still to accumulate at this price range, still very cheap and discounted price. Doesn't mean to buy 1 BTC right away. Just do whatever suits you, DCA or just buy when you have capital with you. The end game is still to save and stack sats as much as you can before the block halving next year as it will be the catalyst for the next bull run, regardless if there will be another exchanges that will file bankruptcy or another witch hunt from SEC.",

People  shouldn't have kept their coins on the exchanges in the first place. \"Not your keys, not your coins.\" What you gonna do if somehow binance goes \"poof\" tomorrow without any explanation of what happened? What if they say \"the SEC came by and took all (y)our coins.\" Even if you somehow manage to get back your coins from them, who knows how long you will wait for that. Keeping your life savings on a crypto exchange is a huge gamble and if something goes wrong you will pay for your mistake. It happened many times before and it will happen again in the future.",

Despite this apparent attack, Bitcoin's price remains fairly stable. It is having no effect. But then, do we just sit back and do nothing aside from saying to avoid centralized exchanges? What can we do or should do, or not do as Bitcoin supporters at this time?We can do only one thing and that is to lay down and relax. We can't do anything against the Sec and even if someone dares to do anything then the result is already known to many of us. Now, we can only sit on our chairs and speculate the situation by reading news article related to those exchanges. We should always monitor the price of Bitcoin in such situations and be happy if see a good pump. We should wait for dumps and the dumps should not impact us emotionally because they are expected and could occur anytime in such harsh situations.I also recommend you to withdraw your money from Binance US if you have any assets in that website and you should do the same with Coinbase. In current situations the best thing to do is to withdraw the money into your own wallets and wait for the results of the Sec actions. I'm quite sure that Binance will shut its operations due to Sec's strict actions against them and the result could be dump in the market and maybe the assets on the US version of Binance get frozen in such situations. There is a saying that \"Prevention is better than cure,\" and in current conditions one should withdraw his/her assets from those exchanges to prevent further damages to ones assets.",

And when you are free, you start asking questions and question authority. That's not what they want.Keep your bitcoin to yourself, use P2P modes of trading if you can, or try out decentralized variants. If you must use a CEX, go in and out.

I've been saying it for years that I don't trust Binance and CZ and I don't trust tether, bnb and all the rest of these unnecessary tokens that only confuse the average user into thinking they're all the same. That they're all \"crypto\" and it doesn't matter what you get, you should get a number of these shitcoins so you don't have all your eggs in one basket. The deal with CZ is that he was trading on his own exchange and manipulating the markets and he wasn't sharing any data with any auditors. It was all \"safu\" and all fine and dandy until he was making money. CZ doesn't care about bitcoin, he just wants his listing fees and he likes making $$$. Crypto is just a horse he wants to keep riding until it dies and then there's going to be another horse and another. Should we do something? Clap maybe that shitcoin peddlers are running out of time?

Aside regular warning of treating centralized exchanges as a market place like it’s supposed to be, we should also create awareness to less knowledgeable people that this doesn’t pose any threat to bitcoin holdings and as such they shouldn’t sell. Also the best thing now is to prioritize using decentralized exchanges as such the liquidity we continue to say that this decentralized exchanges lack will grow if the number of users increase and this will also reduce the dependence on centralized exchanges",
