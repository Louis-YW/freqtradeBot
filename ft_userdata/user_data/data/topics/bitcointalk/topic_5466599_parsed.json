He was very actively to upgrade that application but unfortunately, it is an abandoned project because the user was banned. As I remember he did not make any appeal for his ban.I really believe a user like this should be given a second chance than many cases recent months broke rules but were not banned at all. It looks like the user still tried to see whether his account got a second chance as last active day is in March 2023. I believed he left the forum after the ban but today, it seems he is still around.",

      "body": "Hey, I have created an open source extension based on TryNinja's script that is working perfectly on Chrome browser. The source is completely open and anyone can use it without any issue. I could keep that thing closed source but that would not be helpful for anyone. Here's the link of the source code of the extension: https://file.io/d9uQUNNZVwg5In order to install the extension, first you need to unzip the files in a folder and then enable developer mode in the extension, and after that click on Load unpacked and then select the folder of the extension, and it will be automatically installed. Further if you want to make it from the source code then create a file and name it as contents.js and paste the following code in that file:Code:// content.jstry {  document.getElementById(\"smfheader\").style.display = \"none\";  document.getElementById(\"hellomember\").style.display = \"none\";  const avatars = document.querySelectorAll(\".avatar\");  avatars.forEach((avatar) => {    avatar.style.display = \"none\";  });} catch (error) {  console.error(\"An error occurred:\", error);}And then you will need to create another file and name it as manifest.json and paste the following code:Code: {  \"manifest_version\": 3,  \"name\": \"Hide BitcoinTalk Username and Avatar\",  \"version\": \"1.0\",  \"description\": \"A Chrome extension to hide BitcoinTalk username and avatar\",  \"permissions\": [    \"activeTab\"  ],  \"content_scripts\": [    {      \"matches\": [\"*://bitcointalk.org/*\"],      \"js\": [\"content.js\"]    }  ],  \"action\": {    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\"  }}Once done save those into a folder and load it using the method mentioned above. I hope this will be helpful for the members of the forum. Remember it's based on TryNinja's script so all the credit goes to him!",

This would prevent your friend from being able to read the text after the avatar and signature have been hidden. This would work wonders on a TN panel, but not so much on VA and IPS panels.- IMO, the privacy screen/filter that LoyceV mentioned \"here\" is a better alternative solution... You can even detach some of them easily and transfer it to other monitors [the only downside is that most of them are made for smaller screens (21 to 27 inches) that have 16:9 aspect ratio].",
