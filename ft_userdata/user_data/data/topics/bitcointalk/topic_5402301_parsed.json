  "content": "The Railgun project (RAIL token) (https://twitter.com/railgun_project) just did a soft launch release of their wallet application called \"RAILWAY\", it allows you to make fully shielded transactions on Ethereum. There is still a fair bit of testing to do so be careful. I have used it myself with no issues so far and its really coolâ€¦ This could be game changer for DeFi. We now have the ability to shield ANY ERC-20 token on layer 1. Unlike competitors such as Tornado Cash that have high gas fees and require the user to deposit in set amounts, Railgun is cheaper and allows users to shield any amount of coin they would like.They will be integrating with Matcha in the coming months, and have much more planned. Here is their current roadmap:https://imgur.com/a/krFPnvNYou can play around with the app here:https://app.railway.xyz/They are also live on Polygon, ( this is what I am using the most ) - https://t.me/RailgunprojectOfficial RAILWAY wallet related chat: https://t.me/railwaywallet",
