This innovative digital asset has been created by amalgamating the most advantageous features of both Bitcoin and Litecoin, with the primary objective of introducing a new perspective on decentralized finance and redefining the concept of true freedom within the cryptocurrency realm.By leveraging the strengths of Bitcoin's security and decentralization, TFC ensures a robust and trustless environment for its users. Furthermore, it draws from Litecoin's fast transaction confirmation times and lower fees, making it more efficient for everyday use. This combination results in a cryptocurrency that aspires to deliver the best of both worlds, offering a secure and efficient means of transferring value and wealth.True Freedom Coin aims to provide a platform where users can enjoy financial sovereignty and independence. It envisions a future where individuals have greater control over their assets, free from the constraints of traditional financial institutions. TFC's unique blend of attributes represents a step forward in the evolution of cryptocurrencies, offering a compelling alternative for those seeking to achieve true financial freedom through blockchain technology.The purpose of this press release is to inform the public, adopters, and the broader crypto community about the significant strides that True Freedom Coin is making in the crypto space. We aim to shed light on our core objectives, achievements, and the positive impact we anticipate on the cryptocurrency industry.Our fundamental purpose is to empower individuals worldwide by providing access to a financial system that is transparent, secure, and truly decentralized. We believe that financial freedom is a universal right, and cryptocurrency is a key enabler of this freedom. By adopting True Freedom Coin you are also championing human rights like privacy, free speech, the right to own property etc. WHAT IS TRUE FREEDOM COIN? https://ugetube.com/watch/tfc-explained_EYi2XhNOHijGKoM.htmlhttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/thread/2/true-freedom-coinTrue Freedom Coin (TFC) is a unique cryptocurrency that emerges as a fork of both Bitcoin and Litecoin, two prominent digital currencies in the cryptocurrency market. TFC is designed to present a novel perspective on decentralized finance and redefine the concept of achieving true financial freedom through the use of cryptocurrency.What makes True Freedom Coin distinct is its amalgamation of the best features from Bitcoin and Litecoin. Like Bitcoin, TFC operates on a secure and decentralized blockchain, ensuring trust and transparency through a consensus algorithm for validating transactions. This familiar aspect provides users with the same level of security they experience with Bitcoin.A FAIR LAUNCHTrue Freedom Coin had a fair launch with no premine, ensuring equal and unbiased distribution of its cryptocurrency. This means that at the project's inception, no coins were allocated or reserved for developers, founders, or any specific individuals or entities. Instead, all coins were made available to the public through a transparent and equitable process, such as mining, where anyone interested in acquiring the cryptocurrency had an equal opportunity to participate. This fair launch approach is designed to promote decentralization and prevent any single group from having undue control or influence over the coin's supply and ecosystem.The Real CURRENCY OF TFChttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/thread/5/true-currency-freedom-coin-truthJust as Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has its smallest unit called a \"satoshi,\" which represents the tiniest fraction of a Bitcoin, True Freedom Coin (TFC) also introduces its equivalent unit of currency, known as the \"Truth.\" In the realm of TFC, the currency is structured similarly to Bitcoin, with 100 million Truths constituting a single Freedom Coin. This means that, like Bitcoin, TFC can be divided into smaller units to facilitate microtransactions and offer greater flexibility in managing the cryptocurrency. DECENTRALIZATIONWhat makes TFC Truly decentralized is the way the community is set up:https://ugetube.com/watch/why-doesn-039-t-tfc-have-a-offical-website_77Ch9U3U4hBICEW.htmlhttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/thread/72/why-tfc-official-websitehttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/board/15/tfc-site-listTrueFreedomCoin has deliberately chosen not to create an official website in order to prevent any central authority from exerting influence or control over the project. Instead, they encourage users to directly engage with the community. This approach fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among participants by giving them a voice in the project's development and direction.To facilitate open discussions and collaboration, TrueFreedomCoin utilizes various communication channels, including forums, social media groups, and decentralized applications. These platforms enable users to interact, share ideas, and contribute to the project's growth.Furthermore, the commitment to community ownership goes beyond the absence of a website. Decision-making, development upgrades, and improvements are all subject to community consensus, ensuring a transparent and democratic process. This inclusive approach guarantees that every member has a say in shaping the project's future, making it truly community-driven.Decentralization through mining: https://ugetube.com/watch/tfc-is-decentralized_7LYgHi31EuYcOAA.htmlhttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/thread/103/true-freedom-coin-miner-controlDecentralization is a fundamental tenet of cryptocurrencies, exemplified by Bitcoin and True Freedom Coin. It ensures that the authority to oversee and authenticate transactions is not concentrated within a singular entity or governing body but is instead dispersed across a network of miners. This dispersion of power serves as a safeguard against censorship, fraud, and vulnerabilities associated with a single point of control, thereby fostering trust, security, and autonomy within the digital financial realm.TFC WANTS ADOPTERS, NOT INVESTORShttps://ugetube.com/watch/should-i-invest-in-tfc_q7nLPOJWxDdvZdD.htmlhttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/thread/4/invest-tfcTrue Freedom Coin (TFC) distinguishes itself as a cryptocurrency that operates on a decentralized blockchain network, with a primary focus on advocating financial freedom, privacy, and security in the digital era. It differs significantly from traditional investment assets in several important ways.    Not an Investment Fund or Scheme: TFC should not be viewed as an investment fund or scheme. Unlike investment assets that may promise returns or profits, TFC doesn't have a centralized entity managing funds or making promises to investors. It isn't structured to generate returns based on the efforts of others.    Freedom from Manipulation: TFC cannot be artificially manipulated or pumped by fiat money. Unlike traditional financial assets that can be influenced by monetary policies or central authorities, TFC's value is determined by the principles of supply and demand. This means that its worth is dictated by market forces and user participation, fostering a degree of immunity from external manipulation.    Decentralized Nature: TFC operates on a decentralized blockchain network. This means that it isn't controlled by a single entity or government. Instead, it relies on a distributed ledger system maintained by a network of users, ensuring transparency and security through decentralized consensus mechanisms.    Value Derived from Supply and Demand: TFC's value is akin to other commodities like gold. Its price is determined by the basic economic forces of supply and demand. If more people desire TFC and are willing to buy it, its value may increase, and conversely, if there is less demand, its value may decrease. This market-driven valuation separates TFC from traditional assets with intrinsic value, such as stocks or bonds.WHY DOES TFC HAVE SUCH HIGH MONETARY VALUE?https://ugetube.com/watch/what-gives-tfc-monetary-value_9ggRshubCZcwBH1.htmlHOW TO EXCHANGE YOUR TFC:https://ugetube.com/watch/tfc-p2p-exchange-tutorial_pUoXCNoeLIPJ5cX.htmlhttps://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/board/8/tfc-p2p-decentralized-exchangehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0USE CASES AND APPLICATIONSEcosystem and Economy:https://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/board/3/true-freedom-coin-economyTrue Freedom Coin is a cryptocurrency that has established a robust and dynamic economy, enabling individuals and businesses to engage in a variety of economic activities.

      "body": "@CryptoSDesignerThank you for your comment. Although True Freedom Coin holds no value to you personally, this isn't the case for the people who bought it from the miners on the Blockchain's early days (genesis block was mine in June 21). http://159.223.197.86:3001/block/0990d84f7d938e6e1eac48fed88ff566a95ecb4dbd057dbbd642b367b66ad1d7Bidding for True Freedom Coin started at 0.00000010 TFC i.e. 10 Truth at $1, at the time this was roughly 17k Satoshi. If you do the math you will see that it actually checks out: http://tfccalculator.atwebpages.com/Additionally, part of True Freedom Coin's appeal is it's emphasis on P2P transactions and privacy as an alternative to going through centralized crypto exchanges. Please let me know if you need any resources for you research. @poolmz @Branden_crypto  Thanks for adding TFC to your pools and welcome to the True Freedom Coin Economy. https://truefreedomcoin.boards.net/board/17/mining-pools",

Somewhere. Gotta love the hang up in blocks, though. Pound the scrypt coin with 1Th, then turn it all off... smooth quick death of a coin.Where is this negativity and hostility coming from? True if you read the announcement you will see that TFC had a fair launch i.e. no premine. Decentralization and fairness is at the core of this project. Yes, Bitcoin had an advantage above all other crypto's because ASICS didn't exist when people were only mining from their laptops and new coins are vulnerable against this. It's not my place to say whether you have a cognitive bias or not, but killing every Alt coin that comes along just doesn't make sense in the long run and will actually hurt Bitcoin's reputation, especially on a forum like this. Alt coins are important for decentralization, and it' helps bring new people into the crypto space. There is a reason why the Bitcoin source was released on GitHub for anyone to fork. When people can launch new projects it helps with innovation and adoption of blockchain technology. Additionally, TFC was created with the mind of enabling people to acquire and adopt Bitcoin, it's a Bitcoin friendly crypto project. If you had even taken 5 minutes to read about and study the project or speak to people in the TFC economy you would know that. Instead you took one look and there a new coin, without even reading any of the information, took it upon yourself to bash the project.",
