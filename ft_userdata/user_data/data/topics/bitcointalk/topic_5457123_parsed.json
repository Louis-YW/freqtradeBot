Omo. This one done become old news nah, we dey fine fresh update, abi is this the first time you dey buy fuel for #500? Because me I don buy fuel for #700 and even #1k before during fuel scarcity for Buhari regime, so this one no be new something, because one thing I like about Nigerians, we are good at adapting to change, because for this fuel matter, me originally, I don adapt to am, because what's the need of complaining when I already know within myself say that talk no go fit boil water.

No be today this one start, na so eh don be since for we contri, the corruption dey everywhere for we society, both in schools, politics and even the church. Na only God fit help us.QuoteWould the price come down or increase the more? This one na only the NNPC or the minister of petroleum fit answer this very question, because eh get one old news I been hear some days ago if I'm not mistaken about NNPC giving only Dangote license to import & export petroleum products into we contri, (such as fuel, diesel, kerosene & e.t.c) of which we all know say him na business man, and the main aim of every business man go be to make profit, which is likely to affect fuel price upward immediately that commerce.",

Nigeria is lawless state. The first thing he the president would have done after the announcement of the fuel subsidy was the regulation of the fuel price but he allowed everyone to sell the price they want and that means he is also afraid of the fuel marketers. Upon all these crecata crecata the president dey do I never see anything from im. If anyone or a leader meant to work well for the citizens for the country, the number one thing to do is the policy to regulate all aspect of the country then things on their own would began to work well. And not to touch the politicians. The policies you make will affect every bad leader in the country.Quote from: Salahmu on June 21, 2023, 06:05:26 PMI don't really no what is wrong with this country almost all the sector are corrupt, no more human rights, police are doing the work of road safety, people are more afraid of police than any other thing on the road because they will always find a fault to extot from you, I don't really no why is like that. You dey tok of that one, no tok am sef. This one na misplacement of meritocracy. Nigerian police has forgotten their office since 1968. Fuel price might come down if the president work on it. The click on marketers are more powerful than the president im sef. But things will be ok. Now has dey come down now.",

Please let's share knowledge because I believe one of us in any way has been harase by a police officer, and also what do u really think about the fuel issue? Would the price come down or increase the more? The problem now is that the price of fuel always has an impact on everything. One thing I noticed, especially in this country, is that many people are opportunist and constantly seek out ways to exploit people. When the president mentioned it, the price had already started to shoot up, to the point where some filling stations were selling for 600 naira. The government always assumes that people will adjust, and that is what is currently happening. I notice that many people no longer drive their cars anymore instead, they take public transportation, even to get to work. Therefore, I don't believe that the price will decrease. Lets hope for implementations that will make people relax and not feel the impact.",

Before the country been get control which is the fuel subsidy but now dem dun commot am so how you want dem to get control again. Make i make you understand how this thing dey work. Before you (citizens of Nigeria) dey always by sweet (fuel) from your street (filling station) for 10 naira but you no know say your uncle (Nigeria government) been dun already dey pay half payment (subsidy) for all the shops wey dey sell sweet to you but now him dun stop to dey pay the subsidy for you to help control price. As him dun comot the subsidy so the shops dun rush dey sell 50 Naira per sweet but this price no go last for ever, as more people are been given licence to dey operate the shops (refinery and filling station) price go dey come down small small. Now the price control dey in the hands of the market and not the government anymore. To bring down the price of fuels, things like giving local refinery license to operate and repair the refinery putting it in a good shape to operate need to be done because without them they just empowered only Dangote to dominate the oil industry.",

If it is about the price of fuel to reduce, forget am, because em no the happen since the FG government don kukuma commot their hand for fuel subsidy. So any price wey we as Nigerians see from filling stations, na wetin we go buy fuel at, since na individuals and private bodies go d refine fuel for us for abroad, come give us as a country. We Nigerians should continue to be expecting and be seeing fuel increase from time to time because as I take the see am fuel go fit reach 700naira soon.

If na for this our country em don jaga-jaga beyond repair. Where do we start to fix am? Corruption don full every sector. Every sector d find whom them go chop local for them to survive the hardship wey d for the country. Even the police people don leave their suppose work, the follow Agbero around the task motorists. It is so pitiful sae police people don degrade themselves to instruments wey every given sector go remote to their bindings.

Their assets and medical care dey elsewhere. They are unconcerned or unresponsive to what the masses are going through. They and their family have everything they need to lead comfortable lives so them no d bother for the masses matter.

      "body": "First of all was their anything like subsidy, the answer for me is NO.This subsidy of a thing is pure scam, the former leadership said that they were subsidizing premium motor spirit (PMS). But thats not true, this money always goes to some sychofants that loot this money and share it among themselves. But the scam is that, this people goes to the international market and buy this commodity at a normal price and in return charge the government very higher using transportation, high cost and high dollar rate as an excuse, They do all this with the help of the bad eggs in the system that convice the government that such scam called subsidy is real and they get paid at the end of the day for this unrealistic reasons, For them to get away freely they tag it a name called subsidy. That's why the NNPC limited chairman increased the price of the premium motor spirit (PMS) immediately after the inaugural speech of the president in other to cover up this scam called subsidy. The president ought to have arrested the NNPC limited chairman immediately after such chaotic pronouncement made by him and get him probed after probing if found wanting then he should be jailed for imporverishing Nigerians and financial crimes, It is only in Nigeria that a limited liability company has the power to make such pronouncement when the president said from 01/07/2023 Government will no longer accommodate such scam in Nigerian budget, But I believe with the look of things this government will do well, let's give them benefit of doubt and watch as event unfold as weeks run down the clock, I know it is really telling on us Nigerians but the needful has to be done, we cant continue to stand and watch some elements on disguise sharing our countries wealth when somany people are swimming in abject poverty it is unacceptable.",

Because instead of sharing, they should use the money to create companies that will employ the youth.No be lie my brother, the matter tire person no be small. When president Goodluck Jonathan been remove the subsidy, na same people enter street go say dem do do occupy Nigeria and even then we see paliatives wey him bring then in buses wey try to reduce transportation cost, even then fuel na #145 but wetin we see today na #550 / #600 yet no palliative anywhere. When dem even talk about sharing money, the thing dey funny and shameful, how? Like say dem fit let money reach everyone abi na dem go still carry am enter house like dem do for COVID-19. I go dey wonder say dem no fit use BVN send money enter people account. Nigeria na the more you look the less you see.",
