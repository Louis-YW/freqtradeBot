This methods help them to increase their exposer to the market because they do not have to sell the share at the same time they made profits from that lended money.Nested leverage investing has their own risk because it significantly increases debt of a companies so if the value of the investment goes negative they might face financial problem.",

Even banks do that quite often. I believe not always, and not as a rule. Because the more logical move is to let them go from their portfolio and not cause the whole company to be at risk.

But I'm currently not anymore with that camp. I believe Bitcoin is a back up or fall back IN CASE the financial system collapses, but as a direct alternative? I believe not, although it has its own utility and reason to exist side by side with the legacy system economically, socially, politically.",

There's nothing wrong with using your own assets(the companies in your portfolio) as a collateral in order to borrow more capital. The real problem here is the lack of proper risk management.1.Getting more loans in times of growing interest rates seems financially irresponsible.2.The financial institutions, that give such loans to private equity companies should be held responsible. I guess that the banks keep acting irresponsible and keep making risky financial decisions because they are \"too big to fail\" and when \"the shit hits the fan\", the central banks will always print more money and come and save them.",

Can you quote a free copy of it or clarify the points contained in it?Companies do not only borrow to strengthen their assets, but rather buy part of their stock to maintain the strength of the company. Part of the expenses of these companies goes to advertising, buying shares, and enhancing profits, which brings more money to expand the worker base, but they are the first to be fired if a problem happen and the last to be added if gains are achieved.",

However, I think they should not cut their spending and continue investing on research and development (R &D). Reducing spending on R&D can hinder a company's ability to innovate, develop new products to remain competitive in the market and for long term growth and success of their business.",

I said it to compare banks with PE companies on how they act similarly. Being a student of business, I surely know what PE companies and and how they operate. In modern economy, it's debt based. Government prints money on debt. There are other parameters like interest rate, current and fiscal deficit, GDP etc.",

If they can sell off their stressed assets, it's good for their own survival. I mean it would also mean that they would be able to hold the strong ones a lot longer, which means that when the economy grows bigger they would be able to get a lot more. Obviously they would rather hold everything as long as possible and even get more, that's how PE companies work and that's how they make a profit, the more they hold the better, they would rather have double the size of what they have, even the stressed ones but sometimes they can't, like right now, so selling some of them would allow them to keep the others longer and they would make a profit accordingly.This allows them to keep things on their books and when they are sharing their quarterly reports they would be looking fine without a trouble.",

Private equity companies are no different than any other company, in that the managers making decisions can sometimes make the wrong decisions leading to their own demise. There is this illusion that bankers are somehow more sophisticated, and the can be over the average investor, but they can often get caught out by trends they read incorrectly (like borrowing rates staying low) or thinking that demand for a certain good/service can be squeezed ever higher without any consequences. Ultimately they're just playing a balancing game, hoping they can swoop in to take valuable assets by borrowing at one rate and hoping the company can sustain enough profits that they can take the difference in between.",
