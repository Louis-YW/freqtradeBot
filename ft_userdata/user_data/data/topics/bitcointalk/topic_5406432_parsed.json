I have no rapport with either Russia or the Ukraine. Take a look at what you have said.There only two things that make fanatic Ukrainians against Russia:1. The things that the Soviet Union did to them in the past;2. The US stimulating bad feelings against Russia.Ukraine is doing the wrong thing. Think of how Big Russia is when you include Siberia. Sure, Siberian land can be rough and tough, in the winter especially. But if Ukraine was smart, they would forget the things that the former USSR had done to them, and embrace Russia as a fellow, friendly nation... and even join Russia as an ally. Why? To get permission for the people of Ukraine to take part in the natural resources in Siberia.Ukraine is shooting itself in the foot (or, maybe the head). When you look at what is happening, Russia is standing up against the US and NATO successfully. And a whole bunch of nice, Ukrainian people are dying for what? Because they keep on holding a grudge against the non-existent USSR? Because the US told them to? Because they really think the US can win against Russian nukes?Join with Russia. Don't fight her. Forget old animosities. And pick up, in friendship, a whole bunch of the Siberian land resources.Already Putin is allowing small homesteads in Siberia, to almost anybody in the whole world who sides with Russia. If people, including Ukrainians, were to request it properly, Putin might even allow larger homesteads than he has already. And since Ukrainians are almost like brother Russians, if Ukraine gave up, look at what they would gain from big brother Russia in a few years after the memories of this war faded away.Or are Ukrainians thieves who want to conquer Russia and steal the lands they could have had free if they hadn't made war with Russia in the way they did?You won't see Russia fall easily. And long before they fall (if they do), the Ukraine will have been destroyed. Why should the Ukraine ask for their destruction like that? Stupid Ukrainian people.",
