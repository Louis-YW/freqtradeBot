  "content": "Visit darknetone<DOT>com/market/chipmixer/Replace <DOT> with \".\" (without double quotation marks)I was reading the review which came at the first page when I was searching with the keyword ChipMixer. It seems a good review. I did not pay attention to the .onion site. But when I was reading the section \"Limitations of ChipMixer\" and saw the given clear net URL with a TLD of .pro then I knew something is wrong. I went to the .pro domain and found the same ChipMixer site.Few days ago I visited real ChipMixer site and it was saying \"Due to recent events ChipMixer is available only on Tor network.\". I had that in mind engraved. I still do not know what were the recent events.It surprised me that a blog site who ranked up in google first page has put a fake article on their blog. How bad internet could be? I always thought SEO is expensive and it takes time and a lot of money to rank up a site.Shall I assume everything on that site are fake and have fishing URLs to scam visitors? I really hope I am wrong.",

How bad internet could be? I always thought SEO is expensive and it takes time and a lot of money to rank up a site.With my little knowledge of SEO, how much to pay depends on the keywords one wish to rank for and also how much useful content they put out.It's generally not that expensive and fake sites can easily get ranked up if they put enough time to it and they are in a relatively small niche.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on July 12, 2022, 07:59:08 PMShall I assume everything on that site are fake and have fishing URLs to scam visitors? I really hope I am wrong.That's a possibility. It's always safer to assume everything is s scam until proven otherwise, so if there's any evidence suggesting that, I would avoid the site altogether.",

If ChipMixer confirms then there will be no doubt in mind that everything that has put on that site, are fake.I see a lot of DarkMarket review on the site which means all of them are scam and made up reviews by him.",

      "body": "The blog darknetone is know to be unreliable. Like most of websites on the clearnet posting .onion urls because it very often leads to fake sites imitating real ones. You can check about DarkFox Market for exemple, the URL is also wrong.Most of the blogs related to bitcoin mixers have phishing URLs. And ranking them up in the Google SERPs is not as hard as you think.The thing with the mixing industry is it's a small niche with not a lot of competition. Hence, not a lot of blogs related, hence any garbage can be in the first page. You can even see hacked websites selling clothes for kids ranking in the first page of google when you search for \"bitcoin mixer xxxx\"Believe me, I crawl a lot the SERPs and spy them (including their strategies) there are a lot of shits. I got once an idea to become their nightmare and make them lose money (or rather to prevent victims from losing their money). Or at least to make a blog to be \"annoying\".People running mixers could also share about the threats they receive, it could be fun to read",
