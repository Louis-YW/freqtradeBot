And if you finally tried and you were lured with profits only to start making streams of loses just because you wanted a withdrawal, then I don't think you should continue playing but rather work and seek ways to withdraw your earnings if it ever gets possible.Most casinos are only there to scam and exploit from vunerable players who fall such cheap scams and I hope we all try to learn from the mistakes of others and be so sensitive enough to know when something isn't right . I always do alot of research as possible before dropping money into any site, and I do alot of review readings and most of my findings comes from past reviews, but  most times if the reviews are all positive for less than a year game, that also calls for an alarm, as there are possibilities of deleting the negative reviews or the reviews were manipulated",

From that, I suggest you contact the customer service to withdraw funds.",

Second is the gambler itself because some gamblers cheat to claim big rewards from the gambling sites and that's the reason why the facilitator of that sites hold or block your account because they have suspicious you.

I will edit the post if the images do not upload correctlyI joined BC.GAME about a week ago based on the reviews online the platform is nothing short of amazing and could potentially be a top tier online casino, then you go back and actually read those reviews and how fake and generic they sound is when you realise that you’ve been fooled. You’re right they DO remove genuine comments made on their comment wall that logically states why their site IS NOT “provably fair” but replace those comments made with fake positive reviews. Just claiming to be “fair and transparent” is mind blowing how contradictory that statement is.",

I am not sure how fair or true this information is but an official must attend to this so that fellow members can understand the reality and gravity of the matter.
