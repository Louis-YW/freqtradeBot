Either the news could be false, or it could also be true.Quote The Department of Justice has declined to comment on the charges to this point, as has Binance.  So for the main time, let's focus on other things. The up and down price of Bitcoin is what actually makes it Bitcoin; we can't expect the price to remain stagnant at a certain point. This kind of drama and attack are just happening to slow down how fast the price of Bitcoin could have possibly moved and the level it could have achieved by now or before the end of the year, considering the halving event that is fast approaching.",

Lol.The problem with that its, every sibgle player on the market its always making some \"shady\" but not illegal things. For examples its clear some of them always have inside information, wich in part its prohibited and its illegal, but that its not how the worlds work.Manipulation of market can be always put in the table by being a big player, but maybe you only make a promo or a business things, but you are so big in the market then your movement makes all the market tremble.For example Elon musk being a single person its always pointed to do that by only twiting, and its true but at the same time he is only making busines or giving his point of view.Its a very tricky situation. I dont know if i be clear in my explanation i hope so.",

It is a natural movement for the price. We cannot say that the price rose unless the rise was above $38,000. All prices below that are a price move that has continued in The same movement since the moment of breaking $28,000.I clicked on the link and found:QuoteSemafor reports the potential charges while noting that prosecutors are currently, “considering other options such as fines or deferred non-prosecution agreements,” according to sources. This outcome would be a beneficial compromise, holding Binance to account for fraudulent behavior while protecting consumers. It is nothing but rumors and there are compromises so as of now there is no reason for fraud accusations against Binance and Binance is complying with the regulations.",

Is it a part of that? But as the market works, one's loss is another one's profit. Is it fabricated or the truth? Maybe we will know it soon enough. But if you are emotionally stable and know how to hodl, you are all good. Things like this will happen again and again, but that doesn't change the fate of Bitcoin. It will continue to grow. Slowly but surely. So those of us who are hodling, we have nothing to worry. Take a nap till the bulls are back. I know I sound selfish. But those who are getting panicked, they don't belong in here. Try to learn emotion control first and see the history. If that doesn't make you hodl, then you are good with sell. Just leave the market. You are weak.",

Bitcoin is obviously not dependent on Binance, but CEX users need Binance to trade on their investments. Binance is the current CEX Tier 1 and will greatly affect the crypto market when there is FUD aimed at Binance. See how the impact of Binance.US's feud with the SEC, caused a lot of polemics that made the crypto market decline.Everyone can have their own personal wallet, but for trading, they generally use Binance and some other CEXs. Using DEX is also possible, but it is also vulnerable and you have to be careful of fake DEX managed by scammers. FUD will create panic in crypto users, and this will affect the crypto market so avoiding FUD would be better, and do not participate to spread if the news is not valid.",

Dramatic actions and attacks are detrimental to the entire crypto market. A more reasonable approach would be for the US to suspend Binance operations solely for US citizens, as attempting to destroy the entire crypto market or globally ban Binance may not be feasible. Moreover, some countries like the UAE and Japan are welcoming Binance, so there's no need to panic over such news.",

Bitcoin is highly illiquid with just a fraction of the supply being traded and deciding the price for all the rest. We've seen a huge outflow from exchanges as people are holding and everybody is waiting for the halving and ETF rulings, so there's not much buying going on. Those who wanted to buy already did that sub 20k and those who are lagging want to see signs of a bull market...I don't get the complaining about the volatility. If you're a trader you should love it and holders don't care about that as they don't react to 5% ups and downs that happen every month. What we holders care about is 100% up. That's where we wake up and start thinking what we're going to do in this coming bull market.",

Not shady as in FTX bullshit type but he's been made aware of the fact that he's allowing altcoins that are not accepted by the SEC to operate and be traded within his platform. That's about it I guess. I don't think this counts as a fraud charge especially since there's no actually fraudulent activity going on, and I can't be bothered reading the article cause as you said it's just them reheating the same shit that China said so they can put fuel to the fire. If push comes to shove and cryptocurrencies pull out from the US I don't think it's going to cause massive long-lasting effects to the state of the market, it's not like they're the biggest adopters of cryptocurrency anyway.",

Community or investors would really be having that sell off and we did really able to see since the price hits up again on 29k but didnt really go that below which does mean that there's a strong support that who would really be that willing on buying with those low levels on which it would really be just that normal because they do believe that the market wont really be going that low because of these news.
