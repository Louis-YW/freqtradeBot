  "content": "I have some bitcoin addresses that have a lot of incoming transactions. When I first started mining, I was receiving daily transactions of 20,000 - 30,000 satoshis, and cumulatively there are several dozen transactions per address. (begginerâ€™s mistake)I'm looking to consolidate this, so I won't have a problem if one day I need to sell, or send BTC from these addresses.I can't find the answer to my question on the internet: I'm looking for a way to be warned when the mempool empties, and the fees are less expensive.I monitor mempool.space and https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,weight occasionally, but is there a Telegram bot or a way to be notified when the fees are below a certain threshold?I know that this is not really a problem, and that it is enough to check the mempool from time to time. But I'm surprised that no tool offers this to my knowledge. I think that such a tool could be useful if Ordinals continues its mess",

Use this opportunity to Consolidate your small inputs!Just click on notify so that you can be sent notification anytime there is new post after checking the thread, or use the ninjastic telegram bot to track it. But I will advice you to use those mempool mentioned above for it, just try and check it daily or weekly to know when the mempool is less congested. Mempool is less congested more on weekends, so you can try and be checking it during weekends.",

I hadn't even thought about the transaction waiting for a while in the mempool, but it absolutely makes sense.About the Forkcoins, only one addresse is owning shitty BSV, I will try to swap them to BTC in the coming days or weeks. Thank you, I never checked it before and it is always very nice to find some free satoshis !",

I know it's not the same unit, but whatever I try I don't find any relationship that would work out. Is the alerting mempool showing something incorrect, or am I missing something?",

Pay attention to chart \"Mempool Transactions\" and \"Mempool Dynamic Memory Usage\".",
