  "content": "Hello everyone,I'm new here and trying to get an overview. However, it is not that easy, as there are a lot of crypto casinos and betting providers. I came across DEX Sports and after some research here on the forum I decided not to deposit any money there. My question now would be, at which crypto bookies can i deposit without hesitation? I am only interested in sports betting, so all bets should be settled correctly and payouts should be carried out without any problems. Also, maybe someone can comment on betting limits and bans/limits if you're a successful punter. I already know stake and am really very satisfied. Can you name bookies that act in a similarly serious and uncomplicated manner?And just a little bit about me, I come from a German-speaking area and would like to apologize in advance for any grammatical errors. I am a moderator in the largest German-speaking betting forum and ended up here with you because of a recommendation. I would be very grateful for your help and maybe there will be someone here with whom I can exchange football tips.Have a nice dayWettwahn",

And thanks for your recommendationsKnow that when you deposit a large amount, the casino will ask KYC documents of yours. I guess you are okay with it since you are from Bet365. There are lots of bookies in crypto which you have already named one. There's also Betcoin.AG. I don't think crypto bookies will limit your account just that bets.

Since you've already tried Stake, maybe you can later compare the two that gave you the experience.Regarding procedures, almost all sports betting sites have the same rules. maybe there are some points that sometimes differ. you can read everything in advance so as not to miss something that could make things difficult for you in the future.you did a great job when you did a search before you made a deposit to a gambling site. that's the thing to do, and avoid 1xbit if you don't want to lose your money.",

But I have a question. If you are satisfied with Stake, why are you searching for a different gambling site? Keep playing with the one that has been good to you so far.fortunately not in Germany, but in Austria. That shouldn't be a problem for most bookies. I have no problem with KYC. I already have an account with all reasonably reputable Euro bookies, some limited to 1 Euro stake, some still open. I just want to make sure I can continue to place bets freely in the future. And to the question why I don't only play at stake, they also don't accept stakes of 5000 euros or more in an early market. Therefore you have to split the bets between different soft bookies. With sharp bookies like pinnacle you can easily bet any amount you like, but then you don't get the odds for your total bet",

I said I researched dexsports and this forum was recommended to me to get ahead with my research. Trusting a kryptobookie is exactly the reason why I don't only want to play at stake. I'd rather have 5 different bookmakers and there are 20k euros each than just one and there are 100k. I don't care whether the platform is decentralized or centralized, as long as the payment is made. With decentralized platforms, you usually canât bet with Bitcoin.
