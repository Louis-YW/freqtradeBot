The price is 545k EUR equivalent in Bitcoin or Ethereum at the time of sale. I can arrange a Portuguese Law firm to help smooth the process and help clarify any questions.Portugal is very much crypto friendly and houses were already sold there for cryptocurrency.Any information feel free to ask. Visits can be arranged, PM for more details.PS: The house is being sold below market price. The last market analysis estimation by an agency calculated the fair market price of 817k eur.",

      "body": "Hey DomainNames4Sale,Diornov here, founder of Zenland. Saw your listing and thought I'd jump in. If you're considering an escrow for this sale, using Zenland might be a good fit. For a transaction of 820k euros, our escrow contract typically costs $3645. This can be split between both parties, making it $1822 each. However, if you decide to go through Zenland for this sale, we'll cover the entire escrow fee. Plus, all transaction fees related to contract deployment and escrow calls are on us.Portugal's crypto-friendly environment and Zenland's secure platform could make this a smooth deal for you. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions!Cheers,Diornov",
