What BTC does mainly without overstressing things as you did are two and are as follows;1. It helps against the centralization of its financial activities thereby giving more privacy and higher authority over your money/assets.2. It lowers transactional fees to a bearest minimum.Anything aside these will only give room for debates.",

Now they can in BitcoinShare your thought on this .. what do you think would have been situation if Bitcoin was not created You are giving Bitcoin too much credit for things that has not been pioneered by Satoshi Nakamoto... Take decentralization as an example ..... It has become popular to decentralize \"clients\" or \"servers\" to enable people to share content over the Internet for years.. a lot of torrent sites use decentralized \"nodes\" or \"clients\" to make it difficult for authorities to stop them. Napster was one of the first services that was developed for people to share MPs files (music) ...but it was taken down and then more decentralized projects followed Napster's P2P file-sharing example, such as Gnutella, Freenet, FastTrack, and Soulseek.So Satoshi Nakamoto only borrowed from previous projects that used \"decentralized\" nodes to protect it from being taken down.",

Many lives that supposed to be living just average or in poverty becomes better and having a better life. You are right that bitcoin is not the only asset that increased 20x, but it actually grows 1000x. Does that mea nothing to you? There are many crypto businesses today, helping people and economy. Does bitcoin creation, directly and indirectly creating ways for more employment means nothing to you?",

Before I didnt know bitcoin, I worked almost hard and waited for payday I try to save every month with a savings account in the bank and my biggest goal is to buy a house after 10 years of work. But really luck came my way when I learned about bitcoin my income increased faster and can say I reached my goal in a shorter period of time. Besides, thanks to bitcoin, I understand the risks the bank will pose to me, the devaluation of fiat...actually bitcoin has made me a completely different person not only in terms of income but also perception of the world the government has been trying to deceive us for years.",

Did the world give importance of his presence? Maybe we can say yes to the crypto users because he is well known creator of second top crypto in the world but the world media(the mainstream) didn't cover him and been not crazy about what he do.For sure if Satoshi will appear he will be highlighted on medias but for sure this are for short term only.If we talk about if crypto is not created for sure everything will be in normal and still we can see a digitalization in different form.

I do agree with you, without btc there wouldn't have been this great forum and experience that comes along with it. Without btc the world will still be the way it is but the value and freedom btc brings into the financial system would be missing, the ability to actually invest individually without needing any third party will be missing a great deal. Btc simplifies many things which would have been very had to do without it.",
