I don't know why, however I'm start again and post your analysis and thoughts too here. Because your thread seems to look like a pump and dump discussion and I'm afraid this might be locked too.You should read the forum guidelines, this shouldn't be here, it should in the altcoin section.

Thank you According to the image I saw, it show that the graph in the chart will dump at 50%, So, instead of buying it now, that is too riskyif you do that, but if you have the coins already better to sell them due to that the price will going to dump at around 50% of the price pumping recently. There are a lot of traders doing this method anyway for several times and I've seen this repeatedly in this field of business industry here in the cryptocurrency.",

There are a lot of traders doing this method anyway for several times and I've seen this repeatedly in this field of business industry here in the cryptocurrency.Thought the OP is going to talk about crypto talk coin by yobit, lol but 50 percent really? Dang! That's a lot and I think this coin have dumped already? Like any other cryptos due to bear. Can't imagine if what will be its value after it dumps another 50 percent but if the coin has a hidden potential then that's a good discount that we will be getting.If we are doubting, we can also invest with smaller amounts. That shouldn't hurt us in case it fail. It's okay to sell as long as he bought at a cheaper rate. He can still be able to make some profit but if not then I don't think selling now is a good idea. The only thing that he will be getting is a loss if he did that.",
