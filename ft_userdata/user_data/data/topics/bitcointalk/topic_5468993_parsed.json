I do not view this news as a positive new for the Indian crypto community as it is all about development of their infrastructure. Gemini exchange had opened their development center in Gurgaon a few years back. What they are now doing now is expanding it as India has the best skills in software development. The investment by them would help the economy of India, it will help India in achieving its goal of a 5 trillion dollar economy, apart from those goals I cannot think of anything with this news.",

By setting up office here, they can eventually decide whether to pull out because of problems or stay and offer services.What I get pessimistic about is the government here, where politicians know shit about crypto and are pushing it under the rug.",

Despite the 30% crypto tax, India offers many advantages for businesses like:Talent: India has smart people, like Google and Microsoft CEO's sunder, making it great for tech ventures.Cost Efficiency: Low living costs mean you can do more with less money then any other country.Government Support: Initiatives like \"Startup India\" supports business growth.Infrastructure: India has good physical and digital infrastructure.Big Market: With 1.3 billion people, it's a huge market for products and getting new ideas.English: Most people in India speak English, making it easy for global business.So, despite challenges, India remains an attractive place for businesses to grow.",

Gemini is following the same path as Coinbase, a lot of new job opportunities would be created by this investment. I am certain they won't start their exchange operation in India unless regulation comes into place. This is a piece of good news for the Indian economy which is looking far better than the global economies. Only Indian exchanges are struggling for now and not global exchanges like Gemini. This news has nothing to do with them starting their Indian operation. It is only related to software development and research, which they have outscored to India.",
