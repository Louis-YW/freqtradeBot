Don’t let the temporary dips to distract you. It might not always be stable but it will continue to rise for sure.QuoteNot coin is it safe to enter this coin nowThat depends on your goals and what you can afford, mate.QuoteDoes bitcoin effect memecoins on solana or baseYes but not directly. Bitcoin has the power to influence the larger crypto market. Typically if bitcoin is in good form, altcoins will also show a positive trend and if bitcoin is not going well then you can imagine what it does to the crypto world.",

      "body": "Some thoughts:Bitcoin is not/will not be a memecoin and will continue to be the fundamental backbone of crypto markets. The realization that a lot of people have come to understand about Bitcoin is that the price would definitely go up higher than here (even more than the all time high). However, There's only so much higher that Bitcoin can go even with the capped supply. That's why a lot of crypto native folks now opt to over memecoins and other shitcoins in hopes that they can get rich quickly or get an experience close to what the early buyers of Bitcoin experienced — that is, to buy a token at an incredibly low price and the price goes on to achieve at least a thousand x?",

Hilarious    I have always wanted to give answers in this manner but I don't know how others will see it because in this community people just say whatever they like and at some point one may begin to feel guilty for nothing. BTW, your answers is worth of some accolades. To you OP, bitcoin has been in existence for more than a decade plus and it has not shown any stupid sign or movement like the so called memecoins that you're obviously obsessed about. Perhaps every other coins depend on it's movements for them to also move so bitcoin isn't a joke memecoins.",

Bitcoin will definitely face a price drop eventually and I can agree that it will make things worse but have this piece of knowledge that whatever that situation is, it's always going to be a temporary thing and that you will never have to worry for it at the long-term. Another piece of advice for you OP, the price drop of bitcoin isn't a tragedy or a curse or whatever negative connotations you've got on it, it's a blessing for everyone because that's an opportunity for you to invest into bitcoin at a much cheaper price and you will have more value when you buy at those times.",
