Since we already know how unpredictable the market can be so there is no guarantee of a future increase in price unless a project has a clear use case and an ecosystem to support its growth.",

Mostly unpredictable and unreliable,  so advertising such cheat coins may mislead others into investing in them and causing possible losses to them. But then nice to see that you already clarify your stand on all this.",

Ben.eth and company are monopolizing all the liquidity on the meme coins which makes the other meme coin illiquid that prone for rug pull. The loss on meme coin is tremendous that makes it more dangerous than gambling since Uniswap charge tons expensive fees while the price change more than 100% in just a short period of time due to low liquidity.Meme coin is ponzi. Even pepe coin is already struggling now to hold the current MC. It will collapse very quick along with low caps meme coin like this when the meme coin hype is over.
