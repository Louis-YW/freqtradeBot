I know how that experience changes anyone's conception and view on life, especially if it's a first baby. You know, the one that changes one's status from wife/husband or woman/man to mother/father ðŸ¤ªQuote from: Victorybit1 on March 14, 2023, 01:22:57 PMMy baby and I has made up to $50 if converted just 10days after giving birth.Â That's an appreciable amount of money in my part of the world. It shows you do have givers around you. Your idea of putting that money down in Bitcoin as savings is really a noble one. There's no better time to do that than now that price is about picking up to embrace a new ATH. However, my skepticism is on the duration you said you would hodl it in wait for your new born. 18 years isn't tomorrow or a year after. This is easier said than done but we all know how life doesn't play fair, given that loss, theft and misappropriation could happen within the period. All the same, I wish your plan comes through.",

Bitcoin price might touch $1 after the next 18 years because anything is possible, it's also possible the price will be sky rocketed, but I not really think the ROI is really so huge.",

I hope your decisions for him will come to a successful end. like in the future your son will be proud of the decisions that you made for him. And you also gave me the idea to give gifts to new parents. But it has its drawbacks like most of the people in my society does not aware of the potential of BTC and if I give them this gift they will going to forget about the wallet.Overall, many many happy returns of this beautiful day. and I must say if you could, add more BTC to his portfolio like do proper DCA and observe the market to take better entry but overall you are holding for the long term so I can say 1k up or down dows not make that much difference if the amount is not that much.

So overall, your concerns are no doubt in the favor of this child and I appreciate your honest concerns about privacy even for a newborn baby.",

If you have enough knowledge and faith in bitcoin, nothing is too difficult to do. 18 years is a very long time, but if you are determined, you can do it, it's like saving for our children's future.Quote from: Bananington on March 14, 2023, 01:48:54 PMIf you want to invest in bitcoins for your child, you need to be invest a huge amount and not crumb by crumb. Why is it necessary to have large amounts of money in the first place to invest in bitcoin when we can accumulate over time? Accumulation is like saving, every time we have lazy money, we will buy bitcoin, and if we maintain it until 18 years later, it will be a huge amount of money.Quote from: Bananington on March 14, 2023, 01:48:54 PMAlso before you child come of age, you have to ensure that you have done the part of educating him or her well about what bitcoin really is, so that at the end when you hand them ownership of the bitcoins you have been keeping for them, they will actually know the value and not waste it.Even if you don't have any bitcoin savings for your kids for the future, when they're old enough, you should teach them about bitcoin because that's the future.",

People usually opt for these schemes as they want to secure the future of their children.I think a better option is to invest monthly some amount in bitcoin for your baby and keep on doing it for the next 10 to 20 years. Believe me by the end of this period, you child will achieve financial freedom because we can't imagine the price of bitcoin after the next decade.",

It's a lovely idea to put the money into BTC, IMO, as at least it's likely that it will add up to something while the baby is growing, whereas $50 will only cost less and less until it's of extremely symbolic value or replaced with some other currency altogether. So it's certainly smarter than keeping and saving up money in fiat which is meant to lose value over time and tends to lose even more than expected, whereas Bitcoin tends to grow in value over time, and 18 years is a lot of time, so it might grow very significantly.",
