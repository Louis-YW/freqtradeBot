Cryptocurrency gains value when demand rises higher than supply. for that i think bitcoin will lead the currency market in nearly 5 years. Which currency do you think will lead?The world of cryptocurrency is made up of two entities which are Bitcoin and the rest. Many altcoin creators have boasted that their coin will overtake Bitcoin and make the coin lose its number one spot. But all their bragging and predictions have been futile. When OneCoin came on board, its owner Ruja Ignatova boasted that in two years her coin will make bitcoin obsolete. After just a year and six months, OneCoin vanished and many investors lost billions. Bitcoin has many features that most altcoins can't copy or easily imbibe. Bitcoin will keep leading the crypto market because no altcoin has better features that can make them dethrone the king of the crypto world: Bitcoin. In five years the gap between bitcoin and other coins will keep expanding.",

Which currency you think will lead?I think Ethereum will lead the currency market in the near future. Ethereum is the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization and is seen as a viable alternative to Bitcoin. It has a wide range of use cases and is backed by a strong development team. Ethereum's transactions are faster and cheaper than Bitcoin's and its smart contract technology offers a wide range of potential applications. Ethereum also has a larger total supply than Bitcoin, making it less scarce and thus more accessible to a larger group of users. It also has a more decentralized network structure than Bitcoin, making it more resistant to censorship and manipulation,Â  Ethereum has the potential to become the leading cryptocurrency in the near future",

So far, bitcoin is the only coin created with use cases and utility. The rest of the market is just a dump, where people are just looking for a way to scam each other for money. I also invest in altcoins, but to be honest, I just want to increase my money, I can't find any other purpose.

In fact, if all crypto were to somehow simply disappear tomorrow, it would not have a long term effect on the price of Bitcoin. However if Bitcoin were to disappear, all those cryptocurrencies which have Bitcoin as their asset layer would not even exist anymore. And the rest would be seen as too risky to buy because if the ultimate coin, BTC dies, all crypto would be considered dead.",
