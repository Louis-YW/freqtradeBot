  "content": "Hi all.  Just finished bringing a 10TB IPFS server online just for kicks (216.146.251.8:4001), provide 54TB to ScPrime's network, and run a Tor relay node.  Keeps me from getting bored <smile>.Obviously, while researching IPFS, Filecoin came up.  I'd like to know more!  In the olden days, coins would have a basic stat page on bitcointalk.org that would provide basic stats like block time (apparently 30 seconds for Filecoin?), Max number of coins/tokens?  Current number of mined coins/tokens, reward method, pre-min amount for PoW coins,  etc.  Is there such a thing for Filecoin? Basically looking to see where I would be in the project if I invested enough to build a mining machine.Also curious about if/how hardware requirements are expected to increase as the size of the blockchain increases.  e.g. I'd be pissed to spend $20K+ on a server and have it, or some component, become insufficient in 6 months.  Related, concerned that the current specs are close to the edge with regards to current technology.  For example, pcpartpicker does not even support the Ice Lake CPUs recommended (shame on them, but point is they were only released 2Q21).  Basically want to make sure that such a beast of a machine will continue to function for several years, without hitting something like a GPU memory restriction.Given that most dual Xeon (my \"goto\" config for large servers) motherboards support 10 6gbyte/sec SATA connections, I could see having 160-200TB of storage along with a 2TB NVME disk for OS, ZFS cache, and 1TB for sealing cache (although I wonder if that space would be better served in the general ZFS log/cache space).  My understanding is that FIL needs to be purchase to functional \"allow\" storage space to be used.  How much FIL would I need to purchase to support, say, ~128TB of usable (10x16GB ZFS RaidZ2)?Thanks in advance for any feedback.",

      "body": "I'm a little curious about this myself.  Is there a filecoin \"mining\" guide out there?  Its amazing how bad google has gotten; Nothing but spam sites and worthless clickbait articles.  On a sidenote, Icelake CPUs probably aren't on pcpicker because I don't think its possible to buy them in a retail package. They were either embedded on laptops or sold with servers.  I could be wrong though.",
