Fast transactions, minimal and elegant code. It is written from the ground up in C++. We want the Pandanite source code to be simple, elegant, and easy to understand. Rather than adding duct-tape to an existing currency, we built Pandanite from scratch with lots of love.Mining payments occur using the *thwothirding* algorithm, which yields a total final circulation of ~100M PDN:- 50 PDN per block until block 666666- 50\\*(2/3) PDN per block from blocks 666667 to 2\\*666666- 50\\*(2/3)^2 PDN per block from blocks 2\\*66666+1 to 3\\*666666etc.Socials:Twitter: https://twitter.com/pdn_pandaniteReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/pandanite/Telegram: https://t.me/pandaniteDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/crfkWjxYyTMastodon: https://techhub.social/@pandaniteThanks for your time!Pandanite Team",

He had IRL issues so he stepped down, cant tell more - he has the right of privacy. There aren't any 5 million coins, just as Lind said that issue was patched and fixed back in Summer of 2022. On topic: we are working on to speed up the node sync - it looks great we just need some testing.",
