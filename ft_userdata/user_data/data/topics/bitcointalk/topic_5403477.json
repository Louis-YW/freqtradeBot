      "body": "Diversifying doesn't mitigate the risk at all. If you invest that 60% into a poor investment, then you'll lose out. In fact, I'd argue due to having the majority invested in various different things, there's more risk. For example, you invest 60% into ten different altcoins, well most altcoins are absolutely not worth even talking about. The vast majority, and I would go as far as saying 95-99% of altcoins end up failing. So, while you've diversifying into altcoins, you have a very low chance of those altcoins being successful. Plus, it's almost guaranteed you'll lose money if you diversify into that many altcoins, simply because 95-99% fall flat on their face. Personally, I'd just stick whatever you can afford to lose into Bitcoin. The rest that you aren't sure about, keep in fiat. Bitcoin is definitely the most promising out of any other altcoin out there, and I personally believe the best investment someone can make. I believe its better than property, the only reason I'd pick property over Bitcoin is if I wanted to move or didn't have a home yet. Since, that satisfies two needs, rather than just being an investment. If I had a home, and was investing solely for profit, Bitcoin all day without any question in my mind. This might just be the perfect time to invest into Bitcoin, if you plan on holding it long term, or at the very least a year after the next halving.",

      "body": "LogitechMouse hit the nail on the head. Do your research. If you haven't done your research, and understand why a particular investment should be successful, you're setting yourself up for failure. You wouldn't go down the street, and invest in a hot dog stand, if you didn't know how busy it was, so why would you do the same with other investments? I personally didn't really understand the potential of Bitcoin until months, maybe up to a year of using it. I was just using it for a side gig. I basically looked for an alternative to the traditional payment processors like Paypal, simply because I was earning gift cards on a phone at the time, and wanted to sell them. That's basically it, so I was not looking to make millions. Then, as time went on I started to learn a little bit more about it, and that was that. I've now developed a sort of belief system that the world will always need something like Bitcoin. If you care about privacy, and not relying on third parties, you'll need something like Bitcoin. It gives you the freedom. Although, at first I was probably a little bit too young to actually understand the importance of that. Plus, having a few problems with banks blocking payments, such as a trip I wanted to go on, and then having the hassle of sorting that out; that's basically what drove me to Bitcoin, and ended up becoming a massive part of my life. My investment has already paid off, and not completely via monetary gain, simply the freedom I've achieved over my money has been priceless.",

Your advice is correct, I would even say that most of the investments should consist of bitcoin. As for other altcoins, it may not be worth buying them now until you figure out what's what, maybe by then you will change your mind about buying altcoins altogether.  Now is a good time to invest, the market has dipped very significantly and it may take some time before it rises again, in the long run you will get a good profit, the most important thing is patience.",

Where have you read that? Honestly, what's the most recommended for a newbie is don't invest at all if you don't know yet what's the best investment that you must have. And whoever said that you must diversify more with altcoins, might don't have a lot of bitcoins.But if you're going to listen to the majority here, we'll tell you that you must have a bitcoin portfolio first since you're still a newbie. Learn from it and eventually, you'll get to explore the altcoins because not all of them are profitable.Can you just imagine of putting $600 there without you knowing where you'll invest there?",

I suggest 50% of your investment capacity should go for bitcoin. Btc and Ethereum are the best you can invest in , most altcoins are like gambling away your money. Bitcoin will rise again and go above the current ATH, this has been proven with history but many other altcoins may not do that again after this bear. An investor can only make profit in hodling if the coin has the volatility to go above initial ATH. Be wise with your $1,000 or you could start with lesser amount to get some experience except if you already have more cash in reserve.",

First of all, it ain't diversifying at all as all other tokens/coins depend on bitcoin so when bitcoin goes up, they go up to and the same thing happens when it goes down, so what's the point. Another thing to keep in mind is that you are newbie, and in 99.99% of the time newbies don't know when to sell altcoin on time and problem with alts is that majority of them don't survive the bear market so if you miss you opportunity (and you most probably will), you will end up with bunch of worthless shitcoins.Stick to bitcoin buddy and if you really want to diversify, invest in something that doesn't have to do with crypto.",

In Bitcointalk questions are appreciated and answers will be provided if the questions are worthwhile. But for whatever it is worth, it is best if you do not ask 'noob' questions relating to investment or trading, or to state exact sums of money you possess and wish to invest; that clearly denotes you wholly do not know what you are doing, and when you do not know what you are doing you become more vulnerable to scams and scammers.Do your personal research about investment or trading and from there you can make up your own mind, if you had done your research you would understand that investing in things that are intrisincally similar is no investment whatsoever.",

I've come to realize in investment that your first win always strengthens your confidence level and propels you to invest more. On that note, I think you won't be getting it wrong investing more percentage in Bitcoin than in alts. You should've done a 60% to 80% in Bitcoin and then do the remaining in alts that you would've researched thoroughly. Bitcoin investment is safer than investment in alts. Hey! Come to think of it, Bitcoin is at a good entry level at the moment; whether it goes down further or not. Just invest and close your app and act semi forgetfully about it till end of this year before checking what ROI it has earned you.",

Although, if you posted about whether altcoins were worth investing in, and secondly safe to do so, you'll find different answers since its from a different audience. However, put it this way. If I had invested in some of the altcoins which piqued my interest along the way, I would likely looking at losses in them specifically. Whereas Bitcoin I've only ever profited. Although, I might be down to what I received last week, that doesn't matter in the long term. Ultimately, it's up to you, but try to remember that the majority of altcoins aren't worth your time, and almost always fail. There's a few that might be promising. Particularly those that have Mimble Wimble implemented, as that at least from a technology stand point, is quite interesting. Other than that, most do the same thing, but slightly different.",

I have read that I should put 40 percent into bitcoin and diversify the other 60 percent.My first question is, if you're limiting your investment options to only cryptocurrencies or by diversifying you mean entering into other industries?If you're referring to crypto;True diversification does not really exist as all coins are within the same niche and mirror the price actions of each other; so when the price of Bitcoin goes up, about 90% of coins would go up with it and same thing happens when it goes down. So, you'll have a portfolio which would likely be in red or green at the same time.If you're considering different markets;Firstly, you should do your own research. There are lots of investment options, so you would have to read up and understand more about any investment venture and choose how best to diversify your capital.Bitcoin is a good investment option, there are also other options like real estate, precious metals etc.",

These things are very common things that you need to learn. I am not sure who introduced you to cryptocurrency and not sure if he tech you basic knowledge. Cryptocurrency investment is always high risk, whether you are investing in Bitcoin or Altcoins. Just see the current market, where it was, and where it's now. Invest only that you can afford the loss. We don't when crypto will break previous ATH or if it will never break. You need to know about potential loss. Many people making money from crypto and many are lost. So please learn and research first. Choose only the best and top altcoin when you intend to invest in it.",
