Binance are one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin, FTX had a large amount deposited with them, so it's only natural that the many holders of Bitcoin there would cause of a negative news on those platforms panic and that in turn that sentiment will affect the price.In the long run as a BTC holder you should not be too worried. The effect of those news last for just a couple of days at best and the market corrects.I would hope it would teach many not to deposit their bitcoins on centralized exchanges but that's not the case.",

But the price of the currency is determined by a market, and that market is greatly influenced by a few such entities, like Binance and the like. There shouldn't be exchanges used as wallet software in the first place, as you're not supposed to have an intermediary when using or buying bitcoin, but unfortunately many people (who partly define the price) don't get that.",

One exchange going down doesn't mean BTC must follow.Binance will disappear? I don't give a damn.Everything has its place. There are people who believe so much in exchanges to take care of their assets security more than they think they can do for themselves, and as such, most people save their coins on centralized exchanges with hope and believe that they are the best option. Which is the worst idea anyone can have. A true Bitcoiner knows the value and benefits of self-custodial.The price of Bitcoin always goes down based on the level of fudz, which is a cause against Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price is not controlled by anyone, but most times it can be manipulated, since the case of the SEC coming after Binance CEO is enough reason for non-believers to start panic selling, which can cause a drastic price dump, but this can only be temporary and not a permanent price. But you shouldn't be considering your savings gone until you have sold them out entirely. So long as you still hold your coin, there is a higher chance and possibility of regaining everything that you have calculated to have lost when the bull market comes. That's why we are always advised to hodl strong in a bearish market and never to sell under panic.",

One exchange going down doesn't mean BTC must follow.Binance will disappear? I don't give a damn.you have been around long enough to know this stufffirstly never measure your \"SAVINGS\" based on the volatility of the market price because the market price is indeed controlled by exchanges..instead if your a long term holder stop caring about the market price. and just remember its volatile..instead remember this simple factthere is always a periodic BOTTOM that the markets refuse to sell below. set that as your \"savings value\" per coin per 6 month periodthe bottomline value is almost like the guarantee minimum return. yes the speculative market can swing up above this and you can get temporary opportunities to sell higher then the periodic bottom. but if you are not in a selling mood dont care about the temporary pricesfor instance late 2022 saw the bottom at $15k early 2023 saw it at $17k (even when temporary market prices were over $20k)now the bottomline value is over $20k (even when the market prices are over $25k)knowing you would get a minimum of $15k late 2022 and now $20k in 2023 is much more relaxing though then daily worrying about the daily speculation and volatility of the markets that sit above the bottomline valueif you want to calculate the bottomline value.. take about 6 months of average network hashrate. calculate the cheapest most efficient asic to work out how many asics are needed, how much electric and the cheapest effective electric of prominent mining farms. to then calculate the cost to mine most efficiently on the planet per btcthat there is the effective bottomline cheapest way to acquire bitcoin on the planet(below market rate) meaning no one wants to sell below that amount because no one on the planet can acquire bitcoin via mining, otc trading or CEX trading to get bitcoin any cheaper. so no one on planet will sell below that. which is where the bottomline support steps in to re-inforce that cex markets never correct all the way down to that levelonce you know the number. you can then be rest assured that unless bitcoin really breaks you have a minimum value for your \"savings\" and anything else the speculative market wants to sell for is a bonus above the savings",

If we look at the this exchanges mostly centralized exchanges we would find out that most of the coins stored on them are for traders that utilizes the features like spot trading, future trading, margin trading and its likes. And binance been the largest or biggest exchange it is possible that it will have more traders on it. And we all know traders arenâ€™t investors that would hold on to their coins or withdraw them to a proper wallet. The traders will be predicting a price drop in bitcoin and the rest as CZ is reported to be sued, and then they also would just sell off their funds to either fiat or stablecoins. The continuous increase of different trading features on exchanges will definitely make it hard for traders mostly daily traders to take off their funds off the exchanges. Also if the many people do not only see the use of bitcoin as payment method or an asset that can be stored but a currency for different trading purposes and without decentralized exchanges matching the number of different trading features on centralized exchanges, sadly many will continue to hold there funds on platforms like binance",

Reason? as others have mentioned, FUD.

Quite of a domino and relative events given that there's a belief of a downfall with Bitcoin's price because of CME gap below $23k. It is our reaction which creates a wave or movement with its market value.",

CZ denied the allegations on his twitter account, and these are just \"SPECULATIONS\" because of the word \"ALLEGED\" meaning they aren't 100% sure if it's true. Now to answer your question, I guess the fact that most of the investors are using Centralized Exchanges whenever they buy and sell makes it more important to them. I mean if these exchanges will disappear, what will be our options if we want to buy, or/and sell Bitcoin, and other altcoins.Well like you, I will not get affected if Binance will suddenly disappear, but I doubt it will happen.
