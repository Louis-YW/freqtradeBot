Some times someone wants to talk to you about the specific thing you said in the channel, but these chats are never about giving or sending money/airdrops.When the message says confirm, or you need to click any kind of link or \"send eth to:\" like this one does, it's a 100% scam. Not even a good scam. But apparently people still fall for them, which is the main reason these still keep happening.",

If some company is so great enough to give you a free $500, they would have money to cover the transaction cost. Just delete the telegram channel or block it completely. Otherwise they will keep annoying you and might send some malicious things to your telegram ID. So better not to involve in any communication.",
