The same rules apply whether you set up your hardware wallet on a phone or a PC. There should be multiple copies of the recovery phrase, but never in a digital form. If the hardware wallet has a secure element, the sensitive data won't leak onto the phone or be obtainable in case the phone is malware-infected in the same way seeds and PINs aren't leaking on computers. In essence, you aren't keeping the coins on the phone just like they aren't on the computer. And the private keys stay safe on the hardware wallet's chip.",

We have been touting for years that phones are not secure and you should not have large amounts of funds on them.I even thought on a hardware wallet, you can not know your seed phrase again after it has been generated during keys and addresses generation, only what you can do after that is a way you can be able to verify if the seed phrase you generated before is correct or not. The seed phrase is the coin, if lost, there is possibility that the coin is lost forever.Quote from: Pmalek on January 13, 2023, 01:21:29 PMThere should be multiple copies of the recovery phrase, but never in a digital form.I think 2 or 3 is okay, having more backups may lead to offline less security. I guess just like 2 or 3 backups is what you meant as multiple. Although, this may depend on individual preference and how secure they can save seed phrase in particular locations. But I will recommend just having 2 or 3 and not more.Quote from: Pmalek on January 13, 2023, 01:21:29 PMIf the hardware wallet has a secure element, the sensitive data won't leak onto the phone or be obtainable in case the phone is malware-infected in the same way seeds and PINs aren't leaking on computers.Like Trezor, if the hardware (Trezor) wallet is not having a secure element, nothing will leak online as well, unless a physical attack on the wallet which can reveal the seed phrase, but making the keys not to leak with the help of passphrase, provided if passphrase is used to generate the keys and addresses along with the seed phrase.",
