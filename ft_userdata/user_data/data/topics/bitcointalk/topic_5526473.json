It's honestly amazing, given the fact that the Peso isn't very strong, the lack of willingness to accept bitcoin.  My conclusion wasn't that they didn't like bitcoin or anything like that, it was a simple lack of education.  I believe this to still be the #1 reason why more people don't own/support bitcoin.Have you ever used bitcoin in Mexico? I'm not sure I've met a single person on bitcointalk from Mexico..so would love to hear from any Mexicans who read this, if any do!!Edit: I did give an impromptu financial \"seminar\" on the beach yesterday about bitcoin.  It started off explaining to a couple that I was a financial advisor and whom I worked for and then bitcoin came up.  By the end, there was about 10 people (all tourists) asking questions about bitcoin to me. Would you believe that all of them had their coins on Coinbase and many owned mostly shitcoins? smh.  ONE guy had a tangem card.  So i whipped out my wallet and showed him my Tangem card lol.  He said \"okay this guy knows what's up, what was that wallet again, Trezor, how do you spell it\"...  It was a fun interaction.",

Some scammers try to rug such people online by showing them dreams when it comes to crypto but even those scammers don't use Bitcoin themselves and try to rug those people's other coins instead of Bitcoin.In areas like Mexico there are of course some people who are aware of Bitcoin and who use it for their dealings, but majority are still unaware of it and that's the reason why they don't use it. Personally, I think Bitcoin will get more attention in all areas when it gets accepted as payment method for app stores like Play Store, App Store etc, and also if online games support payments with Bitcoin then that could also be helpful. However, so far none of those accept Bitcoin based payments and that's why locals don't really know how it works and what it is.",

Having tourists in your country means more money is coming in and it would be a choice location for Bitcoiners who are looking to spend and live on Bitcoin throughout their vacation.",

There is no way all the cab drivers, or hotel workers, or any other person that you might have come across doesn't have that formal background education. Most people don't just get involved because they actually don't know how it works, what it does, how to keep it, how to send, or even how to receive, which we can definitely trace to digital illiteracy (or should I say  Bitcoin illiteracy).Being a digital illiterate is not bad, besides how many people these days knows how to surf through the internet fluently. Someone can be on a social platform, and still not be able to carry out a simple search. So, I can't dispute the fact that lack of education is a problem, but I just feel that digital illiteracy is quite common.",

I'm not sure I've met a single person on bitcointalk from Mexico..so would love to hear from any Mexicans who read this, if any do!!I am not Mexican but let's be honest, many average people do not own or use bitcoin. Especially those in retail industry. Plenty of reasons why they do not use bitcoin. You can say that maybe they just do not know what bitcoin is or even how to use it. But can you blame them? Many people in my country do not even know how digital money works even though it is in fiat. What else for bitcoin? We can expect the same for a developing country. Another thing is if they are serving customers, they might not offer bitcoin because not many locals use it anyway. These people do not earn a lot and might not be attracted to their funds going to bitcoin first before they have to transfer it to their local money before they can buy food for their family.I know that lack of education is not an excuse and if they want to progress, they need to catch up. But I also think there is no need to be condescending and assume conclusions about people of a certain region especially if you are not a local. You have not lived in their state of environment. You do not know their daily lives so assuming things like maybe they simply don't like bitcoin is unfair.I think we should try to be kinder and let people understand bitcoin in a way that is welcoming and not patronizing. Congratulations on the vacation though. Hope you enjoyed and welcome back.",

From cartel to cartels, its either your on one side or another. However, i believe due to the high rate of illegal activities going on in Mexico it wont be a limitation to anyone who wants to use Bitcoin over there if it is allowed. Just so you know anything can happen even in the beach, we just need to be careful to whom we share some certain things to. Not everyone is what we seem to be. The most fun part of his story is where most of the persons over there are not really tourist but they make use of Bitcoin. And that true, its more about the education of Bitcoin not the lack of money which has made many persons not to own a fraction.",

Mexico is the country with the most homicides in the world, and 5 of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are in Mexico, so it is not a question of films, as Agbamoni says, films reflect reality. I have known people who have gone to Mexico and nothing has happened to them and I also know a person who had a gun pulled on him to rob him (he was lucky he wasn't kidnapped or killed before being robbed, which is not uncommon there either).On the other hand, I don't know why the OP thought he could use bitcoin to pay in Mexico, when in fact it can't be used to pay for services on the street almost anywhere in the world.",

They're struggling with much more serious issues, their priority isn't cryptocurrencies nor investments. Okay, let's suppose that your taxi driver knew about Bitcoin and actually accepted your payment. What happens now? The majority of Mexico's residents live in poverty, how is he going to cash-out your payment for his daily needs? We need to acknowledge that Bitcoin is not a panacea, it's not a go-to solution for everything in place. Whether we like it or not, in order for it to be fully functioning, an action similar to El Salvador's is needed. Informing the public, providing basic education and access to wallets that can be used on a daily basis, to conduct basic transactions for your livelihood. That's not going to happen in Mexico, unless they take example from Bukele and deal with gang crimes that are basically running whole cities.",

Just this recent holiday season alone, a number of individuals all over the world, some of them influencers, have been kidnapped for their crypto assets. Anyway, on topic, yeah, that people don't know Bitcoin is the primary reason why they aren't on it. This refers to both people who haven't heard of Bitcoin yet and those who have known Bitcoin wrongly all this time.",
