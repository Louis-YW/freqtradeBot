Coinbase is a fully regulated centralized exchanges, why would you think they are using the AMM mechanism?Your inquiry is not clear, but I think you might have joined a scam. Please explain more about the smart trading system.",

A heavily regulated company in the heart of regulation-land(the United States) isn't going to start such a scheme. Knowing that the government would want control, a non-custodial wallet is probably the farthest Coinbase can go as to releasing a \"non-controlling\" product.",

I don't think there's anywhere on Coinbase's website that describers their Earn schemes as a \"smart trading system\", so I'm going to bet OP was almost duped by a scam.",
