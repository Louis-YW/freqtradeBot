Though I really do believe that no one is perfect and as flawless as not making any kind of mistake in their life. There are different kinds of mistakes you could have made even if you were the most careful man on earth. You are telling me you never regretted at least one small thing all throughout your crypto journey?",

I think we can learn a lot from the mistakes made by others.1. Never pay in up front in cryptocurrencies (for goods or services) unless you are confident in the reliability of the receiving party or in the absence of guarantees to ensure the successful completion of the transaction.2. Buy bitcoin as soon as you first learn about it. Don't wait for the best moment to buy, otherwise you will miss the favorable moments and will regret the missed moments years later.There is a downside to this. Most often, people learn about cryptocurrencies during the hype thanks to the media and news. During this period, it is better to refrain from investing.3. Avoid investing in shitcoins and most altcoins, otherwise you will lose your money.People learn poorly from the mistakes of others, and only their own mistakes with financial losses force them not to repeat the mistakes. And even then, not always.",

So when you are trading be careful because those vendors most of them are scammers.Then another mistake I made was keeping coins in Centralized Exchange and when government crackdown the exchange I almost lost the coin. I kept it in the period when the fee was high though the coins were for spending and I immediately transferred them to another exchange and sold them.",

But for me, there is always a warning that says that it’s not scary to be confident; it’s scary to be very self-confident. You say that you don’t follow people, but you learned everything you know and can do from people (it’s not the gods who burn the pots). Nevertheless, my mistakes, as m2017 writes, are that I knew about Bitcoin from its first days, but I didn’t buy it at that time and didn’t listen to the advice, which, of course, was not enough. Another mistake is believing in altcoins, but I think many people make this mistake. But what you, MeGold666, say about the deafness of people holding funds on centralized exchanges is absolutely true. They need their own experience, and here the saying about self-confidence is appropriate. It is always better to gain experience from the mistakes of others.",

I was not keeping up with information while my peers were doing so, and so I missed the opportunity to be one of the early investors in bitcoins as some of my friends are. It took a while for me to ask the right questions, what was the step to wealth? And one of these my friends mentioned investing in bitcoins.
