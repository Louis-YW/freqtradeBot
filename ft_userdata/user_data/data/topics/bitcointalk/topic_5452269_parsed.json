Whale Map3. Blockchain Explorers4. ClankApp5. Whale WatchersFive trackers, maybe it can be recommended for you.I myself have not used it, you are wiser in your own judgment.",

But the fact is signal groups can be tempting for those looking for an easy way to make profits in the cryptocurrency market, relying solely on signals can be risky. Markets are always changing and there is no guarantee that a signal will always be accurate.Developing your own trading skills and understanding the market can be more beneficial in the long run. By doing your own research, analyzing market trends, and understanding technical analysis, you can make more accurate decisions about when to buy or sell a particular cryptocurrency. This will not only help you to make better trading decisions but also enable you to stay ahead of the market trends.",

You've got your mind made up and all that you need is just the relativism to enable you push through to archive your goals of trading with the whales.Trading on signals is definitely not the best idea for you and it doesn't look like them whales have got like a group or something information channel for all whales to get there instructions from on how to work the market.I think they have more like a puppet should you be a part of them group, they make you beleive one thing and they do something else minutes later. That's just being a part of such group can do to you.  Whales exploit the market, you should know that.",

But the fact is signal groups can be tempting for those looking for an easy way to make profits in the cryptocurrency market, relying solely on signals can be risky. No one will look for the signal group anymore if they know about the dark activities of the trading signal groups. Trading groups are also involved in various pump and dump operations, thereby using their group members to provide dump money for those pumps and dumps. So trading should not be done depending on someone else, it will be effective to rely on your own skills after developing your own skills.Quote from: Wiwo on May 10, 2023, 10:53:06 PMQuote from: ScamViruS on May 10, 2023, 07:27:37 PMIf you keep looking for signal groups then your trading journey will end badly.

They may really not want to come online and post any signals, but few do so if there are really many.Quote Hence why all these signal services are scams and you won’t actually make any money from them. You gotta trade on your own if you want to make it.That's correct, there are a lot of scam out there forming to be a signal source but they are just collecting people's money and giving out fake signals. I can not say all of them gives wrong signal but the truth is that I haven't seen anyone that gives a correct signal.",
