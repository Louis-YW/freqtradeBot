  "content": "Quotehttps://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-experts-urge-pause-training-ai-systems-that-can-outperform-gpt-4-2023-03-29/March 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives are calling for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4, in an open letter citing potential risks to society.Earlier this month, Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled the fourth iteration of its GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) AI program, which has wowed users by engaging them in human-like conversation, composing songs and summarising lengthy documents.\"Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable,\" said the letter issued by the Future of Life Institute.After the recent events of the  fake AI generated photo of Pope the risks to the society are clear.Technology personalities and even people from other areas such as Yuval Harari have been telling the risks of AI for years.Risks must be correctly managed and there must be some kind of security protocols to avoid damage that chatgpt and others can do.One question I have. Does chatgpt own any btc? Can it have some hidden keys?",

Back to the topic ChatGPT ain't holding any Bitcoin or hidden from it because information are just stored on them and on what purpose on putting or owning it since it will not transact on it so for sure none.  AI is really fast development and at first I thought elon will also jump in to this because of his ambitious projects but not. Not sure if they would stop this as there are a lot of big companies now supporting openAI",

I could no longer recall when that was, but it's true that he warned us the dangers that might come with AI. I also believe that there will risks and dangers with AI, and if it's true that some other nations are already planning to weaponize and integrating them into robots, then that's enough reason for me to be more wary, coz like you've said \"what prevents the future AI in doing so, right?\".There is no guarantee what danger it may fall to mankind if that's the case, but it is also undeniable that there are so many benefits given by the development of technology.",

Unless devs put some noteable sign that something was generated via AI, and can't be edited that easily, then I don't think stuff like this is stopping.Can't wait for Github Copilot X though, let that release first before stopping AI devs.",

Yes, there's a privacy concern and a concern for fake imagery, texts etc., but I don't think this can be stopped at this point.
