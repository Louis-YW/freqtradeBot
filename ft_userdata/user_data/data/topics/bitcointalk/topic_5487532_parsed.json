  "content": "I have a lot of friends who are into stonks and have no clue how bitcoin works (oH itS sO VoLatile!) so me and a Bitcoiner friend decided to create this tool where you can input the DCA amount, frequency and compare bitcoin vs stocks.Check it out → bitcoinvsstocks.comIt's free, open source and verifiable (links to Github repos are on the FAQ section).The most amazing part to me is that even when we started working on it last year, Bitcoin was already much better almost every single stock in the list. Now it's literally DESTROYING them.And now that the price is up, my nocoiner friends are obviously finally interested in bitcoin    Feedback is welcome! We're working on a search function to compare against the most common 7,000 stocks.",

      "body": "Nice inputs on this, this tool will help many bitcoiners in identifying on the difference from how they have been making the use of DCA in bitcoin and also related that to those that have their own investment in stocks, we know that the performance of bitcoin is far ahead many other crypto or digital assets investments including the physical ones that many choose to invest in which are centralized, this will help them relate and compare their market price performance as needed.",

One of my coworkers said \"I'll get in if it crashes\". hahahaha, I was like dude, it literally just spent a year crashing, we're at or near the bottom of the crash lol. Dude wanted a full bear market after the full bear market before he'd be convinced to get in, and no doubt he'd be even less likely to get in if it crashed significantly from the $3000s.A few months later when price was around $10k, another coworker who I had already shown the long term charts that showed how Bitcoin goes up a huge amount every four years so the crashes don't matter long term, tried to convince me to sell at $10k because \"what if it crashes now? it always crashes\". I was like uhh he didn't pay any attention when I showed and explained the long term charts and the market cycle to him.The average member of the public who doesn't follow Bitcoin thinks one or more of these things: it always crashes, it's too late to get in because the last big bull run was the bitcoin bubble finally popping, and won't buy until it crashes and then when it does they are too scared to buy and say they'll buy when it crashes more which they never will.",

And that's the start of bitcoin becoming more and more popular around the world.",

Yeah, somehow I didn't think of an image *facepalm*. Appreciate the help and the suggestions, I'll keep some of them in mind as improvements. I think most people are worried now about going to the moon instead of comparing the performance of stocks   but eventually bitcoin will stop going up... right?",

But Bitcoin is only best as an investment, and not as a currency system. If the goal is to invest and only invest, then your crypto portfolio will outperform all other portfolio of yours.",
