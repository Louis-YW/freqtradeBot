I don't gamble for money because I know it must be very difficult and I don't want to burden myself with that desire. I played gambling just because I wanted to have fun for a while and that was enough for me. Maybe you'll feel more confident by chanting the mantra so you'll keep doing it. But you have to remember that gambling depends on luck and not everyone can get that luck.",

I am still having this notion that mantra is just a fallacy with no prove of existence until I see to believe it truely exist. Bringing it to gambling if it really works I  narrow it to luck and nothing more",

If you hop on to a slot machine, maybe knowing whether it's taken a lot in without any payouts can work in your favor. If you're at the blackjack table you better be ready to play a perfect game or you will leak money much faster than you will to the basic house edge. Ultimately it comes back to having fun, unless you're walking into a poker tournament as part of your career then you have to understand that casinos and sportbooks are pretty good at calculating how to take your money, so go with the flow and accept some free drinks along the way.",

Yes, same with mine mate. I don't have any mantra every time i gamble but i always see to it that once i start to gamble, i'm not bothered and i don't have to entertain negative things as it could only lost my luck and that i could not focus anymore to the game. So while i am in the middle of gambling, i always think of winnings rather than losses but of course, whatever the result i am very much open about it.
