Better to get UST from selling your garbage USTC to the exchange site. Don't you have calculator in your phone to did a correct math about that? Mostly of people in here even smarter than you. It must be around 100 USTC  for 0,3 USD lol. What a pathetic scammer.",

This is obviously a lie. You have been informed about it before, so you do it with full awareness, which means that your intentions are not good. In other words, you're hoping someone will be stupid and you will scam him. Thats why it is scam behavior.Is it clear enough now?",
