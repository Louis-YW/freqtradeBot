The US government has more bitcoins in her possession than any other any nation in the world as state in a Forbes article. According to this Forbes, the US government is sitting on a stash of 207,189 bitcoin, worth $5 billion, by far the largest such state-owned hoard. Between 2011 - 2023, the U.S. has auctioned of some bitcoin holdings said to be worth $366.5. million. Other countries that have seized and sold off bitcoins holding are Australia, Germany, Netherlands.

      "body": "These Bitcoins auctioned are mostly seized by the government as a result of illicit activities of the owners as at the time of seizures. Most of them are drug related, money laundering, trafficking and lots more. While the auctioning is done, the government can generate revenue from the auctioned Bitcoin to aid in other governmental activities. These Bitcoins are auctioned outside market price possible higher or lower but I believe the binding price wouldn't settle for a lower price. One thing about this auction is that the guests are all invited and anyone you see there are strictly on invitation. So therefore it is not anyhow thing to start with as the government is fully involved in the process.",

I want to know, when the government of a country who have seized bitcoins decide to auction it off, do they auction the bitcoin based on the price as at the time it was seized or at the current market price which is the time it is being auctioned off?It’s not a sales but rather an aucion. The price will be dictated by the bidders and possibly close the current price or a little bit higher since we are talking about bulk purchase here on a same price which you can do on exchange with thinner volume. The government has no legal obligation to sell it on the price when it was seized since they need to maximize profit from it. Many institutional investors accumulate their Bitcoin holding from this kind of huge haul auction from government and miner that’s why the price is not heavily impacted despite some whale surprsingly manage to stash huge chunk of Bitcoin which in reality should pump the price hard if they purchase on the open market.",

It depends on the interest of the bidders and the worth of the auction goods. The government also wants to make a profit so will not be stupid to sell at the former price or below the current price. When the US government auctioned off 29,655 bitcoins in 2014, out of 40 bidders it was Tim Draper, who bought all and it was sold above the market value of June 2014. These funds are kept in the Department of the Treasury’s Forfeiture Fund and are used to finance law enforcement agencies, building and furnishings prisons, and support victims of crime.",

They are working with many agencies and other nations to implement strong rules and taxes over the Crypto, good luck to them. There exist Decentralized marketplaces where you can sell your Crypto for Fiat if you want or you can even use the Crypto Debit Cards provided by various exchanges, so pretty much you stay in crypto the whole time.",

Let's say the Mtgox coins are also seized because, after all, the US government can get a hold of those people despite them living elsewhere in the world. So there is much more than that 207,189 BTC.The old exchanges since the past decade I think also have a ton of BTC since the time when it was just so cheap that they must have accumulated millions like the Yobit exchange that still operates even today. I think they are supported by the Russian government because it's still not shut down.",

I do rather see that -10% of the market price is really that a steal. I did make some search on how bidding been made or been done then i found this.The Bitcoins were also only available for bid in nine “blocks,” each containing about 3,000 units. The government estimated these blocks would sell for about $1.8 million each.Source: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/government-auctions-bitcoin-silk-road-seizureThis is Silkroad seized Bitcoins btw.",

However, since these deals are too good for the buyer compared to market's prices, these auctions happen and most citizens don't even know about that.I say this, because the same happens with lands and properties auctions which are very common in many countries. I wouldn't doubt governments have their favorites, because not everyone will follow their publications closely to know auctions' dates, while people who are close to power will know about it automatically.",
