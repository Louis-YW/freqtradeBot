  "content": "Once upon a time people were mining bitcoin with CPU and GPU, while the last one is still used to mine altcoins. CPUs and GPUs are designed to cope with a multitude of calculation types, so, they weren't the most effective hardwares for that purposes. Afterwards, China-based computer hardware manufacturer called Canaan Creative invented the first application-specific integrate circuits, i.e. ASIC miners.To generate customized bitcoin address, you need power CPU and/or GPU and use softwares like Vanitygen, VanitySearch. Your GPU has more hashrate than your CPU to generate bitcoin address just like in mining and in other cases. Now, my question is following: Can we create an ASIC customized bitcoin address generator? An equipment with only one aim, to generate bitcoin addresses?",

Even if tomorrow someone magically snapped their fingers and it came into being and millions of these units were produced the odds of finding a funded address are still so close to zero as to be zero. -Dave",

To perform a successful brute force attack on an address, you'd need to know the exact bit range and the range should be very small.No manufacturer would waste their time and resources for such futile endeavour.

That is why they manufacture ASICs for mining some cryptocurrencies with different algorithms, because there is an incentive there and don't bother for some other altcoins since there is no incentive.It's the same for \"vanity addresses\". There is no incentive to create such a hardware since that won't sell. Nobody is going to pay thousands of dollars to buy a hardware that could create a pointless address.",

Cost-wise, i expect buying few FPGA and hire FPGA programmer probably would be better choice. FPGA usage on cryptography field is somehow common.

For example, first ASIC antminer called S1 had a hashrate of 180 GH/s. Now we have Bitcoin Miner S19 XP Hyd. with a hashrate of 250000 GH/s. Its hashrate is 1388 times higher then the hashrate of S1.Definitely, one needs tons of money to fund the research and this should be done silently, without leaking any info. In 2010 devices could rarely go higher than 1 GH/s, modern devices offer up to 250000 times more GH/s. But if we somehow invent quantum ASIC, we may hack addresses.Okay, I know I went into science fiction, just wanted to know if its possible to create an ASIC miner for customized bitcoin address generator. My question is answered, many thanks!",

The first BM1380 chip was 55 nm, currently, they are down to 7nm , there is not so much speed to be gained, and you can see that in power efficiency is starting to slow down, in 2014 the s3 was at 1j/gh, in 2017 the s9 was at 0.1j/Gh in 2022 we're down to 0.021j/Gh, from 10x in 3 years to 5x in 5 years and going further down.There will be further improvement but nothing \"dramatically\", much like BTC price, it has done x30 000 in 10 years but doing it again?  Quote from: Synchronice on March 20, 2023, 08:43:57 AMBut if we somehow invent quantum ASIC, we may hack addresses.No!

Better comparison would be comparing GH/W where S1 has ~0.6 GH/W while S19 XP Hyd. has ~48 GH/W which means 80x energy efficiency.I didn't keep that in mind because my main priority was comparison of hashrates.",

In addition to what you said, keeping all your private keys, seed phrases etc., is important because you might need to sign a message from one of them someday. I know, it sounds very improbable, but not impossible. Somewhere, at some corner of the Internet, you might have posted an address that is found years later. Someone might try to impersonate you, after 10 years or even more. Signing a message from such address can be lifesaving; completely paranoid, I know, but there's a non-zero chance. We live in a world where the Internet is about 30 years old. Who knows what historians of the 22nd century will look up and which purpose they will have in their Internet.

Even if you don't bear in mind the above, you gain absolutely nothing by freeing up the space a wallet takes (in both physical and digital formats).",
