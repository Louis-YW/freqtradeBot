I think I may have used the link from their twitter account on my 3rd try.Great it worked when there is a prefix \"www\" in the URL. Their dev should just use redirection to the URL with \"www\" to avoid getting this error and to avoid lossing their potential users. It's easy to config for www redirection though.",

The webmaster might have picked the domain with www. when launching the site and failed to create a redirection.",
