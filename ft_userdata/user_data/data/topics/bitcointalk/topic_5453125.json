Without Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency in general, life would not be as simple as it is today for me because there is not job opportunity in the country and if  someone have the opportunity the wages/salary scale is too low in comparison to how expensive things are in the country. Infact Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general have been a great benefit to the world because many unemployment nowadays are in the crypto industry doings one or two things.",

In reality. I give kudos to it for that. But within myself, I always believe that even without crypto currency being in existence, with the level of hustle a lot of us have out there, we could have actually been able to figure out something for ourselves. I don't know what, but it's actually a reality, because when something seems not to be working for us and the end result of what we are actually doing is not giving us our preferred result, we always seek an alternative option.Crypto has helped a lot of us, giving us a great opportunity to standout, save, and earn more money, adding to whatever we are also getting from our daily or monthly pay job. It has indeed been a helping hand to the uplifting of most people's financial backgrounds right now.",

Yes in reality and naija in particular, APC government has failed the masses expectations. And if really the citizens of 9ja voted for APC government in 2015, it was because of the CHANGE they proclaimed at that time to overthrow Jonathan and the people were expecting APC really changed things in the country but irony was fully found in the government. But we thank God for cryptocurrency that came and change the narrative of the government for the interested youths in the country. Bitcoin investment has helped me in the absent of government work.

You were because I believe too well that there must be a way out for people to be financially free and gain freedom. Now talking of our government, we know the usual way and we must not talk about them all time because we already inside and what I understand is that \"whatever you don't paint green would never benefits you\".
