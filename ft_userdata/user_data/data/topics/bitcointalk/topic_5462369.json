  "content": "I was sharing my testimony with some of my neighbors last two weeks, that thought BTC will not cross 14 years before it will disappear like other cryptocurrencies and it has crossed 14 years and some months now. BTC be the first cryptocurrency I have started my journey with in the community, it has helped me to seen wonders around me, feel greatness around my believe and it will live forever to fulfill purpose in the world. I received text message from my neighbors this morning, that they have seen many reasons why BTC will live forever and they want to be part of the decentralized currency in this period since they have some huge amount of money they are not using now than to invest them in BTC till it will cross to 20 year old before they can sell to share their own testimony. I believe many people here also have testimony to share about their BTC journey and how people try to discourage them but they still go ahead to embrace BTC. For what you have seen so far in BTC, do you think it will live forever? and if it live forever will you be part of those who will love to share the good news to people? You opinion is highly welcome.",

We can say that bitcoin will live at least until we live.",

I received text message from my neighbors this morning, that they have seen many reasons why BTC will live forever...Whatever that expression of yours means, I honestly don't know about Bitcoin lasting forever. Though I know it has come to stay. I know this from the evidence that Bitcoin is the bedrock of this industry. Whatever makes Bitcoin disappear will kill the entire industry. It's going to be tsunamic. But that isn't stamping it that it will last forever. Nothing on planet earth lasts forever.Quote from: Upgrade00 on August 07, 2023, 02:43:24 PMIt will be great if we have a troll account that calls out some of this ridiculous stories about how their neighbors asked this or that about Bitcoin.

A regular account can still point out any shenanigan if spotted. Though I must confess that some of them do sound convincing. This also could pass as someone else's reality. It isn't that bogus it can't pass that test remotely.",

I wonder why they all take these made-up stories seriously as appealing to the forum members to gain favour or qualify for future favours as against the real discussion which is bitcoin and its fundamental role in our financial life,Â  I bet also that some of these newbies are mistaken bitcoin to be a crowdfunding thing, that needs to be promoted,Â  which is not what it is,Â  so no need for makeup stories let newbies face the reality of time.",

You opinion is highly welcome.mate, nothing endures forever. ... nobody can assert, as you did here, that anything like Bitcoin will endure indefinitely. Are you going to believe someone if they come to you and tell you what will happen to you or someone else tomorrow? No, I understand that you consider what that individual said to you to be significant since you think he didn't know what the future held. Therefore, the answer to the question you were hoping someone would answer is still true today: nobody can predict what will happen to bitcoin in the future. We can only conclude that bitcoin existed even before we were made aware of it, and we remain optimistic that it will do so in the future.But it's best to just state that bitcoin is here to stay. The claim that we simply made that prediction would not be accurate. It may seem that we are skirting the issue, but that is not the case.",

Well, there's nothing really wrong with it but ofcourse it would be better if they'd show proofs in line with the story they are telling which would make it more reliable. Purpose? Anyone could create a good story but not all could create a meaningful one not only something filled with bias. Such thingÂ  creates unrealistic impression towards this industry. They are indeed knowing its benefit but it should not be benefit alone. Many people are still getting up of their assumptions because of what they have heard or learned. Ofcourse if things would continue developing in this technology, then that would be the best. But forcing it out will not do us any good.",

But now if you look at this generation, many people are aware of Bitcoin and they have good knowledge about Bitcoin. As op said in his post, Bitcoin has passed about 14 years and few months. So he said that bitcoin will never end or maybe the op meant that the popularity of bitcoin has grown so much or maybe we've been through almost a century so hopefully it won't stop easily so maybe that's what he meant. I would really like Bitcoin to live long and its popularity will increase many folds so that our young generation can have a better understanding of Bitcoin.",
