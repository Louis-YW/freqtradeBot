This means that bitcoin can become a millionaire if people invest in it at the right time.Investment can bring profit or loss. If you start in a bear market, exit in a bear market, likely your net investment will be loss, not profit. If you start around a bull run, exit in a bull run, I am sure you will get profit. Like your old brothers did and got recently.But risk is risk and it is not small. DCA can help you to invest more money in Bitcoin and can help you to get profit. Only invest (with DCA), don't trade.Use that website for DCA https://costavg.com/Dollar Cost Averaging with costavg.com include exchange feeThat website is great because it includes withdrawal fees from exchange. You should not leave your bitcoins on centralized exchanges.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

I think bitcoin is a bright future for us.Congratulations on your brother for making the right decision at the right time. Surely, Bitcoin can give you a solid ROI but as always there are risks involved...as Bitcoin is very volatile digital asset meaning it can go up and down anytime and even for no reason at all. Bitcoin is known to an investors' haven as there is a big potential to make a considerable profit here...but you must act when it is good to act and always listen to the market and maybe even listen to your gut. Anyway, holding on to BTC with the idea of 2024 being a bull year due to its halving and the possibility of ETF approval can prove to be the best decision to do. Note: this is just my opinion.",

This means that bitcoin can become a millionaire if people invest in it at the right time. Whether the story you tell is true or not, we can conclude that Bitcoin can bring someone to the stage of financial independence. But what you need to underline is that Bitcoin will not bring someone quick riches. The moment your brother took is good because maybe he understands how to invest. If you only look at the potential you can get from Bitcoin without learning how investment works, then the worry is that you will experience the opposite of what your brother did.Quote from: BD Technical on October 26, 2023, 02:10:53 AMI also bought some bitcoins myself and did it by withdrawing money from the bank.

I think bitcoin is a bright future for us.Wherever we are risk is something that is normal especially if investment involves the use of money and the risk will definitely be much greater. Taking risks in Bitcoin investment is interesting, but you also have to have a way to stay calm and not panic. Difficulty earning money is a process that is currently happening because many places providing jobs are experiencing problems in the current economic conditions, therefore our skills and methods are the steps that determine everything.",

BTC is fairly stable at $28k-$30k. it happened for quite a long time. If your brother is impatient with holding his Bitcoin, maybe he won't get that big of a profit in a fairly short time.",
