  "content": "What do you think about PEPA?They claim to be the first ethical memecoin that aims to bring attention and attempt to solve global issues through, Sharing, Community strength, and Positive vibes.What ethical mean? they try to spread message like this (that it's agree with my idea):\"Explain Why there is never enough money for Poor people, but there is ALWAYS money for Weapons\"with reference to the current vicissitudes of war.There are some hilarious NFT on opensea which depict the powerful lords of the earth in a green key, my preferred is Trump one or Gheddafi one . There's a forum too, but is not too much used.sure it's a practically useless token, but at least it has a little underlying meaning.If you want to loose 10 minutes of your time take a look at WEBSITE:www.pepa.funPANCAKE LINK:https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xE9565D3Ddb04089c08A73173449446e2dd31937bNFT OPENSEA LINKOPENSEA:https://opensea.io/collection/pepaworldhttps://opensea.io/collection/epicalmemeAUDIT:https://www.cyberscope.io/cyberscan?address=0xE9565D3Ddb04089c08A73173449446e2dd31937bFORUMhttps://pepatoken.freeforums.net/",

      "body": "QuoteDesigned to bring attention to global issuesAka pump and dump money grab that's going to rug all the participants. Where exactly are the ethics on this? Are they donating to somewhere or something? Talking about memes and patting yourself in the back because you think peace is better then war has nothing to do with ethics. Sounds like there's no plan except holding your hands virtually. They could actually turn this to something good, but from reading the web page it looks like even they don't know what that would be like. Changing one letter from pepe doesn't make this original meme either. They are basically taking away only thing what makes meme coin honest by trying to say it will have more gravitas. Thing that annoy me more than meme coins is meme coins pretending to be more than just memecoins. Stay away, it's a money grab.",
