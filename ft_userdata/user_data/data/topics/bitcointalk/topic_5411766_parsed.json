  "content": "Hi, my name is Luigi and I have cancer.I have been diagnosed one year and a half ago. The mass I have is located in my chest, and as of now it is 16.6x9.9cm.It's decreased during this year because of the therapy I decided to take. My therapy is not chemotherapy based, but based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. And, based on my exams, this is working out... slowly, but it's working out.In Italy we have free healthcare, but... out free healthcare sucks. If, with cancer, you take the free healthcare path, you're given the easiest treatment and the cheapest.So, to improve my chance of surviving, I took my own path. The therapy costs me $2800 per month.After almost 2 years, Italian INPS (the institute that takes care of taxes) decided to investigate me, and Binance decided to block my funds. Basically, in Italy, if you hold more than 50k€ anywhere you have to pay taxes on that and name every investment you've made. I did it, but my papers were \"non compliant and very unspecific\" and they blocked my funds. I am fighting since months, but Italian justice is DAMN SLOW and as of now I can't afford the therapy anymore. At this point, leaving this therapy is a death sentence.I feel sick, so I don't have a job, I don't have a bank account and my friends donated me all they could.I'm not here for you to tell me that I was stupid... I know I was. But I couldn't think properly in the situation I was and I still am.I try to ask for donations in a few ways but nobody cares and I'm not that well known or I'm not that good advertiser... so I failed miserably.I even made an NFT that no one purchased:https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/71972852343825529982360624475141218836500796076084685084187045309915336802305I can give every IRL contact, social media, number, everything.Photos and documents, if needed, of my condition.Pretty obvious, I will pay with my assets when trial's over. In September they resume it, and, if not postponed for some stupid reason, in November it's done. And there's a 100% chance I win that, because they just don't understand shit about crypto and they believe every crypto investor is a fraudster here.You can choose the %, I honestly don't care.",

What i suggest you do is find a job and actually work to get that money, it's not gonna be quick and easy but it will atleast work.",
