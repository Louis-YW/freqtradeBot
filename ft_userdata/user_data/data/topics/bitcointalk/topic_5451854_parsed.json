  "content": "Hello, I hope I am in the right board to post this & I really need some advice, I am relatively new to this.I am using Bitcoin Core 22.0.0. I had an issue with Armoury 0.96 after I imported a private key which would not send to a deposit address on the network, after importing the private key I did back up the Armoury wallet with a paper backup. After importing the private key to the Armoury wallet the balance showed correctly in my wallet. On the blockchain address the bitcoin still sit unconfirmed, after trying to send them a bitcoin deposit address.I did get a message saying the transaction fees might be too low & to try again but the same message appeared over & over, I did see the link to report the issue to Armoury but instead i tried to reseach the fault & ended up loading Armoury 0.96.3 over the old wallet, that did not work so I reverted back to 0.96 & the wallets that I had are still there but the one with the imported private key is now showing no bitcoin balance.i have tried to import the private key again but it says the address I am trying to import is already part of my wallet, can I get the coins back?I also tried to restore the paper backup on another PC but the balance says zero.Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.",

If the balance still remains unchanged in Blockchain Explorer, then you know you might have a lesser problem.",

      "body": "Hi there, thank you for your respone & I wonder how do I make an exact copy of the key? do you mean in the wallet or do you mean the private key that I used to import the coins from the cold wallet?I can say the coins are there unconfirmed on the blockchain, you can see they were redeemed but they remain unconfirmed. Is it possible get them back to my wallet now they do not show in either my original Armoury wallet or the backup on the other PC that i tried to restore?I am thinking because I reedemed the bitcoin from a cold wallet to the Armoury wallet, but did not get to send them on the network to be confirmed that they are lost, even with a backup?",

If you can confirm that they are still unconfirmed, then you don't have anything to worry about. The blockchain network is very congested this time around, and confirmation seems to be slow, especially when you use a very low transaction fee to execute your transaction. It might take forever before the deposit finally arrives at your other address.I will also suggest you try to install electrum on either the mobile or PC version, which will use your backup phrase or private key to import it into the electrum wallet. If the address is the same, you will see your unconfirmed transaction showing as pending over there and how many confirmations have been completed. From either wallet, you can view it, provided that it has been recorded on the blockchain.",

Providing that your private keys are safe, I don't think you have anything to be worried about. If the coin doesn't pass at least one confirmation, there is every possibility that it will reverse back to your wallet.",

Let's say you have made transaction A and that's still unconfirmed. You make transaction B and spend the fund received in transaction A.As long as the transaction A is unconfirmed, the transaction B can't be confirmed and if a miners wants to include transaction B, they have to include transaction A too. If you make transaction B (which can be a transaction to your own address) with high fee, so that the combined fee is high enough, miners will include both transactions in the same block. Combined fee rate is equal to the total fee paid for transactions (the unconfirmed transaction and the new one you make for doing CPFP) divided by total size of them.",

      "body": "Quote from: Tigerbill on May 08, 2023, 04:43:22 PMHow do I pay more in fees when the BTC has left the walletIf you used Armory 0.96.5 to create the transaction, the RBF (Replace By Fee) flag would be on by default, meaning you can \"respend\" your inputs as long as the original transaction has not been included in a block. The transaction would show in a teal line in the lobby's tx ledger, and you would be able to right click it and pick the RBF option, which will let you update the fee.If you still have coins in the wallet, you can also choose to CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). This is a situation where you create a follow up transaction that spends from the unconfirmed tx (typically your change within that tx) and pays a high fee. This incentivizes the miners to confirm the parent tx (low fee) to get the fees on the child (high fee follow up). In essence, it \"pulls\" the first transaction along.To CPFP in Armory, you need to set the user mode to expert, then in the \"Send\" dialog, the \"Coin Control\" button will appear. In there you can pick those outputs that are eligible for CPFP (they're listed in their own subtree) and create a transaction that \"pulls\" them in.To summarize, you can:- \"respend\" the inputs if RBF was enabled at tx creation- \"pull\" the tx with a high fee child if it has a change output",

It's possible that a node has your transaction in its mempool while another node doesn't have it. Whether your (unconfirmed) transaction is shown on a block explorer or not depends on whether or not they have your transaction in their mempool.",
