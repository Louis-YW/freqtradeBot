  "content": "Since we have new members joining this forum on a daily basis, I believe it would be a good idea to remind them of a way to check their merits over the previous 120 days, as I am sure some forum members find it difficult to manually count their merits, unless they use BPIP Extensions. I believe that using the manual technique would be inefficient since it would take too much time from us and we might get confused while calculating, but this method merely requires you to search for your username, which would disclose your profile's details.Although I believe that some people still use the manual method of counting their merit, I think that if we use the method I'm about to provide, it will be simpler for us to know our merit count as well as other information like the actual number of merits we sent out and the number of merits we received.You may find out who the forum user with the highest merits is, as well as the forum user with the highest level of activity and the most trusted person on the forum's trust list Here.Screenshot 1.This is how it looks when you enter your browser and search for this link, press the plus sign, and enter your bitcointalk username.Second screenshot will show you your profile information and your merits count.Although I know that so many users are used to these links, I just want to drop this as a reminder because some users do find it difficult to count their merit in the last 120 days when applying for signature campaigns.",

It's pretty good for viewing merit earned ranking and other rankings as well. This thread should belong to the Beginners & Help section. I believe those who visit Meta regularly know about BPIP, and they know how it works. If you specifically think about the service, then yes. It should fit into the service discussion. But OP may have arguments because this service is exclusively for BitcoinTalk users. So, if Suchmoon or ibminer create a BPIP thread in meta, It should be okay, just like Talkimg thread. Since this thread does not come from BPIP officials and somehow reminds/teaches people how to get information from BPIP, I guess this is a bit better in the Beginners & Help section.However, Installing the BPIP browser extension is much easier to get information like earned merits in the last 120 days, Check DT Status, Check Earned merits, and Go to BPIP, Ninjastic and Loyce.club with one click, so you don't have to search for the username. I am unsure if anybody uses them, but I find these five buttons useful. Want to check user info on Ninjastic? Click \"N,\" and you will be forwarded to Ninjastic.

This is true for the most part, but the only statistic I question the validity of is the \"most recognized\" one.  I absolutely refuse to believe that I'm the 9th most recognized member out of the millions of registered accounts.  It isn't the number I question but Vod's algorithm used to generate it--it might have been the best way to quantify forum recognition when he came up with it, but if I'm that high up on the list then something's wrong.  Aside from that, it's extremely useful if you're tracking your stats on bitcointalk and I am glad that Vod created it before he left the forum.  Is suchmoon doing any updates or coding work on it?  If I'm not mistaken, Vod left the website in suchmoon's hands but for some reason I'm never 100% certain about that.",

That really was so difficult but when I came to know about bpip I was feeling like dumb. But we all learn from our manual work. Note* I did not noticed this topic is 120 days old but I got the notification of moving this topic here so I came here read it made post but I think it won't be a problem if due to my post this thread would be bumped, as it will help new joiners to avoid the hurdles of doing task manually.",

Actually, this topic was not posted on this board before, so I moved the topic here for more recognition and for beginners to learn more, and I believe it is difficult for some people who are using mobile phones to install the BPIP extension. You see, if they are able to know this one, it will be easy for them to count their merits in the last 120 days when applying to the signature campaign. However, BPIP.org doesn’t only contain how you will count your merits in the last 120 days; you can also know some information about your account from the start.",
