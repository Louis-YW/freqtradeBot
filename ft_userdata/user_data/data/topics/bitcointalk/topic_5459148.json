  "content": "I see news about NASA warning of an internet apocalypse because of the solar storm.If the internet apocalypse happens no doubt it will severely damage the global communications system. and also all traditional markets will crash hard. It will also happen to bitcoin. But I don't think the internet apocalypse will do a huge damage to the banking system. because we can do banking things manually. because there is physical money we can touch. So I don't think this will have a huge impact on the dollar or physical currencies. However I want to know your idea of what will happen to the bitcoin network if the internet apocalypse happens. when we compare bitcoin to traditional currencies. Is this going to be the disadvantage?(Please don't mention other consequences here. Just discuss the bitcoin network, price impact, banking system and traditional market.)-update-there will be no internet apocalypse- https://www.space.com/sun-solar-storm-internet-apocalypse-debunkingThanks for your responses mates.",

I think  this is a clear one for local banks against bitcoin  else, bitcoin  always stands as a liberator from local banks slavery.I don't know the chances of NASA's warning coming through  but since it's a warning, I believe  there are still possible ways to cover come this.",

As space is vast the likelyhood is rather low that a massive Corona mass ejection event (CME) will actually hit earth, but shit can happen.If our infrastructure can't cope with it, so be it. Something of the magnitude of the Carrington Event is rather rare. There have been CMEs of dangerous magnitude sampled and observed by the Parker Solar Probe but which missed earth (fortunately!).Satellites might get damaged but that's not the end of the Internet.",

If this information is true or might happen for sure it will have huge negative impact to crypto industry since it runs by the internet, you could say some could do offline with other devices, still the msrket itself will be affected since you couldn't even see a real time results. Where in banks, of course it could also affect them big time since almost many people rely on online transactions for their own convenience. When it comes to recovery of course banks would have recover first due to it could be done in actual transactions where people are obligated to do transactions on site.",

All of my work is online, hell THIS is a work for me, after all I am getting paid to write here, there is no secret there, every one of us are getting paid to write these, we can't do that if there is no online world, no tech, no nothing like that.

We also can't use Bitcoin like now because Bitcoin requires the internet and without the internet, we can't use Bitcoin.We might go back to traditional currency or maybe we'd go back to the old barter system. It will be a setback for humanity because we will have to start again to build the infrastructure. But I think the government can still use the technology because they might have anticipated the internet apocalypse happening.But whether it will happen in our time or the future of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren and hopefully, it will be a very long time from happening so we can still find a solution before it happens. And I'm sure scientists are still looking for a way if it happens in our time or our children later so they can anticipate it well.",

This present generation is so attached to internet usage that the banking sector is no exception. If the internet goes down in any way today, the banking sector will also be affected. It will cost them a lot of money to go back to the traditional and local ways of executing transactions and the old-school way of recording. Now data is being backed up in an online cloud, which requires the use of the internet in order to be accessed. Both inter-banking and international transactions will also be affected by the internet shutdown because the internet is needed to send and approve requests for those transactions. Going back to the old ways of going straight to the bank and making a cash withdrawal, which will cost you almost your whole time, where the accountant will have to be opening files upon files just to find your data where it's being recorded,",

So I don't think this will have a huge impact on the dollar or physical currencies. Transactions in fiat is heavily reliant on the internet. Majority of transactions today are made through credit cards, direct mobile transfers and USSD codes. If there was an internet black out the damage will be huge on the banking system.Even the cash transfers are heavily funded by mobile banking to make the cash available at ATMs and POS stands.Within a few days there will be such a crisis and more people will begin hoarding the available cash they have a hand.Quote from: SirJake on July 09, 2023, 10:43:07 AMHowever I want to know your idea of what will happen to the bitcoin network if the internet apocalypse happens. when we compare bitcoin to traditional currencies. Is this going to be the disadvantage?It will certainly be a disadvantage. There has been some alternative means of transacting with Bitcoin that have been discussed but none on them can replace regular transfers using the internet to broadcast the transactions.Maybe at such a time efforts to get an alternative will be intensified, but pending when that happens it will negatively affect price and possible halt all trades.",

But if you want responses from some people here, I can only give my view that the banking sector will also experience difficulties if the internet apocalypse really comes and most people will also experience difficulties because now there are so many people who rely on the internet for their business and in marketing whatever goods they have. So all sectors will experience difficulties if the internet apocalypse really comes as said in the news, although for now I still don't believe in what is said in the news.",

Seem a very self-fulling forecast in the future where if the government wants to do something they could just lie about it and let the people know it's something only NASA knew.But are the internet connection under the seas where there are huge cable wires down there connecting all the computers around the world? Sure that storm wouldn't scratch a butt.https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60150/10-facts-about-internets-undersea-cables#",
