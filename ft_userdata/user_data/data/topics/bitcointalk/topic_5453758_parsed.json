      "body": "They only can seize your bitcoin if they arrest you and get your keys then sweep it to their wallets.They can have easier seizure against your bitcoin if you store your coins on a centralized exchange. They can send an official request to that exchange and get the exchange support to seize coins in your account. However, people must know that they don't have any coin in their account on an exchange. It is only a number and the centralized exchange will only send coins to you when you submit your withdrawal.If Interpol, governments can control that centralized exchange, they can seize any coin in the black list.Like many Tether USDT was seized so far. They have easier works with centralized stable coins.PSA: Most Stablecoins Can Be Frozen, Even in Your Own WalletsStable coins and blacklistshttps://dune.com/phabc/usdt---banned-addresses",

      "body": "Looks to me more of a list of standard things to look for when doing a search and seizure.They were already coming in to get things with a warrant / court order. Makes you wonder if they were loosing cases or not getting what they came for because the people doing the raids were missing things that they should have taken.In the end however, it is trivial to hide a seed or private key in such a way that you know about it but the police will never ever be able to find it. And if they do, unless they know how to get to it will more then likely destroy it trying to get to it.However, as we have seen many times here. People are lazy, it's on a piece of paper labeled private key. -Dave",

      "body": "It's really funny how these law enforcement agents are just getting their hands full of work for nothing. This kind of law is telling their associates to treat every suspect as a criminal, as if someone stole something from the government and every piece of material could be used as evidence and help them wrap up their case. (That sounds ridiculous.)And how do they intend to do this, by the way? Are people really that stupid, or will I say very lazy, to make their phrase and private key very noticeable? Or keep it in a very open place that anyone who worked in for an arrest will just see it and go away with them, or will they have to forcefully take it from their suspect in every way possible (that will be a human rights violation)? I really don't think it will make more of a difference from what they were actually practicing; only those who are not careful enough can apprehend their holdings.",

That way if you are ever threatened with arrest, prison time or even a $5 wrench attack (adjusted to $9 wrench due to brrrrr induced money printing) you can give up the smaller stash and keep your big stash.You have a good idea here, sir, but to be honest with you, in my country, you had better not even give up anything to the police or military force, like showing or giving up like 5%; they will just assume you still have quite a lot more holdings before you were able to give out five percent. So, if maybe the level of torture was just 10% before you gave up the five percent holding, they will increase the torture state to 50% just to forcefully get the information they want. There is this popular phrase in my country that says, \"If the police torture you, you will confess both what you are guilty of and what you are not guilty of.\"I know that some countries' police are friendly, though.But based on what you said, I will likely go with your idea, share my asset into two, and hide 95% of it somewhere safe (that they can't access). The remaining 5%, I will not even give it up to them freely, but I will just keep a bit of a difficult trace for them, which they will still find out for themselves. So that when they do find out the 5 percent, they will themselves be convinced that that's just all I'm holding. If they doubt, let them keep searching and torturing me; they will never find the rest, and I will not say any sh*t to them.",

For some reason, I always thought that having a cold wallet obliges you not to keep it at home (since law enforcement agencies have additional questions, such as \"where is the private key, etc.\"). I have one and I don't keep it at home, just like private keys.Things get a little easier if you live in a private house! You can easily pack and bury or concrete these things in such a way that, if necessary, they can be obtained within 5 minutes. Important note: you need to save at least your Bitcoin address (online) that you could replenish the balance at any time (without opening the stash).",

Maybe not the private ones to directly have access, but watching via the public addresses.Except for the 1%, maybe 2% of folks that really know what they are doing, I would guess that the vast majority of people storing their BTC does not do so in a truely private / hidden way.",

When you leave yourself clues how to decrypt your wallet you leave clues to expert too.And just like it says, they are going to look for anything that resembles passwords too. And for sure they are using every possible combination for brute forcing in every way they can think of.I am thinking that Vitalik was on to something by giving half of the privatekey to someone he trusted. It might not stop interpol but i don't think Vitalik would need to stop them as he is legit.",
