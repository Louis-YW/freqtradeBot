  "content": "This might not be applicable everywhere but in my Country Nigeria i can attest to it.Land price is ever growing and its supply is gradually reducing(limited supply) which has helped pushed the price more,unlike some fixed assets which depreciates in value with time.Lands in the time of old was barely of any value. Something man just met and didn't know how valuable it is. In the past, couple of decades ago the prices of land were cheap due to its abundant supply in my country but now to buy a land is not something one can just wake up and do. Its very expensive especially in developed areas and even the rural areas increased the prices because demands is getting higher than supply. A land that could be bought for #5000($3.8 ) is been sold in millions of naira (>$2000).This phase of growth to me could be likened to Bitcoin, while Land is in the physical realm Bitcoin occupies the digital. During Bitcoin inception its price was zero,many didn't consider its value but as times goes on the world started seeing its importance and many smart individual are holding already. It reminds of grandparents who kept their lands for years and later sold to school their kids abroad or improve the status of their family.Now the price of land is so high that it would be difficult to get some acres by an average family but not Bitcoin. Since its divisible one can buy as little as a dollar and enjoy the privilege of fore fathers in getting their land at a relatively low cost.Land was an opportunity for the past century and still till date, Bitcoin is one of ours. We were fortunate to be around the era where it can be bought by anyone. So try to take advantage of it.Land owners who didn't enjoy their investment paved a great foundation for their children.Bitcoin supply is limited like land and would continue to grow in price as inflation continues to affect the world.In my country, especially in products gotten from lands like agricultural products, the law of gravity doesn't apply. As it rises yearly, the increase continues.Buy now and don't start waiting for huge dip before entering. Trust me you would miss out.There are people that sold their lands around 5 years ago and are regretting not keeping till date.In the case of having a land, i believe leasing is better.Its better for your regret to be not buying more than for it been not buying at all.How's the price of land in your country?Have you ever thought been in the time where land was cheap and bought alot?Are you boarding the train(cheap) of Bitcoin holders or you want to wait for private jets?",

What I don't like to invest in land is, there are many gangsters in my country that cooperate with police, notary, and banks. So let's say I bought land and have the proof of ownership, there's a possibility someone can claim my land using other proof of ownership. In Bitcoin, you're safe. As long as you bought the real coin aka BTC (not BSV, BCH etc) on chain (not BSC, MATIC etc) and you hold it in non custodial wallet, you don't have to worry.",

Whether you prioritize the stability of land or the potential growth of Bitcoin, it boils down to what aligns best with your financial goals and preferences. Having both is better.  Land provides a tangible asset with historical appreciation, while Bitcoin adds a digital dimension with its potential for significant growth.",

These are the two of the most reliable and profitable source of investment. This stands true for most of the countries not only to Nigeria.",

I think it was Michael Saylor who explained it in great detail regarding the comparison. Buying Bitcoin now is something that could create generational wealth for you & your family.The ROI around bitcoin is by far greater than that of a land. A land can appreciate depending some factors like locations which most at times Take years to develop, yes bitcoin can also take years before a massive ROI is possible but bitcoin also has the ability to overturn that in a space of year. Let’s look at last year bitcoin rise it did an almost 3x from $16k to $46k, landed properties cannot do this. But also bitcoin with this volatility is also what makes it a risky investment because you can simply go in and decide to take your money out immediately it might have dumped then. Now here comes the advantage of less volatile assets like land you can simply get it sold off at just anytime and the worst case scenario is not getting any profit on it except maybe a natural disaster rocked that place. So I am seriously with the opinion that while we at taking advantage of bitcoin ROI ability we should be diversifying it to other assets like land to help make one’s portfolio better",

It's true that land and Bitcoin are two different things entirely as one is digital and the other is physical but that's not the point of the thread, am from Nigeria too and I can relate well to what the OP is saying, land purchase has been a major game changer for citizens here in my country as it's yield huge profits because the land actually grow in value overtime just similar to the way Bitcoin has gotten so much value since from the time of its creation. Myself I can testify to this because I also involved myself in the opportunity of getting a piece of land in an area not too developed some years back having the faith on it bringing me good returns in the future like the way most Bitcoin enthusiast HODLs their coins and I was not wrong also and if not for the fact that I build on that land the price tag on it was 5x the original amount I used in acquiring that piece of land.",

One thing you got right is to encourage people to own BTC stating that it would be a life changing decision in the long run. In my own analysis I don't think it would be appropriate to put Land and BTC in the same stream as pertain investment.Land is a fixed asset and BTC is not. The fact is the price of BTC fluctuates and it is volatile whereas land has a fixed price this demands on so many functioning factors and the region in question.To own a landed property is a decision that marks your territorial advantage.

I don't know if there is any comparison between land and Bitcoin because there are a lot of differences. In an actual sense, the supply of land doesn't reduce over time as you said because even if land is sold from one person to another, the land still stays in the supply but it might just vanish from the market for a while until the new owner decides to sell it again. So the supply of land keeps fluctuating which isn't the case with Bitcoin because Bitcoin has a fixed and limited supply.Another big difference is the investment size. One doesn't have a choice to invest as low as they want when it comes to land or real estate, but even today, you have the choice to invest as low as you want in Bitcoin because the minimum you can buy is $10 in most exchanges which means that it gives you flexibility when it comes to investment size.",
