Personally i wouldn't use one with negative reviews, nor one that uses cloudflare...I personally use the mixer in my signature from time to time... I know, they do pay me, but i wouldn't promote them if i didn't trust them. Other than that, i use wasabi wallet aswell to do some coinjoins, but the company behind wasabi started to blacklist unspent outputs which the community disproves of. It's up to you wether or not you trust them. I personally still give them the benefit of the doubt (since blacklisting unspent outputs is not equal to stealing from somebody), but i do understand people that stopped using them.",

It means it's harder to use on a lightweight client (perhaps apposed to services like bisq which would let you convert to xmr/grin and then back later without needing a long sync) - but I'm not sure if bisq suffers privacy issues for being spv (which is the reason reddit seems to give for joinmarket needing a node).Joinmarket looks like quite an interesting new project and it'll be interesting to see how that develops - especially if centralised mixers become easier to censor.",

So, i don't know if there would be an extra attack vector if you have a virus anyways... If you have a virus that steals data, it wouldn't need Wasabi to send your data to the virus writer, and it probably wouldn't matter what wallet you used anyways, if it was unlocked the virus writer would probably be able to find an attack vector no matter what wallet you were running (unless it's a hardware wallet or an airgapped one).I see more problems with the censorship part than with data stealing/virus problems. I mean, if your system gets compromised you're in trouble no matter which desktop wallet you use...",

They'll change their statements and their rules whenever they like to suit their ulterior motives of neutering bitcoin and controlling their populations. We shouldn't rest on our laurels and assume that we will never need anything beyond coinjoins for maintaining privacy and censorship resistance. Coinjoins remain very open to attack, not least of all from the centralized coordinators themselves, as we've seen with Wasabi.",
