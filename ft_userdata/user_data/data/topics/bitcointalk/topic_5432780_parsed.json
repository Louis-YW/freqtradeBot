Pestilence, famine, war, conquest all the horses of what our Abrahamic leaders at the top caste tell us. Fill in the blanks.",

IMF reports from IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva already suggest and warns that this year will be tough economically in most countries  due to recession.Quote\"For most of the world economy, this is going to be a tough year, tougher than the year we leave behind,\" Georgieva said in an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that aired Sunday. \"Why? Because the three big economies — US, EU, China — are all slowing down simultaneously.\"She added: \"Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people.\" Read hereThe warning is not to promote fear but for everyone to prepare and position themselves properly for the year. On a personal level, some people will still experience growth financially even in this year that has been predicted to be tough, I like to see myself as one of those persons.",

The loss of both human, material, and time resources because of the pandemic affected the economy of most nations negatively. The war in Ukraine has caused a rise in oil and gas and some important agricultural products. Putin just declared a 36 hours ceasefire to allow the Orthodox Christians to celebrate Christmas but Kyiv has rejected the offer. But we pray that this would be a good sign of peace in a few months. It could also be possible that Bitcoin Bullrun might begin this year. If this war ends and Covid-19 doesn't resurface, 2023 would be a good year. Let's just be optimistic.",

For example, we faced a tough time during the pandemic of COVID-19 when the survival of humanity was at risk due to the coronavirus, but we made it through it. Similarly, strong willpower, sound strategy, and planning can make you strong enough to overcome any worse scenario and let you pass through it quickly.",

It also affected the price of crypto currency. 2023 is starting on the same pace but there is strong hope things will turn out good before the mid year.

The world economy was also impacted by the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Therefore, in my opinion, those who have survived the hassle of 2022 should be considered heroes. I anticipate that the global economy will start to pick up a little bit in 2023.",

Damage is already mostly done and we have prepared for the worst for a long time. Also i don't see this as a game where individual tough people will survive, but more like a team effort which is crucial for our survival right now. Right now we need to work together to get pass the worst.",
