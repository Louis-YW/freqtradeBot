Although, I wouldn't exactly describe the price of Bitcoin stable, literally ever. It's known for its volatility, and to some extent that's by design for now. What's for certain is news like FTX isn't exactly great for consumer confidence, especially when we're trying to convince people that Bitcoin is a better alternative to fiat.",

If you see in past whenever btc price falls, traders do withdraw their coins in private wallets many people even trade based on this data using cryptoquants. But I think so far the sample space for this data is pretty low. I have seen many times this metric of Bitcoin exchange reserve ratio falls and yet price keeps on falling as well. So not very sure if this is the right indicator to judge or not.",

Bitcoin is only for panicking. When something awful happens in the crypto space, people panic and begin selling. You can see the issue with Luna, which has crashed the entire crypto market, as well as the issue with FTX, which has also crashed the entire crypto market. In such cases, people seem to prefer to liquidate their cryptocurrency. As a result, there would be a massive sell, which led to a massive dump.",

Not except your looking at it from the part of demand and supply where, you've got an inverse action depending on what constraints is in play. I don't know if you are following up OK OK am implying but, am rather talking about the total supply of some BTC21million. That is hardly called limited nor have effects to the reset surge and bear moves as, its always remained fixed that way.The drastic moves you see of recent is largely traced to the issues of FTX. People having to realise that the phrase, \"not your keys and not your coins\"is for real and the dangers in having so much coins stored away on an exchange and a centralized exchange at that. People finally arr trying to play it safe.",

So there is less money to buy fewer coins. Net impact is neutral but ... it all cause lower liquidity on exchanges = more volatility = more risky asset = more fear = fewer investors = price goes down.I don't agree here and you've actually contradicted the first part of your post with the second one. If according to you less liquidity means more volatility and more volatility means lower price then the amount of coins on exchanges does matter. I'll add that less coins on exchanges is always good. Think of it like this:More coins available for sale > bigger sell walls > more fiat needed to break into higher pricesLess coins > much easier and more frequent short squeezes > higher possibility of price manipulation but also higher and more frequent pumps, wider price ranges.IMO more coins outside exchanges is good because it suggest more people self custody and as a result less coins being possibly lost or stolen. It's also better for traders because they're the ones that love volatility. I'm not a trader and I don't care if the price range is wider and btc goes up and down by 100% in a year. I've seen it in 2017, 18 and 19 and was fine with it. I kind of miss it now.",

But in the environment that we are in right now, this isn't so surprising.People want to get their bitcoin and any others coins off exchanges immediately from actions of the past week.There is even a PSA on the top of the forums put up due to these series of events that wasn't there the last time I was on here at the beginning of the week.Which exchange might I ask were you referring to with these sort of orders totaling 0.5btc per trade? They must be a regulated one because non-KYC exchanges have probably limited their withdrawal amounts from those events occurring.",

And any coin that is out of exchange can be deposited in 10 minutes, so thousands of bitcoins could be dumped on the market before you blink.So, people taking their coins out of exchanges won't necessarily cause a bull run. A bull run in Bitcoin generally happens when there's a surge of demand, not when there's a drop in supply.",

It won't cause a bull run but it won't cause a breakdown either. It may also start a pump because with less coins on exchanges volatility goes up. A pump like that is followed by new deposits of people who wanted to sell but held on their wallets and the res a correction but that's all normal.
