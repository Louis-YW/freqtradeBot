My people how Una see this matter.Na true wey you talk say when the parties apply for livestream of the court proceedings say court no gree but now dem want go live. Anyway, then and now no be the same thing. Me and majority of us been want am like that then unto say we want to dey get updates by ourselves but the court no gree. Them refer to the constitution say no where e dey say make dem take court proceedings to public, so the constitution already kill those application natural wey make them dismiss am. Them say such decision na at the discretion of them wey be judge to decide and there oga wey be Mr Tsammani say that go dey bring drama and people go dey carry court do caricature for the proceedings.So I think say now wey dem want go live na because no be proceedings. Na judgement e be meaning say the lawyers no go dey involved unto all those lawyer dramas. Anyway make we hope say Wednesday go be a bright hope for the youth and the poor. People dey suffer in the midst of plenty.",

Dem bin raise our hope high by announcing say dem go use BVAS for di first time, but las las na person wey dey control di BVAS na him run di show. So like dis I no go like make person come give me another hope with dis presidential electoral tribunal. No be di same running party na him set up di people for di tribunal? How are we sure the tribunal committee have not been bought? Like dis I no get any expectation say di tribunal go do di right thing.",

Truly all eyes d on tribunal. The whole world is watchingWhatever the outcome of the presidential election tribunal  judgment on Thursday 6th go be d for tribunal hand to determine how Nigeria go end up becoming. Whether em go continue to be a democratic state where the rule of law is practiced or something else.I smell danger to happen if the tribunal goes contrary to the finding accusation brought before them in which they are going to carry out their final judgment. If they tribunal judges try to deviate from the truth, make we no d surprise to see wetin happen for Gabon, and Niger, to happen for our country(military taking over the country) in no short time. For peace to reign, make the judiciary give the right judgement so that everyone for the country go d happy sae our judiciary d work. As em d so the fate of our country as a democratic state d their hand.",

Make we never despair, tomorrow fit better for the majority of Nigerians because we know say no be them Nigerians vote for.
