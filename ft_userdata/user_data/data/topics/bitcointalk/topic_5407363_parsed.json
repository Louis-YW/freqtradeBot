Proverbs 14:23In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty.'' According to the netizen who shared the clip, the pastor got a professional to train congregants on crypto. While boasting that such an opportunity can't be got anywhere, the netizen expressed joy that 'kingdom wealth is on the way.' In the clip, a projector is seen displaying a crypto trading chart while people listened. https://www.legit.ng/people/1478160-crypto-chuch-pastor-tutor-train-members-crypto-church-video-stirs-reactions-social-mediaDoes this look like  a plus to the crypto community?",

Historically, churches have been responsible for education in many places, so the mission of giving knowledge (and not just the knowledge regarding a specific religion) has been implemented by churches for a long time. That being said, we currently live in quite a different world, where there are plenty of schools and other education facilities. Also, while teaching about Bitcoin and blockchain would be good, I am not sure about trading specifically. Trading is something that can lead to losses of money, and no prayer will save people from that.",

This is wonderful to read and something that I wish other religious leaders can emulate instead of only being spiritual all the time which can get boring and scare some people especially the young ones from Church. If more churches emulate this and engage the youths more in activities like this that they see are contemporary and have physical benefits to them and their lives...More youths will not leave their churches and will find Christianity more practical and not boring.Also the involvement by the church can also help change the minds of those extra religious person's who have never believed in crypto.",

Moreover it’s also great that when people manage to hold their money in a decentralised manner.Really appreciate everyone who took this initiative.",

In the clip, a projector is seen displaying a crypto trading chart while people listened. Does this look like a plus to the crypto community?    The pastor teaching the church about Crypto (how to make money) in order to escape from being enslaved with poverty is a one.Recently Just in my own story too, A pastor friend in my local church met me in the house that they're going to have a training section (an entrepreneurship week) for secondary school graduating students and other children in the Church, that he would like me to join and share my skills to the children as well, So I told him that I only got a digital skills to share, that it's all about digital asset investment in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency, I was a bit surprised when he said that is okay, that there are many students that will fit in that category and they're already on ground.When I got there and gave them lectures on Bitcoin, I was really shocked with how the children catched up and the pastor begged I should come back next time to complete the lecture. Bitcoin is money and money is used in the church, so if Bitcoin becomes the future of money as we hope, then even the church will make use of it.This is how fast Bitcoin is growing.",

Otherwise, one would observe that you praised the action of the church in organizing a crypto lesson for its congregation. Why call it bizarre then? Anyway, I believe the church is in order educating its members on current happenings around the world as it concerns financial awareness and uplift. The church shouldn't be heavenly bound that it forgets it's still on earth with all its earthly challenges. If the congregation is taught financial stuff and it prospers, the church prospers with it too, vice versa. It's a simple logic and the leadership of the church knows that.",

First of all I appreciate your thoughtfulness in reminding me about where I was supposed to post my thread, but let me remind you that wherever and whenever cryptocurrency is mentioned the first thing that comes to mind of majority of people is  Bitcoin before any alts could follow.On the other hand my friend, whether clergyman or not, the whole truth is that the whole teaching took place in the  Church, so I think you're just being too religious about the whole matter and rather diverting focus from the message the thread introduced to some irrelevance.Thank you.",

I hope that every church would have this kind of awareness because, to be honest, some religions link cryptocurrency to 666 which sounds crazy. I really wish that more churches would be open to crypto adaptions and see it as a key to financial freedom in the future.",
