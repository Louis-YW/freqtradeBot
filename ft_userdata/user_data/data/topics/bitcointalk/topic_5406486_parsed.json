  "content": "A non-fungible token from the CryptoPunk collection has sold for a staggering 2,691 ETH ($3.3 million), defying the bear market.This has marked one of the most valuable NFT sales of all time despite the fact that the industry is in the doldrums. The purchase has pushed the floor price of the CryptoPunk collection higher. The collection has seen a resurgence this summer despite the fact that sentiment toward NFTs has soured. Another rare CryptoPunk was bought for $2.6 million earlier this week. Last June, a CryptoPunk NFT was sold for a whopping $12 million worth of Ether.Read more on U.Today https://u.today/what-bear-market-cryptopunk-sells-for-33-million",

Huge price sales meant to draw in fomo should not affect one, if you have been in the crypto space for a while. Even if there is someone willing to pay millions for a token or artwork and you do not see any value in it, then it is what $0, and you should not care about it.",

Today the 24 hour Bitcoin volume is $23 Million and it's 8 times higher than this NFT, do you think $23 Million is a small number? why Bitcoin price doesn't increase if the volume is big? lol.Actually most people sold their coins on bear market because they're fear if Bitcoin price could be lower in the future, if you look at the graph and trading volume on CMC, you will know.",

If you are collecting real physical pieces of art then of course it is totally different because then you are the only one owning that piece of art and you can touch it, but with NFT's millions of people can have the jpg of that NFT on their PC or whatever and the only thing that the owner has in comparison to those millions of people is a string of code withing a blockchain that is identifying him as the owner.Also like others in this thread already mentioned, i also think that it is very likely that this was just a wash trade or something between two addresses of the same very rich guy or between two rich friends or something.",
