  "content": "In 1976 president Jimmy Crater put his family business in a blind trust, in order to avoid conflict of interest while being president, in 2025 president Trump has launched two meme coins for his family taking full advantage of his position and not having a care in the world.This is why they wanted Gray Gensler out, not because he was anti-crypto as Gary was actually a true bitcoin maxi, a dying breed even here, during all his reign he was pro-Bitcoin and antishitcoins, he went exactly after the exchanges that would list crap like $melania and $trump without a sweat, a coin with %80 locked and just %10 distributed to the public with a single page than in its disclaimer says stuff like:QuoteTrump Memes are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol \"$TRUMP\" and the associated artwork, and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type. GetTrumpMemes.com is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign or any political office or governmental agency. CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively own 80% of the Trump Cards, subject to a 3-year unlocking schedule. CIC Digital LLC and Celebration Cards LLC, the owners of Fight Fight Fight LLC, will receive trading revenue derived from trading activities of Trump Meme CardsAnd now, they are free to do whatever they like, they have put a shitcoinlover and a pump and dump lover in charge of the SEC that is on the payroll of all the exchanges that are fleecing users buying this crap and everything is better for crypto right? Satoshi must be proud of the situation, I'm sure he is clapping with both hands this milestone as the greatest achievement he could dream of!But if you still think that's not a big deal, let me tell you how this will go from now:This is Trump advisor, pumping a tiktok coin, selling then all his coins because it was going down and then he says he is sorry   /endAnd because the guy in charge of the SEC that was going after guys like these and was asking for laws to punish those that would shill shitcoins and exchanges that would list such obvious scams is now gone, here you have, much freedom, such token, wow reality!Enjoy decentralization lawlessness!",

      "body": "Yes, I don't like the current situation either. Meme coin is the highest degree of cryptocurrency degradation. Bitcoin is based on advanced technologies and decentralization of mining, storage and development. Also, the value of the first cryptocurrency is due to the huge energy costs of the Bitcoin mining process. And what is the value of meme coin? I am afraid that the actions of Donald Trump and his friends will lead to people becoming disappointed in the first cryptocurrency. This, in particular, will lead to a drop in the price of Bitcoin in the future. In the worst case, Bitcoin (and the very concept of private money) will be completely discredited, which will give the next generation of US politicians a reason to introduce CBDC (digital US dollar).",

As a person who holds a very sensitive position, it was insensitive of Ryan to make such a post. Other leaders in the world are watching and the next thing is for the first family of some countries to copy what they have seen. There should be some law against this just to prevent abuse. Despite this, the principles of cryptocurrency should be applied- invest what you can lose. And if you do otherwise and lose don't come wailing. It is noone's fault.",

It will be quite funny to see crypto enthusiast losing money to non-crypto enthusiast, all in the name of promises. Thank goodness Bitcoin isn't in this class.It is less than 24hrs since I made the reply above to a thread about this whole $trump coin, and your thread @OP still proves the same point. I actually had the same thought, because we all know that something like this wouldn't happen in the first place, as Gary isn't the type that smiles at projects with obvious intentions. Fine, we all know that Gary has his own tough side, but it seems some bad sides also have good sides as well, which would have made him question Trump's agenda.I have a friend who is currently at loss, after buying both shitcoin due to FOMO and overhype. Like I said, \"it will be quite funny to see crypto enthusiast losing money to non-crypto enthusiast\".",

But understand that Wall Street has always been running scams, Ponzi's and pump and dumps.A multi-trillion dollar fraud known as mortgage-backed securities lead to the 2008 financial crisis, and the US government bailed out the fraudsters and bankers running that blatant fraud. That is why Bitcoin was created, in response to that massive fraud and is the only legitimate crypto.

You could even see that his wife launched her token. I mean! Wtf?",

For me the scary thing is how the newbies or those coming into cryptocurrency will be onboarded, the narrative that they will actually get rich quick will most likely be spreading around. Yesterday they were many newbies who made four to five figure profits from initially buying the trump token with $100 or less. This opens door for them to actually start going for trades like this instead of actually studying the use case properly. This also onboards new and many scam projects through using influencers names for memecoins creation. I can also see many scammers already projecting that can sell signals for early calls like this.Seriously no matter what or how we all know memecoins are just pump and dump I think Trump actually getting involve definitely shows he knows nothing about cryptocurrency and careless. This isn’t surprising at all because I have also been singing this “trust politicians at your own peril”",

Bitcoin is a universal value, a decentralized protocol for transferring value in the virtual space. In my opinion, Bitcoin has a very bright future. But this does not cancel the scenario when, as a result of Donald Trump's actions, the first cryptocurrency will be discredited (even if for a certain time, over time people will be interested in it again). I still think that Donald Trump's main goal is a strong US dollar, not a strong Bitcoin. Also, Donald Trump and his friends are interested in promoting a centralized cryptocurrency created by large American companies. They do not need free Bitcoin.
