Since OP is not here, I will try to answer logfiles and SaisherQuote from: logfiles on March 15, 2023, 11:50:28 PMFor starters, How much did you deposit on the site?His last deposit was $1199.QuoteHow much did you stake?His last bet was $20QuoteHow much did you win? He lose the bet.QuoteHow much have they let you withdraw so far? Not sure if he has withdrawn before. But, it seems it was not his first deposit since he said his \"Most recent Investment was $1199\". The case at a glance. OP deposited $1199 at 1xBet and Placed a $20 bet which he lost. Meanwhile, He triggered KYC and submitted the KYC. After one week, He got an email from 1xBet saying his account was closed but would let him withdraw his funds. He deposited $1199 and placed a $20 Bet. He should have $1179 in his account. But, When he logged in to withdraw the funds, he saw only $153 in his 1xBet Balance. He is looking for help even though we know it's a scam casino. @OP, Correct me if I am wrong. Also, Please follow the scam accusation report format as aioc suggested.",

Sorry to say this of you had been here long enough you could have able to see that or are you a member here who have been adamant to the warnings and after being scammed you opened a new account for complaints? So sorry about this because I see the possibility and tendencies that you would get help to FasTrack solution to your  complaints here is minimal as it is already a known thing here that 1xbet is a scam casino. Just accept that in good fate and move on.Nevertheless, you are making complaint without any proof to back up your claims so how do you want members of this platform to believe you. Be factual with your complaints mate.",

I start to wonder if they really put efforts in researching about the casinos they are about dealing with. They do not in any way attempt to check on reviews about this particular casino to know their true state and what people are saying about the casinos they are about identifying with. They just get registered because they saw the advert on bonuses or someone told them that based on referrals. After getting registered and being scammed, they look for this platform to start crying and complaining for possible help. I have no doubt that most of the newbies complaining are old members that are fully aware of the 1xbit scam activities but still pay deaf ears and when they get scammed, they disguise themselves in a newbie account complaining on being scammed.",
