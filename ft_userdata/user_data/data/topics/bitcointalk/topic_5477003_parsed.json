  "content": "It was in 2021 that the president of El Salvador Nayib Bukele decided to invest part of the nation's treasury in the purchase of Bitcoin and it seems it's already paying off. According to data from Nayibtracker.com, a website dedicated to track the performance of El Salvador Bitcoin, stats shows that the country was 3.17% up when BTC crossed the $40k mark on Monday amounting to profit of $4M from total investment of $127M. With BTC now trading slightly above $43k, the country is surely in massive gain. With expectation of approval of spot Bitcoin ETF and the post halving implication on the price of BTC, experts are looking at BTC hitting a staggering ATH of $100M and if this should play out, Nayib Bukele nationals will obviously be in a good state because that will contribute immensely to the country's GDP which ultimately will improve the standard of living of the people if resources are properly managed.With more people from El Salvador keen on investing in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general because of the country's friendliness to crypto, more exchanges are already finding their ways to the country but it's important to note that activies of cryptocurrency exchanges is being regulated in the country. I think regulatory compliant CEX can take advantage of this opportunity to build a great influence in the country.If Bitcoin should hit a new ATH and El Salvador profited greatly from the bull market, I have a feeling other countries might be forced to embrace crypto. What do you think? Let's discuss.",

A 3% yield is much less than inflation and much less than US bonds. You could say that realistically their investment is still underwater despite the fact that bitcoin has gained 170% over the last year and is probably approaching its mid-term ceiling. Moreover, to talk about profit, positions have to be closed, which affects the price and reduces real returns.Quote from: Palazodeen on December 08, 2023, 05:17:06 AMWith BTC now trading slightly above $43k, the country is surely in massive gain.

Currently, the profit is about $4 million and represents 0.014% of GDP, and even if bitcoin reaches $100,000, which is by no means certain, the profit will amount to $180 million, or 0.6% of GDP which is far from \"contribute immensely\".",

If the price rises, you will find news headlines saying, El Salvador has become a rich country because of Bitcoin investments, the country has gained billions of dollars from cryptocurrencies, or exactly the opposite if the price falls, Nayib Bukele is wasting tax money, or How El Salvador lost billions of dollars in useless investmentsBased on investment numbers and total public debt, we find that Bitcoin alone will not improve the economic situation of that country.",

And since they made the news when legalizing Bitcoin in 2021, who wouldn't know what would become of them when Bitcoin is now rising in price? Â Mind them, I hope they would be more practical and strategic this time that Bitcoin is showing them love, the coin has shown them a deficit rather than a surplus in terms of the number of years they have possessed it. I will continue to wish them luck!And I hope many of the citizens purchased and own Bitcoin as well, if not, this will still amount to nothing, only the government will gain the riches. It now depends on what they use the money for.Quote from: Palazodeen on December 08, 2023, 05:17:06 AMWith BTC now trading slightly above $43k, the country is surely in massive gain.

We can't ascertain that now.QuoteIf Bitcoin should hit a new ATH and El Salvador profited greatly from the bull market, I have a feeling other countries might be forced to embrace crypto. What do you think? Let's discuss.With the challenges faced as El Savaldor held their Bitcoin in more loss than numbers of time held it in more gains, I think it's still not an encouragement for countries to join it. Normally, some countries would join Bitcoin, even before now, some African countries were planning to purchase their coin, but the current price must have discouraged them even as they regret not buying it when it was still very cheap between 2022/2023.I will be careful at this point and I believe their experts in the field would have told them as well. It's not about buying Bitcoin alone but buying it at a reasonable price.",

For the fact that individuals, businesses and now El Salvador, as a country has adopted it and it's profitable for them shows that there's no going back on a decentralized digital currency to compete with top fiat currencies, and possibly take over in the near future. I also hear that the president of Argentina, is a bitcoin enthusiast, hopefully he can also adopt bitcoin into his country's economy, this will also be a step in the right direction.",

All countries that are bitcoin friendly are part of what are helping the adoption.This is one news that most AntiBitcoin wouldnâ€™t want to duel on the most as it has some positive effect to the bold move by El-Salvador and to the El-Salvadorans but, with the fact that the goal isnâ€™t fully achieved as, Bitcoin isnâ€™t the sort of investment that you would always want yo take profit on (of course you might but) with the idea that, there is more to profit over the bullruns that one might encounter in the market as time progresses, you would want to hold up a while longer and thatâ€™s it.One good side to help you persist in the system has been, not to center your focus on Bitcoin for survival funds or hope that it be the power to finance your day to day and as a nation, El-Salvador has got more than enough resource outside crypto investments yo enable them make this achievement.If this be the reason why some nations would be hooked up, Iâ€™m not sure but, I feel it should have. Perhaps by some means, to have a good portion of their reserves in Bitcoin.",

We even have to assume that the 1 BTC purchase per day is still a thing, dispite there being no proof of it, lacking any transparency that is not originated to a mere Tweet from Bukeleâ€™s account.If I recall correctly, 150M $ were assigned to a Trust to provide liquidity to the Chivo System. The Trust was used to make the initial bitcoin purchases to allow for btc<->usd conversion, and has more of an operational connotation than a mere hodl appeal to it.By the above I mean that, unfortunately (and even more so for the local population), we donâ€™t really know if these purchases are still whole, if they can all really be sold, and if any part has already been sold to cover these or those expenses.",

Countries or companies investing in Bitcoin have been criticized by many people, but they have made their future investments and are now starting to make a profit. Sometimes you shouldn't listen to anyone because the people you listen to are not always right. Making bold decisions in life is not easy, but if these bold decisions are also the right decisions, then you have the chance to achieve real success.We will hear that countries and companies investing in Bitcoin make more profits in the future.
