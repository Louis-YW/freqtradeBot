  "content": "Who does not like a Job that make you an Ambassador ? Who does not like the yearly Salary of $160,000 dollars ? You will not like it if you are making more than $160 K in a year. But, I am speaking on the top of your income if you are working for yourself and making money out of Botcoin business then why not becoming a recognised and appointed Bitcoin Ambassador and get paid for representing Bitcoin to the Governments around the world officially ? Think about it. I was Monk for years, then I have chosen to become a Digotal Monk .  Now I am considering myself to become a Bitcoin Ambassador Officially. Ofcourse, you might ask me who has appointed me in this position and who is going to pay me $160,000 dollars a year ? Well, it a Bitcoin confidential for a short time. In other word, I have appointed myself as a Official Bitcoin Ambassador. You can trust me or nor but I am considering this post for myself for the times being as I have decided to become the Bitcoin Ambssador. Soon, I am going to make the Official Announcement. I will also appoint another 300 Bitcoin Ambassadors who are interested to work in the Bitcoin Embassy in a Official capacity. If any one want to become a Bitcoin Ambassador and work with me as a fellow Bitcoin Ambassador then you are invited to contact me. Do not worry about who is going pay the salary to the 300 Bitcoin Ambassadors ? That is my duty to find money to pay you for your work as an official Bitcoin Ambassador. There will be a budget for each Ambassador who will be commissioned to go to a foreign country and work closely with government and central Bank. Ps: if any one hackle me in this proposal, no mater who you are ?  I will not tolerate. You are here to support each others only. If you need further information ask me question. Thank you. First Official Bitcoin Ambassador aka Digital Monk",

I would just say to everyone, use the \"report to moderator\" button as often as possible, because that is the only way to communicate with such ambassadors.",

So I am looking for some one or a group of 3 or 4 people who can help me out to build a New Block Explorer Platform and I will provide full instructions with few new profiles that needed to be implemented. As some of you have mentioned, that I do not want to spend money for it, that is incorrect. I will pay a good amounts of money but I need to discuss the matter with them who can help me to build it. It is not just an ordinary Block Explorer but it will consist with many other features and transaction mechanism that will be within the New Bitcoin Block Ecplorer.",
