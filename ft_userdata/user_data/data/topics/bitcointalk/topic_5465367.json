Also those who have invested early have no doubt will say it's the most profitable to them.But there will be other investors that might argue to you that it's not the most profitable to them. It could be the altcoin of their choice that have pumped a lot and that's true. If you want stability and safety, Bitcoin is the choice and it is profitable no matter what happens to this market in the long run.",

But if you are talking about with the current market stance, I believe altcoins are more efficient on taking profits like can attain a 3x minimum for certain time even without a bullmarket season.

There are top altcoins such as Ethereum, BNB, Matic, OP, Arb, and others that also have the ability to give us profit in reality. So no matter what coins we trade at the moment, in my opinion, it is difficult to do trading on the exchanges because I also noticed that what is happening right now is pump and dump. If we are going to base it long-term, yes, Bitcoin is really good, but it should be in large amounts; you should have something to hold when the bull run comes. Otherwise, it's better to invest in top crypto, in my opinion.",

I just want to say that Bitcoin is the only decentralized currency with guaranteed investment. We generally know that there is no trust in altcoins. At any time those altcoins can be hacked or scammed. We've seen two major currency scams in 2022 where people lost everything. There is also no guarantee that such efforts will continue in the future with new coins. So there is no alternative to investing in Bitcoin to risk free your money.",

You posted this on the altcoin discussion board but talked about Bitcoin (BTC), LOL. I mean, let's have a serious discussion about this, whether discussing L-1 or L-2 projects which are the other pillars of the crypto side besides $BTC.",

So Bitcoin had its early days where the prices were very cheap and a dollar could get you a few hundreds or possibly thousand units of it, but its not at that point anymore, it has gained value over time through adoption and relevance. Just like Bitcoin, altcoins are at their early stages where their value is not yet known or shown/made public, although its not every project that will be succesful as Bitcoin but a comprehensive research will show you which is worthy of alternating Bitcoin with, if you can research more, you'll get a coin that has a more relevant value than the millions flying around with no indept token value or solution.",

But this is the Altcoin Discussion so I guess we should be discussing what Altcoin was the most profitable cryptocurrency of all time. I think it will depend on the era of entry. If an investor entered the cryptocurrency market during the time when Ethereum was way cheap then he is also reaping the rewards by now. The same goes for those who trusted BNB upon its arrival in the crypto industry. From literally cents to now hundreds of dollars it even went further by $600+ which is unimaginable. I have my share of regrets for not buying them at their inception but past is past and we just have to live with the present now and probably not make the same mistake again.",
