  "content": "After creating a JollyGood thread about a weird merit giveaway, I happened upon a thread in which merit was generously distributed to several accounts, and the strangest thing was that the accounts were already seen as one single farm.How it all started: An account brought up an old thread that has been dormant since June 1, 2022, at 05:33:23 AM. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=716530.msg62189264#msg62189264The newbie account immediately received 10 merits from the author of the theme, which was already created in 2014.The donator himself also made his first post since June 1, 2022, as he is also a newly awakened one. Previously, he distributed it to four users, after which the account itself was inactive.So, what is next?

      "body": "What is your point here, to collect multiple merits or want people to know you are doing better? This is just off a reasonable discussion as the guy who merited me has the right to distribute his merits the way he wants whether he's a consistent member or not, so far he has the merits and the merited posts are meritable. Also upon checking the guy's profile, which you just made me do, he did his best while he was active on the forum and ranked to Legendary level with no single trust issue, which is more reason why your post is so insensitive trying to drag him into the mud for your appraisal.For your information, I replied to a post (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=716530.msg62256635#msg62256635) just like any other post that has a recent communication. The Forex broker discussion was what even attracted me to it on that day and I was surprised the guy handed me 10 merits despite not agreeing with his view, which is my luck .I simply don't know when earning 10 merits on a single post suddenly becomes envious. Check the link that earned the merit and see that I wasn't the only one who was lucky to earn it on that day.You should have been more thoughtful before accusing anyone, this is a community where anyone could reply to posts without victimization or fear and I doubt if @capoeira has anything in common with those he merited. Perhaps you want to crucify him because a sensible person that might have other priorities engaged than being active here decided to distribute his merits instead of wasting them hanging there, something theymos even preaches against. Lastly, you can check my profile, I don't think I've ever merited any of these guys listed above before, or any of them have ever merited my post. I've even seen other boards which further prove we have nothing in common. This simply makes your suspicion baseless, you should have thought better and been sensitive before quoting me with them.",

These are the same Merit Simps that continually copy/paste stuff from Twitter in the WO thread and I'd say there's a strong chance that they all belong to 1 or maybe 2 people. They will appear in every single thread where merits are being given away freely, one after the other.As far as the merit giver is concerned, it seems like they woke up and felt like spending all their merits on accounts that \"contribute\" to their thread... nothing wrong with that, but when these farmers smell loose merits in the water, they circle around like sharks.",

I won't blame him for getting defensive like that without really understanding what @lovesmayfamilis was trying to pass across. I mean, I don't think anyone would appreciate being accused with subtlety. Recently, with the Deadsea33 saga, most users are trying their best to be as transparent as possible and if I must say, I think @EarnOnVictor has a point concerning how the high ranking users rush to conclusions on some of these things, some with little to no evidence to prove their claim.TBH, these approach by some of the legendary users who are trying to fish out account farmers and keeping the forum clean from individuals who may want to spam, scam and do crazy stuff is quite commendable but at some point, it's affecting those who are trying to go about their business on the forum. It might look like some of the newer users get attracted to these threads like sharks to the scent of blood, but some just want to participate in the forum and they get luck to receive merits for their efforts.",

I just had a look as almost all the users who received merits are from my local. However, the guy who (account) sent merit is possibly from Portugal as I can see he has written a post there. It more seems like a merit buy sell or account purchased and merit distributed. It will be a real shame if they are abusing (which seems obvious) as I can see some familiar faces here. I used to trust a few of them and now it seems one of them successfully convinced me to believe a lie in another case.",

Merit farming is possible - but the Bengali community may have grown to the point where they are supporting their community with merit from one user to another [friend, brother, sister, uncle, grandfather or whoever]. I'm thinking on the positive side - but if it's account farming, of course I'll condemn it.lovemayfamilis - I think the merit has turned to blood in the water right now. Hungry piranhas will smell it so quickly that they will swarm in and get it. Some other patterns of merit can also be found in some of the other local community board - it's not just about the Bengali.",

I have tried to understand why the OP of that thread gave away merits for literally no reason but I have been unable to come to a conclusion.One of the things I noticed about that merit distribution in that thread was fact that several accounts tagged with negative trust.Even the Gigabit account received 10 merits, speaking of which I hope he makes another entrance on the loginsam45 and his alleged alt-accounts: ltcrstrbrt, GigaBit and bluedeep  and state if he can/cannot sign a previously used wallet from before the allegation of hack was made against him.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on July 28, 2023, 02:19:54 PMSo, what is next?
