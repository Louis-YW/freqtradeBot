  "content": "Many people in the crypto market are still uncertain about which type of asset to hold onto for the upcoming growth cycle of the crypto market: Bitcoin or Altcoins. Additionally, they're wondering when to catch the bottom or exit at the peak. As we know from previous cycles, Bitcoin tends to rise first, attracting the influx of funds, followed by new funds flowing into Altcoins. However, holding onto Bitcoin might not yield substantial profits, and determining the right time to switch from Bitcoin to Altcoin for maximizing gains during the growth season remains a challenge.Now, I'd like to share a method that I have been using and find quite effective, hoping to share it and receive feedback from you all:First, I establish from the outset that BTC is solely for holding, not for selling. When BTC surpasses its peak and an Altcoin wave is on the horizon, all you need to do is put your BTC into cross margin and borrow USDT (not exceeding 50% of your capital) to invest in Altcoins.For instance, if you currently have $26,000, you could invest in 1 BTC and hold it from now on. Hold it until BTC surpasses its previous peak of $69,000, which would mean your asset is now worth $69,000. At this point, place the value of 1 BTC into Cross Margin and borrow $30,000 to invest in Altcoins. Borrow only $30,000 or even less, not more. This way, you can continue holding onto that 1 BTC as it climbs to $100,000 or $150,000, while also having $30,000 to invest in Altcoins. With the $30,000 borrowed, smart investment in Altcoins can potentially turn your initial asset into $300,000. You could sell the original 1 BTC that you held onto for $100,000 or $150,000. The combined profit from BTC and Altcoins could amount to around $400,000 - $450,000. After repaying the $30,000 borrowed from the exchange, you'd be left with $370,000 - $420,000.In summary: Starting with an initial investment of $26,000, you could potentially make $370,000 - $420,000.In previous cycles, I often found myself struggling to find the answer to the question of \"when to sell BTC and switch to Altcoins.\" BTC is meant to be held, not sold, and even more importantly, never sold for Altcoins. Simply hold onto BTC and when there's an Altcoin wave, use your BTC as collateral to borrow funds for Altcoin investments (ensuring borrowing remains under 30% of your capital). Now, with the increasing choices offered by the DeFi market compared to past cycles, this method proves quite effective for the strategy of using BTC as collateral to borrow USD for Altcoin investments.",

Most likely they will use floating interest rate than flat interest rate, so you will pay more especially you borrow for long term.What if it goes wrong? assuming you will need to pay $35,000 and you lose everything in altcoins, you're use the profit in Bitcoin investment to cover up your mistake.",

Altcoins are the same, majority of them are absolutely useless and they are all created for pump and dumps which are risky to get involved in.In any case, during the \"bull cycles\" if anyone wants to touch altcoins they should firs prepare themselves for the concept of pumps and dumps otherwise they will be dumped on and become bag-holders. It is of paramount importance to know when to sell altcoins and how to do it quickly.This is why we always suggest newcomers to stick to bitcoin alone.",

The crypto market is dynamic and the occurrence in past bull runs may be different from the expected one. Another problem will also be how to identify the altcoin that will give your targeted profit. The worth of many of these altcoins can disappear in no time. Don't also forget that during the bull run, there are high rates of scam airdrops targeting to reap off unsuspected investors. It is not good to put all your eggs in one basket but it is better to put all of them in a dependable one than to face the risk of losing them when it is put in uncertain ones. If you are not experienced in such smart investment moves, Bitcoin is the surest asset to hold. The profit from Bitcoin might not be as big as altcoin, but at least you are sure that your investment is safe.",

Altcoins investment Facts.1. Most altcoins don't ever see a new all time high again, once they do well in a bull market it's over for them.2. Most altcoins won't survive in a bear market, before a new bull market gets here they would have died.3. It's only in altcoins space that scams exists, there are many new projects that are showing up only to take peoples money and exit liquidity on the investors. 4. New altcoins brings the biggest ROI but they are also the most risky investment, if they go down they go down hard and fast.Bitcoin investment Facts.1. There is no reason to be scared of scam when investing in Bitcoin, it isn't a smart contract enabled project like Ethereum.2. Bitcoin always makes a new all time high.3. You only lose if you sell your Bitcoin, unlike altcoins that can go down and never go up while you holding them. 4. You need good amount of money invested in Bitcoin to make better ROI, Compared to altcoins, investing only 100$ in a good alt can bring you better ROI than investing 100$ in Bitcoin.",

I think if you invest in the new-age blockchain projects or the ones improving the existent blockchain the returns on your investment would be good. For example, projects like Matic, DOT, Solana, and others are very cheap at the moment. During Bull Run, you can easily expect them to generate a 2x or even 5x return. Another good investment if you can take a risk is shitcoins. There are many in the market, but some are being constantly promoted by a billionaire. If you invest in them, you might gain up to 10x return on your investment. IMO you should have everything in your portfolio for you to gain good profit in the next bull market.",

There are seasoned altcoin investors,  who know how to sell fast when it comes to the point of dumping, if you buy with them when the alts pump and help them pump the price the more, when it begins to dump, they will dump or sell on you before you know what's happening, leaving you with worthless coins.",

But if we're talking about investment such as Bitcoin and Altcoin, it would be the best to invest at coins that are really have the potential to reach x10 in the next years like Bitcoin. Cause I think putting some eggs in altcoins could be consider as quick-flip due to it's value it's too random so it wouldn't be a good idea to invest at it with a long term idea. I have loss some funds and profit as well in altcoins like the meme coins due to FOMO. Researching at some projects is actually good, cause having an alternative investment is still a good idea in case one's failed. You won't loss funds if you're planning to hodl it for long. But some coins couldn't even last years and could reach below $1.",

This does not give a guarantee that there is still a maximum return on investment when you buy bitcoin but the risk will be minimal when you buy and hold bitcoin for the bull run.Altcoins are known to always shoot up at the time of bull run, so people will like to take advantage of that not knowing that they are actually taking a big risk in their investment. Altcoins have little or no confidence to bounce back after experiencing a volatile market. Most of them leave the market if they cannot cope with the market. It is not an ideal investment but can be taken by measuring the level of risk you’re intending to undertake with investing in them.",

What exactly are you gonna be left with?I do believe it’s an amazing strategy but I also think it’s a 50/50 thing, it’s not a 100% sure it’s gonna go as planned, something could go wrong along the way which could amount to a loss. I just think whatever investment strategy you choose to employ, you should weigh the risks  as well as the success possibilities",

It's currently trending at $26,000, and a new ATH would get you to $70,000, yielding approximately $40,000 to $45,000 at most. It's funny how we're talking about thousands of dollars like they're peanuts. However, if your strategy is that simple and efficient, why doesn't everyone do it? I'm not trying to be offensive by any means, but no established altcoin, such as Ethereum, BNB, Polkadot, or many others, is going to go x10 in value either.You're mostly referring to pump and dump coins, or generally those that are hyped and are extremely volatile from the moment they're listed. Although it sounds like a great idea, it is not as simple as that, not to mention how risky it would be to invest $25,000 in altcoins that you may not be familiar with. The concept that Polkadot, for instance, or any other low-priced altcoin is more likely to double, triple, or quadruple in value is completely false because that would require billions in order to reach the necessary market cap and ultimately the price we're discussing.",

But keep in mind that Bitcoin cycles cannot be equated with altcoins which are easier to manipulate quickly. Even when the Altcoin bull market will turn things around 180 degrees. Therefore I did not include a budget for any altcoins. My goal is quite simple where the Bitcoin handle is the ultimate safest peak of pump and dump manipulation activity. Do you think we humans are perfect? who can endure beyond our means. I mean running bulls come and still Hodl? don't sell it at all, even if it's only 1%, then where is the beauty of investing in Bitcoin if you don't enjoy what we should feel because it's gotten to the point where anyone will take advantage first rather than just watching it. .",
