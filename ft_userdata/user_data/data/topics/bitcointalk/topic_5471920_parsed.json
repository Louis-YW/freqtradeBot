  "content": "I myself belongs to Pakistan community. In usually, We don't have our local board for Now but Hoping to have it Sooner.  Our Senior members    shahzadafzal , irfan_pak10 , Hamza2424 Leading Us very well. I am sharing the request link of local board where you guys can see our every months reports which is now is impressive rather than before.Re: Request: New Local Board for Pakistan (Urdu)But, this idea can be implement in other local boards for now until we get our local board. Many of here may ask why i am saying to create chlid board with the name of location. So, the reason is that if there is child board with the name of location we can create threads in it with the name of cities; Like in Pakistan Threads name be like in location child board in Pakistan....1. Lahore2. Karachi3. Islamabad 4. Faisalabad .....etcThese cities name may vary location to location according to the country name in their local board.By creating these threads in chlid board name with location we can held collaboration concerts or events by doing some announcements in these thread like where we want to held any coming event and maybe helpful to announce some important News in the cities thread related to coming events. This May be very helpful to increase the audience by inviting many of the people on these events. Where seniors will educate other people about this forum who have no idea about it like how much positive potential have this forum. I Myself really like this forum very much because as a joiner on this forum i get to know alot of ideas and knowledge from other member and even from other boards as well.So, for now this idea can be implement on other local boards by creating child board with the name of location. This may bring a massive audience on this forum and bring it up. Hope you guys like my idea. Many Thanks!",

By creating those childboards, you are dividing your people and your community into certain groups. Do you really want that? The best would be one board for Pakistan so that everyone can share their knowledge, their ideas, and their opinions in one place. My suggestion for you is to focus on getting a local board first.Imagine if everyone thought of creating child board based on their location like usa, russia etc. Do you realize how many child board will there be if that were to happen? It will only cause unnecessary mess.",

      "body": "Firstly, I think you’re missing the whole point of local board creation and mixing it up as something that is an individual country thing. The reason for local board is just to cover up for other languages that are not English which is the forum general language. This local board help members that aren’t fluent in English to understand and communicate well in the language they understand. So the suggestion that there should location child board will simply imply that every country should also have their own board too which is not the point of the local board in my perspective.",

Many Thanks  Like you didn’t read my post well also, local Board aren’t mean’t for different cities or different countries but rather for other languages. Take a look at the Arabic local Board all countries that speak that language can fit in there. So there is no reason to create a child board of different locations. You just discus in the Local board language.",

How will you expect them to unmax themselves in an event.Again,I don't think using physical locations would be a good means to organise any local board.",

The local boards are accepted only based on someone's language and the Pakistan local board is for Urdu language speakers and if gets accepted then the people from Pakistan will be able to create Urdu threads in their own local board.It's not good at all to create sub-boards in a local board where people from specific cities can talk about the events that are going to take place in that city and such child-boards can help spammers to create the threads which aren't even needed in a local board.The first thing is that the Pakistani people haven't got their own local board and I think it's important to have their own local board before they can post a thread in Meta to ask for any child-boards. The Pakistan's local board has been in exposure for sometime but still it isn't accepted by theymos and once it's accepted then it would make sense to create child-board request threads.The local boards are for the locals of a country who speak the same language and if Pakistan's local board is accepted then anyone from Pakistan will be able to create threads on their local board, but still most of the threads will have to be related to Bitcoin or crypto-currencies unless the local board also gets an off-topic child board.",

Yeah, well there's a point and I would like to mention to the OP, that creating such topics for whatever purpose doesn't necessarily need a special child board for each, if a user wants to discuss something in his locality he can create a thread, In his local board as we have by the name of Pakistan*.Anyway, I would be seeking more light on the topic of why he got up with this idea maybe there's something unique as well.",

For example, a man without a arm can't put on a wrist watch because he needs his arm to put on his wrist watch on his wrist. This it works too in school you must have a department before the courses. Hope for your local board first before you can think of having a child board. My country has a local board but we don't have a child board yet and we are hoping that Theymos will grant us that request.",

I can say that the best alternative to your idea is to create Meetups like this board https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=86.0, within which each person can talk about events related to Bitcoin in his area or city. This will be easier to familiarize yourself with Bitcoin and track local events by creating a topic for each city.",
