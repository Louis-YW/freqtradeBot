  "content": "What Happened: I found a scam website of Arkham Project in a Telegram Group where they are forcing community members to Join this Fake Arkham Token Sale. But as we know that Arkham already launched in the top ranked exchanges and trading successfully in Binance, Gate.io. So we should not fall in these types of scam by being greedy to get tokens in a lower price. They are asking you to connect your wallet which may be a cause to be hacked or stolen. So never be greedy and always verify from of official announcements. And it's quite impossible to launch a token sale when the project is available in market for trading.Scam Website Link: Code:https://arkhmtoken.com/auth/index.phpScam Site Archive Link:  https://archive.ph/YQQbAOriginal Website Link:https://www.arkhamintelligence.comWhy People May Fall In this Trap: Because they are targeting community members and they have built a similar website like the original one. And their phishing website link looks pretty genuine (my opinion). But when they ask to connect wallet it's really a sign of a Phishing attack.Here are the interface on this Fake site: Here they are asking to connect when you click on Launch Platform option: So I hope everyone will be from any kind of scam traps and verify if the website is genuine or not. And never connect your main wallet to any of these Phising sites. You have to remember that in future these sites will arrive with a new name. So awareness is a must for now and the future.Here is the Domain information of this Phishing Site: QuoteDomain:arkhmtoken.comRegistrar:NameCheap, Inc.Registered On:2023-07-26Expires On:2024-07-26Updated On:2023-07-26Status:clientTransferProhibitedName Servers:bob.ns.cloudflare.commira.ns.cloudflare.com",

Arkham is still trending in the crypto market so there is a lot of potential for scammers to successfully scam crypto users. Arkham is currently trading on all big exchanges so there is no point for traders to buy from the fake website provided in this telegram group. Crypto users should stay away from such scams and expose them when they find them so that other crypto users can be safe from these scammers. Keep up the good work OP.",

      "body": "All these scammers never know when to stop, as they always want to create scam tokens from whatever they see trending and making a big name in the industry. Was it not just a few weeks ago, if not just a week, when ScamViruS reported a fake airdrop shared on Twitter for the same project?I just can't imagine the kind of people that will fall victim to all these scammers, since most airdroppers are always desperate to make free money online, which usually leads them to a dead end as they end up giving the scammer the little they have over nothing.This kind of airdrop wallet connection is what I believe usually compromises users wallets, as their keys and phrases could be extracted by just giving approval to the airdrop dapp.",

Keep up the good work OP.Not only telegram but twitter also is the main social platform for promoting scam/phising site and project. Arkham is recently launched project having partnership with Binance and this is the reason scammers are trying to make fake website to cheat people. In crypto we will face many scam action but we should do own safety and should not allow scammers to break out securityAnother fake Arkham twitter account is also active Kindly report Twitter Profile:Code:https://twitter.com/X_TokenBNB",

Keep up the good work OP.Thank God, I only use Telegram for the SuperNotifier, I don't know if there's hope that Telegram will be able to purge their application of scammers and other malicious entities because it's been a paradise for these malicious entities for a long time and I think it should be time for them to start cleaning house but so far, nothing has changed. Only problem with these tip you got is the people that will read it, the scammers would probably find a way to make sure that unwitting newbies would buy in their channel like saying that it's cheaper to buy to them or that they are giving exclusive X token privileges if they buy there.Nice catch OP, your battle against the endless horde of scammers is appreciated by many.",
