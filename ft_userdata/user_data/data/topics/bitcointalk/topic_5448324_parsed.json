The main irony I realise is that in 2021 and 2022 most remained bullish with Bitcoin above $30K, and that was an accurate statement until price broke below in May/June 2022. At least that's when it became clearer that the bull market was truly over. Whereas now with price breaking back above $30K the bullish sentiment isn't exactly universally accepted, in fact many bears remain sceptical despite the move. Let's not forget that the initial Luna-based capitulation started around $29K, and price has since reclaimed this level. It just goes to show that while selling into capitulation can be a strategy in order to accumulate at lower levels, it's only ever been a good short-term strategy, rather than long term. No doubt most people who capitulated below $30K failed to re-accumulate at lower levels anyway.Aside from the fact that $30K area was previous support for 18 months, the fact it was also the confirmation of a bear market when broken below could well mean it can act as a confirmation of a bull market with price back above and is therefore somewhat of a psychological level. There remains many similarities with the capitulation from $6K in 2018, and we all know what happened when price reclaimed $6K in 2019.",

The only factors that I can think about that would mean that this run is not the true one, is the stops that the U.S will put in place to artificially strengthen the dollar in the short-term, or resistance at 30-40k+ levels. Skeptical is definitely the right word for it, though I have a feeling deep down that the disbelief is not warranted and that the growth should be embraced due to its cause being directly in line with what Bitcoin is all about.",

Furthermore, this is really a good start and yeah this indicates that the bulls are back. I'm thinking a mini alt season run but if Bitcoin starts to correct then alts will totally bleed back.",

LFG!!!Those are perma-bears, so I expect them to really go full retard with their bitcoin predictions, lol.But yeah, we have jump to $30k++ because of the anticipation from the Feds that the rate hike at going to be minimal. So it's good news that's they the price suddenly took off from a dull $28k in the last 10 years to what we have right now. Maybe this bears will have to come up with another excuse to say that this is just temporary jump. But it's better to just ignore them, again, they are perma-bears or anti-bitcoin so just let them open their mouth.",

I do feel like we may see a pause at this level for a while to allow for some accumulation before the next leg up. I agree with you, we may need some high liquidity to stay above that price of $30k+ for a while and while we are at that, we should consider some events because that is what will help us to prepare ahead of the next leg of the market, as we wait for what the next move and the direction Bitcoin is going to take we may have some troubles with price consistency at this point since it took bitcoin a long while to get to its present price.The whales will continue to accumulate more bitcoin as their journey along and wait for the next bitcoin market break out, while we expect price to Â increase we should also expect some level of market pull back at some point, since we cant continue in an uptrend price movement without some form of pull back at some point so we should be prepared for that too.",

Usually the early period is choppy. When we go from bear to bull there's still a lot of early birds who want to get some cash just in case this is a fakeout. I don't think it is, but market psychology can create some unpredictable panic moves, 2019 rally being a good example.The longer we continue, the more people will change their attitudes. Probably if we went to 50k there wouldn't be any \"it's a fakeout\" guys left and we'd instantly test 60k. All those naysayers who were waiting for 10k bitcoin would finally go all in.
