  "content": "On before now gambling was seen as a dirty habit and was painted black in the society because way back the society believes any gambler have so many bad habits too like doing drugs which most gamblers was mafias not just mafias but rich people .But in this present world now gambling is seen as a business which both young (+18) and old part in which in the old times gambling was base most times about money wasn’t base on sport but now is modernize into different kind of sport that why in west Africa there are so many gambling and betting companies because is been accepted by the public now as a medium of making extra cash basically gambling to me was for men but now you can see woman parting in gambling games which everyone in that habit believes each day he/she must make more returns than he/she has spent to stake just as an entrepreneur knows that risk management of any business he/she is operating,a gambler knows that their is high risk in every stake but their believes so much in good future that good must always come by that no matter the amount a gambler loses believes his coming will earn that triple times .So my question now is that can someone use gambling as a means of earning living?",

There are few people who take it as a job and are successful while others end up bankrupt and in debt because they believe in the thing called Luck and become addicted to it after few times of winning thinking they might just hit the jackpot again.But those who sees gambling as a profession don't depend on Luck but depends on continuous learning and studying and using logical reasoning and not being swayed by their emotions.",

A man who would decide to live by gambling without cheating would actually decide on a life in which his fate depends on whether the roulette will be black or red - even or odd, or how the dice will turn.One type of gambling where you still have slightly better odds if you play smart is sports betting, but that's another story.",

To my understanding is only the bet companies that benefit more from the stakers.",

But earn decent amount isn't easy at all. I have seen some statistics that show an average earn around 5-15% of total amount wagered. E.G. You need to play 100K usd in one year just to earn a normal wage for western countries... if you think it's like any other job around here. it requires time, effort, experience, ability to learn, passion and much much more.",

      "body": "It is generally not advisable to rely on gambling as a source of income, as it can be unpredictable and lead to financial instability. Additionally, depending on the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction, gambling may be illegal or heavily regulated, further complicating the potential for a steady income from gambling. It is essential to consider alternative sources of income that are more stable and reliable.That said, professional gamblers make a living from gambling, such as poker players and sports bettors. However, even in these cases, success is not guaranteed and requires significant skill, strategy, and luck. It is important to note that professional gambling also comes with its own set of risks and challenges, including the potential for addiction and financial ruin. It is always wise to approach gambling cautiously and seek help if it becomes problematic.",

It may be different in some other countries, especially the countries that are mostly guided by religion and gambling will still be considered a vice.There could be someone out there who just keeps winning either in sports or casino games, but s/he must have good counting skills to really make it a living. In sports, many are actually learning how to weigh the disadvantages and advantages of the team and they pick well to win, it's still a skill to learn.",

I think you know what I am saying... you described the reality of those who are into gambling in a few wordseach person has their own way of analyzing things, there are few people who manage to make a profit in this sports betting market, but I believe they have more businesses like: telegram channel where they talk about sports betting and charge membership, youtube channel , also write books and articles, and probably have real world businesses, so they don't just live off gambling, by that I mean you start by disciplining yourself and taking your gambling profits and putting them into other real world businesses that way you can livenote that if you are greedy and want to get high quick profits from gambling then you will lose money fast and you will be broke and it won't take long for you to start borrowing money and become addicted, the idea is that you get business on real world and play with small amounts as fun, gambling Is something very dangerous",

It's not already that surprising especially in the times we are in now where almost everywhere we go, we can still do gambling whether if it's physical casino or offline casino as there are a lot of established platforms who offers sports betting and as well as casino games.Although, I cannot really advice doing that OP because making gambling as your primary source of income may lead into some path that you wouldn't want to be in. It's still much better for us to treat gambling as a past time and to entertain ourselves so that we can avoid such experience and situations.",

Those games which require skills, knowledge and experience, have the chance to earn decently.But if you are talking about gamblers who are only playing luck-based games, I don't think they can rely their gambling activities to earn for a living.If you are into casino classics, don't expect that you will survive on these games in the long run, more than likely, you will lose your funds if you don't know when to stop.",

Gambling should be seen as entertainment and not a type of hustle because if you depend on it,you will get disappointed at the end of the day. Gambling depends more on luck and skill and your lucky day might be your worst day,if you are a greedy gambler.The house hedge will always win,and what I observed about gambling is that, you will always loss more than the amount that you always win. Seeing gamble as side hustle is recommendable but there should be a limit to  this, so that you don't end up losing big.",
