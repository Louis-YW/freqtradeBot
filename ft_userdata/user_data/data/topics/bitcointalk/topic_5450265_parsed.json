Many? I don't think it's many. Some have pilot programs, where they are testing the new systems. I only know of China and Australia. Several other nations have announced readiness to start working on their own CBDC, like Russia, the US, or Sweden.

As long as they're truthful on it and balance just as with other investments and currencies that they're in, they should be fine and no need for any re-strategization.",

I will like to have your views.You're assuming they want to accept/integrate crypto into their system, which is not always the case. If they don't want crypto to enter then you will never see any crypto-friendly regulation or strategy comes into play. Basically, you'll probably need to change the person in charge of these policies if you want to see any changes, or try to lobby them with organizations and so on. Like it or not it becomes political to some extent, especially if this issue can be used to determine whether they'll get votes from the public or not. I believe the majority of countries will likely regulate exchange sooner or later, but will never allow crypto as a legal form of payment. Basically, it will be treated like gold or other investment assets. That won't really stop you if you want to pay stuff with crypto though.",

Bitcoin is still in its early stages of becoming a global reserve currency, but it is a small leap in the direction of changing the global reserve currency and replacing it from the dollar to another currency.Bitcoin will not be mostly that currency, but it will be a currency for international trade, as the acceptability of Bitcoin, ease of conducting transactions and high transparency is suitable for it to be a currency of international trade.Will it be accepted by all countries? Yes, but for international trade.",

I will like to have your views.It's not going to be easy for any government to accept crypto, it will still be based on those who are in the power and sitting at the office. For example, Bukele of El Salvador he is the President for now and seems to be Bitcoin friendly, so what happens next election if he losses? technically, he is not allowed to have 2 consecutive terms if I'm not mistaken, however, their Supreme court discarding that rule,(https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/despite-prohibition-el-salvador-president-bukele-says-he-will-seek-re-election-2022-09-16/)So in any case, he wins that El Salvador will still become a Bitcoin friendly and still accepted as Legal tender. But there are chances that in other countries, the new government might make a U-Turn. No need to re-strategized for government or those financial bodies, they already made some decisions to go anti or pro Bitcoin/crypto so it will remain until they themselves change courses for whatever reasons.",

I was really sure they open their mind if it has approached the halving like today. So, I won't be surprised if they will be friends with crypto because they were bought in the dip. So, after Bullrun, and sold the crypto assets in 2025, China will make FUD again and ban the crypto together spreading a piece of bad news, and so on, because they did this strategy business since 2013.",
