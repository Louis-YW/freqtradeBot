Maximize your profit - combine yield farming with algorithmic trading; set stop loss and take profit levels for staking, lending and farming; auto-sell rewards and so on. Migrate positions from other platforms to Minimax in one click. Use telegram bot for real-time notifications.                              How Minimax worksWe source all the vaults displayed at the platform from third-party DeFi applications. Minimax.finance is a smart proxy for multiple protocols across DeFi, which enables you to handle your DeFi investments in one place. We are a multi-chain yield aggregators hub with a set of advanced features for effective management of crypto investments. Use any liquid token (like BNB, DOT, BSW and hundreds of others) to enter any vault. Our platform will seamlessly do all the necessary conversion and bundling operations for you. Now you’ll need to do just one operation on our dApp instead of 4 or 5 operations on various dApps. Save yourself a lot of time and hassle.                          Main Features       Stake, farm, lend — all in one placeYou don’t need to spend your time switching between different platforms, waiting for the data to get loaded each time. See all your investments clearly formatted, on a single page, and manage them appropriately.Stop loss and take profit for staking, lending and yield farmingYou can protect your investments from big losses when crypto prices suddenly fall and automatically fix the profit, when the prices grow. Setup automatic conversion into stable coins when prices reach certain levels. Now even for LP-tokens!Combination of yield farming and algorithmic tradingCreate your own trading bot strategies and combine them with staking to increase profit. Set buy and sell levels for your favorite tokens, and all the swapping and staking operations will be carried out automatically. This way the tokens between the swaps will be staked and generate passive income for you.Multiple positions per vault with separate parameters for each positionTreat each investment as a separate CEX-like position. Create as many positions within the same vault as you like and specify individual stop loss, take profit and other parameters for each position.Easy migration of positions from other platforms.

Hacken experts have examined our smart contracts in depth, tested them against reentrancy, reordering, overflows, all sorts of manipulations and so on. After Hacken experts have reviewed our fixes, they’ve given out smart contracts the status of ‘well-secured’, the highest grade available.Feel free to read the detailed report at Hacken.io.Communities                                                                                Minimax Farming CompetitionWhat is the price fund?The prize fund of the competition is 4000 USDT.What is the Farming Competition about?To participate in the contest, you need to make deposits on our platform during the contest period and earn as much as possible. There will be separate awards for those who score the highest amount, and for those who earn more in relative terms. Thus, you will have a chance to win even with a relatively small deposit. The minimum amount to participate is $100.When is the Farming competition going to be held?From July 5 to July 25, 2022. We will do a special announcement in our Telegram Channel.What are the rules?You can choose any vaults on any blockchain presented on our platform.You can deposit any tokens you like to take part in the competition.The total size of deposits placed in the vaults during the competition should be worth more than $100. All deposits, not an individual deposit. E.g. if you have four deposits of $40, $30, $25 and $10 respectively ($105 in total), you qualify for the competition.Only deposits placed during the competition are taken into account. Deposits placed before or after the competition period will not be counted.If you place a deposit during the competition period, you will automatically take part in the competition, no need to do any additional steps.What do the winners get?The competition is divided into two sections — absolute and percent, with 5 awards for each section, 10 awards in total.Section 1: Absolute.The goal is to earn as big an amount as possible.Prizes:1st place — 1000 USDT2nd — 500 USDT3rd — 250 USDT4th — 150 USDT5th — 100 USDTSection 2: Percent.The goal is to earn the most in relative terms. For example, John deposited $500 and earned $200, while Jack deposited $200 and earned $100. In such a situation Jack would be the winner, because he earned 50% of his initial deposit, while John earned 40% of his initial deposit. Become Jack, show you’re the winner in this game.Prizes:1st place — 1000 USDT2nd — 500 USDT3rd — 250 USDT4th — 150 USDT5th — 100 USDTWe will calculate the results on a per wallet address basis. If you use several wallet addresses, results from these addresses will not add up, they will be considered as separate competition entries. So we recommend doing all the interactions with the platform with the same wallet address (you can put deposits on different blockchains, but the wallet address is better to remain the same).When will the results be announced?We will announce the results on July 30, 2022 in our Medium and in our Telegram Channel.
