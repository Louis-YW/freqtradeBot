Pick n Pay is one of the biggest and oldest grocery retailers in South Africa and also in a lot of countries in Africa. They have 1,628 stores in sub-Saharan Africa (968 company-owned and 660 franchised) ...so this is big news. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_n_Pay_Stores",

Anyhow, it's still the best combination to date, you still keep your coins in your wallet and you pay over LN if the third party has enough funds and liquidity the strain on the main chain will be limited to a few transactions for thousands of clients.QuoteThe average cost of a transaction is 70 cents, Pick n Pay says.I assume this is in rands, so 3 US cents, slowly we're getting rid of the \"fees are higher than a coffee cup price\" saga.

I reckon bitcoin's biggest appeal is as a speculative investment.Of course, most people would never invest in Bitcoin if there wasn't such high volatility that can result in significant profits, I think that's clear to everyone. Here, of course, we clash with the conceptual idea that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency as it was originally intended, but with time it became less and less attractive. People have always looked for reasons why Bitcoin as a currency is not good, and the main reasons were that the price is volatile, and that the confirmation of payment is not instant.Part of the problem was solved by payment processors, and today with LN, payment with Bitcoin can be instant and very cheap - the only question is whether the average investor in Bitcoin will decide to use the same as a payment currency, or will remain only an investor looking for profit.I think that even those who want to pay something with Bitcoin have certain reservations because they want to protect their privacy and not draw attention to themselves. Owning Bitcoin often means being a target not only of online hackers, but also of thieves who increasingly realize that it is much easier and more profitable to steal Bitcoin than to steal other things.",

Every \"Crypto\" payment should be followed by a small questionnaire, to rate the process and to find out what the customer experience was. This can be done in the pilot phase to see if they find it too difficult or if the volatility is the issue. Most companies start this, because they see it as a new income source.... and they quickly drop it, when usage is low.",

Lack of regulations & laws and uncertainty regarding Crypto's legal status.4. Complexity of the payments over Fiat payments. (Process to get coins / Apps ... etc)5. The transaction confirmation times. (If you are not using the Lightning Network) 6. Payment processors and their ToS I hope you see where I am going with this.....",

You hoard 80% of the coins you buy and you spend 20% of those coins so that the merchants and retailers that support Bitcoin, could continue doing it.

The thing is that for years various influential people have been promoting Bitcoin as an investment, and they are telling us to make as few transactions as possible because we are harming the environment and that we will remain in the dark because Bitcoin will consume all the electricity...How to fight against someone who has more followers on a social network than there are active Bitcoin users?
