If yes what's the username of the account?Have you ever traded with the person? If yes can you provide some proofs?From what I can see on the profile, it looks like an account that's no longer in use because the last time any post was made in that account was four year account which shouldn't be for an active account. I know some people rarely make any post on facebook all they do is to chat but I think Four year is too much of a time for inactivity.And besides Localbitcoins.com is no longer active for trading all you can do at this moment is to login and make withdrawals nothing more, you can't even create a new account there anymore. If you have info about this person you're accusing please do share as it might help others avoid being scammed.",

Remember that you can’t post here a personal info of someone since it can be search publicly. There’s a chance that you might put a wrong details that will put someone in danger.I notice that you already started a right thread on Investigation section https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5453373.0. Please lock this thread and just move the conversation in there to avoid more censorship since you are keen to exposed the suspect sensitive details.",
