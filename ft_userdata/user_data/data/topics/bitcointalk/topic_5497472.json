It's only a matter of time before BTC squeezes past all-time-highs.Glassnode Insights Week 21, 2024 report, A macro reset.QuoteSummary and ConclusionsFollowing an intense period of mature investor distribution into the $73K ATH, sell-side pressure has markedly declined. This has led to a reduction in headwinds and overhead resistance, with even only modest demand able to stimulate positive price action.Alongside this, volatility continues to compress across longer timeframes, whilst a dense cluster of supply has formed below our current spot price, potentially providing a robust foundation to build upon.Money flow from Bitcoin Spot ETFs starts to be green again after some weeks of outflow, red.Bitcoin network flowKeep up your DCA, if you have money to DCA more bitcoin and keep up your Bitcoin hodling, do it patiently with time, in coming months, you will be rewarded very good profit.",

Because some moments I see there is a fake phase that starts a new ATH. But I am indeed very optimistic that Bitcoin has a better value for the post halving period. This is because 2 times I have passed that period. Hopefully there are no bad fundamentals such as the decision to raise interest rates by the Fed due to inflation. Because in some periods an interest rate hike can always undermine the acceleration of Bitcoin's price increase. Meanwhile political issues and decisions by the SEC I think can be a good and bad fundamental for this bull period. As I read June 11-12, the Fed will make a decision on the next interest rate policy DCA is the best option, I think those who have more money power is good strategi. Because they have oportunity to excecute in much moment. It doesn't apply much to me due to money limitations. I just keep trying not to sell BTC before I can see the realistic targets I have planned. Hopefully, the Great Bull will come soon and we can make good use of that moment.Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-prediction-2024/",

Whats shocking or surprising is that who would these new investors and old investors choose to buy now when the market has already risen above 70k. I was expecting this market flow during the little dip that Bitcoin did. Perhaps during the dip many were looking for sellers to sell but everybody held to their coins and it green to choose to sell to the hungry buyers.",

The warm up time is very long like months and people need time to do their research, go from doubt to a little bit interested in but still hesitate to invest. Finally they decide to invest or just spend money and very shortly after that, we will see FOMO wave on the market.FOMO does not last too long but it will last longer than panic time. People will have more time like days, weeks to take profit than time to sell, cut loss or close their position to avoid margin calls, liquidations.",

The Bitcoin ETF and halving this year had prepared us for a supply shock, like you phrased it, so it's not late to start or continue accumulating because harvest season will mature in bull run ATH. I don't speculate but my belief is that supply shock will help price because Supply and Demand Principle always works. It does not show effects immediately but supply shocks and increasing, bigger demand will absorb gradually in the market and participants. When skew between supply and demand is big enough, we will see big reflection on price.It is true that on chain parameters can be changed quickly because people are free to move their bitcoins on chain any time. They can move their bitcoins in exchanges or out exchanges very quickly but I believe the Supply and Demand Principle is important.Halving will cause a skew between Supply and Demand towards Demand, that will help trading volume and price.",

      "body": "I don't disagree with the conclusion drawn in the OP. I would also recommend to continue a DCA-based strategy now, as I see us firmly in a bull market, even if there may more dips to follow.However, I want to point out that the exchange holding graphs of Cryptoquant, Glassnode etc. look much more dramatic than they really are.For example, between January 2023 and today according to Cryptoquant the exchange holdings went down from 2.2 million to 1.9 million Bitcoins. 300000 BTC less, that is a respectable number, you'll say  It's the equivalent of 20.4 billion USD (at a price of 68000$ per BTC).But this equation is wrong, because the BTC price in January 2023 (Edit: lol, I wrote 2020 first) was at about $20000.So if you take the dollar value, the USD value of BTC exchange holdings went actually up, and by a lot - from 44 billion USD to 129 billion! This means exactly what it means: that you need almost three times the dollars to buy all Bitcoins on exchanges than in January 2023!Now some will be scared a bit perhaps  But that wasn't actually my intention. This is something that happens in all bull markets. But it is also one of the reasons why the volatility at the end of the bull markets is so high. For a supercycle or so, we'll need much more dramatic decreases of the exchange supply.",
