      "body": "There should be more to his resignation than just this; what's in it for him with the obsession? I believe even an average man doesn't care about what Craig feels like any more or what form of information he has to bring to the table to justify his claim that he is Satoshi; mere fabricated documents can't deceive the entire public; there are more documents required than just documents to prove his claims. Enough of all this drama; if he is truly Satoshi, he would not even think of revealing his identity to anyone for any reason; he could have been more cautious of his privacy than blabbing. What does he tend to gain even if he succeeds in deceiving and convincing a few that he is Satoshi? Does the network look so centralised to him that he will then benefit massively from being the founder?",

      "body": "Craig only manages to remain in the headlines because he somehow managed to fool Calvin Ayre into funding his scamming. He lost the case filed against him by Dave Kleiman’s family and owes them over $100 million although it’s unlikely he ever owned the BTC they were fighting over and he will just try and drag this out as much as possible.  Craig is a scumbag who will keep harassing Bitcoiners with frivolous lawsuits. Maybe these recent losses has some of his backers thinking they are on a sinking ship and that is why they are abandoning him.",

But sure, let's assume for now that it's true.Initially, I couldn't quite understand what's the connection and why the CEO is allegedly quitting, but now I see that Craig Wright is a Chief Scientist at that company. Still, though: why not fire Craig instead of leaving the company? What good does that do if Craig remains employed and a person who doesn't want to be involved with him leaves?Craig is irrelevant, I agree with that. And I'll easily believe that he manipulated evidence in court. But I don't understand why the CEO would quit over it rather than fire the guy.",

Right the moment, I got aware of this Mr. Craig Wright, am sure he is definitely Wrong and should never be trusted. He is just using his claim of being the real Satoshi - without credible proofs, of course - to his financial advantages. And I am glad to see some crumbling in his deceitful empire. Craig Wright has no right place within the cryptocurrency industry.",

I always thought that all his employees knew he was a scumbag, but they still work for money. But the case seems different for the CEO of nChain. The hashtag he used is #Faketoshi, which also makes me laugh and happy. Quote from: digaran on September 30, 2023, 07:31:56 AMSince when he was relevant ever? If there has been discussions about him on this forum is because people either shill for him or make fun of him. I don't think Bitcointalk people ever cared about CSW. We all know he is a scammer! I don't remember correctly, but maybe Suchmoon had a thread about his scams. I could be wrong.",

How many years has he been pretending to be the founder of Bitcoin? which is obviously not really, he is still bragging, that if we look at the history record that the real Satoshi is silent and anonymous, and no one knows until now, you are a silent bitcoin whale holder.People like that should be ignored, just to be honest. He uses cryptocurrency for his personal interests, that's all.",

You make some nice headlines and maybe get media attention with some negative news and boom there is your company and it’s shares making some moves. For this guy, he has mastered all the arts of making money by defaulting the others impressions on their decisions. What I mean is simple, he is literally an attention seeker and nothing else. The CEO who left might have been into other heated positions and could have left on the command of Craig. You never know if this news is even true or not since one can also try to gain positive attention to form new entity and have personal gains. This is really sucked up for Craig since it can be held as an evidence against Craig in the court. Either way we don’t care because this is just non ending drama anyways.",
