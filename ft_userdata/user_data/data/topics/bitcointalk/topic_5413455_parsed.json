  "content": "SHKeeper (website - https://shkeeper.io/) is a free-of-charge open-source cryptoprocessor orientated at e-commerce products and projects, but the processor is not limited to them. It allows you to accept crypto payments directly on your website!That is to say; it is designed to receive payments in any popular cryptocurrency. It allows private individuals and organizations of different caliber to accept payments online, avoiding any commission.It is flexible and handy when it comes to adjusting rates, auto-payments, and more.SHKeeper has an initial open code and can be deployed on your servers or at https://vsys.host/SHKeeper FeaturesÂ  1. Multi-CurrencyThese days cyberspace is overflown by crypto and fiat currencies, demanding multi-purpose processors as a must-have option for any business willing to accept online payments. Easy switching between those currencies makes SHKeeper especially attractive.2. Direct Crypto PaymentsOne should add on top direct crypto payments to draw a larger picture of this truly multi-purpose processor and its tools.3. Ability to Set Your Exchange Rates, Commissions, or FeesSHKeeper is not limited to any official exchange rates, commissions, or fees. The processor functions independently in accordance with the aims and purposes of its owner and not some intermediaries or influence agents. Please note that should you decide to charge any fees or commissions, you can easily adjust them.4. Crediting the Overpayment to the BalanceAnother valuable option concerns overpayments, which may take place from time to time. In such circumstances, the processor notifies you automatically and credits the difference to the balance. A fair attitude always adds credentials to any business.5. Partial PaymentsSKeeper allows partial payments for products or services, installments or schemes of a kind, which are relatively popular in the contemporary market, raising the overall attractiveness and flexibility of a business and its products and services.6. Setting Auto-Payments Into a Cold WalletIt can be taken further by setting auto-payments into a cold wallet on a regular basis, in accordance with a planner or accumulated amount. Availability of such configuration allows for a noticeable improvement in the overall planning of payments and expenses.7. No Transaction FeesThe ever-important factor is the absence of any transaction fees, making the processor stand out from the crowd of other ordinary payment accepting tools available on the market. Yet, the absence of intermediaries or third parties makes SHKeeper position a stronghold in the field of similar services. In fact, that is a robust competitive advantage for a business equipped with the processor but a deductive factor for potential clients.8. No Third-PartiesNo third-party involvement significantly increases the censorship resistance, privacy, and security for you and your customers.9. Increased Privacy and SecuritySHKeeper also features intriguing situations when it comes to privacy and security. The absence of third-party involvement significantly raises payment security level as well as overall confidentiality.10. No KYCHowever, when it comes to KYC or AML procedures, the processor does not require its users to go through irritating verification procedures involving photo-taking and passports, such as online casinos, online stock exchanges, and other FinTech products11. Non-CustodialAnother vitally important moment is that SHKeeper is the non-custodial cryptoprocessor, which effectively means your full control over the private key. Hence, the assets are only available to their owner and not some third party, as it happens with custodial services like Binance or MetaMask.12. Independent SoftwareSHKeeper is an open-code processor developed by our team and available on GitHub. Hence, everyone is more than welcome to make their contribution to the code or use it for their needs.

This crypto modules look simple on their github page, so I guess it's not so hard to add any other coins in future.https://github.com/SatSale/SatSaleIts features are quite limited, that is to mention lack of recalculation of the exchange rate, partial installment, commissions, and only one currency.https://github.com/CypherpunkPay/CypherpunkPayBeing very similar to the above one, including all of its listed limitations.SHKeeper easily beats both of them, considering its numerous features and especially, the multi-currency option it has! Quote from: VSYS Host on September 14, 2022, 06:57:49 PMPaid version? So you utilize dual licensing where paid version has more feature and support? If yes, do you have list which shows difference between open source and paid version?Open-source is nice to have, but the paid plan certainly has its unbeatable advantages. In particular, you get full technical support, proper integration, and importantly, more coins than the open-source version has. That is to say, paid one features TRX-20 USDT in addition to Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Certainly, we will move this extra feature to the open-source version but will add erc20 and bnb to the paid one.
