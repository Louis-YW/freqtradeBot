You are quickly at it singing praise of switching to other alt just because of the ordinals attack on bitcoin chain and here you are calling bitcoin un-useable when there are millions of transactions going on currently on bitcoin chain. It is fine and as a result of the attack on bitcoin chain, transaction prices skyrocketed which is not a new thing on blockchain that miners would prefer the higher transaction fee compared to the lesser. Anyways, thanks for your youtube video, as I had to get more of bitcoin because I saw a quick recovery and price boom in a short time.",

Actually it did start around March but it seems it balloon since Sunday as the mempools is being clogged, similar to spam attack.Of course it has affected by market itself, but I wouldn't say that it's un-useable or should we switch to alternative coins.Sorry though, I'm not going to click and watch that video.",

If people didn't switch when fees were over $50 they ain't switching when fees are under $10.Also all alts fail and are short term fads. Solana was big two years ago, now its a broken chain. Monero is interesting for being private but that's it.Why even try to spread FUD as silly and nonsensical as this??",

Well, I see a surge in bitcoin price after this wholesaga.The bitcoin awareness is strong. The adoption is fast spreading like wide fire. No shit coin can take or replace bitcoin not even the shitcoin as mentioned by OP.Lastly, I think I should remind them not to forget that bitcoin is the first digital currency to be developed and as  such, is the genesis of crypto currency and blockchain technology.",

Aside from the OP, I see a lot of people saying things like this because they can no longer pay $15 in bitcoin using the main chain, unless they want to pay another $15 in fees, but as I just mentioned in another thread, let's see what better system there is for transferring large amounts of money than bitcoin. If you want to transfer a huge amount of money to another continent, you can do it without filling out paperwork, without asking for permissions and paying a ridiculous fee relative to what you send. Everyone who is spreading FUD seems to want to forget that.",

Its use as a store of value is widely recognized, and while short selling Bitcoin or switching to altcoins may be options for some traders, it is important to monitor the market closely. As with any investment, there are risks involved in cryptocurrency trading, and it is important not to panic during market corrections. It is essential to remain calm and patient, not rushing to cut losses as the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Entering the market with a realistic investment estimate is vital to ensure you can manage the risks effectively.",

Monero are a privacy coin that are used mostly for illegal activities on the Darkweb, so it will never get any acceptance by any government in this world. Solana has nothing special.... it peaked for a short time and then it went \"Poof\" like the magic dragon. I think you have to stop shilling for Alt coins and start using the Lightning Network, if you want fast transactions in times of an attack.",

Your post is wrong, and is there to create FUD. SOL and XMR are not an alternative to BTC in any way. Why do you come and talk about something you don't know anything about?Since when XMR is a storage of value asset? What guarantee do you have that CEX will eventually accept to exchange it in the very long term given the nature of XMR himself?Solana speaks for itself, wanting to \"replace\" BTC with Solana is for me an insult to BTC, no need to argue.If you had any real knowledge of what BTC and its network is, you wouldn't go into these defeatist speeches, look at what happened in 2017 for example.Do you think anyone is really going to trade their BTC for XMR/Solana here? Plus with 1 year to go before halving, you'd have to be an idiot to do that.",

Like Ethereum network can cost you more than Bitcoin network.It is very important to note: with altcoin networks, you will have less safety for your transactions. Bitcoin blockchain is a best one for transactions in security and safety.How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?How many confirmations are equivalent* to 6 Bitcoin confirmations?",

No as well.How do Bitcoin became a completely un-useable currency? It's because of high transaction fees? Do you think that this will last forever?

What Bitcoin is experiencing can't be compared to Ethereum increase in fees when it happened yet it was still been used so what makes you think people will stop using Bitcoin. We have lightening network that can be used to avoid paying this high fees. Things will go back to normal very soon no need to be panicking. Business owners accepting Bitcoin can switch to using of the lightning network for faster transaction until the congestion get resolved. Solana or any other altcoins you're promoting won't and can't replace Bitcoin. Solana died a very long time ago and should be avoided.",

This congestion on the mempool is why there is delay in transaction because miners will always process transactions with the higher fee which is normal. This hasn't devalued bitcoin,neither has it cause any reason for alarm. Such thing happened in 2017 and bitcoin got over it. Those of us that are complaining, I don't see any reason for it,because I don't think we should be spending bitcoin daily or weekly. It is high time we don't make any bitcoin transaction, if we feel that the transaction fee is higher than what we can afford. Fiat and banks are there, which has been our way of making transactions before bitcoin was created,so I suggest that your daily spending or weekly should be in fiat,so that we can use this opportunity of the mempool congestion to hold our bitcoin. In every problem there is always an advantage for people who see it as a norm. It is only forum members that don't have an outside job and only depend on their weekly pay from signature campaign that will be highly affected. Switching over to altcoins is the worst decision ever, because you will end up in a deeper mess than this.",
