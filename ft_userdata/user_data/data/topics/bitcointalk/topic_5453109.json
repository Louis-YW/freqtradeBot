Is this a clear sign that my software has been tampered with? Or is there another explanation?You're supposed to verify \"SHA256SUMS\" file with \"SHA256SUMS.asc\" signature file.So command should be:Code:gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMSThen after verifying that \"SHA256SUMS\" file is legit, open it as text, then find and take note of the line:9485e4b52ed6cebfe474ab4d7d0c1be6d0bb879ba7246a8239326b2230a77eb1  bitcoin-22.0-win64.zipGet your downloaded \"bitcoin-22.0-win64.zip\" file's sha256 hash and see if it matched with the sha256 sum in the file.For example, using this PowerShell tool: learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?Windows Power Shell command and result (with matching SHA256 hash):Code:Get-FileHash Desktop/bitcoin-22.0-win64.zip | Format-ListAlgorithm : SHA256Hash      : 9485E4B52ED6CEBFE474AB4D7D0C1BE6D0BB879BA7246A8239326B2230A77EB1Path      : C:\\Users\\<username>\\Desktop\\bitcoin-22.0-win64.zip",

Your installation file is genuine as the developers have created it.BTW, the current authoritive website for Bitcoin Core is https://bitcoincore.org, not https://bitcoin.org",
