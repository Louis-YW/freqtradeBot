  "content": "I really don't know where to drop this thread because this thread can not be drop in another thread unless a board. I strongly know that there is local thread for Nigerians but flood disaster is not a local issue but international, therefore if I used it as a comment there, Nigeria (Naija) because most of the users in the forum will not see and know if I post it there. They have to see what is happening in Nigeria right now. And this natural or man made disaster also affect Bitcoiners and bitcointalkers because when flood has taken over their houses, they have to relocate to another place, or refugees camps and if the place they have relocated has no network and light, automatically they have been cut off from the forum. Most refugee camps are in darkness, there is no light, and no network. As it is no, most people are sleeping in their cars because their homes has been flooded with water. I am also parking to refugee  camp right now. 6 persons as died in my locality in the flood. The water is increasing day and night continuously.",

      "body": "I think this should be moved to off-topic or polictics and society as it doesn’t help beginners nor crypto related. A perfect place would have been Nigeria local board but since we don’t have one yet it makes sense to discuss such issues in our local thread. I understand your frustration OP and I’m sorry you lost your home, I watched it on the local news a few days ago, residents were advised to move out before the flood hit those areas. It’s presumptuous to claim “many” have been cut off from the forum, the whole country isn’t flooded, it’s only the riverine areas and water log areas that are affected ( happens every year). I hope you’re safe and have moved to upland.",

      "body": "It's pity that we are experiencing this kind of flood damage every year. This continues to show that we are living in an unprepared country.Nigeria should have dams or build a couple of dams to collect excess water released and distribute them to various dams. Such waters would have been released systematically without causing collateral damages along the flood plans and coastal areas like it is seen now.All this flood damage is happening in Lokoja, Anambra, Imo, Asaba, Delta, River, Markudi, and many other Nigerian states. My prayer is that God should protect people's life that's all.",

      "body": "Like you accurately deduced, this issue took place in 2012, and like I found out, it's from the lagbo dam in Cameroon which according to news, it's caused as a result of excess water that they are trying to \"offload\". But where I'm most bothered is the seeming nonchalance of authorities saddled with the responsibility of averting such crisis. Why will the government of a country be so lax as to issues facing it's citizens? Why will they wait till the economy is thrown into an unrest and prices go higher before intervening? It's sad that people are being forced to move out of their homes because not a natural disaster in this case, but man made is forcing them out.",
