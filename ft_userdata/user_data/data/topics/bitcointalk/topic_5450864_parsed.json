  "content": "Hello;I recently found a token I added years ago on my Metamask wallet, I don't really remember how I got this significant amount but I found it worth +$900.I want to exchange or swap this token or sell it. The token is known as \"smARTOFGIVING\" (AOG).I have tried some swapping services and platforms but they require high fees, I couldn't do the swap because I don't have the required ETH to acquire the action.I have also found that I can do the swap ifÂ  I bridge the coins from ETH mainnet to BNB network. But unfortunately, I couldn't find the token in question to bridge it to BNB.If there is any suggestion on how to can I exchange it, or if anybody is interested in buying them you can leave me a comment or send me a DM.Thanks in advance.",

Thank you.I however, want you to practice a lot of caution with that exchange. It has a number of scam accusations in this forum, so even if you plan to use it. First read through the scam accusations. If you must exchange the coins there, send them in small bits, exchange them and transfer your funds out to avoid losing all the money at once in case they try to scam you.",

This is the list of markets/exchanges where you can sell that. (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/smartofgiving/markets/)So, the main solution is gonna come from you by having some ETH so that you can cover the fees of the transfer and sell it anytime as you wish on those platforms where it's listed.",

You can check on Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko. i found some exchange where you can sell this coinBut his main problem here is that it seems that he did not expect a high fees or not wanted to spend from His own pocket.and with this there will be no exchanging or swapping to happen because there are needs to have a Gas,and since he only find out recently about the funds , I am also not sure if he got this legitimately or just a airdrop that seems to be trap from bringing out.Trading Volume 24h $66,400 and that is something that OP is wanting to comes out because the volume now is increasing with more than 500% ROIRanking number 414 , well there is still Hope for OP to gain,if he will make its way out today before bouncing down sooner.",
