I do not know why I remain pessimistic on bitcoin price this time after it has increased to over $30000. From the monthly chart, using BB and RSI, where the market is going is not known. It can go either up or down. If you want to hold bitcoin in long term, do not be afraid to hold, the price will later increase, even if the price first decreased.",

That is the next deadline in which they will reject the request again, or maybe accept it.If this does not happen, the first option is that the price will continue to move between $25k and $30k, and the second option, which some are speculating about, is that we are expecting another more pronounced drop towards $20k.Quote from: Ricardo11 on September 22, 2023, 01:07:43 PMI think the Bitcoin market will start to grow by the end of this year. Because the Bitcoin market is very bad this year. Because the price of Bitcoin is not increasing at all this year.Bitcoin price has not risen above 30k at all this year. It will probably begin to rise later this year.How can you say that the market is bad, if at the end of last year we had a price that was close to $15k, and at one point this year we even reached over $31k, which is about 100% growth in just a few months. I would call it (regardless of everything) a very positive year if we take into account inflation and the war in Ukraine, and many other bad events that marked this year, such as record heat, great floods and earthquakes.I wonder what you would say if you were here in say 2015 when the price of BTC was only a little higher than $200 and when the pessimists were saying that the end for BTC was around the corner...",

Grayscale winning against the SEC about the lawsuit is one of the biggest news that came out just recently and they want their Bitcoin Trust to become an ETF which I think will affect the Bitcoin market at a very high level once it is done. SEC has not approved it yet but they cannot do anything now to stop Grayscale from doing it, it's just time that will matter. Investors are probably moving their money to Bitcoin too after that news came out and they want to if the pump will happen or if they are the ones making all the pumps now due to demand. Expect more increases in the upcoming months as we get near the approval of it. Finally, something good that could become consistent in the years to come.",

Price movements can move sideways, downwards and upwards depending on the conditions and situations that are currently occurring. In short, it depends on how and for what purpose you use Bitcoin. The BTC/USDT chart in the picture is still in the momentum to hold with strong patience and is still the momentum to buy.The reality is that in my experience, trading Bitcoin in the hope of expecting profits in a short period of time is not suitable.Quote from: Ricardo11 on September 22, 2023, 01:07:43 PMI think the Bitcoin market will start to grow by the end of this year.

A huge factor being that I don't think there are signs of retail coming back any time soon.The explanation is pretty simple, as it's always been. Bitcoin has its followers who DCA and hold, but it also experienced a downward pressure from miners, so it barely manages to stay at a given level for more than a month, unless the retail comes in and it usually acts like a zombie horde. Most of the year they sleep, but when the price starts going up for a few weeks, they begin to wake up. When bitcoin is up 30% the whole horde is on its feet, smelling blood. I don't expect the horde to wake up until we reach 50% of the ATH by ourselves, so ~35k, or we're past the halving point.",

From the image as shown above what's your prediction on the direction of the market next move?  Feel free to express your opinion be you a professional or trading expert or not.For sure there wasn't going to be any movement right now, I mean September wasn't really a good month for cryptocurrency so personally I wasn't expecting some kind of movement, but it doesnt really matter since the market overall is kinda weak the moment, probably one of the biggest pumps is going to be the bitcoin halving which could probably hype the market, in the past years if we are going to check and analyze the bitcoin halving timeline we could clearly see that a few months before the bitcoin halving there was some kind of movement in the market, so since the bitcoin halving is only a few months away, in my opinion probably around early 2024 there will be a small movement in the market. But the Bullrun is going to be after the Bitcoin halving most of the time 365 days before the Bitcoin halving. So dont really expect a huge movement at the moment so just HODL right time.It might reach around 40k early next year and then the market is gonna drop again before it is going to skyrocket to over 100k$ in my speculation. That's probably the time when the Bull Run is going to happen around 2024-2025.",

In my opinion; i think the market has been stagnant and when i say stagnant i mean there has not been an impressive or outstanding movement either positively or negatively. The market is just there on its own recycling funds.The positive note so far in the market that i have noticed is that there are more incoming volumes into the market (We can call them new investors)",

So just expect that the market will go on a sideway pattern in short term.So it could be this month, or maybe up to the end of the year.But as others have said, since we are in the bear market, then still take advantage of the market, just continue to accumulate as much as you can.",

I agree that we will be just going on a sideways, I mean if I'm not mistaken, after reaching $30k last March, April was a sideway patterns for many months until we have some break out run in June, but still we haven't had that sustained run.However, I do not see a November 2018 event here, we are just months away from the halving. Maybe this is just some sort of calm before we will have the halving for next year and then the eventual bull run. So most likely, this will be our price till the end of this year.",

A huge factor being that I don't think there are signs of retail coming back any time soon.They will return only when there is no doubt that the bull run has started, because most such investors do not want or cannot afford to have their money invested for too long, especially in something as volatile as Bitcoin. We have seen this so many times that we can say that it is a constant, and for them the idea of \"fast in, even faster out\" is something that characterizes Bitcoin as a way to make quick money and nothing more than that.However, I am interested in whether the average Joe will react the same in the next bull run as it was the case in the past, because inflation is still something that deeply affects all those who are not in the upper class. For many, the money that they would have otherwise invested in something has already been spent or the stock under the mattress is getting smaller and smaller, and borrowing money for risky investments is something that many have been burned by in the past.",

This is elaborated upon in the following thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467398.0In my own perspective, I believe that the price of Bitcoin will experience a period of sideways movement due to the ongoing decline in trading volume. Indeed, scenarios are needed to stir the market in late 2023, and one of these could be the news of Elon Musk once again embracing Bitcoin. Alternatively, other developments may surface within the next month. Let's keep an eye out for them.",
