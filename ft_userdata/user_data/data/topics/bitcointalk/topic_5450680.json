There are forks of bitcoin and also there are forks from the forks of bitcoin, but bitcoin remain bitcoin.What I noticed today is that the community are avoiding a way that can lead to another fork or forks. But all forks are altcoins, not bitcoin.",

You can take a look at the price graph of any one of those coins to see just how well they are doing (hint - every single one is currently hitting all times lows against bitcoin).",

From BIP16 (P2SH activation) all the way to BIPs 341-342-343 (Taproot activation).We've reached majority consensus for each of them before they were activated too.",

So, it's not a crazy scenario, similar events already happened in Bitcoin history before and therefore there are multiple \"Bitcoins\" existing at the same time.",

There is just no change which would result in such a split that would create such a strong conflict between the Bitcoin users, that would let both versions survive. Reminding you that the free market relies on some basic principles, one of which is the efficiency granted by converting everything into one unit. Splitting the currency in multiples is an attack to the very foundations of money, from a market perspective, because it brings discord. People will switch to the most widely used version, even if objectively inferior, because this principle simply triumph over any feature other than that; being the currency.",

It wouldn't be a competition of coins named \"Bitcoin\" because there can only be one that retains the original name while other forks get a different name in order to tell them from the rest of the cryptocurrencies on the market. Technically, nothing stops from creating a fork with the same name, but usually, when there is a serious hardfork, as we have witnessed during the blocksize war, a fork that has got a majority of hashrate or that retains original consensus rules keeps an old name. I would say that, as long as original consensus rules remain intact and most Bitcoin users agree to follow them, Bitcoin remains to be Bitcoin, and other forks are nothing else but forks. Should one of these forks obtain a majority of hashrate, it gets renamed to Bitcoin regardless of consensus rules conformity to \"Satoshi's vision\".",
