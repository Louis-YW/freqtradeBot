  "content": "Hi, I reserach and extensively use AI and machine learning for trends prediction in bitcoin and other crypto's as well. The model is built using cutting edge algorithms and it is capable of predicting 5 days ahead with more than 90% accuracy. On top of prediction, almost all trading strategies and risk managment would be improved significantly. Would you in the sea of dishonest vendors selling renamed RSI, be interested in buying real AI predictions? Here's photo of testing chart for the last few months:EDIT:One more photo where model is trained for daytrading, predicting next day in advance:",

This is not an indicator, like moving average, RSI or any other lagging indicator.What you see on chart is 'prediction' for last 100 days. Model was trained, and last 100 days were used as test for verification of performance - orange line is prediction and blue one is actual price. It is predictive model that outputs forecast for x amount of days into the future, it doesn't smooth and recalculate price like moving average, etc.",

To get predictions for hours or minutes, it takes 50x amount of time as there is more data for training and processing.

Are they like the average trading price for BTC per day or there's a specific time the Bitcoin trading price is expected to be approximately close to the stated price?For example today, starting from the time you posted, Bitcoin price has been roaming between $20,380(lowest so far) and$ 21,200 (highest so far)",

But have you made a profit or tried to predict it again?I admit the sophistication of AI makes it easier for us to do things beyond the reach of market algorithm movements. AI can source resources in a short period of time and the results can be compared and then come up with an almost correct price prediction. But believe me, a natural market can change predictions that may not be on target.",

I've found there is some error in the code and function for future prediction is not working properly. Basically what happened, model predicted the test data, not the future, so technically it was not a prediction. Currently, I'm able just to post next day forecast, until I fix for the multi days function.Take a look, predictions I posted and real price for the 4 predicted days; 100% correlation. 19937.01                               19381.3020040.5820372.0719970.5619323.9120212.0720569.92QuoteSo the prices above. Are they like the average trading price for BTC per day or there's a specific time the Bitcoin trading price is expected to be approximately close to the stated price?After training and predictions are made, it is converted back to prices for easier reading and interpretation. By no means it is predicting exact price, it will sometimes be very close, sometimes not. What we are interested as traders is 'trend', hence I'm looking if the price will up or down.QuoteWith such accuracy you dont need to sell your product to become very rich very fast. In fact selling this product seams irractional and raises suspicions. I coded HFT market maker by myself that was giving me decent profits. last think i would do was selling it.Well, yes and no. To become rich with trading you need capital, either your personal or seeded one from investors. I'm trading my own money right now, as I have no guts to trade other people money.Frankly, I would never sell the system; code and logic behind it, but information in sort of forecasts - why not?QuoteIf you succeed in developing such a tool, you will be rich in a short time. All you have to do is take a loan and then buy and sell, and since you will know the best time to buy and sell during the next four days, day trading for you will be very profitable.That sounds very simple, but is far away from reality. Even if the forecasts are good, there is yet to build trading strategy and risk management framework for very profitable trading. What do you mean by loan, raising money from investors or taking the loan from the banks? QuoteAs for trying to sell such a service, you will find it difficult to do so in the forum.Post constant price updates prediction and gain trust, and then you may raise money.I'm not selling anything, yet. I started thread to see opinions and sentiment on the topic - if there is good interest and I manage to provide good forecasts, then it is mutual benefit. Yes, I'll post regular forecasts, when I finish fixing sequence prediction = more than one day into the future. QuoteThat will actually be a brilliant idea.

In most cases it's free and clean. I can't tell you much details, but image processing and in particular speech recognition problems are quite similar to financial markets. If you are going to try to develop AI system for markets, take a look at speech recogntion algorithms, I'm quite sure that's the way to follow.
