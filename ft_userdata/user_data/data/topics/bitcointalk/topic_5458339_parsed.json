And If so, is this a good strategy?Why do we notice that? because they fight and are billionaires? And why are these things worth watching, actually I'd love to see their fight, but you're exaggerating this, we both understand that it can generate signals around them. They are all influential people in society.I once heard a great story about two cows fighting and the flies around it dying, so it's not surprising that people took advantage of this opportunity to communicate their ideas.Or perhaps they are simply too lazy about how to make money, just the blink of an eye will take money out of our pockets.",

A beef is just a beef and its purpose is for clout chasing. This is very common these days so, don't believe with anything you see on social media even if gets reported by the media. But you also get to understand if it's an actual thing.Quote from: Framelover on July 02, 2023, 03:57:40 PMAlso, could this be considered as a strategic element of their business or career strategy? And If so, is this a good strategy?Yes and yes. Negative or positive publicity is still publicity for them. It's just all about of being talked about in the whole town world.",

And If so, is this a good strategy?Sometimes we may hear the conflicts between the two well-known parties and this may bring them to the news. We never know if this is being done to gain popularity or if it is just natural. Even we hear some known personality will tweet about the bitcoin price prediction and gain hype. Though their prediction never comes true, yet people listen to them and they are talked about all over the internet.Sometimes these personalities will publish good or bad news about crypto creating a pump or dump in the market. Elon Musk is a perfect example of this as how he changed his profile photo and/or title to Bitcoin and removed it causing the market to move. These celebrities want to be in the news and they would do all the dirty things to be part of the news. I would not call it a \"Good Strategy \"",

For the billionaires or elite class I don't think so they really need the public attraction. Well, it is clear from the outcomes after the controversies that they usually create themself for personal gains.",

Many of these bruhaha in the society I believe are just to gain prominence and remain notices in the society. It is most common amongst artist and they are all at it being at the mainstream media for just nothing reasonable. Companies do this as well just to attract the attention of the masses to their product and gain cheap publicity. All these are for business and profit making.So OP, most of all these rantings with celebrities and companies are just a good business strategy.",

In a way this reminds me of the Trump vs McMahon fight in which they both picked a wrestler to fight as their representatives, if Elon and Zuckerberg actually fought each other then this will be many times larger than that fight.",

And If so, is this a good strategy? Your last sentence would have been used in the subject as well. Like if I may restructure the sentence, it will be \"If this a Strategy, Is it a good Strategy?\". Yes it is a fight to attract fans for fame. If I could remember, in those days for about 20 years back, celebrates (musicians) were shooting themselves to overtake the next person position in the music field. They were envy for one another progress. They are fighting for best name and also to tarnish the other person name/image. Most of them are also fake, the fake ones are always coming from oil companies, they fighit to distract the oil producing communities so they can extract the oil freely when the fight is going on. It is also a tactics oil companies used.",

And If so, is this a good strategy?I do not know if this topic going to remain on this thread or will go into an off-topic thread so I would cover my answer as shortly as possible. Which is, yes and no. Sometimes they do that on purpose because they want to shift all eyes on them and want to be in the spotlight. For example, many say when Elon Musk was presenting his new truck (cyber truck I think) and he said the glass is break-proof and when he hit it, the glass broked which many said he did that on purpose because his rivals will spread that news like fire and that's a free publicity shared by those who do not like that idea. Is it not funny, they play back games on their rivals and haters and lure them into doing actions that become profitable for celebrities and companies? Like the current scenario of a Titanic submarine going into waters for a tour of The Titanic ship's Wreckage and many still saying they did that on purpose *I am nobody here to judge because the loss is real*And yes it is obviously a good strategy. did you not watch any celebrity video which is full of cringe and hatred for some groups of people to attract their attention so that those people could spread the word even if it is hatred one and spreading their information is all they want and we are doing it intentionally.",

And If so, is this a good strategy?It's also called business, sometimes they need to create a sensation, sometimes don't. What is clear is that they have a certain way of attracting public attention and this assumption can be considered as a strategic element of their business or career strategy. I think that is relative, and people's views certainly differ depending on what side is seen and is the object of attention. I think it's a classic style and not a professional typr in building a business.",

Billionaires creating issues to be the talk of the town isn't really anything different, although they already have proven means of making money so there's that. Perhaps, the reason why rich guys do this is because they just don't have anything better to do with their lives. If they wanted attention, they can create news that will not require them to engage in such activities but hey, maybe they really just get bored and wants to fight it out physically?",

I won't use names, but in the country that I was born, there was a boxer who was bad, so he turned into kickboxing, then MMA and he never did good, kept losing, but people still kept watching his fights because he loved to create drama. He wouldn't shake hands, wouldn't congratulate the winner, would fight dirty in and outside the ring. People hated him and wanted to see him lose, and that's how he kept making money for years.

In marketing, you need to get the audience or attention of whoever you are trying to convince and in this case, it worked very well that the public are so eager to see that happen and so they kept talking about them, checking up on their social media handles which automatically increase the numbers of views, likes and also followership.
