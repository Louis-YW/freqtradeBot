  "content": "A few days ago I found, by pure chance, that the sticky topic from Scam Accusation board containing a scam accusation format was created by a user which has now a -4 Trust score: escrow.ms. Furthermore, the user has also an active flag created against him, after he was arrested for credit card fraud OoI thought it's a bit ironic to have a sticky topic teaching how to properly present a scam accusation and the topic to be made by someone involved in a severe scam.Then I kept looking through the forum and I found other sticky topics which are created by authors with negative Trust:Bitcoin discussion/Legal: List of court cases, complaints, regulatory actions, etc. is created by Stephen Gornick, which has a negative feedback from The Sceptical Chymist for account selling, encouraging of scams, spam, and account farming. Bitcoin discussion\\Legal: this board has another sticky topic created by Stephen GornickBitcoin discussion\\Legal: this board has one more sticky topic created by an author with negative Trust: Guidelines for Press board, created by jgarzik, which has a negative feedback from gmaxwellMarketplace\\Lending: [EDU] How to spot a scammer (Read this before lending your coins!) is created by Tomatocage , whose account has been compromisedMost likely, the list can go on, as i did not look thoroughly inside each board and child board.I believe that these sticky topics created by authors with negative Trust should not be sticky anymore, as they do not offer credibility to the boards they belong, to the ones which read them and to the forum as a whole. It's a situation similar to the one related to DT2 users with negative Trust. However, if that situation is difficult to be solved, this one has real chances to be solved, if there is willing about doing so.Eventually, these topics could be rewritten by someone which does not have negative Trust / bad reputation. Or simply have the author changed, if their authors are not active anymore.Opinions?",

In my opinion, having a good material, but presented by someone with negative Trust is like a stain on the face of the topic or on the face of the respective board. Imagine a corrupt politician presenting a good material in front of public. If everybody knows he is corrupt, that material loses its credibility. However, in our case it also leads to losing the credibility on the respective board, since it contains sticky topics from those which are scammers or which have bad reputation, negative feedbacks, flags against them and so on.How would it be to have a sticky topic written by CSW or Roger Ver inside Bitcoin discussion board? Would you believe anything from it? Furthermore: wouldn't you ask yourself \"How was it possible to have here a sticky topic written by that clown?\" -- do you understand now what I mean?

I think it's more appropriate to say that her account was locked. Okay, technically speaking she was banned, but she was banned in same way Satoshi's account was banned Quote from: theymos on October 19, 2020, 01:50:51 PMDone. Lauda is banned in the same way as satoshi, such that it isn't possible to even log into the account anymore.Excepting that, some of her negative feedbacks are referring to her departure:qwkÂ Â Â 2020-12-01Â Â Â ReferenceÂ Â Â Farewell Lauda. DabsÂ Â Â 2020-11-08Â Â Â ReferenceÂ Â Â Lauda said Goodbye, world! Account is no longer active.VodÂ Â Â 2020-11-05Â Â Â ReferenceÂ Â Â Do not trust this account should it ever post again.The plagiarism accusation... if you remember, she was never sanctioned for it, therefore mods / theymos did not consider it plagiarism, although, maybe, it was.I would not insist more on Lauda as I know opinions are very different from user to user. In any case, she also has some topics which contain obsolete information and they need revamping. One of them is this one: [General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?.In any case, something should be done with all these topics, either if we talk about obsolete ones or about the ones written by scammers or users with shady reputation.",

It cares (through its users and administration) a lot for combating spam, for example. It is one of the very few (if not the only) forums which bans plagiarism. And examples can go on and on. These high standards pushed this forum way ahead of others, like CryptocoinTalk, AltcoinTalk etc. Right? If it is so, then these high standards should be enforced wherever possible. Including in not having sticky topics with obsolete materials or created by authors with no credibility. Picture these sticky topics as landmarks of a particular board. Having a topic set as sticky one makes it practically to be pushed forward in front of all other topics, right? It means it is a topic representative for the respective board. Maybe one of most important topics of that board. And, if that topic is written by someone with -5 Trust what impression does it make about the entire board? I think this thought appears naturally, for many users: \"Since most important topic of this board is written by a scammer then this board is full of scammers.\".Quote from: Despairo on February 18, 2023, 03:53:06 AMPersonally I don't mind if the useful post was written by clown, just like how we give merit because of the good post, not the user.Quote from: joker_josue on February 18, 2023, 08:59:10 AMIf the content is relevant and useful, I don't think it matters who wrote it.

And it would imply questions like \"Why haven't you checked first, to see if there is any other topic on this matter\"?. Remember, that was the best case scenario. Worst case scenario is to have the new topic reported as plagiarism and actually be considered by mods as plagiarizing the original one, which leads to ban.For these reasons I am reluctant in doing anything unless a consent is met or until a decision coming from theymos, although seeing a sticky topic written by a scammer in Legal board feels like a kidney stone and when I see the sticky from Scam accusation board also written by a scammer my eyes are bleeding",

Biggest clown in crypto and someone with compromised account - maybe a bit too extreme comparison. And negative trust doesn't always can be received for scamming something, sometimes it can result of disagreement between DT members, even if it's not right use of trust system. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that Lauda had negative trust even when she was active as she was contraversial personality.I doubt that we will hear theymos stance on it, but from what I understand, he don't want to mix moderation and trust system much.

I don't think the OP was talking about only the feedback page but the whole escrow.ms thing. Lauda banned herself and wanted to disappear with her own will. If she would not decide to disappear then she would still thrive.Lauda asked to be banned after he was exposed for plagiarism that ruined his reputation, and he is a male but you can call him it if you want.Punishment for multiple cases of plagiarism is permaban so he decided to perform hara-kiri.May be I messed up my memory but as far as I remember the plagiarism thing happened a long time ago and after discovering it we also passed long years. When Lauda asked for banning herself, at that time there were nothing existed, she was doing well and the good bye thread came just suddenly. Again I may messed up my memory, after all I am ageing ðŸ¤£Lauda male or female or shemale (ðŸ˜‰) still is a mystery. But she was a cat for sure.",

This thread can be edited by mods as well so it will be easy to edit it when it becomes outdated just need a reminder.Creating special account just for pinned posts is kinda over complicating the issue and it would be more elegant if they just did it by themselves on their own main accounts. After all, how often mods get tagged for scams?Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on February 19, 2023, 05:48:06 AMMay be I messed up my memory but as far as I remember the plagiarism thing happened a long time ago and after discovering it we also passed long years.

And then few months after the discovery, Lauda decided to leave the forum . Since he didn't get any sort of ban in the meantime I am not so sure that was the main reason for leaving. Unless he felt kinda embarrassed with all that mess since he was very strict when other plagiarized and decided to leave.",
