  "content": "Just a simple poll to get a feeler on what this part of the forum thinks of ETH and the altcoin market right now.  I would've asked for 2.5k but I guess breaking out 2k has as much psychological effect as 2.5k. Anyway, how do you guys feel about the market right now?  Getting bullish?  And in a good way?  There are times when you have to worry when everybody starts getting bullish.  I feel like this is not that.  But dunno...  I want to know what you guys think.",

It will eventually be 2k and then 3k and 4k and 5k and even 10k, but until that we are not going to really end up with anything special for the august month, it will be later on for sure.",

      "body": "More than 20 days left for the month. Right now ethereum is trading at $1700+, more $300 to the price can happen anytime. I've been positive on this based on today's price movement of bitcoin. Everytime the price of bitcoin increase, the same can be found with altcoins. The price of bitcoin that went above $24k have come down and moving around $23900. This looks like stability gain, and soon the price could start moving and reach $25k. Maybe by that time ethereum can be seen above $2k.",

Though looking at the chart right now, it’s good to have that white candles waiting for a breakout, I’m not in position right now and I’m just waiting for other confirmations before buying, ETH can still reach that price when the recover of the market begins.",

No one knows when ETH will be able to get back to $2k again, but I feel that it could be reached later this month if the bitcoin price can go higher than the current price. Maybe if the price of bitcoin returns to $25k this month, it will influence the price of ETH to increase again, raising the price to $2k again. Maybe the price can go to $ 2k temporarily because there is a pump from the whale but I don't know.",

I think not anymore but I have a strong feeling that this current one is now real because we are now getting close to the ber months and the year is going to end soon so there must be some improvements.I don't worry when everybody starts to feel bullish but I am happy about it because people are too positive. They will now buy more for one last minute and then they they will hodl tight until the full bull is achieved but it's okay if you're not one of them.",

Lucky to those who buy at a cheaper price, profit is with them already.Far from recovery but at least a good sign of life, ETH can still go further and that $2k can easily be hit when the market becomes more stable. What’s the good news here is that, many countries are slowly recovering from a recession, though it may still take some time but at least we are on that way. If you are able to buy ETH, know when to sell and don’t be greedy because the market is still volatile and the price can still drop.",

And that that we have the CPI news and it seems not that bad and way below the expected numbers, it seems it has affected the bullish mentality now.",

I mean if you think it will break over 2k and be a good price, then end up buying it as well that means there is a right answer, and if you think it will be over 2k but it fails to, and you lose money then that was a wrong answer. So, people should realize that this is just a poll and nobody should make any investments based on a poll.I think that in the long run it will break it, maybe this month, maybe not, but it will be over 2k and even be over 10k eventually and that is something I invest accordingly, doesn't mean I would suggest anyone else to do it just because I am doing it.",
