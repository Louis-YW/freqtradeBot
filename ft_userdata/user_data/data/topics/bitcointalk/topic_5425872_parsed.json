Currently BTC, ETH, BUSD, USDT, and more are supported. Once activated, Hyperdex manages all necessary components. All users must do is wait and collect profits when due.Profit for each cube type is paid out in the same asset deposited (e.g. BTC cubes return profit in BTC).LIVE PRODUCTSSo far Fixed Income, Algorithmic Trading, and Race (derivatives) Trading Cubes are currently available.Fixed IncomeUsers may earn a fixed return on select crypto and stable coin deposits over a fixed time period.To invest, users simply browse and select a cube.
