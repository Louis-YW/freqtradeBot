Though I don't have chrome updated on my PC and like Rikafip said, it's not a trouble just wanted to confirm if I'm the only person that's experiecing the problem. I'd try with chrome once it's updated.",

      "body": "I use Firefox, and my shortcuts are shift + alt + S. So, a little more work, but it should work as long as you have the language setup correctly. Obviously, to preview it would be shift + alt + P. Do note, it's not Alt Gr, it's the left hand alt that's oriented on your keyboard. As far as I know, it's handled by the browser more than the OS that the browser is on, but just for covering all basis' I'm running Linux, inside Qubes OS. However, like I said it shouldn't make too much difference what OS your using. if it does like loyceV suggests then, just take a look at your keybindings on the OS, and see if you can figure out the corresponding one based on the answers here. I'm running a fairly modified Firefox, especially via policies, but it shouldn't affect the keybindings. Quote from: ETFbitcoin on February 13, 2023, 11:24:28 AMI just tried it and doesn't work on my device. For reference i tested it with Tor Brwoser on Linux, although i don't know keyboard setting on my OS.Have a look at your settings on your distribution, it'll vary depending on which one you have. As for Tor, I can't see it acting any differently to the default Firefox, as long as the same language is being used.",

You do not need too but some people will find it easier to use. You can post without previewing and for people with smaller windows or smaller resolutions they can post without scrolling down the page there is a use to it but it does not mean everyone has a use for it.",
