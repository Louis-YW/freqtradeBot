Kindly describe clearly which function you encountered when using kyc? Because depending on the situation and the use of different sections, (e.g. flash exchange on the homepage, buy and sell coins, wealth management, and currency deposits are traded in the standard market), the corresponding solution plans are also different. If you just use the lightning exchange on the homepage, there is no KYC.. (Please see quote #5 for additional reference)",

Since the topic of our post is the website's home page, the Currency Exchange (converter), we don't require users to register or get verified in our site. You can exchange without registering an account. KYC is not required. Legal currencies are fiat currencies. If you plan to use other features in our site, like buying crypto coins, registering an account is a must. Why? We must perform KYC verification for users purchasing and selling coins due to legal restrictions, to make sure you don't use our website to engage in illicit activities like money laundering.  If you need to use fiat currency to purchase a cryptocurrency, it can only be used after the KYC verification is completed.If a non-registered user uses our home page, and the order fails to be converted successfully, we will return your funds to the original way. In this case, you may please provide your order number so we can help you. Live chat on the website is also available, and other contact details are also provided. Non-registered/verified users can message. Please be aware that once a transaction has been initiated and the system accepts it, it cannot be canceled. Please confirm and double-check that the order is correct before proceeding with the transaction. The instant exchange function transaction cannot be canceled as long as you successfully transfer to the account you provide. If you haven't transferred the money, just stop the transfer or get a new order. Old orders can be ignored. I hope this helps.",

One advice that I can give you right now is to change font family on Trade page, I don't know if its only me but I find it hard to read numbers on orderbook, they look very bold and harsh.Hello, Thank you for your warm welcome.1. We do not have a so-called headquarters, our team are in distributed offices, just like most digital currency exchanges.2. We weren’t against KYC. We require KYC once it involves legal currency trading.3. We apologize that we cannot inform you of the total amount of our reserve currency due to some reasons.4. Most of our transactions are completed within a few minutes. If there is fraud, we won’t be able to cover it up. Everyone is keeping an eye on us. In addition, we also have a twitter small channel and other contact information.The floating exchange rate is different from the introduction of the exchange rate. Because of our current activities, the price of the floating exchange rate is momentarily reduced, and we hope that more users can try to use our services.We apologize for the errors. As per the maintenance of the website, we still continue to put a lot of effort into doing better and enhancing our website.Thank you for your interest and inquiries Quote from: RikandMorty1 on August 21, 2023, 02:15:14 AMIt would be nice if you could add the website link to your post OP.
