This is, unfortunately, what the educational system does.I am also a victim. Wish I had joined this forum earlier.Your post is somewhat confusing.First of all, it's normal to be cautious about everything. It's not about being taught as child, it's about evolution. Else we would be still eating mostly poisonous mushrooms.The problem is that people were taught to trust authority, and authority is (at least sometimes) unreliable or blatantly incorrect.What's the issue with education system? Simple: in many cases is insufficient and poorly structured, hence not getting enough people to the point they can think for themselves (hence they rely on what the authority tells them to do).So yes, educational system has issues, but calling it bad is unfair at best. And this is what you imply. And nothing stops us from helping our children get more info than the educational system provides and learn how to use best that info.You say you're a victim. Victim of what? Of education? Victim of exchanges? (What does some unknown exchange do between known and reputed exchanges?)",

We are all feel hesitating to get in with something new. Bitcoin is something weird and can not easily understand for the elderly. I implied that the ages affect how people accept or don't accept Bitcoin. If you are young, teenagers, in 20s, 30s, you are more likely to accept Bitcoin.For people from 40s to 50s and above, it is harder for them to accept it.QuoteThis is, unfortunately, what the educational system does.Age affects our readiness to learn something new including learning Bitcoin. Education about Bitcoin, blockchain for the young is a good approach. It will help to increase Bitcoin adoption in future.",

But people have forgotten the prime factor that when the risk is high, the return of investment is also great.Nevertheless OP ,i can see your feelings that you are really upset, as you are not an early investor of the coin, so definitely you are feeling bad. But guess what currently Bitcoins price are best,so use this advantage and buy as many coins as possible.",

Even in last year, bitcoin always made appearance in every Bank's mailers where it was showcased under a negative light. So where people are so dependent on the banking system, they will grow a negative mindset against bitcoin. They grow fearful of any such new innovation. Unfortunately that's how human mind works! You tell bad things about bitcoin for 50 times to someone and they will eventually start believing the same. But thankfully the younger generation is able to show courage in new things and innovations.",

As I’ve shared this many times, here’s a GREAT quote from Andreas that covers this topic ..\"I think many of the intellectually honest people eventually stop being critics, because they suddenly realize that the flaws they are identifying are temporary features, issues, and not inherent problems. There are very few inherent problems in a dynamically evolving design or ecosystem of different designs all competing, that cannot be resolved.  There are critics who criticize this technology primarily based on their world view.   It is politically inconsistent with their world view.  It’s not that they do not like the technology it’s that they do not like the implications of this technology and the primary criticism you get then is “this should not be” to which all I can answer is ..and yet it is.  “but we mustn’t”… and yet we did, “but you shouldn’t”.. but yet we did\"- Andreas Antonopoulos.",

For example yourself, you once felt victimized by it, and now know that some of it is legit. I think, you know that by gathering information, and studying. it happened to me too.",

I wouldn't blame anyone though, the times we are in calls for extra care and caution from everyone especially with the distinction between dubious and credible becoming fainter by the day. What I will always say is the source where one gets their information about something in this case bitcoin, matters a lot and can go a long way in making people believe in it's credibility faster.

Moreover, sometimes it's important to be cautious, and I'd say feeling insecure when using centralized platforms is a healthy approach because many make a mistake of carelessly storing their coins on a centralized platform and then suffering when there's a hack, an exit scam, or an exchange freezes the funds and asks for things related to KYC.I think most people aren't investors into anything, and of those who invest, the majority would prefer a low-risk investment. Bitcoin is highly volatile, and the risks shouldn't be underestimated. People who are afraid of investing should stay away, it's better for them and for the market. For them because they remain calmer people and make responsible decisions. For the market because we already have plenty of panic sellers, and having less could help make Bitcoin more stable.",
