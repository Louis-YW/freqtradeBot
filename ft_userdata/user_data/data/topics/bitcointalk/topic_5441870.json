Those two are some of the last places where you should keep your bitcoin because former is a closed source wallet under Binance control, while latter is exchange where you don't even have control over your own bitcoin. Not your keys, not your coins.By far the best place to store your bitcoin is your own non-custodial wallet, preferably hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) if you can afford it. If not, software wallets  like Electrum will be fine, just make sure to store your seed at a safe place.",

Even when such advice and/or information is given you free, you would still be asked to do your own research. That particular phrase with the acronym DYOR is a disclaimer by the advisor and/or informant stating that they are not responsible for any losses you may encounter as a result of their advice and/or information. About your question. It all depends how much bitcoin you want to buy and how long you will allow your bitcoin before withdrawal. If you are buying anything less than $50, there is no need  spending more than $30 to get a hardware wallet. Then if you are buying bitcoin to withdraw when their is a 2 to 5% increase in the price you bought, you may also consider to use exchange for easy monitoring. Otherwise follow what Rikafip advised above.",

I am still in confusion. Btw what is previously said that always a hardware wallet is better to store your crypto. If you use any software wallet you must keep the secret key securely in offline. Never store it in online to keep yourself secure.And about investment, if people in the world thing about investing in crypto they first think about  Bitcoin.  If you give me a list where BTC is involved and ask me to.choose a crypto for investment, I will say it’s Bitcoin. But if you don't have any knowledge of investment, you must gather some knowledge first before depositing in crypto either it’s Bitcoin or other crypto.",

There will be no possibility of hacking. please help and advice? Irrespective of where you keep your Bitcoin, there's a possibility of it been hacked and stolen from you immediately you become careless with your private keys. It doesn't matter if you're using a paper wallet, Electrum or any of the hardware wallets, provided you have exposed your private keys by storing them online, your wallet is as good as been hacked. Both Trust wallet and Binance are central service providers and not the best place to store your Bitcoin especially as you'll be investing for long term.I make use of electrum, you can download the mobile version (for everyday transactions) or that of the PC and make use of it for storing your coins for longer term without any complications. You just have to update the wallet to the latest version whenever you see the notification and make sure the devices you're using to access your wallet isn't been used for other online activities as malware could infect your PC from so doing..",

There is no difference between them, and on the contrary, you put it in a place where it can be hacked.Any open source wallet is a good option, in the forums electrum is often recommended for your desktop and Samurai Wallet for your Android phone.Then, make sure that the operating system is clean and does not contain viruses, do not randomly click on links or randomly download files, especially from torrents (paid applications for free or cracked.)As for investment, do not invest in something you do not understand, learn about bitcoin and invest in the long term.The best investment strategy is to buy fixed amounts of bitcoin every period, for example, a week, and keep it for several years.",

Obviously, you do not know the difference between a custodial and noncustodial wallet and what is the safest between the two, I don't recommend you put or hold your Bitcoin in Binance or any exchange, the risk is just too high, go to a wallet where you control the key, and about the possibility of hacking it depends on how well you know about computer security, I always say that once you invest in Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency you are your own bank and so much depends on your knowledge of security.",

There will be no possibility of hacking. please help and advice? If you are a new person in this forum and are also just trying to invest in Bitcoin with the expectation of profit and security in putting Bitcoin in the wallet. You can use a hardware wallet if you have the extra money to buy it, but if you prefer a free wallet that is secure and doesn't have to spend extra money to create one. You can use an Electrum, Bluewallet, or trustwallet wallet if you are familiar with these wallets. Because all those wallets are much better as an option for you to use than you put them on the exchange even though the exchange is Binance. Here's a little advice from me to you, I hope you get enlightened on this and have fun investing in Bitcoin.",

Investing in Bitcoin can either be profitable or a loss.It depends on time period you decide to invest and prices at that time which will actually tell whether you are in profit or in loss but if you have long term holding in mind without even thought of selling or getting panicked with normal dumps you are mostly in profitable boat.But you should be prepared for that time period which can be more then 4+ years.Quote from: Mr.corol on March 02, 2023, 04:24:39 PMShould I put it in Trust Wallet or Binance? Hoping for advice from everyone on where it should be placed? As already pointed out these two options must be avoided at any cost if you are looking for safety of your funds as Binance is a CEX which will have the control over your funds with your keys so what safety do you expect when giving third party acess to your funds who can spend it or even restrict you from withdrawing your funds? The good option is non custodial wallet like Electrum if you are not interested in buying hardware wallets which are more safe options as your keys remain safe with you without leaving your device.Quote from: Mr.corol on March 02, 2023, 04:24:39 PMThere will be no possibility of hacking. please help and advice?

You are correct, mate. It would be wise for him to learn more about bitcoin before making an investment. Avoid acting too cleverly by asking questions you don't understand. Instead, try to research and understand the type of wallet you intend to use and which can be very secure for a long time. Although all wallets aren't perfect, it all comes down to how you keep your secret keys and don't divulge them to anyone.",

I don't agree. Every time is good to get some bitcoin, you just have to be smart about it. Let's say that you have 10k USD lying around, waiting to be spent and you have a steady income that allows you to cover your basic needs. Divide that 10k into a number of parts, like 10 times 1k each and dollar cost average by spending 1k every week, or every month if buying each week is too much for you. Put the coins on a desktop wallet immediately, if you don't have, or don't want to buy a hardware wallet. Don't keep it on exchanges and don't use web wallets. I'm not recommending a paper wallet because it may be annoying to use for a beginner.While buying, project a profit within 24 months. Don't check your balance every day, or even every week, it will only make you nervous. Forget about the investment, at least for a month or two, it will teach you patience.",
