  "content": "In the topic I covered today, let's talk together about the idea of debt, why it is bad for the majority, and why it is used as a tool for the advancement of the few. If we observe people in debt, it's like your friend who borrows a cellphone, your neighbor who owes a motorcycle and vehicle, and the person you know who borrows to build their house. We can notice and see that most of them are not happy. Because instead of enjoying the money owed, it becomes a burden because it is automatically deducted from their wages at work. And this is often the reality of a person's life in debt.Even so, using debt is not bad at any time. It is true that many people have become miserable because of debt, but if you are strategic and use it to build an asset, it can help you get rich or get out of life. And this is possible. In fact, all the successful entrepreneurs we know use debt to grow their businesses so they can maintain their lifestyle, and this is called leverage. Instead of using your own money to build assets, you will use other people's money as capital. Instead of waiting for a short period of time, you can start now with just your simple idea and the money of other people.Let's discuss this matter, friends. If others don't already know, there are two types of debt. This is bad debt, and the second is good debt. And we know that this concept was explained by Robert Kiyosaki.* Bad debt: This is what makes a person suffer, because it is the things that give us liabilities or the ones that decrease in value, such as gadgets and cars. And the common problem with these loans is that you will pay them with high interest.* Good debt: this is the type of debt that will make a person rich. Or else you will also earn money because, instead of using it for your needs, you will use it to build an asset. Which, if you handle it properly, can give you extra income.So that we can give more clarity to good debt, I will give an example: You want to build your own business; you have a product, a business plan, and a marketing strategy. But the problem is that you lack capital. And the amount you need is $1,000. So what you did was share this idea with friends who you think have the potential to become investors. You explained it well, presented it well, and they liked it and were willing to invest. And you convinced your friend to borrow money, and you will pay him back in two years with interest. Then you started your business immediately; people liked it, and it became profitable immediately in the first year. It gives you constant income, and it continues to grow.After two years, you have paid your friend. And your business just keeps growing. And it all started with an idea. Your idea is to build a business, and you use other people's resources as a tool to build your own assets. But it's an important reminder that you also need to be doubly careful when using debt. Although this is a good tool, you must work yourself out to handle it properly.what I means you must know how to handle money. Must have skills, such as COMMUNICATION, LEADERSHIP, NEGOTIATION, SELLING and INTRAPERSONAL. Because if you borrow money and use it in your business, it doesn't mean that everything will be okay immediately and your business will grow automatically. It's just that not every time the weather agrees with what you want to happen in your life.",

Because if you borrow money and use it in your business, it doesn't mean that everything will be okay immediately and your business will grow automatically. It's just that not every time the weather agrees with what you want to happen in your life.That's right, someone who takes out a loan to start a business must be able to handle their money well, by using it in a controlled manner so that it doesn't just go to waste. Also, in my opinion, borrowing money to start a business is not wrong, because you have to have the courage to take action, even by borrowing money for capital to start a business. someone who has an idea to start a business but they don't have enough money to run their idea into a business and they take out a loan to start the business in my opinion they are people who dare to take action, because they dare to take risks to become better. There are people who stop when they run out of capital to start a business, because they don't dare to take risks so they prefer to quit.I personally prefer to take out a loan if I don't have enough money to start a business, because in my opinion we should have the courage to move forward, even though there are risks, but in my opinion that doesn't make me stop there. Dare to take risks is an action that is not wrong, because at least if we fail, we have tried and done our best. By taking out a loan to start a business, it means we have to manage it well so we can produce and pay off the debt we have. Regarding the risks, the important thing is that we have the courage to move forward, which is good.",

      "body": "I agree with that, because being in debt is not always bad, depending on why we take out a loan and what we use the money for. If the designation is clear, to start a business for example, because you lack capital so inevitably you have to take a loan, so that what you planned before can be realized immediately and you can start to do business.However, it is careless.... if we take loans for things that are less important, such as to fulfill your desire to have a luxury house. Even though you also have a house. it's just that the house you have is very simple. That is careless, because it will only add to your life burden, you live in a luxurious house but your life is so miserable. because you have to think about credit every month. So in conclusion, when we take out a loan, before doing so, we must have a clear reason and designation. So that we are not too confused in paying installments every month. Because the money you borrow, can make money back.",

Natural disasters, changes in government policies and conflicts could lead to the collapse of any business and the banks will not take any excuse when they come to ask for payback. They will claim the collateral making you lose more than you bargained. I prefer to start a business with the funds available and gradually grow or expand the business. But loans could be of great importance, especially to businessmen with good business plans and the requisite skills to run a business. In my country, there has been an increase in a loan system called \"easy buy\". People can now buy phones, gadgets and even designer clothes on credit. I find it unreasonable to access loans just because you want to change a phone, car or television. All these items are fragile and decrease in value drastically. But I might consider taking a soft loan to buy a house because it will help me save more money.",

There is too much talk about Debt and its impact on life with in different regions we have different view about this all because in few countries peoples don't like this and feel this is not good for anything but still in few countries we have good things about this all which bring good changes but for this all we need to make a solid strategy which helps us for having better use of this all without any strategy and pre-planning things can go into wrong way, and you can go into deep trouble.Even I am personally having good changes with my debits and this make me to do many things which were never been possible because I have short of money for long time so mostly I suggest just go ahead, but you need to think about this before jumping and having better use of this because many times we have terrible impact as well, but this all depends on the user how he is going to do this all.",

It is true a loan you take can be used to build your wealth, however if it was possible to avoid asking for a loan we should take that path as taking a loan will in most cases be an inferior solution than just using your own money, as in the example given by the OP the business idea became a success, but as we know most businesses go bankrupt in just a few years and if you asked for a loan to start that business not only you will not have it anymore but now you will owe a lot of money that you now need to pay up.",

Rich people have the capital but they simply don't use it, they use it to pay back the debt in case if their plan goes wrong ways but an average Joe will never have backup resources to pay back and then end up defaulting on the loan.",
