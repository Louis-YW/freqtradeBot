What are the characteristics of a good post and how do we earn a merit for our post and other activities happening here and how is Bitcoin always important in the forums . So Member, full member, hero member, Lagendary and so on pls let have the tips thanks üôè‚ù§Ô∏è #bitcoin LordsYou're welcome to the forum.First of all, you should ask yourself why you're here on the forum, this forum is somewhere that provides you with all the Bitcoin knowledge you require and new in your Bitcoin journey, this is the primary aim of this this forum, and then alongside that, their are other incentives that comes along with the knowledge you acquire, which is the gaining of merits and attaining a significant position on the forum and joining a paid signature campaign and then start earning from it.The problems that we encounter here on the forum as newbies is that we fail to understand the reason for the forum and then we prioritize gaining merits over the learning and seeking knowledge which is wrong. It's just like the bible said, seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and every other thing will be added to you, so it is here, seek first the knowledge embedded on this forum and the merits will follow as rewards. Rather than making merits your priority, I advice you dedicate yourself to learning and acquiring knowledge here, then you'll have something to offer, because you can only earn merit here when you have something productive to offer, that's when you'll be rewarded with merits, so how can you earn merits when you've got absolutely nothing to offer? This is what many newbies fail to understand and in their quest to seeking merits rather than knowledge, they end up spamming the forum and making irrelevant and unproductive posts and comments just because they're hungry for merits, you won't succeed here like that. Everyone in this forum who has attained a certain significant position all have something to offer and something they've offered to the forum and are now reaping their rewards. So the best way to earn merits is to go first for the knowledge, do your research and then you'll be surprised how the merits will start coming in their numbers.You can also look at the threads below, could also be helpful to youTopic: How to earn merit https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2978377.0Topic: How to earn merit?? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5070524.0Topic: How can I earn Merit? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5039637.0Topic: How to earn a merit https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4803789.0Topic: How to earn merits. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4642499.0Topic: what is merit how to earn \"Merit\" easy? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4547944.0",

Hence, I don't know if I am mistaking or not, that every accredited (approved) boards in the forum as a whole has a specific Merit source who empowered with a specific amount of Merits to randomly speculate the merits within the forum a specific board user (member): with the above constructive and highly appreciative quality POSTs.So as a newbie, tend to o believe that you are only liable to earn MERITs here on the local board but also as other related boards on the forum. The thing is that earning writing to make one of the worth meriting POSTs is not such an easy task.Asking about about what you can achieve here as a Bitcointalk forum users, you are opportuned to learn about Bitcoin in a general overview and other AltCoins including the activities that is surrounded to lives are also discussed here. You also have the privilege to meet and discuss with the Bitcoin lord's here as you may address the case.Again is that the forum has a program that earns the qualified members token of Bitcoins or AltCoins through a the user (s) joining a campaign and joining the campaign is considered by a minimum of expected ranks in position.",

I started to bring topics which are about scam on this forum and also about something related to bitcoin. Before I knew, I have my 50 merits.It is not only about bringing the topics, also there are people that will post on your topic's thread. I read all their posts and reply when necessary. You replies can also be given merits. And you will grow. The more you will grow and rank up, the meore you will understand more about this forum and know more about how to earn merit.

So by the time you understand all this thing,¬† you will be able to arrange yourself and know how to go about your forum growth and development,¬† but the ultimate thing is to write quality posts and contributions and before you know it,¬† you will see yourself receiving merits,¬† and for sure merits is very very motivating for a member,¬† each time your posts receive merits,¬† you feel as you have impacted or share something that is useful to another member and that why they have rewarded you with merits.

The forum is designed to talk about Bitcoin and the only reason why the concept of merit became necessary is to encourage individual that are giving in their time and effort in contributing meaningfully to the growth of the forum. You only get merited when you've made positive contributions to the forum that has helped the next persons doubt to be cleared or when you've shared a meaningful information or insight in the forum.
