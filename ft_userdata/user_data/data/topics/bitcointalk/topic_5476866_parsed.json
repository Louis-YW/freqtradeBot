      "body": "Thanks for the questions. I encourage you to visit the account description where you'll find a GitHub link to the repository, where there are comprehensive details, explanations, and the rationale behind the index. This index is distinctive because it captures a holistic view of the crypto market by encompassing a wide variety of tokens, beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum-based tokens. The account is newly established because it was just recently that the author decided to open it. The creator wanted a separate account solely for sharing this resource. Importantly, there is no monetary solicitation involved; the index has been the creatorâ€™s personal tool for crypto investment for over four years and is now being offered openly and free of charge, with the hope that it may benefit others.",
