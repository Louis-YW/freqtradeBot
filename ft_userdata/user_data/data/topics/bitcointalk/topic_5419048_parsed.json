Many exchanges are not really providing truthful figures in terms of BTC volume. Most of them are exaggerating their volumes to show liquidity and attract traders. Coingecko is showing that the volume has actually risen a lot but tradingview as well as bitcoinity is showing that the volume has already decreased. But the data provided by tradingview and bitcoinity are not as comprehensive as coingecko. They are only using volumes of certain exchanges. Coingecko is probably giving a total figure. But this is questionable because of fake volumes submitted by exchanges.",

What am I missing here?That's the part you're wrong here, why you're only look from BTC/USD market? BTC doesn't only have one pair, actually any coins and fiat can be traded with Bitcoin. You need to look from the whole BTC market, just like @hosseinimr93 mentioned above where the current Bitcoin's volume is +10x higher than 2017/2018 volume. Maybe the BTC/USD pair is decrease since many people doesn't want to sell their coin to USD, they're prefer to hold their coin.",

According to Coingecko, Bitstamp's share from the total trading volume is below 0.15%.",

What am I missing here?One thing certain with bitcoin right now is that (just like it's tagged a store of value) with the decline from $68k to it recent all time low amount which i believe was a little above $17k, and then this recent sharp rise to the current price of $20+k, alot of investors are anticipating another bull season around the corner, so a greater number of investors/traders might have pulled a greater percentage of their money out from the futures market and buying bitcoin on spot market in order not to miss out just incase its a bull, so from this, it is likely that there is a lesser amount of bitcoin trades and more bitcoins going into store with hope for future profit.i might be wrong though, which i totally accept because we all are just speculating.",

What am I missing here?What you are missing is that you do not check the data thoroughly until you are immersed in information that is completely invalid or even false. Because in fact the volume of Bitcoin from year to year has increased dramatically. There needs to be an in-depth study for you so you don't get half-assed information. Because if you don't read much and do research it will only make your thinking limited. Bitcoin will continue to increase over time and volume has come a long way from the first time Bitcoin was traded.",

Just click on \"Bitstamp\" to see a list including some other exchanges. I don't know why by default it has been set to Bitstamp. Maybe, it's kind of advertising.
