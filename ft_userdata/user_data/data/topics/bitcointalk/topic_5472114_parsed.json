I completely forgot that \"untrusted/trusted feedback\" are feedbacks that came from other users and \"sent feedbacks\" are the ones the user sent to other users. I am drunk, I've been drinking for several hours now, and I am gonna blame this on the beers I've drank, so it's not my fault for being a dumbass.sorry if this is off-topic.",

They exploited the historical animosity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, insisting that I must furnish identification to prove that I am not of Pakistani origin before they would proceed. When I requested a refund, they resorted to threatening me. Their behavior was utterly deplorable, and they relentlessly sent threatening messages on Telegram.",

The Bangladeshi community here is small, and someone may have dealt with this scammer, but in the future, avoid all those who sell PayPal accounts, as they are either stolen or created illegally, or they will be closed after a period of time, so it is better to look for alternatives or ask someone who has a PayPal account to make a deposit on your behalf, with the ability to pay him in Bitcoin.",

Instead of using other PayPal accounts and isn't buying a PayPal account which is registered using details and personal information from other people is an illegal thing? Isn't that an identity theft case right? So basically OP here is also guilty of something illegal which makes me not sympathize with his/her problem of getting scammed.",
