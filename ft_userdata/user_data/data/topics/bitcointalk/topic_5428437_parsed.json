I know many investors are not happy about what is happening in the crypto market, because the best solution to it, is to continue holding not to panick because the bullish season is very near for long term investors to experience positive change from the market. I believe, this situation will not remain like this till January because there are some signs altcoins and Bitcoin are displaying for investors to believe that there is a bright future ahead.",

What I mean is that in 2017 our all time high is $19+++. And so look a the price of Bitcoin? it's just $17+++ and it's the first time that we have witnessed this kind of movement.And this is just the beginning, 2023 is still considered a bear market and so we have to endured that as well same as 2022.Yes, we don't want to see this kind of price, but we can't do anything and so we will have to face it.",

Why did you decide that the bulls left the crypto market forever? Sorry, but ahead of the crypto winter, and then the rise of the entire crypto market. Buy while it's cheap, and fill your bags with tokens like UPCG from UpcomingsDAO's ongoing Airdrop. Closer to March 2023, it will be known! And while the bear's attack.",

Hopefully, next year can bring changes to the crypto market and make bitcoin and altcoin prices increase higher than now. And even though we still have to wait for the market to change to a bull market condition, that's okay because the market price doesn't fall too deep either. We must wait in the current conditions and keep hoping everything will change soon.",

As I observed the movements, it looked like the bear would go for a longer time than we may have expected. I would be expecting some changes as the year end closes in, but that is classically known to be a bear run, so I am not sure whether it will end  up being a prolonged bear market or a bullish trend, consider the fact that prices of major assets are inching upwards currently.While every bear market is bad, comparing how bad or how good will not result in anything fruitful. Rather it is the amount of assets that you can gather during this \"hunting season\" what matters. Because when the bull market starts, prices will go beyond your reach for weeks and at that time everyone will sulk around saying that they dont have the asset at hand to sell and are panic buying shitcoins which might be within their reach will huge chunks from their salary, eventually leading to disastrous outcome in the next bear cycle.",

You know why? It's because, 2018 was worse than this current bear market. But still, those that have bought at the top for this cycle might say that this is the worst bear market that they've seen and there's no need to argue with that. Anyone who's at lost is free to say what he thinks with the market, if it's not profitable as much as he want to be and dwelling in losses. That's how bad this bear market is and no one can skip it.",

Ever since the FTX incident it didn't recover yet from that devastating event. Maybe if SBF return all of the assets lost of most investors who used his exchange maybe the price would pump up a little but it's all just an speculation if that's going to happen.Every Bitcoin cycle there's this one time that the market will look like it's over to almost everyone but not if you know how the market works.And also, I think most people who invested on Luna still suffering from the losses and hardly trying to recover.",

Only these two incidents cause the entire cryptocurrency industry to tremble, but thank goodness the market held up and didn't crash like it did in 2018.",

Also, this time, despite its badness, gave us a lot of lessons and we gained a lot of experience during it, one day we will witness a bull market, and these difficult times and crises that the crypto market is going through may remain just memories, so be optimistic and invest in what you can lose.",

It doesn't mean that there could be another exchanges collapsing, but maybe there could be another FUD that can pull the market on the brink of another all time lows this bear cycle.We just have to accept that fact though that Do Kwon and SBF has something to do with how the market turn out to be this 2022.",
