  "content": "I think it would be cool if the community had some kind of tool (however blunt) to help smoke out liars. So, the way I see it working is that someone senior (maybe a mod) maintains a thread (in Reputation?) that's meant to collect and quote truth \"declarations\" (kind of like how address staking works, the quoting is to prevent edits/deletions). The idea is that if someone says something like: \"I don't have any alt accounts.\", then you can encourage them to state that fact in this new topic. Then they go over there and post something to that effect in a format like this: \"I, $MEMBER do hereby state the following: As of $TIMESTAMP, I $DECLARATION.\"If it later turns out that this person was full of shit, then tagging can ensue. Even better, if this system were supported by a new forum rule that lying in that specific thread is a bannable offense, then people would think very carefully about what they write there. I don't believe that banning is too harsh of a punishment, because nothing (except community pressure) forces anyone to ever write anything in that topic, if they don't want to. Of course, their refusal to do so would also be a semi-reliable signal that they might be full of shit.I'll go first: \"I, PowerGlove do hereby state the following: As of Oct 15 2022, I've never open-mouth kissed a horse.\" [This is a joke and a terrible example]Anyway, I'm not wedded to this idea and I realize I'm still too junior to make suggestions like these, but maybe it'll spark some interesting discussion between more experienced members!Edit: To be clear, the only kinds of \"declarations\" that I have in mind are things which are potentially falsifiable by other forum members (otherwise, why bother) and that ends up being a pretty small set of things (alt accounts, merit abuse, trust abuse, etc.)Here are a few things I'd like to say about this proposal:I had a very specific thing in mind when I thought of this (the recent naim027 drama, which is what got me thinking about honesty).I'm against reckless tagging and don't want to encourage misuse of the trust system.My position is scattered throughout this thread, and you'll have to read each my posts to understand it.This proposal is (I feel) a little more subtle and sophisticated than most people are giving it credit for.Please try and give it a \"generous\" reading, steel-manning leads to better discussion than straw-manning does.",

I suppose it's a matter of how much usage you believe a thread like that would have, though. I mean, especially with the caveat that it should only be used for declarations that are potentially falsifiable by forum members, do you think it would be used so much that it would be unmaintainable? With millions of members, you'd think the \"Stake your Bitcoin address here\" thread would be overflowing, but it just quietly ticks over (582 pages and counting) with only a post every now and then (I know that's a very different demographic, and a topic that most people use one time and then never again, but still). Although, maybe I'm underestimating how often people would enjoy putting each other to the test and saying \"Oh really, why don't you post that in the pinocchio thread?\" Edit: Reading Chymist's post again, it looks like maybe my horse-kissing joke might have confused things. Just in case it did, I want to be clear that the proposal is for people themselves to post their declarations in the right thread, not in random places like I did. I'm not expecting some poor soul to have to scour the forum looking for declarations to quote. All the maintainer of this hypothetical new topic would have to do is delete off-topic posts and occasionally quote a declaration themselves, when the community itself has failed to do so (which won't happen very often if the \"Stake your Bitcoin address here\" topic is anything to go by).",

      "body": "Well, yes, I like both ideas, but consider this: liars are everywhere. It is inevitable that they will be here. I doubt that such people will voluntarily publish incriminating evidence about themselves here ... at least not if they have any common sense or self-preservation. Liars will always try to cover their tracks. If they admit to lying or confirm their lie and a thread provides proof of their guilt - then yes, they are guilty as charged. If they deny it - then there isn't much more you can do because of the nature of this place. You cannot force someone to admit they are a liar. So, I think it will be more useful to have a thread where members can post evidence that someone is lying. And just like we have threads to expose alt accounts or plagiarists, I think it would be helpful for members to post evidence about someone who has lied. If someone is obviously lying, and you can prove it - then it would be great if we could have a thread where the evidence could be posted. It would also help if other members could verify those claims and offer additional proof, if necessary. I think a thread like this will help clear up confusion about what is true and what isn't, especially in regards to controversial topics.",

Not all lies are equal and I don't want to encourage incorrect tagging, I didn't really think of that. On the other hand, if you don't want to face the (possibly unfair) consequences of lying, then just don't let yourself be goaded into posting a false declaration, you know?Quote from: Stalker22 on October 16, 2022, 09:21:44 AMI doubt that such people will voluntarily publish incriminating evidence about themselves here ... at least not if they have any common sense or self-preservation. Liars will always try to cover their tracks.Yeah, me too. But that's kind of what I find interesting about this (especially the banhammer version); I like the idea of speeding up investigations by having more signals available that someone might be being dishonest, and a refusal to post something in that thread is a pretty strong signal. I also like the idea of having a place where reputations can be defended by posting things that are likely (or at least more likely) to be true. Of course, there needs to be the credible threat of being banned for any of the \"game theory\" to work out.Quote from: Stalker22 on October 16, 2022, 09:21:44 AMSo, I think it will be more useful to have a thread where members can post evidence that someone is lying.

Everyone has an equal right to their prerogatives. AFAIK - it's driven in diverse ways... people don't say or suggest the same thing so for that reason, I'll say that you're right to make a move. The question is: is these some kinda segregation BTW the typically masked persons behind every account -- persons to Which you don't even know personally? Or are we just planning on for an unleveled rule to ruin our priceless liberty and engaged in wholesome TYRANNY?Gloves, you've a visceral conscription and you won't need to convince anyone of that: but I'm afraid that this particular appraisal was a misconception. I was hoping to get on something that'll have me drowned in a pool of perplexity and anxiety at the same time  and get my panties soaked in sweat  Change is the only thing constant: anyone could decide to say anything at anytime and at the long run, feel remorseful or left in their plight, such that they have no other choice than to evade or revoke the statement. I might claim to be something I'm not today, then by tomorrow -- I'd say I was intoxicated, too anxious or stressed ( emotional degradation)...The worst part is suggesting it as a ban-able offense; you're trying to create an atmosphere where people ain't given that pseudonymous freedom anymore and that'll automatically make out more forgeries outta people's asses.Comee onnnn..... Dearrrrr -- when there's a RULE, there's a WRONG. introducing very many rules won't make things right....If the purpose of this was to be made yet,  another way to trust peeps for not having different statement, is it even worth the time? Someone could keep pretending (some gurus are already good with that) until he/she gains a bunch of trust without ever being trustworthy, are you in any doubt?? How about the lies over the years? Will it be scrutinized as compared to the latter day?
