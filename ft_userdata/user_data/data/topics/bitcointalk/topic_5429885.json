Yes, in order to buy our cryptocurrency, including BTC, at a low price. This is called knocking cryptocurrencies out of weak hands. I don’t know, but still I see this whole situation with FTX and statements about the closure of cryptocurrencies as an attempt to push the price of cryptocurrencies down before the next flight to the moon. This is just my vision of the situation and of course it may not coincide with the real reasons.",

Because if they ban them or the centralized services, the scams won't stop and future FTX like collapses will still happen. And if they heavily regulate the market it still won't help users because such regulations have always been privacy invading type that targets users and they do nothing to provide any kind of security for them so FTX like collapses will still happen!",

In my observation, they are not going to ban crypto because they know they won't be able to stop it, but they are putting a lot of pressure on the market to find a way to penetrate and control it more tightly. That's what they're looking for because they don't want to miss the huge tax revenue from the market.",

Even the hype of this FTX is strongly spread by Government officials who want to put a stop to crypto currency. they have strike in every direction to stop (even the creation of CBDC) but to no avail. The worst they could try to do is regulate it because even other countries that tried to ban it have experienced its massive adoption by their citizens. They should rather find a way to call scammers like Sam of FTX to order when saga like this are pull off",

It has no operator, and no company behind it, and its operations span the world, so banning it is almost impossible. There might still be a way to stop bitcoin completely, but in my opinion, they would never do it because it's not worth doing, such as shutting down the entire internet or power. Those tasks can only be said on paper but cannot be performed.",

That’s because there always be lot of investors, developers, institutional groups who will be investing on high levels into the bitcoin. This is due to its very nature that was meant from its whitepaper. The very pseudonymous nature of the bitcoin, it’s capability of transacting in unlimited data is something that wasn’t achieved already. Though we keep saying governments are trying to ban it and stuff like that, there is one thing for sure they and private companies are already trying to explore more and more about the blockchain and thus it is meant to go on and on all the time.",

It will be in usage till there are people who are willing to use it with miners and nodes securing the network as there is profitability to them as well in form of rewards.So government will always put forward excuses which they have done from ages but bitcoin will keep going on.",

Bitcoin is decentralised codified with blockchain technology, it is very independent of every government to stop.Yes, maybe it can. But it is most likely difficult. I read a few months ago, the Chinese who have banned Crypto only there is still news that their residents are still using it. So china alone has not managed to fully suppress the use of crypto. Maybe if it was true the whole world had the same rules and users would be penalized it could happen. But so far I see Bitcoin developing in a good direction. Many countries of the world are adopting its technology. They (the government) want to keep going and don't want to be left with fiat money. So many countries make up CBDCs. The current world government can only regulate, killing this industry is too difficult.",
