In Russia, the mineral extraction tax has been in force since 2001 and this tax is much higher.",

Mining gold and mining bitcoin are two different things. Government can impose taxes on Bitcoin mining but can't impose royalty on it. Also I believe Bitcoin is considered as a digital security in US. Have you ever seen royalty is imposed on security? But a government can do whatever they want.

Bans don't work in Russia; they're useless. Thanks to global sanctions, Russia is now experiencing an economic boom.police love busting people for drugs, weapons and prostitution here. they set up sting operations and everything go to elaborate lengths to bust people so they can get a nice news story written about them. meanwhile they don't do anything about public safety and robberies and murders and rapes. because those don't make them any money.QuoteAny ban is a sign of weakness. I talk to Europeans and they themselves say that if their government bans cryptocurrencies, they will go on strike.no one here is going on any type of strike against the government i can guarantee you that. they're too busy with other things.QuoteYes, banks can prohibit payments, but most likely they will kill many other businesses at the same time, which will be an even more severe blow to the economy.i would say that bitcoin is kind of like the stock market to most people here in the usa. they hear it being talked about maybe here and there but don't really think of it doing anything. just something you can buy like a stock. but you can't really use it to do anything...I don't think the police need special operations because everyone already knows who sells drugs, where the illegal casinos are, and where the illegal currency exchanges take place.I want to talk badly about the Russian police. The work of the police has become more transparent, and people come there who want to help people, and not earn money from bribes.It seems to me that people in the USA are more afraid of tax inspectors than the police. I'm right?",
