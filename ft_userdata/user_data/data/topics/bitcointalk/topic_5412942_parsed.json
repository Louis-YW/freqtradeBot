At one of our founder's parties (that's who we call the gods), they spilled their favorite beverage called CAPS. That's how the Punkverse was formed. A strange, inexplicable universe with different planets. We have been exploring the vastness of this world for half a year now. There are a lot of lifeless planets. But we managed to find 3 where Punks live! Hence the name.Our CollectionsIn total, we know of only three planets and a special guests without own planet:⚡ Crypto Chronicles - the first collection of digital Punks on Waves blockchain, dedicated both to the major milestones in cryptocurrency history.  Check it out on Waves Marketplace⚡ Zombie Punks - the second chapter of the Punkverse. This collection is dedicated to the world-famous zombie culture. The Punks have taken on an authentic look and will battle it out in a future Zombie Rush game.Mint them here⚡ Memaliens - the first free mint collection on Waves. They were the invaders of the Punkverse in the past. But with the help of our community, we were able to tame them. Who knows, maybe someday they'll get back on the warpath? Check it out on Waves Marketplace⚡ Mad Punks - A new planet we recently discovered. It's a post-apocalyptic world where Punks have to fight for survival and valuable resources. The once peaceful life has come to an end, and now the Punks have split into 3 warring factions and are fighting a bloody war for survival.

Sure, Waves platform is alive as never before Here a lots of long-term projects, expecially related to NFTs. Waves Ducks, for example. It's official team product. Btw, Waves Punks collection is available on the market about a year for now. What's about Waves itself. According to their roadmap and Meta0 release, platform will solve some of the main issues of the blockchain.",

The answer is simple: NFTs on Waves are gaining momentum and we could be pioneers on it. A wide field for the experiments. Low fees and fast blockchain. Own language for smartcontracts - Ride. And very friendly community, which is intrested in education and platform development.Waves Punks is the first collectable project on Waves. Here are some more examples of \"old\" NFTs, such as Waves Ducks, which concentrated on play-to-earn, and Sign Art marketplace",

Waves is very much different now compared to five years ago I remember creating a token using their platform for $1 but now they are concentrating on what's trending right now, like NFT, I am also not aware of any token in their platform that reaches even the top 50 in the market, although they are still fast and cheap based on their stat, unfortunately, they lack the right marketing to keep this coin in the radar of investors.",
