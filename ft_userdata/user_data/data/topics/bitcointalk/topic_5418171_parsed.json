  "content": "QuoteRussian institute plans to build 7nm-capable scanner that beats ASML's analogue in several years.A Russian institute is developing its own lithography scanner that could produce chips using 7nm-class fabrication technologies. The machine is under development, with the plan to build it by 2028. When it is ready, it should be more efficient than ASML's Twinscan NXT:2000i tool, whose development took over a decade. After Russia unleashed its bloody war against Ukraine on February 24, Taiwan was quick to ban shipments of advanced chips to the nation. The U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. then followed up with sanctions that effectively prohibit virtually all contract chipmakers with advanced fabs from working with Russian entities. In addition, companies like Arm cannot license their technologies to Russia-based chip designers. As a result, the Russian government rolled out a national program to develop the country's own 28nm-class fabrication technology by 2030, reverse engineer as many foreign chips as possible, and educate local talent to work on domestic chips. However, there is a problem with a 28nm-class production node by 2030. Russia's most advanced fab can produce chips using a 65nm fabrication technology. Meanwhile, American and European makers of fab tools cannot supply their equipment to Russia due to sanctions, so the country has to design and build domestic wafer production equipment if it wants to adopt a 28nm node. Essentially, what has taken companies like ASML and Applied Materials decades to develop and iterate has to be done in about eight years.  Apparently, the Russian Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences intends to beat all expectations and produce a 7nm-capable lithography scanner by 2028, according to its plans published on Nizhy Novgorod Strategy Development website (via CNews). A modern lithography scanner capable of processing wafers using a 7nm-class process technology is a highly complex apparatus that involves a high-performance light source, sophisticated optics, and precise metrology, just to name a few critical parts. However, as a leading applied physics university in Russia, IAP believes that it can develop such a tool in a relatively short amount of time.  The tool will be somewhat different from scanners produced by companies like ASML or Nikon. For example, IAP plans to use a >600W light source (total power, not intermediate focus power) with an 11.3nm exposure wavelength (EUV wavelength is 13.5nm), which will require considerably more sophisticated optics than exists today. Because the light source of the device will be relatively low power, it will make the tool more compact and easier to build. Yet, it also means that its production of the scanner will be considerably lower than that of modern deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools. That might not be a problem, according to IAP. When it comes to timing, IAP may be slightly too optimistic. For everything below 32nm, chipmakers use the so-called immersion lithography (which is essentially a booster to DUV tools). ASML introduced its first immersion lithography system — the Twinscan XT:1250i —  in late 2003 with a plan to deliver one in Q3 2004 to produce 65nm logic chips and 70nm half-pitch DRAMs. It took the company about five years and another generation of tools to announce its 32nm-capable Twinscan NXT:1950i in late 2008, with customer deliveries starting in 2009. Then, it took the market leader some nine years to deliver its 7nm and 5nm-capable Twinscan NXT:2000i DUV tool in 2018. TSMC used less advanced tools with multi-patterning for its first-generation N7 fabrication technology, but the timing of ASML’s introductions demonstrate how hard it is to transition from 65nm to 7nm. It took ASML 14 years to go from 65nm to 7nm. Now, IAP, which does not have any experience in chip production or ties with chipmakers, intends to build a 7nm-capable machine for volume production from scratch in about six years. While the plan does not sound feasible, it looks like IAP is full of enthusiasm.\"ASML, the global lithography leader, has been developing its EUV lithography system for almost 20 years and the technology has turned out to be incredibly complex,\" said Nikolai Chkhalo, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences for scientific and technological development. \"The main objective of ASML in this case was to maintain the extremely high productivity that is needed only at the world's largest factories. In Russia, no one needs such high productivity. In our work, we start from the needs and tasks faced by domestic microelectronics — and this is not so much about quantity, but about quality. First of all, we need to transit to our own fabrication processes, develop our own design standards, our own tools, engineering, materials, so our own path is inevitable here. In fact, we need to balance between simplicity and performance.\" IAP plans to build a fully functional alpha scanner by 2024. This one will not have to offer high productivity or maximum resolution but will have to work and be attractive to potential investors. IAP intends to build a beta version of the scanner with higher productivity and resolution by 2026. This machine should be mass production ready, but its productivity is not expected to be at its maximum. The final iteration of the litho scanner is said to emerge in 2028. It should get a high-performance light source (hence better productivity), better metrology and overall capabilities. There is no word how many of such machines IAP and/or its production partners will be able to produce by 2028.It should be noted that fab equipment is not limited to lithography scanners. There are other types of machines performing etching, deposition, resist removal, metrology, and inspection operations that are not made in Russia. Furthermore, there is somewhat less advanced machinery like ultrapure air and water generators which also are not produced in Russia. Even if IAP RAS manages to build a lithography tool, Russia will still be a few hundred tools short of building a modern fab. Also, fabs need ultrapure raw materials produced in countries that will not supply to Russia.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lithograhy-tool-russia-7nm-2028....So it seems russia is committing itself towards developing its own cutting edge semiconductor industry. They set a goal of developing 7 nanometer chip fabrication by the year 2028.Analysts say russia would naturally take 10 years minimum to develop the technology from scratch as sanctions prevent them from sourcing components or data necessary to develop a 7 nm lithographic process.I think russia might conceivably fast track their development. The blueprint has been laid by corporate espionage and theft of classified and confidential material. Russia will have no need to reinvent the wheel if they can concievably steal or borrow all of the needed intelligence. Russian hackers were blamed for stealing the US elections in 2016. Its possible state sanctioned electronic attacks could seize documents needed to produce small scale chip fabrication. There are many past precedents for similar events in the past.The real question is to what extent lack of 7 nm chips is preventing russia from full scale manufacture of jet fighters, tanks and missiles. It is known that russia has only produced prototypes of its T-14 armata tank. As well as only prototypes of its newest line of jet fighters. Are 7 nm chips a bottleneck preventing russia from manufacturing these weapons of war on a large scale? If true it might mean that russia will not be able to produce T-14 armatas or new jet fighters until 2028 at the earliest. Which might give NATO near to a 6 year grace period.",

(a quick search says they at least were in 2020 so probably still are). Most of the patents for current chips are held by the US, UK or Japan so I think that's going to be one of the main things making the sanctions harder on Russia. I don't know if there's a reason for Russia to produce their own 7nm chips though, I'm not sure why they'd need so much efficiency and there might also be a competing architecture that gets open sourced by then (even just to spite them). Intel chips normally have 45nm technology with moderate energy consumption, smaller energy consumption machines (like arm with smaller chip sizes) are good for control units (such as on peripherals) so they don't need much power, but they're not an necessity imo.It's unclear what the majority of anti tank weapons used in Ukraine are but I know the ones gifted from Europe come with components that mean the course of the missile can be changed in flight if a tank tries to \"camouflage\" it's infrared signals - if these are the main types in use there, there's a good chance an arm controller isn't needed as it'll be quite useless. The only other thing I could think is GPS/inertial guidance or object avoidance systems (if those are a thing) which might be the reason they have problems building them.I wonder if the chip shortage has been the reason Russian fighter jets have been crashing into each other though too (or if it's just inexperienced/stressed pilots).",

It's one thing to build your chips in a fab, a totally different to have the tools to build that in the first place.ASML holds a near total monopoly on lithography, even TSMC and Samsung for example are 100% dependent on those machines, and neither has been able to match them and do their own, that's why everybody who has a clue about the long chain of logistics and supplies in the chip-making business knows that even if China gets hold of TSMC it can do basically nothing after the first production cycle is done for they will still need foreign machines, and the alternatives for ASML are either Canon or Nikon, just lol.As for Russia, good luck, they will succeed where no other company has managed to do that, they can't even produce their own archaic chips now they want to build their own lithography machines, that's just how they wanted to sell pork meat to Indonesia or their magic Yota phone (which went bankrupt) while they can't even get old chips to build simple airbag systems for their cars.QuoteAre 7 nm chips a bottleneck preventing russia from manufacturing these weapons of war on a large scale? If true it might mean that russia will not be able to produce T-14 armatas or new jet fighters until 2028 at the earliest.Forget chips both the SU-57 and T-14 are plagued by a myriad of other problems, the SU-57 prototype was ready in 2004, the first flight in 2010, it's 2022 and they've only built 6 flight-ready planes, T-14 had 2000 units planned for 2015-2020, they don't have even now 100 pieces in total, including test units. The chips are the last of their concerns, the problem is that they haven't been able to gather enough funds for the 10 mandatory yachts for each tank/plane batch.QuoteIAP plans to build a fully functional alpha scanner by 2024.

IAP intends to build a beta version of the scanner with higher productivity and resolution by 2026.Let's see how many yachts and mansions they will be able to make by 2024, cause those machines for sure won't be built.China hasn't managed to do it in 5 years with unlimited government funds and Russia will do it in 2, yeah right!",

Just a year ago in Russia there was no such powerful support from the state for the development of its own microelectronics, and now this direction has been given the green light.",

It does not meet our minimum requirements, nor the declared characteristics, in a word - in the trash!Let me ask a simple question - in Russia, the only industrial technology that is able to produce a mass processor is machines using 80 nm technology. And for a long time there have been restrictions on the sale to Russia of something newer than the technology of the year 2000. Tell me - HOW do you think they will create industrial equipment for the 7 nm process technology?I highly recommend watching a YouTube video about what a 10 and 7 nm process is, what equipment for the process technology, what difficulties and features. And you will immediately understand that high technologies and the dense middle ages of Russia do not intersect in this reality What technologies can a backward country have, which for its military-industrial complex now- according to the \"gray scheme\" buys household appliances in order to \"solder\" very primitive chips from there, for use for their own purposes.- steal speed cameras in the EU to install on their drones",

Russia can do mass contraband, plus the fast that Belarus is usually missing from sanctions lists but is almost a part of Russia by now means that buying what they need via Belarus shouldn't be hard.

No weapons.\" But after the destruction of a large number of Iranian UAVs in Ukraine, and a group of Iranian military advisers who trained the soldiers of a technologically backward Russia, Ukraine, the United States and Britain have irrefutable evidence of Iranian sponsorship of the terrorist country, backward Russia. And of course, Iran needs to somehow \"get out\"! Because now, due to the great internal tension in iran itself, there is a high probability that the outside will provide assistance in overthrowing this terrorist regime! And now they will invent anything so that the US, Britain, Israel do not \"pay special attention\" to Iran. They will even tell that Russia has STOLEN these UAVs from them.",

The topicstarter news is about scientists from the group of Konstantin Koshelev, who 20 years ago created a source of extreme ultraviolet radiation on laser pulses in tin plasma, actually for ASML (US patent 6452194). Just a year ago in Russia there was no such powerful support from the state for the development of its own microelectronics, and now this direction has been given the green light.A year ago, before the Russian attack on Ukraine, there were still certain opportunities in Russia to implement projects in the field of microelectronics. But this year the situation has changed a lot and not in favor of Russia. Of course, the military industry is now very interested in microchips, but the tough sanctions imposed to prevent this will do their job. Russia will be set back economically for many decades. Therefore, the next grandiose plans are unlikely to come true.",

To put it simply, Russia speaks before Russia does something, and most of the time it never happens. While they are technologically capable in their own accord, I don't think they have the materials, let alone the technology, to create the tools that even TSMC themself cannot create. This is one big claim for Russia, and I'm almost certain that this will not push through.It's been two years since this thread was created, and we see that the situation in Russia with microelectronics is only rapidly getting worse due to the military invasion of Ukraine. Russia's economy has been almost completely converted to the military needs of the front. Any social projects are being cut or closed completely. Electronic chips for the production of weapons and military equipment in Russia are being removed from washing machines and other household appliances. If they could start producing their own electronics, this would have been done already, since there is a catastrophic shortage of it to support the war in Ukraine.But of course, in Russia they often only brag about their capabilities, but this is very different from reality. Under the conditions of tough, but not universal sanctions, there is only degradation there, since Russia has never been famous for microelectronics, almost everything was imported from other countries, and high-tech developments are not made from scratch. For now, Russia is facing degradation and isolation in the foreseeable future.",

That's not just Russia, a couple of other countries are expanding their microchips projects.OP says the plan was to finish it by 2028, I wouldn't be surprised if with the recent terrorist attack the deadline be pushed to a lot sooner...",
