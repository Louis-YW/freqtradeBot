We cant control whoever who left here or those who spawn again. People come and go. Yes there are accounts who became inactive and some are born to join the forum. No wonder some left uncheck due to market and they also feels like hanging around might not be good for them but thats on them. People who actually like doing things or contributing here will always stay no matter how bored the forum is.",

I see that the forums are a good source to see the latest developments, news, and crypto projects, and to learn and gain experience from discussions and valuable answers from various opinions, expectations, and recommendations from experienced members around the world, also many of us earn a living from participating in bounties, as it is for me and for many a good source of income that I cannot leave no matter what happens.",

However, bounty hunters would leave because most of the projects have recently been terrible or fraudulent. Earning money from the bounty has never been easier recently. If you are a valuable contributor to the forum, there is no reason for you to leave. And this is a non-profitable forum, so it makes no difference who leaves or who joins.

A long and heavy bear market like the one that we are in right now definitely has an impact on the mood of the people that are involved in the crypto space. I personally don't really wanna look at the my portfolio value anymore if i am honest. It was already down like 95% compared to it's ATH even before that whole stuff happened with FTX and now it is even way lower than that. If people are sad and demotivated then of course they also have no intention to talk about cryptos on forums anymore. I noticed that also in the german subforum here. During bullruns there are new people joining the conversations, but during bear market it is very quiet.",

This is probably the time in which  the less new accounts will be created and the more users leave, so in a way I can see why you are worried, but once some time passes and the collapse of FTX and Luna are farther away while the halving and a potential bull run comes closer that is when the forum will begin to increase its level of activity, and then once we are in the middle of a bull run the forum will be so lively that it would be difficult to believe that it was so inactive at this point in time.",

But now I fully adjustment that's why even in this bear market, it doesn't affect me like what happen to me in 2018.And so I guess this is also the experience of some members here, we should go through all of this in 2023, could be worst, but at the end of the day, we learn it the easy or the hardway and so we are going to survived.",
