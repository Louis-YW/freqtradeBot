Here's Satoshi's latest tweet and I quote:\"Bitcoin is a predicate machine. Â Over the following months, we shall explore different aspects that were not explicitly contained within the white paper. Â These aspects are all parts of bitcoin, and are important. Â Some of these ideas were touched upon in the early years; now is the time to extrapolate and explain.\"When I look at the comments of this tweet, there are mixed reactions like he's not the real Satoshi, scheduled post, he just got out of jail, etc. But his account has blue verified check mark at least.I don't know what to say but he does have some plans in store for Bitcoin. What's your take on this guys?",

If Satoshi will come, he will give evidences that he is Satoshi that nobody will be able to question further.

But even if the checkmark still was about authenticity, it would change nothing - no one knows Satoshi's identity, so no one can verify it.To me even just a signed message is not a full proof, because there can be many ways how someone would get their hands on those keys. Someone who claims to be Satoshi would need to present a lot more evidence than that - a full story of how they created Bitcoin with some small details, etc.",

Can't believe he made his first tweet since 2018. I surprised when I read the title but quickly when I visit X, I realized it is very possibly not a real account of Satoshi Nakamoto. Because the account was registered in May 2018, not more years farther in the past like 2010 or 2011. satoshi account on Bitcointalk was last active on December 13, 2010. So a Twitter account registered 8 years later does not make sense and can not convince me that it is actually from Satoshi Nakamoto.That account is possibly owned by someone else, not the founder of Bitcoin, so that tweet is not serious.Before checking, I thought that Satoshi Nakamoto account was hacked but after checking, nothing to discuss on it as it is not a Satoshi's account.",

I agree with what MusaMohamed mentioned, that twitter account was created in 2018 while he was last active on this forum in 2010. Does anyone wonder, if Satoshi really comes back, why is he not active here but chooses twitter, a social network with quite a lot of trash?",
