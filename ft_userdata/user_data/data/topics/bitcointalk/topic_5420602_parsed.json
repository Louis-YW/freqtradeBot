  "content": "When I first entered the cryptocurrency world, I was very worried about how to do the transactions. I went to various Facebook groups for transactions and messaged. The price was fixed even if I got it in a few minutes. I paid according to the seller's choice.Seller blocked from Facebook after payment. I can discuss after a while. I first learned about P2P in the wake of losing my first investment in life. Hope those who renew will not be scammed again. Lessons learned from cheating are revealed to you.What's p2p:First of all, P2P is the process of performing cryptocurrency transactions directly between two people without middlemen and third party intervention. It allows you to determine your best price.Advantages of P2P: Its main advantage is that two people can decide the payment method according to their own convenience. Here the cost is also reduced. Work step by step as per the diagram below:Image bb1.2.3.4.Disadvantages P2P:Behind every advantage there must be some disadvantages also Such as:-Low liquidity:p2p typically has less liquidity than centralized exchanges, so you may not always get the order matching you need.Scams Risks:For P2P there is no third party involved, there is a pleasant risk. There is also a risk of being cheated. By creating using fake profile, can attract with false information. So before transaction should verify complete information of the seller. It is better to see the opinions related to previous transactions.I used Binance Exchanger, almost all exchange rules are same.",

      "body": "I basically enjoy using peer-to-peer (p2p) for most of my transactions, as it tends to be more faster and a little higher in rate than some local exchanges.I really don't see so much risk in p2p because most of this exchanges makes it a safe and enabling environment to transact since it involves just the both parties coming to an agreement with any third party.In most cases if not all, when one wants to make a transaction using p2p, you first have to release your coins, which isn't released directly to the buyer but frozen, this singular act has made p2p very safe as both the buyer and seller wouldn't have to be in possession of the coins but it will rather be frozen until the payment is confirmed by the seller who then approves the release of the coin.I think the seller is always at the advantage in p2p.",

A real P2P trading doesn't need any third party who can freeze someone account or need to submit KYC, this is actually a centralized exchange who run fake P2P trading.I advice if you want to do P2P trading, you can use localcryptos or hodlhodl, you can also use decentralized exchange e.g. Bisq who have good security and protect your privacy.",

This platform acts as an intermediary, and it being centralized or decentralized would influence the level of privacy and autonomy the user has over the funds being transacted.â€¢ About the cost of transactions being reduced in P2P, this would also depend on the mediating platform.",

That's not proper P2P trading, but who cares if both parties get what they want in the end. If I was meeting someone in person, I would except to get the money upfront before the coins are moved from my wallet to that of the other person. You need to check the bills so they are not fake. It's weird doing that in the public, but for your own safety, you should never meet someone in a back alley or take a ride with them in their car, for example. Someone in a different thread suggested going with the person to the bank or an ATM and watching them withdraw the money from their bank account is a good way to ensure you aren't getting fake bills, and I like that.",

I have a friend, I do not know what he did wrong on Paxful, but said to be manipulating bitcoin ad price and his account was banned, no option again to withdraw through lightning network and not able to withdraw because the remaining bitcoin on his account was only almost up to the minimum withdrawal fee which 0.0005 BTC at the time, but not up to that. Bitcoin was above $50000 at the time, which makes it to be almost $25, but unable to withdraw it on Paxful.There are inconveniences you can still experience on centralized platforms.People do not just want to learn in depth, they prefer the easy way that centralized platforms are offering them, because they know less, they think using centralized platform for p2p is better, but not. They also like the zero fee transaction that do attracts them. But people are also making use of decentralized exchanges successfully.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on November 12, 2022, 10:11:25 AMOn Binance p2p service someone I was paired with claimed they'd made the payment but I got nothing for 24hrs and I was forced to use the appeal button, later I got my money but that's because of the exchange intervention. Try and learn how decentralized exchanges work, you were not scammed simply because you did not release the coin from escrow, if you did not receive any money but you released the coin from escrow, that means you have been scammed.You do not have to depend on centralized platform before doing that. Many people even do not know what is multisig, using 2-of-2 or 2-of-3 multisig wallet for p2p, so how are they going to know how decentralized exchanges work.Try and know more about decentralized exchanges, scam can also be completed avoided.",

A third party entity is totally in control and in charge of whatever you do, which makes it more risking, because whatever or any suspicious activities on your account or profile, you're either blocked or banned, which might result to lost of account, so in all honest this isn't P2p, it's just a fake system of operation to enticed you into their exchange, beside your identity and privacy isn't safe, just keep that in mind too.",

      "body": "From my understanding of peer-to-peer systems, there are two types of such systems: those for transferring regular information (digital data) and those for transferring financial information (physical and digital transactions). In systems designed to exchange information between independent and equal rights peers, it is possible to conduct transfers without the involvement of any third-party servers, decision-makers, or gatekeepers. It is akin to mere communication between individuals who speak the same language (use the same protocol). On the other hand, when it comes to transactions that involve money transfers, things start to get more complicated. Unlike regular P2P systems in which transfers of information may or may not involve losses, financial transactions always involve losses (one of transacting parties gives away money risking not getting in return a desirable good or service). In other words, such transactions always involve trust that can potentially be breached by one of the counterparties. But people tend to trust only those they know well or those who have earned a good reputation. That is why, in most cases, they will use the services of third parties even if it is possible to send money directly. Pure P2P financial transfers are possible only in local communities where everyone knows each other, in other cases there will be a combination of centralized parties and decentralized systems.",
