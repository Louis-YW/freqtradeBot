Is it the sign that more people are no longer trusting the bank and are moving toward to decentralized world?Trusting a bank and trusting Fiat money are 2 very different things. And this isn't leading to more decentralized world. It leads to more regulations, falling banks is what happens when populists like Donald Trump rolli back the wall street reform and consumer protection act. Just out of spite because he wanted to cancel everything Obama did.And why not just decentralized world? Because that's far from ready. Decentralized world doesn't have build in IDs, confidential transactions or ZK smart contracts that are ready to get adopted. The whole platform is still being developed. And buying a coin/native token because you think that's going to be a next platform is a gamble. Most of the top marketcap coins have dropped out from the list.",

If they halt it in the middle, a last few months will not lead to final result they want.It is time for Bitcoin to shine but it's not a time for cryptocurrency to shine in general. Cryptocurrency means Bitcoin plus altcoins. Altcoins are scam and they are not different than fiat currencies or banks. I don't believe in altcoins after a few years in the market. Very few altcoins I can put my belief in them and for most of altcoins, I only consider them as chances for me to enjoy their short bull runs or bounces and exit.After many years in cryptocurrency, I no longer mind to hold altcoins and consider them as good for my portfolio.",

Inflation is out of control, the money printer was relentless during COVID. They literally shut down the worlds economy for 2 years. They must have known something like this would happen? Maybe it’s what tgey wanted, The Great Reset & introduction of CBDC’s. You will own nothing & you will be happy etc.Bitcoin & other cryptos may dump with legacy markets when the shit hits the fan soon but long term bitcoin especially, with it’s deflationary supply by design will have meteoric rises in price. People will flood out of fiat & into bitcoin. It might look messy at first but bitcoin will moon as the world sinks into a great depression.",

Such a huge bank collapsed definitely will gain concern and people will rethink again is the system still perfect to keep our money in it? I'm here to seek for more deeper discussion, but ya, thanks for your comment anyway.",

You are right The collapse of banks like Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank, along with the rise of Bitcoin, may suggest that some individuals are losing trust in traditional banking systems and exploring decentralized financial technologies. The motivations for using Bitcoin can vary, including greater control over financial transactions, investment opportunities, or simply hype. However, it's premature to predict whether decentralized technologies will fully replace traditional banking. Banks remain crucial for economic activity and financial services such as loans and investments.",

I know that cryptocurrencies as a whole were created as an alternative to the traditional financial institutes and as a replacement for banks, but still in the past when there was a stock market crash the crypto market crashed too. Now i feel like it is the first time, that the crypto market is going into the opposite direction than the stock market. I just hope that this is not just a temporary thing and that the prices will stay that way at least for a while.We will see.",
