  "content": "So I just saw this on platform X and it really got my attention because when I reasoned it, it's actually quite crazy but real too and many Bitcoin HODLers today don't really know the power and benefits behind this particular thought of action.Here is the link from 0.20$ to $70kHODLing of Bitcoin is probably the most talk and deliberated matter on the crypto space and even here in the community. And it's funny how many people have turned a blind eye to this and some persons are feeling that Bitcoin price today is too big to buy well the thing is that everytime is a good time to buy, that's if you are a long term holder and I for one, am shocked at seeing how Bitcoin has been held for almost 14 years now although I know they are still some folks still HODLing and even planning to keep for longer terms maybe when Bitcoin reaches $200k to $500k before they actually sell off. I think there's probably a reason why they say patience is virtue and it's something most humans don't have and in the case of Bitcoin journey, it's something that everyone needs to actually achieve that financial boost goal in the HODLing of our Bitcoin.So I bring this for some folks to actually share atleast boost our spirits in the HODL journey especially those newbie to the space, that if someone out there is still HODLing why not HODL?.Note:: remember to keep your coins safe too that's base on the preference of a non-custodial wallet or cold wallet if you are HODLing for long term",

It really takes a lot of courage to hold onto Bitcoin for a long time, and for those who've been around since the beginning, they're the true Bitcoin believers. Many people feel tempted to sell their Bitcoins when the price suddenly drops. That's why it's important for longterm holders to check the market less often. This helps prevent fear and the panic that often leads investors to sell in the short term.Quote from: DaNNy001 on March 27, 2024, 01:02:30 AMNote:: remember to keep your coins safe too that's base on the preference of a non-custodial wallet or cold wallet if you are HODLing for long termCertainly, holding onto your coins for a long time without fully securing them could result in losing them. As a Bitcoin user, ensuring the security of your funds should be your top priority since you have control over them, not a third party. Utilizing cold storage methods such as hardware wallets or airgapped devices is the most effective way to achieve this and safeguard your funds.",

Definitely a testament to the power of hodling, not just with bitcoin but also the hodling itself since you can probably do it with other crypto out there.",

And it's easy, too. The easiest way to make profit out of Bitcoin is hodling. But hodling only happens once you're thoroughly convinced of Bitcoin. I guess it follows a certain level of understanding, and consequently belief. Hodling might be too stressful to somebody who is in doubt with Bitcoin. He/she might not survive. It's easy to hodl in the sense that you don't do a thing, not an analysis, not a buy and sell order and stop loss, and so on, but it isn't easy in the sense that you need to keep hodling amidst bears and winters and corrections.",

Holding is key to get richer with Bitcoin as through 3 market cycles, the current one is the fourth, it has proven its strong survival through many bear markets and many bearish years, black swan events. In cryptocurrency market, you can not find any cryptocurrency that is stronger than Bitcoin in survival strength.Regarding to case like this one, it's hard to say the owner actually planed to hold bitcoins or just forgot that wallet for a long time. Finally the owner succeeded to access that wallet again after many years. We only saw tip of iceberg and can not interpret it accurately as it actually is, just our guess.About power of HODL, you can check some information in my thread.HODL bitcoins, you can do it!

And most people assume that the coins from 2010 are lost but this is proof it’s not true.I think coins from 2009 won’t get moved and are considered lost due to the fact that satoshi most likely will never move them or they lost the private key.

Anyone not motivated by this does not really believe in Bitcoin and that is rather unfortunate. Bitcoin seems to be getting set to cross to six figures, so those thinking that the price is too high now might be making a mistake.

Saving your coins under the custody of another person is very risky, so much that it can result to total loss of assets. Now that you mentioned the wallet, it is one of the biggest challenge to HODLing Bitcoin. I have also seen a post in X about some early people to Bitcoin who saved their coins in hardware wallets but having problems remembering their password. So care must be taken about the storage media and how to protect the secret keys.",

Bitcoin is not the same as other altcoins on the market, you buy and you hold there's nothing profitable in trading Bitcoin.Always make sure to hold with your last money.

My reasons for saying this you won't be able to hold your Bitcoin for long when you don't have money or don't have a job.QuoteThere is no way a hungry person who is poor can hold unto Bitcoin since that time till now, holding is for those who are well-fed, have a good source of income, and believe in the future of Bitcoin, another worry is how to securely keep your Bitcoin for this long, many people who mined Bitcoin in 2010 end up losing the recovery seed. It's always good that before you involve in anything business or investment you have to check your financial status, if you can invest you carry on the investment but if you can't you don't. There are things you should know before you do things you planned for.I don't think one with only 1 source of income with low salary can invest in Bitcoin and still hold for long term, even if you have just 1 job let it be that the salary is very big in a way that you can invest, spend and still keep some for emergency issues, these are the most important things one should do before they starts investment.QuoteMy respect to this fellow, for believing so much in Bitcoin, as if he and Nakamoto are pals, in every patience that we human have there is always something giving us the confidence, it's a shame that there is no way to ask him this question, holding is the way, you can never lose by holding Bitcoin.Apparently.

Regular Joes would have been blown away when they got up to a million bucks in Bitcoin and would have been rushing to an exchange to trade that. If they were smart, they would have sold just a percentage and left some, or would have regularly sold and bought back making a profit.

The question is how many of them would have been brave enough to keep hodling even in the face of FUD and diverse attacks. Not everyone would be patient enough to keep hodling even when the price has appreciated to a large extent. Many of us would have sold our coins a long time ago because of diverse reasons. So when I hear stories of people who have held their coins for a long time regardless of diverse challenges I have nothing but respect and adoration for them. Now we are in the midst of the bull run and many people are making plans on how to sell their coins and make some money and some don't have any plans of refiling wallets.  It is not bad to take your profit but it should be known that many hodlers have no plan to sell because they have a long-term plan.
