  "content": "QuoteRoyse777 is trying to rebuild his reputation, and as a result I think there is a part of my previous feedback that is not valid, \"I do not trust Royse777 for deals or $0.01\" but I still don't trust him for significant amounts, because of what was explained in the referenced thread. @Poker Player, are you sure about of saying rebuilding reputation?Of course when holding $7,400 $8,950  (do your math) for three four campaigns (and in the near future I am expecting more) your feedback suggesting to others not to me trust with a $0.01, sounds fun to read. It was entertaining sad that it's gone now.I have been managing campaign from over one and half years. Before Bitlucy saga I managed 21 campaigns. What was you expecting, after an accident I do not continue to what I was at best? You were wrong.Your new try is nice though, \"Royse777 is trying to rebuild his reputation\" but again sounds funny and misleading too.Try something better which will sound reasonable. You are still young in the forum so let me help you, try something like, QuoteRoyse777 is trying to rebuild his business, but I still don't trust him for significant amounts (add an amount. how much? $100k, $200k, A million? add whichever you like), because of what was explained in the referenced thread. @everyone-else, I could PM him but you know what after all I miss this board.",

But I really don't understand why you need another red tag.It's now proven that clients really do not care about what reputation were given from some of the to excited forum members or I would not had any chance to rebuild my business. But honestly speaking it just made my job harder to perform, it's okay though. I am happy that it did not destroy my mental strength.I still have a lot to do. Actually we (the CC team) to deliver what we promised. Some people need to know when you try to neglect others, when you push them so hard that their back set on the wall - they accept the challenge, finds inspiration from all bad things that is happening with them and give their best to push to revert back. It's not a self-scratching but it's something that I believe in myself.",

I was one of the bitlucy campaign's member and I get what i deserved. After a while I stopped the checking events on bitlucy's problems but Royse777 gave his best to finished with less problem. I appreciates him unless he made some enormous problem. As i can see, he got his lesson from his previous mistake and he won't cause another problem as like as bitlucy. Everyone can make mistakes. The important thing is to admit their mistakes and make up for them. This situation reminded me of a story about a tribe. Whenever someone from this tribe did something wrong or committed a crime, members of the tribe would take him/her in the middle and form a circle around him. Then they starts to remind him of the good things he had done until that day. Royse777, you have successfully completed 21 campaigns before the bitlucy campaign. You made a mistake with Bitlucy, but after that incident, manage a more successful campaigns than before so that you take responsibility for the mistake  I believe in you. You can do it!",

Well, one of the reasons might be that he has a reputation to protect ( for the fact that he renders public services) and any client on his Dm would rather get his feedback scrutinized properly (that's to see if it's about fraudulence, like what they claimed in Royce's case) just so he's satisfied with your personality before starting any contract deal, most especially when it has to do with funds, which is probably the same reason he's distrusted. He really needs to build 'em back as I knew him without tags when I was registered....and the little I knew about his services, gave me some confidence (just like Hhampuz now). P/s : I'm not here to support Royce if he's fucked up but, he needs to be given a chance to clean up.Sandra 💇",

Negative feedback mainly prevents you from joining a signature campaign, and with the decentralized system and the people in DT, campaign managers can let you participate in the campaign if they don't agree with the feedback, as we have seen several times. It can also prevent you from doing deals on the forum, but he has a lot of people with whom he can do deals no matter the feedback.It doesn't affect him, he can go on with his business, running campaigns. Even the 1xCrap people do business in the forum. Today when Hhampuz put the campaign I was participating on hold, I even thought of applying to one of Royse777's campaigns like trolling, lol. I do not trust him because of everything that has happened and I will not repeat it or enter into endless discussions. Now he handles a lot of money in campaigns, well, Madoff also handled a lot of money and there were a lot of people who trusted him. I am ashamed to have been complicit in the secrecy of who was behind Casino Critique, as potential investors had a right to know, and based on that, make a reasoned decision.",
