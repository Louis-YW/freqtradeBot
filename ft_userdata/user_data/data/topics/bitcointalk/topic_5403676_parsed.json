  "content": "Although Vladimir Putin, has attempted to defend his invasion of Ukraine on several occasions by claiming that he was merely responding to the danger of NATO moving east. The Russian invasion of Ukraine clearly looks to have bolstered NATO: After remaining neutral for decades, Finland and Sweden decided to ask for membership in NATO.Yoon Suk-yeol, the new president of South Korea, will be the first representative from that nation to attend the summit along with delegations from Sweden and Finland, both of which have also submitted applications to join NATO.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has also announced that he intends to attend a NATO summit for the first time ever.NATO has also invited Australia and New Zealand to the summit as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, https://www.reuters.com/world/japans-kishida-may-join-nato-summit-discuss-ukraine-crisis-kyodo-2022-06-04/This is clearly the exact opposite of what Vladimir Putin wants. With all these consolidation of power by Nato, what chance does Russia has to still win this war if Nato decides to freely throw its full weight behind Ukraine?",

Looks like folks want to turn their ground into mud. The people that live there should move out while they have a chance. Don't stop to save any of their furnishings. It's all lost.",

      "body": "Putin really shot himself in the foot with this one. From wanting NATO as far from his borders as possible, to having it reinforce, reinvigurated closer than ever. We can't really know what his intention were, but from our perspective, this was a flop on Russias side. There will be no winners or loosers in this war (as it was before) but Russia seems to be loosing more.",

      "body": "Putin was most clever in this move he made. He knew NATO would send in armaments from many NATO nations. That's what he wanted. Now, because the world is scared that he might use his nukes, they'll let him take the NATO weapons away from NATO, to be used by him to take over the world. How sly and tricky of him.",
