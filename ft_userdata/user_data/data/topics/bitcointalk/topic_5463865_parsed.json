  "content": "1. Technology: Technology plays a crucial role in determining the advancement and superiority of a project. New blockchain projects or improvements to existing blockchain platforms are often considered potential opportunities. For example, Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) have gained attention for their advanced blockchain technology. However, it is important to note that technology does not guarantee absolute success, and detailed research on the project's technology is crucial.ðŸ‘‰ 2. Tokenomics: Tokenomics refers to the economic factors related to the project's cryptocurrency or token. Considering the total supply, token unlocking schedule, token utility, token allocation, and decentralization in token ownership are significant. A project with sound and attractive tokenomics can create stability and potential price appreciation for the cryptocurrency.ðŸ‘‰ 3. Market capitalization: Market capitalization is an important factor in evaluating the size and value of a cryptocurrency. Coins with large market capitalization often have more reputation and higher liquidity but may have lower growth potential. Conversely, smaller market capitalization coins may have higher price appreciation opportunities but come with higher risks. Considering market capitalization helps assess whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued.ðŸ‘‰ 4. Utility and Application: Evaluating the utility of a cryptocurrency project is crucial. This includes considering the industry focus of the project and the target user base. If the project's utility is low, it may lose value due to a lack of user interest. Some practical applications of blockchain projects include decentralized finance solutions, NFTs, online gaming, and the metaverse.ðŸ‘‰ 5. #DevelopmentTeam : The #DevelopmentTeamÂ  plays a vital role in ensuring the success and growth of a project. This includes the experience, expertise, and vision of the team members. If a project has a reliable #DevelopmentTeamÂ  with long-term commitment, it can increase the likelihood of success in the future.ðŸ‘‰ 6. Collaboration and Partnerships: Collaborating with other companies, organizations, or projects can bring significant benefits to a cryptocurrency project. Collaboration can involve technology development, expanding the user network, or building new applications. Additionally, having reputable and positive interactions with partners can increase the project's chances of success and expand its reach.ðŸ‘‰ 7. Industry Competition and Position: Evaluating a project's position within the industry can help assess its competitive ability and growth potential. Considering competitive rivals, differentiation, and competitive advantages of the project can provide crucial insights into its ability to penetrate the market and attract users.ðŸ‘‰ 8. Socialization and User Community: A large, positive, and supportive community can drive the development and widespread acceptance of a cryptocurrency project. Socialization involves community participation, social media activities, events, and other interactive engagements. If a project has a strong and positive community, it can create momentum for the value appreciation of the cryptocurrency and enhance its development prospects.Â - I hope my post can help you make the right choice in the market For more https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328932235_Investing_With_Cryptocurrencies_-_Evaluating_the_Potential_of_Portfolio_Allocation_Strategies",

An interesting technology is mostly important for the launch phase, when it can help to create momentum. But most interesting tech developments can be used by other cryptocurrencies as well. However, I think this item is important for special-purpose blockchains, like privacy coins (Monero, Grin ...).Small comment:Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PMCardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) have gained attention for their advanced blockchain technology.Probably because people don't know they're based on the PBFT model from 1999. Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM2. Tokenomics1/5. If the cryptocurrency is meant to work mainly as a token platform, at least it should provide the necessary features to enable \"sound\" tokenomics. But why should it not?Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM3. Market capitalization:4/5. Agree mostly, but this is a quite trivial item.Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM4. Utility and Application5/5, at least if you mean the real-world adoption of applications. This is indeed crucial, and for example the factor separating BTC from LTC (because BTC is used/accepted in much more contexts) or ETH from chains like AVAX (because ETH continues to be the \"main\" token/NFT/DeFi platform). If instead you refer to \"features\" of the blockchain platform, then it overlaps with item 1.Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM5. DevelopmentTeam4/5. What's important is that there are developers interested in maintaining and updating the coin.Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM6. Collaboration and Partnerships3/5. Bitcoin benefitted for example when it was accepted by Wikipedia and Wikileaks. But the importance to have a long list of \"partner\" companies is rather limited. Quality beats quantity here.Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM7. Industry Competition and Position3/5. First mover advantage and dominance can be important, as in the case of Bitcoin. But a good position at a specific time may not mean it's a good long-term investment. Take examples like NXT, Dash, or NEM. And not all cryptocurrencies see themselves as part of an \"industry\". Those that are part of an \"industry\" can barely be called cryptocurrencies Quote from: Black susano on August 19, 2023, 10:42:42 PM8. Socialization and User Community4/5. Of course community is important. But you're describing here more something like an army of shills.Most of the items are clearly written from the point of view of a supporter of centralized cryptocurrencies. Apart from that I agree with most of them.",

When they're making a new project, what they always tell to their proposals is that it will solve scalable issues and problems. And on top of that, they're making it look like the old ones are outdated which somehow true for some but even with that, we can still see that they're on best shape and usable. That's why if we're looking at Bitcoin, many of those new projects have told that they're solving block issues that Bitcoin can't and at the same time, they keep on always throwing the same description like it's got an outdated blockchain/tech. But look where it is, still the top of them all.",

Most of them do not follow the roadmap but they do gain a lot of hype because a lot is being promised when a project is launched but the project fails as most of these are made to gather funds and investments.With that being the harsh reality, I think one should be very careful in investing in any altcoin for the long term and allocate only a small portion of their portion to it. The major portfolio should be in bitcoin and your focus should be in bitcoin and/or at most the large cap coins.",

Sure, altcoins are not as trusted as Bitcoin, most of them are not trusted at all, but there are some altcoins that can be used for investment purposes as they have been around for quite some time and they have been performing pretty well over the course, so maybe we can say that there are some exceptions.After Bitcoin, Ethereum is the most trusted cryptocurrency and it has been going side by side with Bitcoin, never leaving position number 2, also, there are about 10 to 15 cryptocurrencies that are generally not bad, though you are right that we can't completely trust them as anything can happen.",

You see, each individual possesses a varying degree of investment motivation. The stronger one's impetus to engage in investment, the more they'll seek additional reasons to partake in ventures for the sake of profit.However, for those who have not contemplated investment and exhibit no interest in it whatsoever, they will muster a plethora of rationales to decline such undertakings. This implies that fostering the desire to invest must take precedence, enabling them to subsequently assimilate the considerations for adopting appropriate investment instruments.Novel investment approach methodologies wield a considerable influence over others, piquing their interest in investment and catalyzing an intrinsic motivation for financial involvement. Subsequently, the criteria delineated by the original poster (OP) metamorphose into a body of knowledge for their benefit.",

Altcoin investments are not what someone should put hope in or believe in the words they say or promise. Their motto is to promise and fail and give unnecessary hope without fulfilling it. Investing in altcoin is totally on luck. It is risky to invest in altcoins based on the words and promises they have made to their community. The altcoin owners might have good utility and plans for their project but the fulfillment of their project goals that's where the problems lie. Because they only care about your investment money, not about delivering the project. The best thing to do is invest more in Bitcoin, if the need to invest in altcoin arises, you can try your luck on top altcoins you find yourself convinced about.",

Because after all, a trusted team that is an expert in their field is very important. And what's more important is the partnership. Because projects that are of good quality and have good potential will usually also have quite a lot of partnerships. especially if it's a partnership with a very influential party in the crypto world.after that only later did i start looking into tokenomics and such. Even the vestiny system and such are also important to note. Because every vesting there will definitely be a change in price and usually it is a decrease.Be sure to reverse search them and it would be better to contact them in the contact address that they provide, only for you to verify if they are real people or not. A team can be trusted but it does not mean that they can now perform well forever. Also a project which had some partnerships, does not mean that they are really great, but some only had a money and they use it to pay those brands to partner with them.We can still benefit on their temporary hype if we are early to invest on them. As for the tokenomics and such, there is also no guarantee that what is written are accurate and will be followed by the team, so always take time to check them properly and monitor them or your assets from time to time.",

New blockchain projects or improvements to existing blockchain platforms are often considered potential opportunities. For example, Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) have gained attention for their advanced blockchain technology. However, it is important to note that technology does not guarantee absolute success, and detailed research on the project's technology is crucial.ðŸ‘‰ 2. Tokenomics: Tokenomics refers to the economic factors related to the project's cryptocurrency or token. Considering the total supply, token unlocking schedule, token utility, token allocation, and decentralization in token ownership are significant. A project with sound and attractive tokenomics can create stability and potential price appreciation for the cryptocurrency.ðŸ‘‰ 3. Market capitalization: Market capitalization is an important factor in evaluating the size and value of a cryptocurrency. Coins with large market capitalization often have more reputation and higher liquidity but may have lower growth potential. Conversely, smaller market capitalization coins may have higher price appreciation opportunities but come with higher risks. Considering market capitalization helps assess whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued.ðŸ‘‰ 4. Utility and Application: Evaluating the utility of a cryptocurrency project is crucial. This includes considering the industry focus of the project and the target user base. If the project's utility is low, it may lose value due to a lack of user interest. Some practical applications of blockchain projects include decentralized finance solutions, NFTs, online gaming, and the metaverse.ðŸ‘‰ 5. #DevelopmentTeam : The #DevelopmentTeamÂ  plays a vital role in ensuring the success and growth of a project. This includes the experience, expertise, and vision of the team members. If a project has a reliable #DevelopmentTeamÂ  with long-term commitment, it can increase the likelihood of success in the future.ðŸ‘‰ 6. Collaboration and Partnerships: Collaborating with other companies, organizations, or projects can bring significant benefits to a cryptocurrency project. Collaboration can involve technology development, expanding the user network, or building new applications. Additionally, having reputable and positive interactions with partners can increase the project's chances of success and expand its reach.ðŸ‘‰ 7. Industry Competition and Position: Evaluating a project's position within the industry can help assess its competitive ability and growth potential. Considering competitive rivals, differentiation, and competitive advantages of the project can provide crucial insights into its ability to penetrate the market and attract users.ðŸ‘‰ 8. Socialization and User Community: A large, positive, and supportive community can drive the development and widespread acceptance of a cryptocurrency project. Socialization involves community participation, social media activities, events, and other interactive engagements. If a project has a strong and positive community, it can create momentum for the value appreciation of the cryptocurrency and enhance its development prospects.Â - I hope my post can help you make the right choice in the market For more https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328932235_Investing_With_Cryptocurrencies_-_Evaluating_the_Potential_of_Portfolio_Allocation_StrategiesI assume that any new cryptoproject is a lottery, since most projects are given funds without any official declarations, so for any cryptocurrency there is a chance to become a good investment.
