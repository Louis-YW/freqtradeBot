      "body": "I think it would be impossible to withdraw a few satoshis (or even a few hundred) primarily because of the dust limit. Another problem is that such transactions would be unprofitable due to high fees.This is just my assumption because I have no experience with Nerd Miners or low hash rate mining pools.",

If so, any pool youd recommend?dude it does 78khthat is terrible.also I am not sure you can join it to any other pool.1000 kh = 1 mh1000 mh = 1gh1000 gh = 1th1 th earns about 0.00000210 btc a dayyou are earning 78/1,000,000 x 0.00000210 btc a dayif you can point it to a pool.If it has real software. you earn 0.00000000001638 a day on average.which means nothing since you need to do 0.00000001 as a minimum earn.so:in 10 days        0.000000001638in 100 days      0.000000016380   which is 1 sat to maybe 2 sats every 100 days.in 1000 days     0.000000163800   which is 16 sats maybe 17 sats every 1000 days.in 10000 days   0.000001638000   which is 163 sats maybe 164 sats every 10,000 days.in 100,000 days 0.000016380000  which is 1638 sats every 100,000 days.none of the numbers above reflect future difficulty or future 1/2 ings",

      "body": "I had never heard of this until now. As I read the description of the device, it's CLEARLY intended to be a very low power \"Lottery Miner\". Even if you find some way to connect it to a pool, it's unlikely to ever produce any income that you can realize. In my opinion, this just has to be a \"fun adventure\" on your part, and not related to any monetary or BTC acquisition. Trying to push it outside it's design goal (aka Lottery Miner) I expect will be frustrating and likely fruitless.",
