Think of this: Someone hacks lido and gets the coins. Simple, common, likely scenario. With 31% of the staked coins, they can first and foremost keep them staked to earn the sweet bucks, and secondly, they can attack with zero cost. But, no problem. Ethereum isn't censorship resistant. The devs will just fork the chain.",

Storing crypto on an exchange has never been safe and still isn't.Worse, Ethereum is an autocracy and has always been one. The rules can be changed at a whim. Once all the coins are locked up the rulescan be changed again with no way to bail out for those who disagree.",

Even if they never want to attack the network, someone could \"easily\" hack them and do it.I agree, and I wonder how they did not see this coming, especially after seeing what has always happened to all other POS coins. It's just a way of giving powers to whales and centralized custodial services, so long as they can manage to stake lots of ETH.I hope the catastrophe that struck LUNA won't revisit ETH.",
