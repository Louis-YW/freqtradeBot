  "content": "Hello everyone I joined this forum over a year now and I was very excited to join. I warmly by the forum members and I felt very welcomed. I had great ambition oh well I think my ambitions were overly much. I had some thoughts about cryptocurrency and I thought they were enough for me to achieve all I had come here for.I didn't spend much time and jumped into the crypto market and I guess it swallowed me. I ventured into investing, trading, schemes and everything that I thought would give me profits. How wrong I was, I made bad investments that were from my imagination that anything I touched in crypto would favour me all I had to do is buy a low and affordable coin and hold.Long story short I have some coins in my possession that are dead and from reality now those coins won't rise again.   My thoughts and now my experience that newbies like I was can learn.1. Emotions thoughts and feelings can hurt you if they were not researched.2. You haven't learnt enough just yet. It's not wise to invest with your kindergarten knowledge, take time to on them first.3. The news can be a disguised trap, I made many investments because I followed the news and what many people were doing, this is a foolish move.4. Diversification that has no research behind it is foolish. I had thought that once you diversify you can do wrong, how wrong I was. You always have to diversify making use of research and don't be in a hurry to buy.I have experienced the bitter side of Cryptocurrency and now I don't need someone to tell me that crypto can bite. Moving forward I would pay more attention to learning and asking questions too, all I can say to the newbies is that grow your brain before you try to grow your portfolio.",

      "body": "\"Experience is the best teacher\"- though I've been a member of the altcoinstalks community and throughout my stay there they've been some threads about how some users made mistakes by rushing to invest without carrying out proper research about the project which lead to them losing their funds. Judging by one of your  earlier thread you made concerning your friend's mistake. I saw many users giving you advice that would have helped you from making any irrational decision but you still chose to ignore them. Just as they say \"First you Learn, then you remove the 'L' and you Earn.\"-I hope this will also serve as an example to other newbies out there, that there is not shortcut to success you have to put in the effort and don't just rely on what others think.

I had thought that once you diversify you can do wrong, how wrong I was. You always have to diversify making use of research and don't be in a hurry to buy.Buying altcoins and calling that \"diversification\" is even more foolish because altcoins do not move independently to be considered a good option for diversification. Whenever bitcoin rises or falls, they get dumped because capital flows back to bitcoin.If you really want to diversify you have to buy something that is not related to bitcoin, like buying gold for example.",

They will only realize it while the bear market had been around for almost a year and thier down to -80% for holding it.  Heck, I have lost too. But not that I know the cycle will keep cycling whether you have money to invest or not, the 4-year cycle will keep cycling.",

But sometimes in doing research we often use emotions and feelings for example when we are going to invest in a new coin we will not know that the coin will be in good development until a certain period of time and when choosing it only feel that the coin will be good even though reading the whitepaper too or the roadmap won't really know it.Quote from: Cynthia_sinach042 on September 28, 2022, 03:28:52 PM4. Diversification that has no research behind it is foolish.In crypto even if you do research first by diversifying it is still a stupid act, you will be safer by holding only one coin, namely bitcoin than dividing it into altcoins",

      "body": "If you want to mature in the market, most people go through the stages that you go through, no newbie realizes that knowledge is the key to entering the market until they lose. Your advice is really helpful but in my opinion, the best way for newbies to grow up is to let them experience the same things that the market offers them. There is no better lesson or knowledge than your own experience in the market.All 3 are good advice but the 4th I slightly disagree, just like in this bear market, diversification doesn't work when the altcoin market depends on the movement of bitcoin. When Bitcoin drops in price, the whole market is in the red so diversifying into altcoins is not necessary when you invest in bitcoin.",

This is the most common mistake of people who are starting to trade. They thought that they will become millionaires in just 1 day or 1 week of trading or they though that when they start trading, they don't lose money. Also because of what they common to see on the internet or social media which advertise by some influencers or content creators.I can relate to this when I was newbie before.",

Many beginners have made many mistakes but not many are willing to try to rise from their mistakes and try their best and you are one of them.I want to provide input for diversification because this can confuse some people. After all, so much news out there that invites them to invest in altcoins makes them not do research before investing. You may be able to take advice from others but always do your research before you buy. That way, you will know which coins to buy and make as your investment and avoid buying the wrong coins.But if you are confused about choosing an altcoin, you don't need to go ahead and just stick to bitcoin because that is enough and you can even try to profit from bitcoin in bear and bull season time.

We are here to learn more and more in order to get any information, from the past to the most updated one. Being ambitious for learning in this forum makes sense, but we must also balance it with our action, what we can do and what we are doing exactly to utilize every chance and information here, to be contributive in this forum.
