United States has gained a lot of attention lately most especially with the present government promises and body language towards Bitcoin adoptions in the US, so it is best their create a more friendly and robust environment to accommodate crypto-related activities and respect for the privacy and freedom of the crypto community.",

It can help banks accept crypto payments. It can help the ecosystem around bitcoin, even if not bitcoin itself.And if the ecosystem grows, it can also bring innovation. Maybe better 2nd layer. Maybe better funded development.If done properly, it can be good. If....",

Some altcoins still promote themselves as decentralized but not as decentralized as bitcoin so they might still be affected by whatever restrictions or regulations SEC wants to impose.Whatever it is, hopefully it is for the better of the community",

While altcoins/tokens will probably be quite effected, this will also effect applications that use or support Bitcoin. It will govern what kind of apps can and can't be built, and what kind of activity is or isn't allowed. This doesn't just apply to alts but also to Bitcoin too. I do agree though that using Bitcoin itself and majority of what is in it's ecosystem as of present day, probably won't be effected too much by this (unless it is overall not positive and it turns out to be an attack on Bitcoin, which I doubt would be the case at this point).",

Do you think there would be billions of dollars flowing into the market if the SEC didn't approve bitcoin ETFs? And do you think any store or company will accept bitcoin as a payment method without government permission?Yes, bitcoin is decentralized but that doesn't mean it is completely free from government control and influence. If they don't want to be friendly with it anymore and impose harsh regulations, don't expect billions of dollars to flow into bitcoin and become popular. Don't underestimate, belittle or fight the government when they are trying to be friendly to us.",

But that, of course, is too vague to be sure that the idea is to build up crypto-friendly regulations and a welcoming pro-crypto financial climate in the US.

If they can seriously do this regulations, scammers at least who live in the USA. will be more fearful of creating scam projects.It's how they can prevent scams at the beginnings that is more effectively than letting scammers make project launches, raise funds, scam money of many people.
