I don't understand this question \"Do you wish the site can refund your money??\"why do you say that a \"site\" should make a refund?these dishonest gambling activities exist in any country (with variations) and it is a scam no more.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_gamethe game is rigged. even if you win they just run away with the money or worse they might beat you up.it really doesn't make sense to participate in such an activity, it's a bit like turning to a ponzi scheme hoping to become rich.",

      "body": "Losing a bet and feeling bad about it is normal; no one is always happy to lose money, either in gambling or in anything else. But we always rejoice when we win a bet from an online casino or even in a betting shop, forgetting that most of the money we win is also part of other losses.This is the main reason why people should always have a stop limit, know when to stop when they are gambling, have a target when they exhaust the money they planned to use, and learn to call it a day. Continuously betting without checking their balance at hand always results in things like this. This is the point where we call someone a gambling addict.",

It's better to stop and learn from the defeat, then go back to betting for the luck, which may come with a win.",

Imagine a real life scenario that these thugs offer gambling game on the side walk while a brave girl gamble and lose it all? Having a courage to gamble sidewalk when you are a girl is already unusual. I’m not trying to impose gender equality here but this scenario is very uncommon for a girl.On gambling like this which is illegal. The girl has the right to request a refund since the game is rigged and I’m sure that the authority will backed her up if she just report it assuming this scenario is real.It’s normal for gamblers to believe on too good to be true profit because that’s what makes gambling exciting since you will have an ultimate goal when you are gambling. Chasing it recklessly without considering your bankroll is what wrong to do.",

That's why he/she said that no one should be forced to play or gamble, it should always be a choice, and in fact an informed one, because all the people who gambles should know, if they don't, that the odds are against them from the start, and that winning against the house is difficult, and the more you play, the more difficult.Well, not so different: that reminded me about the >x5 requirement in some online casinos in order to be able to withdraw. The gamblers who deposit there without reading the T&Cs won't feel much different when they notice that they have to keep gambling against their will to be able to get their money back.",
