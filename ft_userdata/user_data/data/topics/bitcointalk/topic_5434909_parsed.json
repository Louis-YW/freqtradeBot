      "body": "I think, actually quite a few bots out there that offer similar functionality to Cornix, allowing you to read signals, open trades with specific settings, and trail stops. Some popular options include Zignaly, 3Commas, and Cryptohopper.And, each bot has its own unique features and pricing structure, so it's important to do your research and figure out which one best fits your needs. But overall, I think it's definitely possible to find a bot that allows you to run Telegram signals on your own pc or server.",
