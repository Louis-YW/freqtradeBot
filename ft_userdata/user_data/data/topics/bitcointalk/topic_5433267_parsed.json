The only problem is that most folks have power that costs too much to do it profitably. Power costs have always been the limiting factor so nothing new there but until BTC prices go up it certainly has become more of an issue for most folks.",

The bad news is, nobody knows just how much lower it will go, or if it will ever be at all. I've seen some news talking about miners selling all of their BTC just to keep mining, but it's hard to know how much is the truth on that report since we don't see any change in difficulty yet.Quote from: impresiones on January 14, 2023, 05:46:59 AMWhich graphic card would give good results with gpu mining ?There are many tools that you can use to check them out. I suggest visiting the altcoin board for more details. For example, whattomine is a website that you can use to see which coin is mineable and how much profit you can earn daily if you use GPU A or B. While the cost is arguably lower, if you want to make a profit quickly, maybe you should look for other alternatives. CMIIW.",

To get maximum results and benefits, you need to pay attention in terms of electricity costs, if costs are still very low in your area, then this will still be a good time to mine, once again we say that this is not too late to mine Bitcoin .",

Miners will usually be profitable when the price of Bitcoin increases. For Bitcoin mining a miner needs to know some things well. A miner in particular will need a mining hardware for mining which we commonly know as ASICs. Nowadays various types of ASICs can be found. These devices are very necessary and expensive for mining. However, the cost will be slightly lower for those who use the entry-level components. Before Mining you need to keep some things in mind. Electricity is an important issue for mining bitcoin. In that case you need to think carefully whether you can create the mining environment or not.

That's more efficient and saves you the hassle of hardware.And you could also use third-party service such as NiceHash where you automatically get Bitcoin and don't have to setup mining software manually.But as per the old tradition, such services slightly underpay profits (to put it mildly) to their users for using their capacities. Due to this, the profitability of their service is built. Also, there will be a limit on the minimum withdrawal amount. That is, in order to withdraw the bitcoin (of course, only a small part) you have mined, you will first need to accumulate a certain amount of them, otherwise it will remain on the balance of the service, like NiceHash.",
