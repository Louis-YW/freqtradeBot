  "content": "Can we rent a House for Free?and can we benefit from renting a house?then the answer is YESone of the many ways is to share the room for the house that we rent with other people or our friends.Example :I am a student and I am looking for a house for rent near my college. I am renting a house with 5 rooms in it. and in a month I have to pay $500USD rent. And of course I only need 1 room for myself. and the remaining 4 rooms. so this is where my job is to find my college friends who need room rent.and at a university it is quite easy. especially if we have a study group. so here I offer friends to rent a room in the house I live in and I also give the freedom to share using other shared rooms such as the kitchen, living room and living room. so that every friend who rents a room also feels free to live in the house. and because there are only 4 vacant rooms so I'm looking for 4 people only. and I rent out each room for a monthly rate of $150USD. so 4x150=600USD.Now I don't have to spend money on renting a house. even I get 100USD profit per month.this is just an example. please share other solutions according to their respective opinions and experiences.and sorry if anyone has already discussed this. I'm just sharing my experience. And maybe many of us have had the same experience.",

      "body": "There have been recent experiments with timesharing and subdivision of single rooms for rental purposes.The way it works is, a single room could have 2 bunk beds to accommodate 4 people. If the room would normally cost $500/month to rent. Divide by 4 comes out to $125 per person. With there being 4 different safes for people to store personal items.I guess it is similar to life in stalinist russia where people were crammed into apartments like sardines. For those whose working condition and lifestyle are suited towards paying reduced rent. It could be a good format.The book neuromancer took this a step further. Where renters would lease a sleeping space the size of a coffin. I think japan experimented with this. Although it was completely unnecessary with japan's shrinking population making living space far less of a concern.",

It's like competing with Airbnb, you own nothing but still make money out of the property of someone. $150 seems not too high for students as long as the house is in a safe area and near the school. You can probably increase the rent to earn more than just $100 a month.",

So many just rent a room in a big house.They split the rent and usually it’s cheap however you need to understand you are going to be living with 4-5 different people and will have no privacy more or less. And you will probably have a hard time finding good room mates who don’t make too much noise all night.",

To be able to do that, at least in my country, you would have to be registered as a company or at least self-employed, and you have to take into account the risk that those who occupy rooms stop paying, or decide in the middle of the course that they prefer to go somewhere else, and you find yourself with unfilled rooms.",

I am certain that the law here doesn't allow you to rent a rented house. You can rent it together and share the cost but not rent what you've rented to others. In fact there is a clause in the contract that includes how many people are renting the house.if this is done without the permission of the original homeowner. then of course it's illegal. and it is impossible to hide the person renting from the original home owner.so here we have to make an agreement with the original owner of the house. Because usually not many are renting houses for individuals. so I first came to the landlord. I dared to rent the house at a slightly higher price than the usual rental price. because in my country the normal price of renting a house per month is around $350 USD. and I made an offer that I was willing to rent from the landlord for $500USD. but on condition that I can rent back each room to my friend. at a price that I set myself. that's the way i do it. but actually each room here is very spacious. so it actually fits 2 people with 2 medium size mattresses. but the owner of the house also gave me conditions such as per house only allowing a maximum of 5 people to live in. so 1 room = 1 person. I remember that time it wasn't even just one house that I made a business like this. because there are actually many special buildings that are rented per room, such as hotels. in the room there is a toilet and a small kitchen. so that tenants of large houses are rarely found. so it is difficult for the owner of a large house to find tenants. actually this kind of thing is common in every place near a faculty and factories in my neighborhood. and of course people are more comfortable with renting a room per person in a special rental building. because they don't have to share toilet and kitchen. oh i just remembered. Japan has provided many rental buildings that provide room rental with facilities for each room there is a small kitchen and a small toilet. so I think Japan will be the same, namely the demand for large houses for rent will be very rare. so this is where the opportunity can be exploited. but maybe something like this only applies in certain countries. so I don't know the laws of each country. if something like this is against the rules. then it is better not to do.",

And you will be responsible for the actions of the rest of the gouging who will live with you in a rented house Yes, exactly that's the case in my country as well. Firstly, landlords don't want to rent out a house to a bachelor male and even if they do, they won't allow you to sub-let. The rent agreement is made accordingly to prohibit this activity. Even if you have relatives coming to stay with you, that has to be notified to the housing society after taking permission from the landlord. Some good landlord definitely allows to do that, but many others will ask to see government IDs of your relatives. That's a big pain, especially for the bachelors! But once you are married, it's pretty easy to get a house on rent but after that you wouldn't want to sub-let for sure! While I was a bachelor, I had changed my residence six times in eight years. It's not an easy task to be honest.",

It is not to the benefit of the owner but to the subletter and the law is against that. When you give an apartment to an individual and he goes behind to put in another tenant that is not captured in the original contract agreement or tenancy agreement, this is an offence. However the situation in student area area is a little understandable and not strict , some student take this action without the consent of the house owner.",

Instead of looking for a single room to rent, some group of students prefer to rent an entire house and just end up dividing all the expenses including the electric and water bill, and the rent itself. So they can save a lot, and those extra money can still cater to their daily allowance or for their various projects in school.",
