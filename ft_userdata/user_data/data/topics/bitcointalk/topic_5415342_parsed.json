You could add third party repository such as ppa:rock-core/qt4[1], but there's no guarantee you won't face another problem. Alternatively, setup a VM or Docker image which contain older linux distro, then compile the application inside it.[1] https://launchpad.net/~rock-core/+archive/ubuntu/qt4/+packagesthanks ,i use this link https://askubuntu.com/questions/1234786/qt4-libqt4-in-ubuntu-20-04 .can it be ok?",

      "body": "This is a highly annoying problem that can be solved by adding a PPA that packages QT4. Here are some PPAs for 20.04 and 22.04. In particular, Armory still depends on libqt4 (and it was actually wiped out when I upgraded from Focal to Jammy) but there is a beta version of Armory that runs on QT5.",
