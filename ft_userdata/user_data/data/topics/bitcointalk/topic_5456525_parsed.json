      "body": "Good to hear from you, crafter! Thanks for notifying us about the new thread. Although it is kind of easy to find contests and giveaways, the thread created by you would be an added advantage for members like me and will be helpful to those who are new to the forum.Everyone is kinda busy with filing tax returns I guess. The Indian exchanges are struggling with low volumes as many users have shifted to international exchanges. On the trading and holding part Indians are in the top 5 in holding cryptocurrency globally and second in buying meme coins.Do stay active on the local board if possible.",

If you are pointing about the board then wait till the next halving and you will find your answer. I you are pointing India then yes, it is cold, and we are freezing in this hot weather.",

I remember how it was talk of town back in 2021-22 times when it was at it's peak. People were even holding seminars around it and claiming that you can become ultra rich by investing into shitcoins. After the bear run and eventually huge tax burdens by government crypto is really cold now and people have once again started to think about this as a scam.",
