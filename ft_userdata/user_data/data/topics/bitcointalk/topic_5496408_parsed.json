Make sure to cover the most basics first before doubling down on crypto investments, people seem to forget the risk involved that they're willing to lose a lot of money just to get in which isn't the right move.",

Many people will come and tell you that fiat currencies are losing value due to inflation and they will choose bitcoin. But if it were me, I would still choose to receive my salary in fiat currency because I don't want the value of my salary to fluctuate too much. What happens when you receive your salary in bitcoin and immediately after receiving it, the price of bitcoin adjusts by 10% or even 30%? Meanwhile, that salary is not only used for investment but also for daily living needs, and losing 30% of its value is something not everyone can endure. Meanwhile, with fiat currency, I can actively invest in bitcoin after completing my monthly spending plan.For me bitcoin is more suitable for use as an investment asset, it is not suitable as a currency because of its volatility.",

But the truth is that it doesn't matter what currency I get paid with whether crypto (bitcoin) or fiat but where it begins to matter is when I want to keep them, perhaps I would never save a dime for future purposes in fiat as they are all known for getting inflated over time but bitcoins volatility can be a good one as long as I'm keeping it for long but if I'm not going to save for up to 4-10 years then I would save in a stable coin but certainly not fiat. A better option would be what the first person commented which is taking all payments in fiat then use them to purchase as such as you can.",

The stress sometimes of converting every time to fiat will be much. Also the tax conversion burden is another issue again.

Litecoin or Ripple will do.Picking other fast or less fee Altcoins ahead of bitcoin is probably because you want to be converting to fiat all the time maybe because it is your main source of income. If it is then why go through that route when there is fiat option available to pick and safe the hassle. Those picking bitcoin are definitely those that want to hodl and are not regular converters. I don’t see any reason why someone will pick bitcoin or Altcoins when they don’t intend to hold them",
