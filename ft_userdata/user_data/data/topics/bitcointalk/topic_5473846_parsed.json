  "content": "How long has your account been registered with Bitcointalk? Maybe this is not so important to ask or state. However, I'm sure there will be a sense of pride if we are recognized or acknowledge that with our Bitcointalk account we have been registered on the Bitcointalk.org forum for quite a long time. And that can prove that we have been following Bitcoin for a long time and are not new to Bitcoin.My own account has been registered since November 21, 2017, 03:38:32 PM, At that time I knew about Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Forum through friends who like to make money from the Internet.How about you guys? Is There Anything Older Than My Account? And how did you know about Bitcoin at that time? And When does your Bitcoin transaction start? and for what?",

Such an account may or may not have extensive knowledge about the bitcoin. It all depends on the personal zeal of the account owner to acquire new knowledge.In fact, the time spent online (registration date) is just a counter in the account profile. Nothing more.An indicator that an account is not new to questions about bitcoin can only be its answers / posts. And even better - his actions, that is, the practical application of knowledge about the bitcoin.",
