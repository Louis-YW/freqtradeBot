Or they don't care about bull and bear market and they build thier project because the time is already been set? I am certain that some developers try to time their sale/ico, ido or whatever to happen during the bull market, but that's really hard job to time correctly as reason why people invested icos or idos during bull market wasn't just because bull market. It was because those funding methods were hot back then and pretty much guaranteed minimum 2x for investors. Last bull market it was nft mints and who knows what's going to be hot during next bull so trying to get into hype wagon, devs would need to pay attention daily.Imho developers shouldn't care about the price but focus on the development. In fact usually when price talk is allowed in the official chat, i am not investing into that.",

      "body": "Yeah because the market condition during the bull is most favorable for new projects.  During the bear season new projects find it hard to survive because of very low interest from the investors, almost everyone are on stablecoins and not ready to take unreasonable risk with their funds. Even though the market is not fully recovered but it is showing signs of life which is good enough for some projects and while others will rather wait.",

The best projects don't care about bull or bear market trends as long as they launch them on time and based on their time table, that's what's important to them.However, there's the significance of releasing a project during the bull run because every investor has got a lot of money to invest and every project has got a lot of money to make.That's why many projects do come during the bull market because it's tested during bear markets that it's not an effective time to release anything about them.",

Back in the day, people invested in ICOs and IDOs during the bull market because they were all the rage and pretty much guaranteed investors a sweet return. That is why 99.99% of projects turned out to be scams in the long run.But developers should focus more on the development of their projects than on the price of the tokens. At the end of the day, a project's success should be based on its technological advancements and real-world usefulness, not its price or how popular it is in the crypto market. That is my take on it, anyways.",

But when the market goes down, people who invest money get scared and don't want to put their money in new projects. When the market starts to get better, investors wake up and take chances on new projects. But we have to be careful because some bad people try to trick us with fake projects when the market is doing well. So, we need to be smart and not get too excited about new projects. We have to be careful with our money.",

      "body": "Simply because there is a higher probability for new projects to succeed during bullish trend because it is a common belief in this industry, as I assuume. High market demand means high market prices and investors are just reacting to such opportunity. Releasing a project during bearish market would more likely pull your project down leading to unsuccessful release on their public sale.Quote from: molsewid on March 19, 2023, 10:37:36 PMQuote from: MiF on March 19, 2023, 06:57:27 PMHello i just want to ask if i you guys also notice when the bitcoin rise there are also a lot of new projects come out and if bitcoin fall there are only few projects build, is it because some projects developer notice that most of the successful projects are build in bull market and most of the projects build on bear market are failed?

Indeed, this assumption does not mean that things are absolute just like there is a pattern. It is just a common belief which creates a big wave in the demand. Unfortunately, many potent projects were drowned during bearish market. Simply shows that timing is really something to be considered.",

Yes, it could be that this developers is waiting for the right time to go live with their projects. And as we all know, all roads to BTC, so they wait for time where the price is really going up, like in a bull run that we are experiencing right now, so it might be a good strategy. However, we should also think that timing might just be one factor behind the success or shall I say the pump (and then follow by dumping if that is the case). The project must be solid from ground up, developers are very active and it should be unique, at least they have something to offer to the public and the potential end user of it. Maybe if we can see which projects rolled out this week, and we can gauge them in the next coming months if they become successful because of the time or the project was simply a pump and dump.",

When the market is surging and bullish lots of developers are taking advantage of the bullish sentiment of the market which is why most of these developers area launching their projects during the bull market.  Many of these projects are even half-baked just to get in sync with the market's bullishness.  But picking projects to invest in during bullish market does not guarantee success or profit because many of these projects are just into milk investors of their money.  So whether it is a bear market or a bullish market, we must do our research and be vigilant in choosing a project to invest in.",

That is just an old story. new projects will be making so many people throw their money easily. I guess that if it's also triggering scammers to come up with scam projects as well. There are also so many successful projects built during the bearish market. It's all depends on the project developers. The bullish trend was just giving more demand to the project. The new project found how easy to attract money to come in during the bullish project compared with the bearish market. It's caused by there will be many people interested to doubling or tripling their money easily without needed any effort by investing into the new project but the problem is there would be so many people who had zero knowledge tried to inves blindly without doing any research before.",
