(1) If Putin manages to return Ukraine to the bosom of the Russian Empire, then nothing will stop him from the plan to restore the empire within the borders of the USSR. The reason for the invasion of Kazakhstan can be the same notorious reason about the “protection of the Russian world” in other countries, while in Russia itself the “Russian world” is withering, which in the end will certainly end in a merciless Russian revolt and crucifixion on the gates of the Kremlin Fuhrer Putin and his a gang of thieves along with the assholes. This is in the future, but for now ...    Like a bolt from the blue in the presence of Putin, the speech of the President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the only significant figure at the St. Gloomy from Tokayev's unexpected and frank rejection of Russia's aggressive policy, Putin silently swallowed such impudent and personally offensive words in the presence of numerous participants. The closure of the terminal for the shipment of Kazakh oil in the port of Novorossiysk, which followed soon after, can be qualified as Putin's revenge for the slap he received from Tokayev at an international forum. However, this revenge will cause damage not so much to Kazakhstan, but to Russia. The fact is that Kazakhstan can use the oil terminal in Baku and completely block the existing oil pipeline through Russia, which is why Russia will lose income for the transportation of Kazakh oil through its territory. Tankers can freely transport oil from the Kazakh port of Aktau, bypassing the Russian sector of the Caspian Sea, to Baku, and from there, via an existing oil pipeline, deliver it to Turkey and further to Europe.          This route is beneficial for Kazakhstan both economically and geopolitically. Moreover, it will eliminate waiting due to the oversaturation of the Bosphorus, through which more ships pass than through the Suez and Panama Canals. It is important to note that Kazakhstan joined the anti-Russian sanctions, and the already revived Great Silk Road (2) from China through Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan for Chinese goods to Europe, bypassing Russia, completely isolates the participation of the Evil Empire in world trade. Of course, Putin has enough reasons to start an invasion of Kazakhstan, but it is unlikely that he can do anything serious until he successfully ends the war with Ukraine, which is naturally a big question. The Kremlin bandit did not expect that the West would unite in the decision to help Ukraine, and with every day of the war, the hope for victory becomes more and more illusory. Putin definitely should not have gotten involved in a confrontation with Kazakhstan, and even against the backdrop of the formation of a strategic unity of the Turkic countries, one of which is a member of NATO.
