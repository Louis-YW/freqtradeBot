Privately chatting prospective victims, mimicking the names of real influencers, and so many other processes. Well using myself as an example, I didn't learn Bitcoin or won’t learn Bitcoin from any telegram group, why not right out learn through reading! Read books, articles, News, go for Bitcoin functions. Create a rapport with those that know bitcoin I suggest a physical rapport. And you are here on the forum (free to ask questions and get answers) I wonder why you would risk it all just to be on a telegram group. Is it worth it?",

Nevermind about the telegram group for a moment, actually this forum would also be a good platform to learn bitcoin, miners and you could also ask if he have telegram group full of miners or whatever it is that is related to bitcoin and mining. It's been asked many times in board to but moved in mining board sooner or later so better check the board right away and we don't know you have found what you are looking for such as knowing what iminungs the best mining rigs to use depend on your budget.",

Avoid personal messages, if anyone send you PM, they only want to scam you. Just follow some of the links provided by the reputed members above and read online yourself about mining. Avoid scam.Mining is required a lot of things like having cheap electricity, buying expensive mining hardwares like ASIC that cost thousands of dollars and also joining mining pool. Do not go for those cloud mining and other related ones, they are all scam. Anyone or online site that said they can mine for you are also scammers. If you can not buy mining hardwares and join a mining pool, you can go for other options like just holding. Not everyone can mine.Quote from: KingsDen on September 08, 2022, 11:09:12 PMI really have to believe that OP is not a newbie in cryptocurrency, if he is, he wouldn't have known about Bitcoin mining, but my fear is that is he surely knows about Bitcoin mining or has experience of it, he should know where and how to locate such telegram groups.  I pray Op knows what he is doing.The OP seem more like a newbie post. What can come some newbies mind is to search online about how to earn bitcoin, what would be included among it is mining. It is very easy for newbie to easily have heard or read about bitcoin mining, but mining is not easy as it is included on the articles of how to earn bitcoin.",

In addition to all the information that can be found on the forum, it is really strange that you are looking for a source of some new information on Telegram...I also see that you are interested in buying mining equipment, and then you better stay away from various social networks where there are a lot of fake sellers - unless you want to risk paying a few thousand $ for a brick.",
