Most people right now are smart they only use well-known and open-source payment gateways because we don't know if how safe the closed source payment gateway is than using open-source payment gateway like BTCpayserver.",

      "body": "You are too early The market for the crypto gateway is too small currently to think about a B2B model. I'm pretty sure none exist nowadays and there is surely a reason. There is no demand for it, so no use to supply a solution. You will spend resources for next to nothing or you won't get a return for several years. Ending with a big disappointment.Since it is a business and it's supposed to make money (the much as possible) it's wise to follow the B2C road instead.If your business activity becomes more important later on, you could always switch to B2B or make additional revenues. But within the next 5 years, I don't see any niche with the B2B",

Plus if you become compliant with US (except perhaps for New York) and the EU/UK, you would ol easily get a lot of clients from these regions without any governmental harassment.*disclaimer, I myself am building a B2B payment processor at work.",

B2B and B2C there are differences in pursuing the target market, the two business methods are almost often used in the service business or selling products, In my current country, what are often used are B2C services such as Berrybenka, Amazon, Ebay, and many others.The difference is of course there.• The B2B system as far as I know the method of service or product they use uses other parties, but if you are a business you work internationally in conducting transactions or transferring coins, B2B is certainly a good choice, B2B features are more focused on the payment method platform to consumers.• B2C system without other parties, meaning: You can directly make transactions with consumers.This B2C method is often used, such as: food business or the like on a large scale.Of the two methods above, B2B and B2C, of ​​course you can conclude which one is the best to use in the product business, you can use the two payment features depending on the business you are running.",

      "body": "B2C will only be an option if you have your own or friend's online shop where you can try to integrate your payment gateway.B2B will always be your best choice as you are targeting business who will use your service on these businesses' websites. Free trial will be always the best move for someone who doesn't have any reputation. Try to post it on Services section. Make sure its properly documented like if the balance of the users is held by yours or if they will just need xpub, zpub, or ypub for them to generate payment address and so on.Free trial ideas can be- free trial for fixed day like for 30 days. - fixed number of transactions like you will only charge service fees after 20 transactions made via your payment gateway",

The most competitive thing is people Lossing faith in the centralized gateway and moving to decentralize open-source non-custodial payment gateway. So you have to struggle to sustain in this situation. And most gateways have multiple services that's how they sustain.",
