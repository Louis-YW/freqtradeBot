  "content": "Holding Bitcoin for the long term without being tempted to sell is very difficult it requires a combination of mindset, strategy, and security measures to be able to hold for a very long period of time, below are some measures that will help you.1. Backup funds.Make sure you have an emergency, reserve and float funds, this funds will help you when ever you are in an emergency and you don't have finance which is what is needed, instead of dipping hands into your Bitcoin by selling it you can just use your backup funds to settle the emergency.Having a backup funds will reduce the emotional pressure to sell during market downturns also.2. Develop a Strong Conviction.Understand that Bitcoin investment is one of the best investment right now in the world and holding Bitcoin for long term will be more profitable, and always remind yourself that Bitcoin is still growing and selling now means you have lost the future benefit of enjoying the big price.3. Set a Clear Time Horizon.Make up your mind and decide how many years you want to hold your Bitcoin if it is 5, 10 or 20 years, and tell yourself you will reach that time you have set for yourself, see your Bitcoin as an investment.4. Surround Yourself with Like-Minded People.Surrounding yourself with people who are also holding for long term are very helpful, since you are in this forum you can always visit thread where they discuss and encourage long term Bitcoin holding. 5. Stay Away from Daily Price Movements.I'm not saying you shouldn't check the price movement of Bitcoin but don't do it daily to avoid being tempted, you may set a 10 years plan for holding and in the next 5 years you saw that Bitcoin has increased dramatically in price now seeing how big  your money is every day may tempt you to sell.Check but once in a while.6. Time-Locking Solutions.Some platforms allow you to lock up Bitcoin for a specified period to prevent impulsive decisions.This will really help you, when you have set out plan to hold for 10 years and you lock it for that 10 years you can only deposit more Bitcoin but  you cannot withdraw or sell it till that 10 years is over.",

      "body": "The easiest way to succeed is discipline. If you’ve created a plan for long-term holding, you need to stick to it with discipline. There’s always an opportunity to hold, as the market still has room to grow, which should motivate us to hold even longer.One of the main reasons people fail to stick to their targets is greed or panic. They either get greedy and sell too soon or panic when the market turns bearish. I’ve seen this happen so many times before, people get excited and invest during a bull market (like now) because of FOMO. But when a bear market hits, they lose hope and sell at a loss. Which is why it’s easier to invest when you don’t put the majority of your money into Bitcoin as the more you can afford to lose, the better your chances of holding for the long term.",

      "body": "If you compare the profitability of Bitcoin with other investments, you would be motivated to keep holdling for a longer time. I checked how profitable investing in real estate and Bitcoin for eight years and it was clear that Bitcoin was better. You make profit without stress, maintenance, public attention, etc investing in Bitcoin. I am motivated to keep hodling because Bitcoin has proved to be one of the best investments.   Quote from: Ziskinberg on January 26, 2025, 12:54:39 PMOne of the main reasons people fail to stick to their targets is greed or panic. They either get greedy and sell too soon or panic when the market turns bearish. Investors usually sell off not because of greed but fear. If you are greedy, you will keep hodling regardless of the pressure to sell because you want to make more money. It is FUD that is the main reason why people don't follow stated plans.",

Do not give yourself that safety net. If you want to really hold bitcoin, then hold every single one you have.Quote5. Stay Away from Daily Price Movements.Check but once in a while. This is one thing I learned over my experience with bitcoin.

You need to have a good financial management practice to be a long-term hodler, don't get carried away with little profit. Exactly, you know sometimes this happens as a result of not knowing what bitcoin investment is all about, probably after hearing about bitcoin investment from different sources they will just decide to dive into bitcoin investment. Hoping that bitcoin investment is just the same with every other investment, this is the reason why most people end up losing their money in bitcoin investment why most people also get a little profit. However, holding our bitcoin for long term investment without being tempted to sell, actually I think it will be very difficult for some people but the easiest way to go about it is when you set an emergency fund or other business that can profit you on a daily basis. because is only when we have financial problem or any other challenges that we can only be tempted to sell our asset, this is why as a bitcoin investor is always advisable to set an emergency fund should incase of anything you can decide to use the money in your emergency fund to settle everything, with this  I think you will not be tempted to sell your bitcoin.",

      "body": "How long you will hold your Bitcoin depend largely on how you accumulated them, that is the condition surrounding the buying process. Let me give an instance, if you buy Bitcoin with borrowed funds, even if you lock it with steal and throw the key into the Atlantic Ocean, when the creditors come knocking you will have to find a way to open it which is sell your Bitcoin even if it is at a loss. Similarly, if you buy Bitcoin with money meant for your basic needs, you will still sell them when the need arise because basic needs cannot wait. To be able to hold Bitcoin for long term, you must only invest money that you can afford to leave in Bitcoin for that duration without yielding to the pressure to sell. To achieve this, always practice to separate all your cash inflows into funds for basic needs, fund for investment and fund for emergencies that will cover things not planned for which might come up. With this in place, any amount that enter your hand already have ways of being spent judicious and you will never be in any pressure to liquidate your assets over minor challenges.",

The dip is not permanent, it is an opportunity for one to even buy more bitcoin but some people misunderstand it.I see there are actually lots of investors now that actually do just invest for a current bull run like they buy bitcoin before the halving happens with the perception that after the halving comes the bull run, this I will say is not entirely good or bad because base on past bitcoin history such kind of people will see profits because the market has a bullish trend after the halving. But the bad stuff side is, this kind of investors usually fall into panic for every little dip the market faces and this is definitely not a good way to actually hold a coin. Long term investment is what sets holders apart from each other and avoiding unnecessary panics and sells Quote from: Mia Chloe on January 26, 2025, 02:39:31 PMNevertheless one other reason why you should make use of cold wallets is because they are difficult to spend with compared to their hot wallet counterparts.

The habit not been able to hold for long is something an investors needs to learn and it is basically depends on how you invested into it.",

But I have ever witnessed a man fall off his bitcoin investment just to keep the standard of his luxury lifestyle. That is why I think it will be very nice if we let people know about it. Luxury items do not only mean jewellery, clothes, or other things but also include phones. Some people tend to follow the trend to get the most updated items, and this will not lead you to the right path but the wrong one, and it will let you go broke with no options other than to cash out from your investment.Long-term investment goes beyond determination but also financial and behavioural self-discipline, which is only a few that have that, and the best method for you to hold for the long term is by teaching yourself the ability to accept defeat rather than losing your investment, so you will have to endure hard times when it is necessary for you to be able to secure your bitcoin investment for the time plan; that is why we call it patience.

Supported, having one source of income to me is still a no for someone who wants to be a strong bitcoin holder, be sure to have at least two stable source of income, have a plan to use either one quarter of your income for your spending purposes, your family needs and all other expenses should be included in it then you can decide to use the remaining one to focus on your bitcoin investment otherwise you will definitely sell part or almost your capital to solve family needs.
