Canada ostensibly abolished their death penalty in 1998. The difference between euthanasia and the death penalty from the perspective of the state is compassion.And if you closely examine such cases of euthanasia in Canada, the compassion is nonexistent: https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-health-toronto-7c631558a457188d2bd2b5cfd360a867Alan Nichols, euthanized because of his listed condition of \"hearing loss.\" Of course, he was helplessly depressed.
