Would be absurd if you do not even understand that.Ironically this thread was posted in Meta, It was moved here by a Moderator.Regarding your point, I acknowledge that tokenizing real-world assets isn't a completely novel concept. However, the question remains: has it truly been executed effectively? I'm determined to achieve just that. Let's channel our efforts towards leveraging technology for the betterment of the world, rather than merely chasing the latest fad or trend. I believe you are currenty working with AI.Whats absurd is that what is accepted in the project announcement section and what is not. I don't care if it was categorized as a token or a coin. If all those projects with no utility can be allowed to be noticed in the Main Announcement section, then mine should be as well. I don't need a lesson from you about the difference between a coin and a token",

Also CEXes got in trouble by doing that.Yes the platform isnt perfect, the categories of assets we will offer is not finalized yet... But concept is solid and it will work I can promise you that. I also agree a mere token transfer is not a comprehensive solution. That's why we're working on implementing mechanisms that ensure legal recognition and enforcement of ownership rights, it is very much possible. We have done our homework before venturing into this. As far as serious players in the field, BlackRock the biggest asset management company in the world is very bullish on tokenization along with others, You should learn about this more.I agree the project needs fine tuning but the vision is 100% achievable with the technologies available today.Quote from: AnonBitCoiner on September 15, 2023, 06:02:20 PMQuote from: amysteryremains on September 15, 2023, 04:41:15 PMHello everyone, I am the founder of AssetX, A project that aims to tokenize real world assets using blockchain technology.

I agree with you; Moderators might have done the right thing, but ask yourself, was it the right thing to do?Ideally, the layout should be like this:New tokens in the main sectionand thenNew coins (as new coins will not change the world; new projects and new use cases will). Moving new projects into a subcategory just feels cheated.I should just get back to working on my project, instead of arguing about improving this platform.. You keep following the same stuff, Satoshi is proud and its still 2010.Cheers",

The question is why this section has been set up like this.The important thing for us right now is exposure, as we are trying to build a community and fundraise, and Bitcoin Talk has huge daily visitors.I have been visiting Bitcoin Talk for years to check and get updated on new project announcements, and never have I clicked on the button that said ''Child Board / Tokens (Altcoins)'' after visiting the announcement page. As is apparent by the low number of views in that section, most other people do the same.The most visited page on Bitcoin Talk is 'Announcement (Altcoins)'. It should be open for each project that is announcing, and if you do want ''Tokens (Altcoins)'' to be in a different section then put such a button on the main page along with the regular announcement.Most people are here to learn about new projects. It is not wise or correct to put some projects in a corner where nobody can find them.",

The project was unsuccessful because there were still so many security holes and people wouldn't believe it could guarantee/certify their real-world assets.Hi,Here is the project link:www.assetx.networkOwnership rights can be technically and legally transferred to a token, so whoever holds the token or a part of the token is the rightful owner, and every transaction is verified and visible on the chain for everyone to see.However, the main issue here is trust. How would you know that a token you are trying to own is really backed by the real-world asset it represents? Anyone can mint a token and claim it has ownership rights.We are addressing this issue through reputable asset managers. This industry already functions because of asset managers who hold and maintain assets on behalf of owners. This is what has enabled BlackRock to manage 9.4 trillion dollars in AUM, which is far greater than the largest company in the world today.We aim to build a trustless system where these asset managers, asset owners, and investors can come together in one place to gain value.There is a lot of room for growth in this industry, as it is expected to reach $5 trillion by 2030. We are currently at a very early stage, and the project does require a lot of work. We are doing our best to make it successful. But we wont be able to do that if nobody knows who we are..I mean you look at it, this post titled shitcoin has more views than the announcement itself, which was moved to a child board.Our announcement linkhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466874.msg62848837#msg62848837It got 70% of the views in just 3 hours on main announcement, then the rest 30% took 24 hours since we were moved to a child board",

These regulations are in place to protect the interests and rights of all participants in the ecosystem. So in order to protect and enforce ownership rights any platform who will work with real world asset will need to comply with these laws..",

The NFT trends do bring something new to the table, but they could not considered revolutionary. real-world asset tokenization would not bring any value if the fundamental of the growth is merely fueled by large funds and celebrities, not an inherent value that people perceive it useful.Revolutionary things are like what bitcoin offers to the space. Not chased by clout, not a passing fad due to its long history of its conception and how it's going till today.",
