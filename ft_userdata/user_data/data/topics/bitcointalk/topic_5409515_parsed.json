Perhaps the war will destroy most of the population.And btc and crypto will be used by robots to pay each other thts was the ultimate plan when they created Btc.Xrp will be new dollar xrp is all ready dollar its waiting for CBDC label and thts it.Wait for lockdowns and reset the first covid lockdowns was just the test now its coming real economic and system reset.U dont own nothing u dont have business all business will under control of goverment you just working for the bigger system nobody dont get too much all will be shared equally everything equal no salary differences.Off course if you live in the right neighbourhood such us beverly hills then all this nonsense dont apply for you.",

      "body": "If you think about it, you can consider UBI the equivalent of \"bread and circus,\" just give them enough to survive and not cause trouble. But then again if \"they\" (whoever they are) can just produce anything they want, there's really no use to keeping people around. I personally haven't made up my mind about UBI.As for coof passports, we already had that. You can't travel to some countries without a vaxx certificate. Some countries also restricted the unvaxxed's use of public transport.",
