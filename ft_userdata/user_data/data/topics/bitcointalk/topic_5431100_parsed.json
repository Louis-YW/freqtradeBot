  "content": "Hello everyone,I am writing this looking for information about privacy in wallets.It is known that the major closed source wallets use their own servers to provide information about the balance of addresses or to make new transactions.I would like to know if some open source wallets like Electrum have their own servers to do that job or if they work with the public nodes of the bitcoin network.I'm also interested to know if there are any hardware wallets that do that. If not, I would like to know if there is a way to check the balance of an address using the btc network and not a blockchain explorer, for example with some node calls running btc core.Thank you all for taking the time to read!!!",

While I saw it on Coingecko, it is one of the coin that needs not to be gone for:https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pandora-cash#:~:text=Pandora%20Cash%20price%20today%20is,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.No known marketcap24 hours trading volume of $1,152.

Personally, this is the first time I hear about Sparrow Wallet and I must admit, after watching the video on their website, I was intrigued and visually liked this wallet. Including the opportunities it provides. Will have to try to use it. I don't remember the topic on the forum dedicated to Sparrow Wallet. Is there a topic with a detailed overview? And what do you write about coinjoin mixing with Whirlpool? Does this wallet have a built in mixer or how it works?",

But you still can do that by creating wallet which contain specific Bitcoin address or master public key. If you add one which already has past transaction, Bitcoin Core will need to rescan blockchain which could take some time.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on December 23, 2022, 07:19:26 PMQuote from: hosseinimr93 on December 23, 2022, 11:12:02 AMIn electrum, you connect to the servers provided by other people and it allows you to choose the server manually.
