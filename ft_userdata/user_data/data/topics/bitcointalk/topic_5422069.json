Here's your FAQ as a beginner: Q: Who should I trust? A: Nobody. Q: Should I sell Bitcoin when its downfall? A: Never, Never do that. Q: Is Bitcoin dying after FTX fall? A: The Bitcoin price has continued to shrink in 2022 since Terra Luna initiated a significant crypto crash in Q1 and now FTX saga. Bitcoin will most likely have value and regain. The only thing that can make Bitcoin valueless is if all governments ban it or render it illegal. However, this consensus is almost impossible to reach.  Q: What have I gotten myself into? A: Nobody knows. Q: Is Bitcoin a good investment 2022?? A: Anyone investing in Bitcoin will hope for the best, but they should be prepared for big downturns, too. My question to you Q: What is your price prediction for 2023?",

However, this consensus is almost impossible to reach. There's no relation between Terra Luna and Bitcoin, it's off topic.Even all governments ban Bitcoin, it doesn't stop someone to buy or sell Bitcoin. We have non custodial P2P marketplace and decentralized exchange e.g. BiSQ, so you can hide from government laws.QuoteMy question to you Q: What is your price prediction for 2023?No body knows, just like someone can't predict when Binance will collapse just like Mt.Gox and FTX.",

However, this consensus is almost impossible to reach.Your response here does not gives the direct explanation to the required answer to the question, bitcoin is not dying after the FTX or any other crypto fall, bitcoin is decentralized while others are centralized.Quote from: Pam beasely on November 18, 2022, 06:44:40 AM Q: Is Bitcoin a good investment 2022?? A: Anyone investing in Bitcoin will hope for the best, but they should be prepared for big downturns, too.There's risk in whatsoever thing we do in life but the risk taken must be a deserving one for what we took it on, bitcoin is the first recommendation that any new investor will be orovi with to begin a start.Quote from: Pam beasely on November 18, 2022, 06:44:40 AMMy question to you Q: What is your price prediction for 2023?The price will rise but may not get to the $68k and you can also do your own research.",

I wonder how are those crypto analysts so confident forecasting prices over $100,000 by year X.Don't be surprised that some even go to the extent of predicting $250k before the end of 2024 and that's what they can only come up with, but the reality with the market price with bitcoin is what we all sees it to be individually regardless of what others may call it, we all know that this year will keep rotating within $30k and below while early next year may bring a new change of zone to something close to $68k and will still fall down with high volatility till we are approaching the 2024 halving, the media news can also influence a dump or pump in price of bitcoin but to a little extent.",

However, this consensus is almost impossible to reach.  You may not understand how this works and I can see that, I think you should relax and learn, all your post here are actually not correct including this, firstly yes Tera Luna had a very bad period and definitely caught many investors and still many other investors got into it and also got caught in all of that.But what you should know is that Tera Luna doesn't influence Bitcoin and let's say it does it won't be very substantial. It's actually the other way round, for example Bitcoin is dominant and it's situation determine the outcome of the crypto-currency market.",

There was a significant fall of Bitcoin when Terra issue created and so does when recent FTX issue was. Such major chaos in crypto market definitely influence bitcoin price as it creates fear in the overall market. In a normal market, without any such chaos from alt, altcoin follows the bitcoin generally.",

There are some whom actually panic sell during that time and even think that the market will actually downsized and it did happened. Now with the FTX failure, everyone are also in grave phase and wondering when could be the recovery of all market.",

I feel $68k is the huge number to predict. With the current bitcoin price and according to CoinPedia experts the bitcoin price prediction for 2023 would be between $34K -  $43K.Mate you need to check your quote pattern very well in other not to give another person's quote for the other, back to bitcoin price discussion which i presumed to be on speculation board initial, I understand that the all time high for bitcoin is the $68k and what we are saying now is that there's no high tenderness to this high not until we are close to 2024 which will usher us into the halving as expected but before then, we will continue to have high volatile trend in bitcoin price and come 2023 may be abit tougher as well because the $68k ATH may not be revisited within the Q1 to Q3 or next year.",
