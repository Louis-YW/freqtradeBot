      "body": "Is that the test jig from Bitmain? There might be a connection problem which is why it is stuck at sending PIC heartbeat or the USB test data cable is defective. Try to check the terminals of the test fixture and clean them and then replug them all. Test again let's see for any changes. If nothing changes maybe there is an issue on the hashboard related to the PIC program that needs to be reflashed.",
