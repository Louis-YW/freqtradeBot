      "body": "Great to see that you making an anniversary promotion for the forum members,  this is good to hear and also know,  because at some point,  such offer can be the only thing that can motivate any member to want to gamble and test out the asini,  but then also I think that instead of giving a 10% rake back/cash back,  which you mentioned that $100 play can give you a whopping 40 free spin. Just a friendly suggestion,  why not give members that will exclusively test and try out your casinos to bonuses to do that with,  instead of the usual way of of haven't to deposits and making some real-time bets instead of wasting time on something the gambler will just decide to remain on reserves moods,  and only gamble with his or her deposits instead chasing bonuses that it winning is subject to harsh retirement .",
