Everyone used it, and now there is some other preferred method? I never thought pictures could be so complicated. What I am sure of is that there is a thread somewhere and some smarty pants is going to kindly share the link to that thread because I have yet to find it! I'm sure i've missed some huge memo on this or something somewhere. But could someone please explain to me why those image source codes no longer work, and tell me which ones do? Cheers, TREAD",

So all ip.bitcointalk.org requests are blocked, but even many Tor exit nodes are being blocked, for example.",

Besides, Meta is not a board that has any restrictions in the sense that you should not regularly check what is happening on the forum.The forum search gives kind of messy results which could be hard for newbies to get the desired threads links although they could apply different filters to make search more effective.But in turn it could be more useful if they directly do google search with forum keyword at last that will direct them to related threads like this one:Code: Imgur issue on bitcointalkImgur images not displaying bitcointalkThis can help them to have some sorted results rather then looking on forum directly that can be confusing for them but they could also use https://ninjastic.space/ for more information.",

I didn't change anything on the forum's end, so imgur must've loosened up their limits. I guess it's not necessary to convert img images into links as long as imgur keeps working. But to prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.I'd like to create a page which recommends services for hosting forum images, and mention this in the error message you get when you try to use imgur. Other than TalkImg, which ones are good?It lasted a few days and images returned to be invalid. Also another issueQuote from: theymos on May 25, 2023, 06:11:09 PMQuote from: LoyceV on May 25, 2023, 07:17:36 AMQuote from: theymos on May 24, 2023, 06:24:57 PMto prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.This also means old posts can no longer be edited without replacing the image links (I just tested it).It's based on the message ID. Posts before roughly when I posted that can be edited without updating the imgur links.",

Its easier to get a few snarky remarks along with the right info, I did check the search bar for \"posting images\" or \"images\" I saw that one post on the new talkimg one or whatever its called created by a forum user- all my pics were high resolution so I needed to resize all that shit, life happened and I didn't have time to get to it all so sue me lol. I wish we could just upload our pictures directly on here, like strip all other data and just post the image like it posts an image on FB or any other social media site but i'm sure its definitely not as easy as it sounds, I mean shoot why doesn't Btalk just create its own image hosting service just for its users? This could even branch out a bit to help drive more traffic to this site and create even more ad revenue, just a thought....",
