For now, we are only testing this platform and we do not publish fully advertising publications, but only the results of some of our checks with links to our resources. We will also soon make publications of other formats without our promotional materials. But thank you for the advice",

Therefore, with 30% accuracy a trader can be both profitable and unprofitable. I once wrote an article on the dependence of accuracy and RRR, I will publish it on this site soon.",
