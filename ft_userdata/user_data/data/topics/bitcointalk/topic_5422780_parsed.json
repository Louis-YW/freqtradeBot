  "content": "When looking at the odds the favorite winner is still from European clubs like; Croatia, Germany, Spain, and Belgium. We will not doubt because when looking at all squads and players who have enough experience in the big league and clubs, those teams will get the winner and easy to get 3 points, but some time is not easy because they play in a country with hot wheater were not easy to defeat team on that situation.This time I will try the best team which I think will get the win tonight. (Belgium and Croatia)for Spain and Germany, I have a secret choice which I won't show it here.  so what do you choose and thought?",

It seems that Croatia has more point among the four matches, Moroccan players are going to try their best, but they seem not like a perfect match for Croatia and I am expecting Croatia to win. Spain and Costa Rica, I expect Spain to have been winning from the first half. I also go for Belgium and and definitely Germany which is stronger. But I will advice you to just choose like 1 or 2 matches and enjoy the fun with the low amount staked on the matches.",

I don't think miracle can happen on this day, but if Costa Rica can win, next match I will bet on huge underdog team lol.",

I don't think miracle can happen on this day, but if Costa Rica can win, next match I will bet on huge underdog team lol.I think Costa Rica has a chance against Spain. They've been good on their previous inspite of being an underdog to both and upcoming matches. Speaking of which, underdogs do not always lose but it is just that it is more frequent to dominant teams to win which create a bigger impact to the audiences when the least expected teams won. But on my end, I like its idea. It somehow remind the fans that sports is indeed like a round ball; time for ups and as well as downs. But for this industry, there are players who are more into underdog teams simply because the profit is bigger due to odds difference. But for some reason I am excited with match between belgium and canada. I'm not fammiliar with them that muh so I might do a bit scouting since I'm still young in this sports industry. Let us all enjoy watching!",

      "body": "Match Morocco vs Croatia, I chose to bet on a draw. why, even though statistically Croatia is more convincing to win this match.  however, if I refer to the odds given by the dealer. IMO, there's something odd here. the two of them have a FIFA ranking that is quite far apart, but based on statistics these two teams have a pretty good record. In my estimation, the match will run tough. and yes the result I won this fight.Germany vs Japan, based on my analysis, in many posts before this world cup started. I said, that Germany will experience difficulties in this world cup. on the other hand, Japan's statistics are not very good, not bad either. but they have advantages, have a mentality that does not give up easily. in the end, I bet on Japan. however, in the first half. Japan was so depressed they even left behind 1-0, I finally gave up and let go of this defeat. but unexpectedly, Japan could turn things around and become a victory for them. in the end, i got lucky by winning big money.Spain vs Costa Rica, this bet is not very good if you choose Spain with such low odds. in the end, I bet choose Score betting. and yes, I am lucky to win this fight again. well, this is the last match Belgium vs Canada, the odds that Belgium have are not too bad.  so I bet on Belgium for this match. all my bets are single bets. if Belgium wins over Canada, I'm really lucky.",

But Argentina game of today World Cup was unique one, Messi had played his best in this world as the Ronaldino said about Messi in his first game. Ronaldino was inspiration for the Messi and he proved his brother Ronaldino words in this World Cup. Messi was compared to Maridona and Argentina team thought Messi will replace the Maridona and it was proved for now in this World Cup. Argentina was purely based on Messi after the Maridona farewell. But same was reason by the team dependent on the Messi alone. Most the fans think of Argentina should one because of Messi alone.",
