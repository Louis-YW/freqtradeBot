Generating a chart at that point would be redundant as you can just work with the landing page, which already has '1' filled in.This tool is cool and can be useful to show you different valuations of your holdings overtime and make reasonable estimations for the future.Could there be way to calculate for before 2015?",

Played little here and there. The tool does not work on safari browser somehow. I mean the chart is not showing up. I inserted the amount and it shows how I have turned my 20 bucks to almost 1500 bucks since 2014 year to 2022. I assume this is just pre-loaded data that means it won't be calculating the value in the near future, and that would be like prediction calculator rather than valuator based on past data.

Cheers, mate.Thats the point here, its based on the available data. For future presentations you may just showcase some rough cycles of price increase? That would be fun tool to play around. As each day passes the data can be corrected and real values could be shown.",

      "body": "The idea is simple, but I like the design. Perhaps it would be more fun if a person could insert multiple entries (for example, holding a certain amount of BTC in a certain period, and then another amount in another period), that would be more valuable to see, IMO, as here the chart is essentially the same, and only the numbers in USD change based on how much a person is holding.Quote from: J0M on May 21, 2022, 09:40:54 AMThe first data point at this moment is from 23 February 2014 but I'll try to obtain more old data somehow. Cheers, mate.There's data since the end of April 2013 on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin. Perhaps, you could use this to make the chart bigger.",

I'll add this data asap.Not sure why the TradingView tab on CoinGecko only shows the data from Aug 2017, but on their \"website\" their data starts from Aug 2011 [the same goes for \"nomics\"]!I think it makes more sense to show the \"percentage increase/decrease\", as opposed to showing the \"holdings value\" when hovering over a certain period.",
