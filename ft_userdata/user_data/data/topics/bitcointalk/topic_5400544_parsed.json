You are just here to earn and not to learn. This is a forum and not an earning platform. Get that right, OP.When introduced to something, one tends to act according to how it was presented to them until taught otherwise. That seems to be the case here;Many users are on this forum only for bounties and spam to earn. That is all they know about the forum. If they presented the forum to people, they will teach them to act along those lines. They could even tell them that other sections of the forum does not offer much, and they could even get bashed by other members and tagged merit hunters for posting there, further pushing them to the spam grounds.This doesn't make them bad newbies per se, they just need re-direction. We all started somewhere and probably saw the forum to be something different from how we view it today.Quote from: UpiwArt on May 29, 2022, 05:07:35 AMwhen it comes to goals. I want to get knowledge and money from this forum.so it becomes additional work for meFirstly, posting consecutively is against the forum rules.Secondly, learning and earning are all possible here and there are many members who do it, including myself; however during your early stages of the forum, it's advisable to shelve the idea of earning and focus only on learning and growing your knowledge base. Do not be to desperate to rank up or earn merits, just read and learn as much as you can, find an interest and genuinely enjoy this forum, anything else can come later.",

Posting multiple posts in a row (excluding bumps and reserved posts by the thread starter) is not allowed.Secondly, if your friends, as you call them, are doing something here and still doing well and making an income, why don't you ask them?However, to remove the beautiful curtains from your eyes, you need to tell yourself directly and honestly that you will not get good money until you understand how the forum works. Grow in rank, and that takes time. To do this, more reading and trying to block the \"bounty\" section.
