  "content": "Dear Tromp,I hope you are doing great.This is a direct question to you sir. I tried to send you a private message but was unable to do so as a newbie.Like many I was able to create a altcoin out of the bitcoin source code version 17.02 and was able to mine the coins at home with a virtual machine. I got more interested and started to search for a Asic resistant Algorithm.I found your Grin YouTube interview and got even more interested on the Cuckatoo cycle you have developed.My question is: there a way to implement the cuckatoo cycle in the SHA256 coin to make it more asic resistant ? If so there is a lot of C++ code I found on your GitHub but not a guide on how to maybe implement it ? Do you have one ? Can you maybe help me ? I am also from the Netherlands and don‚Äôt mind paying you for your time and effort.Thank you üôè",
