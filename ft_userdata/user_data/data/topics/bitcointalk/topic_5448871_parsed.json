Most of the casino applied with minimum 1x waggering requirement user to completed. It's a based unwritten rule, from casino to avoid money laundry.That's why, some user are getting flag if they withdraw without passed the waggering from their total deposit. Example:- Deposit : 200$- I make a bet with 150$ and profit 150$ (I think is big for me)Withdraw instantly, this is gonna to lead the system flag on their system to withdraw manually. So, the automatically system withdraw are not gonna to work",

For anti money laundering bs most casinos make you wager your deposited amount 1x. So, if you deposit .01btc you must wager .01btc before being able to wd. The list in the OP is talking about normal deposits with 0 bonuses attached. Those casinos want you to wager 3 to 30 times your deposit amount. In most cases you will lose your ass playing on a casino with these kinds of terms.",

I could understand if it was for some sort of deposit bonus, but otherwise it sounds like you lose the second you make a deposit. It's exactly as I mentioned before unfortunately. Â Many users are not aware of certain terms when depositing the minimum amount at a casino such as this one. And most casinos require a wagering of the deposit, especially for no-bonus deposits. For bonuses the wagering requirements can go up to x100. However for no bonus deposits most casinos only require a maximum of x2 wagering or even less. While others they may require a higher terms. That's why I thought to create a list of casinos that have high wagering requirements for deposits.What seems like unfamiliar condition to withdraw even with well known casinos is simply that most of gamblers never made it to withdraw, we lose before requesting a withdrawal.Quote from: Beparanf on April 14, 2023, 06:20:02 PMLivecasino only applies x5 wagering requirements when you are suspected coin mixing as per the terms and your table details.
