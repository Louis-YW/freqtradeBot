  "content": "Hello and hope everyone here is having a wonderful time here. Iâ€™ve been going through the contents of this forum for quite sometime now and Iâ€™ve really found the contents of the forum quite educative and helpful too.I finally created an account yesterday to enable have the access to be part of the forum. I created this account yesterday and today Iâ€™ve been able to make some posts/comments in some of the contents here. Although I used to initially have an account some time ago but I kinda lost the password to the account and lost access to the account, although when I created the account I was unable to make posts due to a proxy ban on the account, but with the help of a VPN browser Iâ€™ve been able to create another account that now allows me to make posts and now I can make posts and comments.While I was busy exploring this forum to gain more knowledge and enlightenment, I kinda bumped into a few threads where beginners and newbies kinda make some sort of introduction and making their presence known to the platform.Although Iâ€™m new here but not really entirely a newbie because I have few and past knowledge about cryptocurrency so I wouldnâ€™t be entirely be classified as a newbie.I felt it would be appropriate to ask if itâ€™s right or okay for me to come in and start making posts here without really formally introducing myself or is there something I should maybe do to attain the privilege of making posts here. Iâ€™m really new here and not really fully aware of the modus operandi of the forum, and I also wish to tender an apology if I have already defaulted ignorantly by making posts without formally introducing myself here.",

Bitcoin is a decentralized finance so it is to the forum as well no one cares about real name, neither do they need your introduction it is just a thing of will, like if you feels like introducing yourself with just your forum nickname the is fine. Apart from that i don't think there is something else to than just keep follow rules and regulations.Â At the top of this Beginners & Help you would find something like that says \"Newbies - Read before posting\" will really help you to understand things across the forum, maybe it could reduces your tension toward here.",

Your thread and comments on other thread will do the introduction for you. Why did I say this is that,if as a new account,you create a topic to teach forum members what they can learn from,you have gained recognition, because the quality if your post will speak for you.

Unless the OP means a different thing, if I understood it correctly, it's referring to a proxy ban, which might be a result of the OP's location as of the time the account was created.
