  "content": "Most people here would have known my conclusion, that people should invest in bitcoin, because altcoins are dangerous, most especially the altcoins. But arguably to some altcoins users, they would say some altcoins can pump significantly and dump significantly and that some new projects are getting successful.I am referring to this not because I am interested, but because I saw it on a Nigeria news, the 5 Best Cryptos To Buy For 1000% Growth PotentialMany among us would have read the news. When I read the news, I noticed that digitoad is emphasized more about, I scrolled up back after checking the down part of the news to know if it is sponsor. Not surprisingly, it is a sponsored news.I checked many news sites which are not local news sites, I noticed that digitoad developers are really marketing the meme coin. Is this not another pump and dump scam? The project is getting successful as over $1.4 million has been used to buy the coins during presale and investors are still buying, but hope not another trap. In a pump and dump (scam) project, the project would be successful, but the developers and early investors that bought at low price sell almost all the coins and the price dump for the new investors to lose.My general advice: see altcoins as gambling, invest only the amount of money you can afford to lose, even if you can invest lesser than the amount of money you can afford to lose, it is better that way.",

      "body": "This is not the first time shitcoins will come with their propaganda, Digitoad is not an exception. The actors behind it must have carefully studied the prevailing market and are using marketing and influencers to propagate it.I've read a lot on the internet and news outlets about the coin, they are only playing their gimmicks to the novice in the game. For how long can this be sustained? I don't know. What I know is that investing my money in Digitoad is a big risk am not willing to take after my experience with coins and tokens.Don't be surprised that there are rich people behind the project, but they won't be able to sustain it for long.",

      "body": "If I could say something that any new crypto project or pay adverts of any new project does in other to gain popularity is one of the worst thing I would ever invest my money because I know it could be tragical ending after investing huge sum of money.Just take at what happened at Dogecoin promoted by Elon Musk, people rushed and invested some outrageous some of money without knowing it was just as setting a trap for the prey, and lastly they were being caught up and the coin dumped to what they couldn't believed from $0.8 to $0.09.",

Basically, dem go always hype all these altcoin. Dem go make you feel like say you dey lose out if you never join and as you join your money to 1000x. Dem go do better aggressive marketing and likely some of we influencers go even follow. Despite say e dey risky, you fit still cash out big time. So just ensure say you dey ready to bear the consequences if you lose your money.",

      "body": "Altcoins have no certainty but bitcoin is certain. So investing in altcoins is not really adviseable because you don't know what will happen tomorrow and must of these altcoins are from exchange platforms which the owner is well known and that is to sae dem dey centralized. The pump and dump process is used to lure uses of bitcoin to theirs or to use their coins as if they are legit while behind the scene they are opposite of what they are doing in physical.Â  It if anyone likes to take the risk let him be. Because it is an individual race.",
