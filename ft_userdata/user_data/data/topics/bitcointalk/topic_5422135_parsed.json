(Sorry, I have not read the whole article). This will actually cause a confusion towards the bettors. Whether who's telling the truth. But, if you're a fan of football and you always watch these guys play, you can easily notice if they're bribed.",

At the moment, it's just allegations, and there's no way that they've already proven this. It's a Qatar, so there's going to be all sorts of drama's over the next month. We already know what's happened prior to the event, which has obviously fuelled these allegations, and I suspect it won't be the last. I do think there needs to be a thorough investigation done to the people who died building the stadiums, that goes without saying. However, I'm not just going to believe allegations based on that.",

But as we know Qatar is very rich and also capable of doing it just to make their people believe in development of their football team and give them more opium. The person who published about that news is not very reliable and mostly doing it for fame and more followers. Xd maybe it’s a good chance to bet on Qatar winning and get some profits of it at least.",

I remember there was some controversies regarding their matches because the judges were very harsh towards their opponents. If they get hard evidence of bribes taken by Ecquador I expect both teams to be banned.

Judging by the odds being offered all over the place, it's possible that they might be inclined to give the hosts at least a draw, but it does really show how weak the home team are in this tournament. Qatar already got the first game of the tournament rescheduled to their own game, so these sort of sly tricks don't seem that farfetched either. It's a country that is swimming in oil money and one of the most anti-democratic governments you'll find, they are trying to buy prowess on the world stage and would no doubt pay bribes to secure what they think is a benefit.",
