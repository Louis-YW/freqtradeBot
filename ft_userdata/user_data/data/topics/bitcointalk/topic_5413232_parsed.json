You should know that an investor faces a number of risks, among which the most serious are:- The risk of hacking the wallet, as well as fraud, in which the user himself gives the code that gives access to his cryptocurrency. - The risk of sites where transactions are concluded, including technical failures, as well as deception of exchanges and brokers. - The risk of changing legislation, which can both prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies, and simply bring down quotes.I recommend studying additional information (there is a lot of it on the Internet) before investing serious amounts in cryptocurrency. There are also many experienced people on this forum who will be able to help you with valuable advice. You did the right thing by writing here",

Even more, investing in bitcoin makes sense only if you plan to leave your coins untouched for 3, 4 or even 5 years, at least. Of course, financial emergencies tend to occur when Bitcoin price is also far from great. So you have to have a good plan.Adding to this the risks the previous post wrote, it's not easy to invest into Bitcoin.Now... you wrote \"crypto\". Many Bitcoiners will say that you may want to invest in whatever altcoin. Altcoins are way more risky than Bitcoin and I don't have a good rule for them to see profit. In my experience altcoin investments are a losing scenario on long term. Maybe on short or medium term some got nice profits, but I don't recommend altcoins at all.So, altcoins are a no, and Bitcoin is also something that must be weighted carefully. Then you decide for yourself whether you should invest or not. Good luck!",

How can someone giving his own private key to other person is called as hacking? I don't think there's a wallet can be hacked because it's secured with cryptography and BIP39 that would make anyone really hard to guess the correct combination of 12 or 24 words.If you're talking about custodial wallet e.g. exchange, no one should hold their coins for long time using custodial wallet in the first place.",

Yes there are plenty of altcoins that arent safe but dont generalize it all. There are some also that are good and has potential. I agree that btc is good for long term but you cant ignore other projects that are also has good use case and potential. Its just that you need to be very careful cause some are really money scum bag only.",

Its just that you need to be very careful cause some are really money scum bag only. Sifting through to pick out good coins with potential out of a whole bunch is a huge task. There are thousands of altcoins with majority turning out not to be profitable in the long run. Sticking to BTC is a safer option, to taking a gamble with altcoins. This is my personal opinion.The comment above yours mentioned forms of diversification like real estate, gold, stocks, which are much preferable to altcoins if done right.- Jay -",

Frankly, no matter which way you slice it, there's no 100% safe way to invest money. The best investors in the world do it for a living, and they still make mistakes. So, the most important question is: how much money you can afford to lose? Do you have extra money that you don't need for daily living expenses? If so, it doesn't matter if you can afford $100 per month or $1,000 per month, start small, and increase that amount gradually over time. You have to evaluate your risk tolerance; for example, can you handle high-risk investments? What are your financial goals? When you know what you want to achieve, it is easier to choose your investments wisely. Once you have determined that you can handle the stress of investing (i.e., higher risk), then you should experiment with different strategies and instruments, and find out which ones work best for your goals.",

If you are planning to hold a big amount of Crypto or tokens for the long term the only safest way to hold them is to buy a hardware wallet like ledger nano. And take note like others said be careful if you buy a Crypto not all Crypto can be the same as Bitcoin most of the new Crypto are dying quickly only buy a Crypto which is already been here for a very long time and the top 20 coins on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. That's a good start for a newbie until you learn more about analyzing a coin/token. If the full money you talking about is all of your savings then I suggest don't risk them if you don't know well how Crypto works. Better do some research first before you going to invest little by little except by buying bitcoin holding them for the long term gives you a chance to make a profit in the future.",

Sometimes you see bullish today, there is no guarantee that bullish conditions can last the next day. For this reason, it is strongly discouraged to use borrowed money for crypto investments. Cold money or money that is ready to lose can make investors a little calmer, they can hold their assets in the long term if the coins they buy are in a bearish phase, this condition will not affect the psychology of investors, investors use money that is ready to lose.Quote from: NeuroticFish on September 12, 2022, 09:29:36 AMIn my experience with Bitcoin, while the price did recover sooner or later, there were long periods the price was low and the news were depressing; I expect many did sell in such times and if you are one of those getting easily scared by that you better not invest.

Of course, financial emergencies tend to occur when Bitcoin price is also far from great. So you have to have a good plan.For every investor, an investment objective is indispensable. After understanding the investment objectives, it will be very easy to determine the direction of investment. Investors can determine whether the investment plan is for protection against inflation, additional income, or wealth growth. Every investment must contain risks, but investors must know behind every risk there must be profit. Risk and profit go hand in hand, for this reason investors should remain calm even when the market is bearish.Before starting to invest, investors should have backup financial preparations, if the indicators of financial readiness have been met, investors can prepare steps to invest safely. However, if the financial condition has not met the readiness, you should focus on improving it so that it does not interfere with the assets that have been prepared for the long term.",

It's not 100% sure that crypto is safe in the long time and that's okay. Nothing can be said 100%. Everywhere there are risks and uncertainties. Crypto has always been considered a risky asset since its inception, against the backdrop of the stock market, for example. Trends change and assets that were considered safe can become risky over time. I recommend taking this into account. Especially if you plan to invest full money in crypto. I think this is not a reasonable decision and it is better to change \"full money\" to \"part of the money\". Which part, here I don't undertake to advise you and leave the decision to your conscience. Investing all the money in crypto is fraught with losses and troubles. If the market falls, as it is now, and you urgently need money, then there will be no other way out than to sell crypto at a loss. You were making these purchases for the opposite reasons, weren't you? This means that losses must be avoided at all costs. Or the market will sink even more and with free money, you can buy another crypto at a bargain price. In general, I consider the strategy of buying in parts with some time intervals to be the best.",

Remember Luna crash, Luna investors in high price become in the road. Even I heard there was a suicide attempt from Luna investors.
