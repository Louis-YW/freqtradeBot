Seeking guide for start these tasks.What kind of guidelines are you looking for, basically? It is not like every project has the same kind of bugs so that someone can let you know where to look for them. All you need to do is use their services and products and look for flaws and bugs in their systems and if you find something, you report it the way they have asked you to.You should get the pattern of how you can report a bug to get a bounty on the bug bounty page on their website or whitepaper or docs. You need to have a keen eye for detail in order to be able to find any bugs since they won't be easy ones and that is the reason why they give a bounty for finding them.",

Nowadays the project managers have gotten so greedy that even big bugs are only paid a pittance. I guess that is the reason why so many of them started stating giving rewards \"up to an x amount of money\" for a bug which they decide how significant it is. And the decision is always arbitrary but always on the low side.My guess is that there are too many third world programmers who have somewhat decent skills but are ok with accepting peanuts for their work.At some point the project CEOs might regret not paying larger rewards when they notice that the bug hunters become information sellers.",

However as the above mentioned, bug hunter bounty offers are flexible (mostly below expectations). You actually have to be smarter to anticipate rejection of reports, because it could be the developer patching vulnerabilities behind quickly to argue that your findings arent serious bugs.",
