      "body": "\"HA-ROO-WEEN CRAFT ART 2 in 1\"Material: WoodTools: Special tools for wood carvingType: Traditional CarvingMode 1:Halloween Candy BasketMode 2:Photo FrameDuration: 20 dayIt was quite difficult to make this \"Harooween\" work, because there is not only one use, but there are 2 uses that can be changed like Transformers. It can be a Halloween candy basket and Secondly, it can be a Photo Frame that can be displayed in the living room when the Halloween Trick or Treat party is over. It took a long time to work on this piece, because it has many different carvings, making each transformable wood part, as well as coloring and varnish coating.

The other three categories require drawing skills and yes I am very bad at drawing with imagination. The reason I stopped joining this contest is because we know digital arts have always had a higher chance than paint art. [I joined many times but did not win using paint art category]Now --with this category, it will change. Good to know the Roobet team noticed this which I think triggered my interest to join.",

Making something that you are not good at will only seem forced and the results will be unsatisfactory. I agree it's usually a good idea to stick to what you're good at in an art contest for better results. However, there are times when trying something new or different can also turn out well, even if it's not your usual talent.Taking creative risks can be rewarding.@Jayce Just look around, there's another casino website running an art contest. Give this contest to those who really in need. Hahaha just kidding.",
