  "content": "QuoteFood supplies are being rocked by Russia's invasion of the 'breadbasket of Europe'The world has just 10 weeks' worth of wheat stockpiled after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supplies from the \"breadbasket of Europe\".The UN has been warned that global wheat inventories have fallen to their lowest level since 2008 as food supplies are rocked by a “one-in-a-generation occurrence”.Official government estimates put world wheat inventories at 33pc of annual consumption, but stocks may have slumped to as low as 20pc, according to agricultural data firm Gro Intelligence. It estimates that there are only 10 weeks of global wheat supply left in stockpiles.Russia and Ukraine account for around a quarter of the world’s wheat exports and the West fears Mr Putin is trying to weaponise food supplies. Russia is on track for a strong wheat harvest this year, cementing Mr Putin’s control over the staple grain as bad weather spoils production in Europe and the US.Gro Intelligence chief executive Sara Menker warned global food supplies are being hit by a number of “extraordinary” challenges, including fertiliser shortages, climate disruptions and record low inventories of cooking oils and grains.She told the UN’s Security Council: “Without substantial immediate and aggressive coordinated global actions, we stand the risk of an extraordinary amount of both human suffering and economic damage.“This isn’t cyclical, this is seismic. It’s a once-in-a-generation occurrence that can dramatically reshape the geopolitical era.”The war has disrupted agricultural production in the region and sent global food prices soaring to a record high, stoking fears of unrest in developing countries. The crisis in wheat has been worsened by India, the world’s second largest producer, banning exports of the cereal and higher costs for farmers from fertiliser, feed and fuel.Western officials also fear the Russian president is deliberately trying to damage global food supplies by destroying equipment and stealing grain in Ukraine.Earlier this week, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned of “apocalyptic” food price rises as Ukraine struggles to export products.“Ukraine does have food in store but it can’t get it out at the moment,” he told MPs on the Treasury Committee.“That is a major worry. It is not just a major worry for this country, it is a major worry for the developing world.”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that Mr Putin is “using food as a weapon”.“The food supply for millions of Ukrainians and millions more around the world has quite literally been held hostage.”He added: “Some 20m tons of grain sit unused in Ukrainian silos as global food supply dwindle (and) prices skyrocket.”Meanwhile, the Kremlin is tightening its grip on wheat supplies after a stronger harvest. Carlos Mera, head of agri commodities research at Rabobank, said mild conditions in Russia – which accounts for about a fifth of global wheat exports – had put it on track to produce 84.9m metric tonnes of the staple grain this year.Conditions for Western growers have been poor due to dry conditions.America’s southern plains region, as the bottom of the \"Wheat Belt\" that runs through the middle of the country, has been experiencing sustained drought conditions.In a report earlier this month, the US Department of Agriculture forecast a major decline in wheat stocks, saying they will drop 6pc to a nine-year low of 16.8 million tonnes by the end of 2022/23.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/05/20/world-has-just-ten-weeks-worth-wheat-left-ukraine-war/....This may explain why russia launched missiles at odesa. To disrupt wheat exportation.I'm not certain what proportion of european diets are derived from wheat sources. This seems as if it might be bad news. We have had claims of \"apocalyptic\" food prices for awhile now. While naysayers claim it will not affect 1st world countries.If food growers adopted a crypto token which was backed by food commodities and guaranteed a static exchange rate for a set number of tomatos, potatos, per token.That could be a good format for future food emergencies.",

Yes, I don't mind not eating bread or pasta for a while, the problem is that the animals are fed with wheat feed, so the price of meat is going to go up more than we are noticing, although the rise so far has been largely due to the rise in energy prices.I think that at some point this will have to stabilise, because people have limited money, and if prices don't stop rising, in the end those who produce will not be able to sell because people won't be able to pay. We are now in a scenario of escalating prices that seems to have no end, but at some point it will come.",

Which next recourse will be on the brink of extinction?These are the unwanted fruits of globalization. Relations between different countries are so intricately intertwined that a local conflict can lead to disproportionate global consequences. And the global shortage of some important product by just a few percent can lead to a multiple explosive increase in prices in an industry that is highly dependent on this product in the production chain. So the threat of a shortage of wheat and sunflower oil can provoke a massive food crisis, and for example, a reduction in the supply of purified neon can cause a global crisis in the semiconductor industry. There is nothing to say about oil and gas.",

It is undeniable that some countries are heavily dependent on wheat imports from Ukraine and Russia, and that Russia is using the lever to blackmail the world to lift some sanctions, but developments suggest the US and other countries will not allow the blockade of Ukrainian ports to continue indefinitely.Ukraine has been asking for a long time, and it seems that the delivery of anti-ship missiles has finally been approved, which will mean a turning point in the war at sea. In the event that Ukraine receives such weapons, all Russian ships would be fully exposed and would have to withdraw or be destroyed. The only question is how long Russia will try to achieve some of its goals in this way, but it will certainly not last long - the unblocking of Black Sea ports will happen with the military defeat of the Black Sea Fleet or Russia's withdrawal before that.Quote from: https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-us-aims-arm-ukraine-with-advanced-anti-ship-missiles-fight-russian-2022-05-19/WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said, amid concerns more powerful weapons that could sink Russian warships would intensify the conflict. Bryan Clark, a naval expert at the Hudson Institute, said 12 to 24 anti-ship missiles like the Harpoon with ranges over 100 km would be enough to threaten Russian ships and could convince Moscow to lift the blockade. \"If Putin persists, Ukraine could take out the largest Russian ships, since they have nowhere to hide in the Black Sea,\" Clark said.",

The only thing that can realistically shift the balance is a NATO intervention in the Black Sea, which we know is never going to happen.What is going to happen is transportation of Ukrainian wheat via railroads.

Russia clearly would want to take the whole Ukrainian coastline if they could, hell - they want the whole of Ukraine right now but are paying a high price for this war. These are secondary effects of the war and are very unlikely to be the main reasoning behind it, especially with all the extra bad will that it brings Russia around the world as they are going to be the major cause of mass starvation. It'd make more sense for profiteering from oil and gas at high prices rather than causing disruption to food supplies. I've said it before, but Europeans are going to be among the last people badly effected by this scenario compared to most of the world, sure prices will rise but the remaining wheat will be sold it the countries that can pay the most for it and Europe is richer compared to most of the world.",

To disrupt wheat exportation.That's true, it is a calculated war strategy. This war was planned for years and food blockage is one of Putin's war strategy. Kremlin used the same war strategy in Aleppo, Syria when they assisted government forces to cut off over 300,000 Syrians from food supplies. The seizing of the coastal cities of Kherson, Mariupol and Odesa was an intentional act to cause world food crisis. This was why Putin was not scared about sanctions because he knew that food and energy blockage would force NATO and its allies to review their sanctions. Recently Moscow has said that sanctions on Russia would have to be reviewed  if it were to act on the UN appeal to open access to Ukraine’s Black Sea ports so that grain could be exported. But I am sure these inhuman strategies would not last for long because the world would gradually adjust to living without Russian supplies.",
