I thought Celsius was the safest bet in town after Binance !IMO, I believe that the problem we face today was started by Altcoins and it was Terra Luna after it was collapsed Terra Luna drag the entire market into a state of doubt and caused some serious concern from investors and now here we are again experiencing the same dilemma after the Celcius hold its withdrawal just to save its remaining asset, that caused an uproar from the affected users and investors too much negativity was happening around so I guess we must prepare for the worst because this is just a beginning.",

If you are still in profit with your holdings, I believe better think of getting out while you can. This can easily very well end up like Luna. They are showing some alarming warnings already and that twitter user is already giving out some scenarios. Now, think if those scenarios make sense to you. And act what you think is the appropriate thing to do. Some hints are already out there, but at the end of the day, it is you who can decide what to do with your portfolio.",

      "body": "Obviously they are facing a lack of liquidity. All of these platforms are very shaky and vulnerable, don't expect full and total security from crypto services. In times of market panics and mass sell-offs, even the most reliable systems often fail to cope with the challenges that are thrust upon them. That's why their security is only conditional, no matter how harsh it may sound.The problem with such platforms is that if people want to withdraw funds, the platform needs to give them back from their own pockets and it will be real cryptocurrency, not the synthetic one the platform has. And platforms do not want to cover the costs of the market situation at their own expense, so it is easier for them to limit participants' rights and temporarily block their money.",

Very little is known besides the fact they stopped withdrawls and swaps, are in serious debt issue (with only 1,5$ billion dollars on their wallets by days ago). The CEO doesn't appear on Twitter for days and all informations are coming from twitter and reddit's crypto enthusiasts. They must be acting on the backgrounds to overcome the loss and avoid a complete bankruptcy, but I don't think they are the reason why bitcoin is crashing. Bitcoin would lose value anyway these days, with or without Celsius troubles. Celsius is just suffering the consequences of bearish market and of their own mistakes by making risky moves on the market with investors' funds.",

It is absolutely no but rather to anticipate such possibility and even in Binance. In fact, leaving sums of money to the exchanges is not a great idea, we are only dealing with a huge risk that might blame ourselves and put in regrets. I'm not sure how they will address the issues by now since people are already in a panic thinking about Luna. But I hope this will be a different scenario and they proceed to an effective strategy to solve the problem otherwise, it is another exit scam story.",

We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations.Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority. In service of that commitment and to adhere to our risk management framework, we have activated a clause in our Terms of Use that will allow for this process to take place. Celsius has valuable assets and we are working diligently to meet our obligations.And from the looks of it, seems that they don't have assets so they pause the withdrawal and it sends a wrong signal to the community, hence the crypto market went down again very hard. Plus added that to the statement of the FED and the bleak economy of the US.As for question, yes, Celsius is in trouble right now, just another bubble waiting to get burst in the bear market.",

Let's see the latest update on their position.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on June 15, 2022, 02:48:45 AMUpdateAfter two rounds of deposit in WBTC, Celsius made another deposit in DAI that works $19M. It is another effort from Celsius team to lower liquidation price to $14,000.Do you think it is enough to save them? I don't believe so. If they have additional $200M to $400M to increase their collateral, they can be safe from this attack. I don't believe they have such money or be able to borrow such money from any entity.It seems there is a very bad ending waiting for Celsius. I know if Celsius liquidated, it will be another fiasco for crypto market.https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1536806455394897923If you have ever experienced margin trading and faced with liquidation, you will see that their position now is unsafe. Making additional deposits as efforts to protect your collateral, to avoid liquidation are something stupid, if the additional capital is not big enough.In this case, it's a damn hell unsafe in my view.",
