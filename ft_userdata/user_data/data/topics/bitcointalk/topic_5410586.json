      "body": "Every crypto professional started as a novice like you and the journey began with an effort by first taking steps. No one would help you more than yourself, so prepare to learn. Watching videos might be good but it is not the best, you might add to your learning and fun of crypto with videos only if you have had some understanding. And if we started furnishing you with websites, you might be so confused, more people might mislead you as well.At this point, you should let Google search be your friend and guide, you can search anything you want about Bitcoin and other altcoins. Try to use Google to know the following;1. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (how they come into play with blockchain technology, how to store and transact safely with them)2. Crypto wallets (custodial, non-custodial, open/close source etc.)3. Trading with crypto (buying and holding, spot, option and future trading among others)Being active on bitcointalk forum is an added advantage, and you might want to click https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2019/08/12/eleven-free-courses-to-learn-bitcoin-blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies/?sh=2eb0cf9450a7 for piles of educative sites.Hope this information helps you!",
