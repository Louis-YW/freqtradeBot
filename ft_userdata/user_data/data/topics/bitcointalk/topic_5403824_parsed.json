And what criteria do you use to invest in them?I do not think there are any such things as website or platforms to find new projects. I think it is best to follow relevant pages on twitter, telegraph and the crypto related news outlet to get a glismpe of new upcoming projects. And as an early investor, you need to conduct individual researches before joining token sale for new projects",

And what criteria do you use to invest in them?Hmm, not sure if there is a website that track any projects before they are launch. Usually though, those projects will just promote it on social media and that's where we heard about them before this huge websites starts to notice them and obviously, they will be listed on them with some good reviews (of course this is a paid reviews).Others have inside track, maybe they know someone from the inside or they are part of the team themselves.Are for the criteria this has been discussed already. But let me give you a few:- the team behind, do you have the experience?- the project itself, roadmap, what they can offer? whitepaper? it should be very well written- website, it is done professionally?",

My criteria if it must be backed by popular venture capital from the big exchange site. It caused by it will be listed into the major exchange site if it can be backed like alameda research, coinbase ventures or binance labs. This is a signal if the project potentially listed into the majkor exchange site.",

Well, I don't get into ICOs these days as they've been not that popular anymore for the past 4 years. But if you're still into it, just to the Announcements (Altcoins) and Tokens (Altcoins).Quote from: Kweek on June 23, 2022, 10:24:52 PMAnd what criteria do you use to invest in them?No criteria anymore as I don't invest on them anymore. Do people still invests on them? maybe a very few that still think that there's huge money on it but not anymore for the past years.",

I thought they were dead already.Anyway, you can find about completely new projects through this forum announcement thread, on reddit and other social media sites. Some googling might help you too. I am sure there are platforms that announces such upcoming projects. The only thing is that you will end up most likely investing in a shit or a scam project. Why take such risks while there are already well known casinos?",

And what criteria do you use to invest in them?I'm not sure if some people are still interested in ICOs and whether they will help them or not, but in my opinion, they are time-consuming and offer few attractive opportunities. In recent years, the market has changed a lot in terms of approaches to new projects such as IEO, IDO, NFT, testnet, staking, etc. Some of the old terms that I see are becoming less and less effective as they seem to be. As it is only momentary according to each trend, it is necessary to have an adaptive way to approach quickly. I don't think many people will share the same path, as I myself have realized that approaching new projects is not a top priority for action either. But I have some methods, like following top platforms like ETH, BNB, DOT, LINK, AVA, SOL,... to find opportunities. The ecosystem of these platforms is getting bigger and bigger, and the development to meet the needs is happening in line with the trend. And the simple way of looking at the team, product design, investment fund, roadmap, et cetera, are some of the criteria that I prioritize.",

As you all know a big and better project can not go up with traders help or investors money but if anybody search any project before launch they can make good amout of money. At present time 99% projects are scam so very difficult to know a project before launchpad.",

If you want to see the feasibility of investing in a project, it is better to study it yourself. Dig up the information through their social media, see their collaboration and backing projects, I think this is more valid",

Whenever i hear about a project that is interesting to me i just look up their website and take a look at all the available info and documents. I read the whitepaper and if it has only a few pages or has just generic stuff written in it then this is a already a red flag for me. I also take a look at the use-case of the project, the team, the roadmap and of course also the tokenomics and the vesting schedule.That being said, because of the bear market there are almost no new projects launching at the moment anyway.",

The ratings can be manipulated or faked (and even KYC can be loopholed like the case of Decentraworld exit scam even if its a priority project on the Kommunitas launchpad). Even the launchpads won’t help much in the KYC part too because these scammers are getting smarter than ever. We just have to do our own diligence and acknowledge  the risks before investing.",
