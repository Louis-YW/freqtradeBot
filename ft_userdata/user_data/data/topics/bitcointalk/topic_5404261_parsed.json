  "content": "Hackers have stolen $ 100 million worth of  cryptocurrency companies based in California in the latest big-money hacks in the digital currency industry.  An unidentified thief hits a \"bridge\" — a program that allows  cryptocurrency transfers — related company Harmony announced on Twitter Thursday night.  \"Harmony is working 24 hours a day as we continue to investigate with the FBI and several cybersecurity companies,\" said a company specializing in blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrency transactions. ..  Harmony joins the long list of crypto companies looted by hackers for  millions of dollars at a time. Hackers have stolen more than $ 1 billion from crypto bridges this year alone,  according to Elliptic, who tracks transactions on the blockchain. According to Elliptic, the  Cryptocurrency Bridge is a major target for hackers as it stores a large amount of liquidity.  It is unknown who plundered Harmony's digital cash register. The   FBI accused the North Korean government-backed hacker of hacking about $ 600 million in popular videos in April.",

I can show you the references: https://viralnewsmagazine.com/2022/06/24/hackers-steal-100-million-from-a-california-crypto-company/Other than that, I think this thread would rather be on an altcoin discussion board than a bitcoin discussion because this is a special case where one of the crypto companies (altcoin companies) was hacked. Hacking or theft is no longer surprising in the crypto world, so be careful as we never know who will actually be the target of future hacks.",
