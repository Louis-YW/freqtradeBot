      "body": "In terms of international law, it is not just justified, it is even required. Hamas, after all, is labeled as a terrorist organization. As far as this specific issue is concerned, I'm afraid opinions on whether this is right or wrong might highly be influenced by our individual leanings, prejudices, biases, and so on. But as far as the overall implication of this is concerned, it's dangerous. It's prone to abuse. In the first place, how are they linked to Hamas? Do they have solid bases or they're acting only on weak suspicions? I hope every single user who is affected by this action receives a detailed explanation on how his/her account is linked to a terrorist organization. Providing only general statements is unfair. Edit: After reading news related to this, I realized this is an old headline. While there are indeed recent freezing of accounts, this news about 190 accounts locked or seized by Israel is relatively old.[1] And it's not only Hamas that they're linked to but also Daesh and other terrorist groups. This kind of operation has been happening for years already. [1] https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/05/israel-has-seized-190-binance-accounts-with-alleged-terrorist-ties-since-2021-reuters/",

OP has his own \"DEX\" service.I think it is unethical to ask for certain opinions with these country's geopolitical situation currently heating up. And whatever the reason, decentralized services should also not support any form of terrorism.",

If tomorrow the Arctic is classified as a bad region, Binance will try to ban accounts here (even if they do not exist).",

Emphasis on innoncent people as I'm talking about false positives. and I don't think both the old and recent ban wave meet that.I believe big hacks and exit scams still have the strongest impact when it comes to enhancing the odds of making people look into dex or non-custodial alternatives because more regular users are typically impacted all at the same time hence more buzz. But ofc, I'm not gonna wish for hacks and exit scams to happen lol.",
