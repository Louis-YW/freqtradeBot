People need to consider that this impersonation exist and they need to do extra effort to make their self safe by researching the real companies or person that they want to deal so that they would not be scammed by those people who use this technique to scam people. Researching will not cost a lot of time so much better for newbies to exert some little efforts to locate those legit and directly send a message to them. They also need to remember that a legit corporation will not pm them first but rather you will be the one who would approach them. Since if someone will send you a private message then tag it as scam and avoid so that we will not fall on their scams.Being lazy will give us a huge benefit but rather it will just give us a headache and financial loss that's why to avoid it better if we could just do a research on everything we do since its important if we know how this people work so that we are away for any type of scamming.",

And I have seen some site clone directly like have a site inside another site. most time it's only developers that can understand the error. This scams occur regularly so it is a good idea to share with us to create awareness. in part of impersonation its a reoccurring event even on social media I see comedians being impersonated and the fake account even tend to be more real than the original, have more followers than that of the original comedian etc. We should just be more careful to find the original sites and accounts we are dealing with period.",

That's why we highly advise people not to always use Google search engines or social media search bots to search for an account or website that they are looking for, because they might not be able to differentiate the clone from the real and at the same time might fall victim to a phishing site by just making the mistake of clicking on the wrong link. It's always advisable for one to follow and bookmark the website and account they want to get legit information from; that's pages that they are sure are legit and that's gotten from the right source. It's always good to save and bookmark, as it reduces the chance of one getting scammed as a result of searching for a user account.",

In order to protect our assets, we should never believe the first moment anyone says anything if finance is involved. If the other person is in a hurry, then something is actually fishy. Rule of thumb. Not just phishing sites, they are also using spoofed emails. These emails look exactly like the original emails, with a minor difference. And there was no way to identify if it was real or fake the first time. A funny thing happened to me once. I used one of my emails on a crypto related site. Some days later, I got a message from an exchange saying that my account might be compromised and I had to change my credentials, even though I don't have any accounts on that exchange. lol...",

Did they link the wallet or did they ask users to enter the seeds because simply clicking on a phishing link is not enough to steal your money?Twitter has been used so many times to scam innocent people. Actually, many newbies are entering the crypto market as they are buying and want to gain profit from the upcoming bull run. To do that, they are trying everything and following everyone so that they can get and know more about any asset or incident.But what they don't want to do is put in their own manual work; they just want to join communities and follow others and don't want to do their own research. That's why they become a sitting duck for scammers and become victims of these scams.For example, many people lost funds when they connected their wallets to a website to claim NFTs that were posted on Viatlik's main account after being hacked by the hackers. We all should have one basic rule in our minds: never trust any link coming from Twitter, and to revoke access, we have to connect our wallet, and that's what all victims did because they do have some knowledge to not share seed phrases but don't have enough knowledge to check things out first.",

First it is easier to get a verified account now on X (formerly Twitter) because of the subscription service that Elon Musk is running now. Before only reputable individuals could get that verified accounts now scammers just buy the blue tick. The second thing is they gather more followers either by growing the account or by purchasing it. Then naive people will look at this number of followers and the blue tick and then start trusting the account. This one of the reason why buying accounts is frowned upon on this forum. We need to educate ourselves and others that large followers or adverts from celebrities shouldn’t be a yard stick to trust any information on social media.

At least this work we can do if we want to avoid such scams. What I will say is never connect your wallet to any site, if you intend to connect your wallet make sure it is not a wallet that holds funds, so when it back fire you don’t lose your funds. In fact you shouldn’t have a significant amount of funds on a wallet that is on device that is online.",

Since the advent of AI, there has also been a lot of impersonation in Youtube resulting in millions lost from this scammers and this is a very dangerous world that we live it.Quote from: Faisal2202 on November 16, 2023, 06:46:53 PMWe should double check everything before connecting our wallets I have learnt this thing that when you do things fast without confirming, without double checking, you become a victim.
