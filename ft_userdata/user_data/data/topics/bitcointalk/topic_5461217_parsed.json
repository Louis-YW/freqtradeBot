I had updated your image link and Qouted it So others can easily see what you are posting.I can't understand what are you trying to ask.. Â It is about Origin Protocol.. If it is then you should at least give some words on it so we can discuss this Project and its trading potential. EBcasue OGN was quite popular in its Airdrop days.Hmm After Watching the unclear photo haha now sure about you talking about OGN so, buddy currently its volume made a massive increase but the capital made a massive dump.",
