  "content": "Heya! I've managed to replace the faulty OLED screen today and I am happy to share this little update with everyone! This is also my first ever upload on Youtube. For those who don't know, this has been my issue after using the hardware wallet for a year as stated in my previous post[1].Replacement Process Video Link: https://youtu.be/hnJKEoBHZdYDifficulties I have encountered.- Personally, I find it difficult to remove the case. I didn't have any repair tools, so I just used an office cutter with an incredibly thin blade to make a small opening so I could completely separate it with a not-so-important card. Due to my incredibly amateurish work, I consequently created dents on the plastic case.- As you can see, I did not include the PCB assembly back into its case in the video because it took me about 1.5 hours of trial and error. The buttons aren't glued, and putting the PCB and LCD back into the case is insanely wonky. This is also, I believe, the most important part because you have to be very careful not to pinch or apply excessive pressure to the ICs soldered on the PCB, particularly the large IC in the middle.- DO NOT FORCE the PCB down into the case when assembling the parts because doing so could easily damage the two buttons that are embedded in the hardware. With a little practice and care, you can gently shoot the USB port into the casing hole without harming the components. Thereafter, the hardware would then simply reposition itself.The only difference I've noticed is that once the wallet is placed together properly, the metal clasp tends to loosen, making it extremely easy to rotate. Before, you could still feel how tight and rough the cover is when you played with it.Fortunately, I was able to replace the screen without a problem and with only minor damage to the casing. And so far, before writing this post, I've just finished resetting it, giving me an additional hardware wallet that I can use for other purposes.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5393971.0",

Nice work and good idea making a video about this!I am considering changing cracked front outer glass for one smartphone, but that is much more complicated work.I guess I could just replace whole screen, but this would cost me a lot of money, and certainly much more harder than it was for your Ledger screen  Quote from: Maus0728 on July 17, 2022, 02:42:02 PMPersonally, I find it difficult to remove the case.

Due to my incredibly amateurish work, I consequently created dents on the plastic case.You need to have set of plastic tools that are made for opening plastic parts with clips, you can find them easily online or locally and they can be used for multiple purposes.I have this and it was used for opening various stuff from laptops to opening plastic parts in my car.Quote from: Maus0728 on July 17, 2022, 02:42:02 PMThe only difference I've noticed is that once the wallet is placed together properly, the metal clasp tends to loosen, making it extremely easy to rotate. Before, you could still feel how tight and rough the cover is when you played with it.You could try pressing harder on metal part making distance between two metal edges smaller, that should make rotating a bit harder.I guess you could use it even without this metal, but more protection for both screen and weak plastic case.",

Too bad you didn't show how you reassembled the case back together after replacing the faulty display.  Quote from: hugeblack on July 18, 2022, 08:32:30 AMCan you compare the cost and shipping time (if you ordered it online) versus buying a new device? This is the display he purchased. 1 item costs $1.50. Depending on which shipping method you select and where you are in the world, it can increase the total price quite a bit. If you want it shipped to Europe, the cost is an additional $24 to $90. A new Nano S was €59 the last time I checked.Quote from: hugeblack on July 18, 2022, 08:32:30 AMI have some devices that need some repairs, but the delay in shipping speeds up the purchase of a new device as a better/fast option. You still have to buy and ship the replacement display, so you haven't solved the shipping delays by trying to fix it manually. Unless you can get those screens locally. Btw, have you tried contacting the HW manufacturers regarding those issues you have? Ledger might even replace them for free depending on what the problem is and even if they are out of warranty.",

Great job, Maus0728.This is true!

But that's no biggie, though.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 17, 2022, 07:32:36 PMI guess you could use it even without this metal, but more protection for both screen and weak plastic case.Yes,but I don't the like the looks of it being naked. The casing is transparent and, personally without the metal clasp, the looks isn't aesthetic  Quote from: hugeblack on July 18, 2022, 08:32:30 AMCan you compare the cost and shipping time (if you ordered it online) versus buying a new device?Purchasing the OLED screen overseas is a lot cheaper. As far as I can remember, I bought my Ledger during sale for about $50 while the OLED screen from Alibaba cost me for about $15 including the shipping fee. Yes, the shipping fee is more expensive than the product.As for shipping time, I waited for almost 2 weeks before the screen arrived at my doorstep while the Ledger, during the early days of pandemic took me for almost 1 month of waiting time.Quote from: Pmalek on July 18, 2022, 08:51:31 AMNice work. Too bad you didn't show how you reassembled the case back together after replacing the faulty display.  Actually I've tried, but I stopped when I realized that It took me 1.5 hrs just to re-assemble the hardware. Personally, this is the most difficult part than disassembling it.",

The main thing is that the display was replaced and the device is now working fine.If you would be part of the marketing team if ledger you would call it a feature, since now you can easily see that somebody tampered wirbt the wallet,. This provides a little bit of security, even if at the same time I think it is unlikely that somebody places something in your device and not just steals it.",
