  "content": "After the pandemic, almost every Crypto casino has gained a lot of user base. As they have offered an alternative way to engage in online gambling. However, I wonder if they have been able to churn customers who are used to traditional online fiat casinos. As per my understanding, crypto casinos have offered benefits that some fiat-based casinos cannot match. Another reason is cryptocurrency provides faster transactions and a level of privacy. Thinking about the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency globally. I think a lot of crypto casinos are still churning existing users of other crypto casinos. Some of these features can be appealing. If a user is looking for a more seamless and secure gambling experience. Whereas as per my understanding, not all players are comfortable using cryptocurrency. One reason, that I could think about is that cryptocurrency is still a relatively new technology & it might be the primary reason some players are hesitant to try them out. Another reason is strict regulations on Crypto Casinos. That is one of the primary reasons why I think churning of fiat casinos user is not able to attract new users and retain old customers.There are many more issues that I believe have hampered the churning of a traditional user to a crypto gambler. But the number one issue as per my research is individual preferences and circumstances.I think most crypto casinos are still churning out existing customers. I also believe that it is not that easy to get a traditional online gambling user to change their habit. What do you think?",

You can go to an ATM in a physical casino and take out to your daily limit, but move $50 to Caesars online through ACH and you get an account hold...-Dave",

If they see somethings about crypto gambling site better than fiat, like fast deposit and withdrawal, they may turn to crypto gambling sites. When I was accessing bet365, the withdraw of money take me more than 2 weeks, while crypto casinos take just within some minutes.",

I'd rather be on the safe side of things rather than risking it on an unregulated environment. If fiat casinos still works and just not that too much of a hassle, I'd pick that one too. Furthermore, I think adoption on crypto casinos are way more growing considering it's a new market.",

Many customers do not like to go through detailed KYC procedure that is mandatory in fiat based casinos. Also a lot of people do not want to reveal their gambling habits to their banks and credit card providers. Crypto casinos provided a way out of those procedures which helped their business to grow even after the pandemic time. Hope this trend continues.",

With the current aggressive marketing that some crypto casinos are still currently doing I still think they'll continue to convert more users in the future.Then again there are crypto casinos that allow you to play with a fiat balance despite using crypto to deposit and withdraw so now it's becoming more easy for fiat gamblers to switch and try out crypto casinos.",

Those gamblers which could be encouraged to be involved in this industry are more likely those who have restrictions of this activity on their country and those who wants to avoid taxes because of their huge bets. However, those who won't be persuaded are more likely the ones who plays it safe; using fiat would atleast save them from the chance of losing to both market price volatility of cryptocurrencies and losing to the game itself, like a double bet. But in reality, a player could engage to either land based or online platforms as long as he would be allowed by accessibility so there's really no need to convince players; for sure they know how risk works.",

You don't need to rely on your bank and how it feels about you transferring money to or from a casino; you can often remain anonymous; you can place bets directly in cryptos, thus actually using cryptos without selling them. Maybe some prefer fiat online casinos because they don't really use cryptos and don't want to get into knowing how to use them. Another thing might be that people feel online casinos are more official, more legit. Which isn't always the case, of course, as many crypto casinos have official licences and everything, but this line of thought can be a result of a general misconception that cryptos are used for shady purposes.",

It's hard for someone to leave it if it's started. If someone has never done it, it would be better not to try. When we gamble, we hope for a great fortune. If we gamble, for the first time the habit wins. Furthermore, if every $100 deposit will fail, we will continue to make deposits, it will make our emotions increase. Even if we have spent $ 1000, and when we win $ 500, then we will forget about the previous failure.I am a game lover, and almost all the games I know I will play, whether they are money-making or not. So I understand very well about the game. Now the slot games got me hooked. lol",

So before we talk about traditional gamblers who use fiat will switch to gambling using crypto, their trust in crypto itself must be formed first. It's like 2 sides that can't be separated, I'm sure at first most gamblers who use ccrypto now are also gamblers who used fiat before.

It makes ultimate sense really, because they are coming under a lot of pressure to perform KYC processes on their users now and not having KYC was one of the primary distinguishing factors for these companies to stick with cryptocurrency for so long. They will likely start hooking up with mainstream payment processors to facilitate these transactions more easily and we do see a few of them already advertising in big venues like sponsoring major football teams - so they've already got huge credibility in that department.",
