I hold Quant but I donâ€™t see or hear many others involved with it so just wondering if anyone else is bullish on it too? I know supply isn't everything but with only 14million it is less than Bitcoin so very scarce I am just hoping it does really well in the coming bull run. If someone could breakdown the above link also and why this is great news for Quant?",

It has been pumping so hard from bottom to the current rate with very small supply at this moment and i think quant will able to go back to the ATH again as long as bitcoin will break new ATH. Rosalid project was a new project between quant with some important entities in england. That's why it was triggering a pump right now. https://twitter.com/quant_network/status/1669653300671553536That's pretty interesting to see the outcome from this project.",
