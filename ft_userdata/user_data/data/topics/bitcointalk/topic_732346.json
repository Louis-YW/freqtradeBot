Eventually when the price is more stable these companies will start to figure that they may as well hold some eventually they may end up holding all, Overstock already holds 10% possibly even more now.And If MANY shops start to accept it. Food, Electronics, Auto industry, Bills (Water, Gas, electricity), Fuel , telephone etc...Eventually they will realise well the price is stable, Millions of merchants are now accepting it & price is slowly on the creep up... this currency is Finite and deflationary.. it will make sense to start keeping 20/30/40/50% or maybe even more... At the end of the day since so many merchants are accepting we can even use it like normal dollars and pay our bills with it or buy stock with it ETCI think we should stop worrying about what companies do with the BTC after we purchase in the long term this is helping this industry and Bitcoin, you can believe that!",

I like the idea of this wonderful currency a lot and I want to spread it even further! I think it is very important to do this! It is true that most companies may sell the BTC directly via BitPay or some other payment processor, yet, there are most likely big whales who buy those BTC instantly, because they're supposed to have contracts with those payment processors, as far as I know. So there's not much pressure on the markets (maybe only a slightly more limited demand)",

I can only think of maybe one reason: If you only hold your coins and never spend them, it doesn't even matter how high the BTC price gets, you'll never realize your gains and never profit from the increased price. It doesn't even matter whether you buy something with your coins or just plain and simple sell them, but you need to use them in order to profit from the increased value!",
