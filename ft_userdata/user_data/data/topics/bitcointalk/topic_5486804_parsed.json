But dude operated a website allowing very illegal activities. His guilt was pretty damn cut and dry. It's not like he was just running a legal marketplace and people secretly used his website for illegal stuff. He knowingly built it for that illegal things.As to that being an unpopular opinion...anyone thinking that either doesn't think we should have laws or is so blinded by bitcoin that they can't see straight when talking about anything related to Bitcoin. Criminals who use Bitcoin to do criminal things are still criminals, obviously.",
