Although the concept is still too new to attract mass adoption, it is undeniable that NFT will experience a surge in popularity in the years to come.,If we look at population growth and there is regulatory support for the discourse, this is a promising development for China itself. I think the future will likely bring more clarity to this issue as well as continued innovation of blockchain applications in finance.",

They can change their statement whenever they wish to. China is the first country which banned ICO platforms. They had launched crackdown on crypto miners. They have taken multiple steps to curb the usage of cryptocurrency in their economy. So I just can't digest this statement. Do you have a link from a chinese website? Even though it doesn't hold much value but still that will be good for reference.",

Afaik they don't hate cryptocurrency exactly, so them trying to integrate NFT's and Crypto would mean that they're probably planning on doing something to the ecosystem they'd use so that it'd stay firmly under their control. Though I'm more interested in how said integration is actually going to work though and if it actually has any uses aside from, well, being looked at.",

So it is right to be careful and skeptical about China moves because they may have ulterior motives. On the other hand, China government may have reviewed its stand on cryptocurrency an may have discovered ways it could be beneficial to the government. IMO the news should be viewed with mixed feelings for now and needs more time before confirming that the government have good motives towards cryptocurrency.",
