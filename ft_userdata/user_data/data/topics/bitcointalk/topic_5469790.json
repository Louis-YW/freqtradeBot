If interested - just shoot me a dm.",

He was a French guy, but was a total asshole drunk who got kicked/booted out of the original slack collectibles channel back in 2018 for some kinda weird ass shit he pulled I can't quite recall, but yeah, he was basically exiled away after that and thankfully has not returned. I think he may have used some alts here and there too back then to bid up his own auctions, but his way of typing/writing style was pretty easy to spot, maybe he did not know about google translate lol IDK.  Anyhow, I always call these the \"Oatmeal Coins\" since I cannot say the weird pronunciation he gave them hahaha!  Thanks for the funny memories, I had forgotten all about Defcon till this post!",
