Plus, it makes the phone unnecessarily more expensive for people not needing that feature, hence not good for business.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on January 07, 2023, 12:32:01 PMAnd if someone stole the phone, they still have to unlock it with possibly a passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, and any other walls of security such as passwords to open apps.I’ll have plenty of time to restore a wallet real quick I guess while the monkey whole stole my phone tries to get inside it.Unless that monkey also steals you (or a picture of you) or your finger, or the last items you've had your fingerprints on.No. Phone security is weak and \"the monkey\" may move your money out before you even notice the phone is missing.----And about your initial question, I think hat Samsung had ideas in that direction, but a quick search has only revealed this topic (2021) and this one (2019) on the matter.",

As is usually the case with devices that try to combine the functions of many others, the quality of the functionality turns out to be worse. That is, the phone can have a hardware wallet function, but the level of protection will be much lower, and the risk of losing it also increases, since you always and everywhere carry the phone with you in everyday life. This is not suitable for large sums, because you don't carry all your savings with you and is only acceptable for pocket money, the loss of which you can afford. It is better not to combine the hardware wallet with the phone and keep it in a safe place. Moreover, you will rarely use HW anyway.We'll have to choose between security and reliability between convenience and mobility.",

If I read it correctly, this won't be an exclusive technology for some manufacturers, so I won't be surprised if there will be more apps that support it in the future. The point is, it is not gonna be hardware or software exclusive, so I'd rather wait and just use any Android phone with open-source apps to manage my crypto right now if necessary.Most of these hacks are done via phishing or social engineering anyway. A secure device won't help you at all if you just give your password to whoever asks you. CMIIW.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on January 08, 2023, 06:07:15 AMAlso, the question \"why cram so much into the phone\", has been asked so many times for the last 20 years. Humanity doesn't seem to care, and seems to constantly deviate towards innovation when it comes to smartphones.You can certainly add more features, but it also adds more attack vectors. It might work, but it will always be riskier to use compared to a dedicated device that is designed to cater to specific needs IMO. Don't know how balanced it will be but I personally don't want to risk security for extra mobility. I never bring my HW outside of my house or when I travel anyway. If I lose it that will be a disaster.",

Even if there was something like that, why would you opt to use that instead of a standalone device that you only connect to when you need it to sign transactions and move your crypto? A phone that you use for all kinds of activities shouldn't be used as a storage for your private keys and seeds. Too many things could go wrong despite what the manufacturers say. Many people simply use their phones as a testing ground for games and dubious apps. They allow permissions and give apps rights without considering what it means. That's not an environment for your digital assets and their signing keys.Quote from: Charles-Tim on January 07, 2023, 02:21:38 PMTo discourage that kind of habit, it is best to remove the WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC and other components that can be used to connect to other devices and to the internet. I doubt you will have much success trying that. Those components are surely all soldered to the main board, and unless you know what you are doing and have an engineering background, you are more than likely to destroy your phone. All the antennas and chips can be disabled on the software side, but who knows who and what can turn them on again if required to.  Quote from: dkbit98 on January 07, 2023, 10:32:33 PMPassport started as ColdCard fork but with open source software and hardware, with added improvements and much better look.

ColdCard used some parts of Trezor code few years ago, and even if NVK keeps making excuses about it I posted proof of Trezor developer confirming this.When Passport foundation hardware wallet was released they initially used original ColdCard code that was modified, after that NVK from ColdCard decided to change code from open source to common clause.

I have already known about ColdCard's use of Trezor's open-source code to build their own product, but I thought they started off with a Common Clause license despite of that. Seems like they don't want to give their competitors a helping hand in any way, even by providing open-source code. It's cold blooded business but also scumbag behavior.",
