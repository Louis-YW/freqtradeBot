  "content": "We have so many exchanges hacked in the past, it happens all years, this is just to notify people again that they should never leave their coins on exchanges. I do not know if this only applies to exchanges in United States, but exchange are not a place to leave your bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies that you have, better send them all to your noncustodial wallet that you have control over your coins. Read this news:Deposits at non-bank entities, including crypto firms, are not insured — FDICIt is as simple as this quote which I quoted from the news:QuoteThe United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, has issued an advisory informing the public it “does not insure assets issued by non-bank entities, such as crypto companies.”Do not leave your coins on exchanges and always remember that if not your key, it is not your coin.",

Consumer-oriented banks and Credit Unions are *not* required to be insured -- but of course for obvious reasons most do sign on to FDIC insurance. Even at current BTC value in USD it's not that hard to be HODLing coin worth more than that.That said of course the Best Practice is to keep the majority of ones coins in a safe custodial cold wallet and only have 'playin' around money' on an non-custodial exchange.",

Without these backups, you no longer own your Coins.  Bitcoin non-custodial exchange is not widely used or does it seem they stop developing BTC DEX exchange?I mostly see DEX exchanges in ERC20 and BSC networks but no one has yet developed an exchange where you can import a private key and start to exchange. There is Dex Binance before but it seems it's gone.

But centralized wallets gives you to a large extent a larger options and flexibility to use your Bitcoin as you will.   That's not really a serious problem. Since Bitcoin transaction fees are already manageable, you can send BTC to exchanges for trading at 1 sats per vbyte (less than $1). You can withdraw and store them on hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger because they support multiple blockchains. I've read that you can also connect these HW to some Dapps but I'm not familiar with that.Non-custodial wallets with swap features are also available.",

Private keys are called private for a reason. It should only be known by who owns the funds. However, just to react to FDIC's advise, this agency isn't part of the game. In a way, it is irrelevant in the space. Yes, crypto companies don't have FDIC's insurance, but does it matter? Of course, their assets aren't FDIC-insured because FDIC is a fiat agency and that it doesn't support non-bank entities. But it doesn't necessary follow that since a crypto-company isn't FDIC-supported it cannot create its own insurance system. The likes of Coinbase, FTX, Binance, and others are not FDIC-supported but they have their own insurance.",

But people who trade on a daily basis cannot afford to withdraw every day precisely because of the service fee that demotivates them, so they have to live with the risk.Some will say that CEX should start using LN, others that they should use alternative cryptocurrencies and tokens, but the average user is, after all, just a trader who believes that nothing bad will happen to him and, to be honest, does not want to take responsibility for be your own bank. If we look at history and the case of Mt.Gox and Bitfinex, and then later QuadrigaCX and many other smaller incidents, you would think that this would affect the general perception of every investor, but people have obviously brought short-term memory to perfection.Those who do not learn from history risk having the same things happen to them, but this is obviously a risk they are willing to accept.",

But then one needs to leave with the task of trying to balance every equation with the mindset of risk management, for example, a passive trader can not do without exchange and even. Though the security commission does not license the operation of cryptocurrency exchange so there is no risk management and protection for cryptocurrency exchange users thereby making it easy for exchange users to get justice in case of a hack or stolen assets, this has been the major set back for exchanges so most cryptocurrency holders prefer to hold their Bitcoin and another asset in a cold wallet and having the private keys saved. In that way, there is no way possible for them to lose the coins unless they reveal the private keys to third parties. It",

Because the fact is, once you give others the right to your coins, your coins will not be safe anymore. Who knows if they will start taking advantage of your coins since you don’t have the full control on it. It’s better to keep them on yourself guarded all the time and also, never store them online.Even if the exchange is not centralized it's still not safe from the hacker thus, it's easy to take your Bitcoin since you are not the one holding your keys. Everyone should know that having a control of your own keys means having a full control of your Bitcoin and wallet so one can take your Bitcoin no matter what happens as long as you never showed your keys someone. And I agree that putting/saving your keys online like emails and other platform where hackers can easily have access online is not safe, thus, never store them online.",
