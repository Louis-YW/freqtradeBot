Susundan natin ang landas ng \"matuto, mag-optimize at lumampas.\" Mayroong maraming mga segment sa GameFi. Ang TCG ay isang uri ng turn-based strategy (TBS) na laro,  with moderate requirements for blockchain infrastructure and relatively low difficulty for development.. Sa pamamagitan ng tatlong taon ng walang tigil na pagsusumikap, humarap sa hindi mabilang na kabiguan at tagumpay, ang axie infinity sa wakas ay nakarating sa tuktok, na nagpapakita sa amin ng pagiging posible at walang limitasyong scalability sa larangang ito. Ang Axie Infinity ay isang pioneer at huwaran para sa amin. Sa pamamagitan ng maraming pananaliksik at pagsusuri, we believe that its success is highly replicable with the large room for optimization.",

      "body": "Quote from: Einnor14 on May 30, 2022, 06:11:42 AMthe mecha infinity is still in the process and development. YES, mecha infinity has similarities sa ibang games lalo na sa axle infinity, but mecha infinity is not yet been released to judge what would be the outcome if you are following all social media and been active on our discord, you will know the benefits of the game in the future like the P2C ( PLAY TO CHARITY ) only mecha infinity has these features na kung saan you can play and help other people as well.Nasabi namin na may mga similarities ang Axie Infinity at Mecha Infinity since yun naman talaga ang totoo. Same features sila both.Ngayon sinabi mong hindi pa nirerelease ang laro kaya marami dito ang naghihintay kung anong pinagkaiba ng Mecha Infinity sa mga ibang NFT games. Gaya ng sinabi ko sa una, curious ako kung paano nyo mababalanse ung sinabi niyo .P2C? Bagong concept yes pero tanong ko lang, if maglalaro ako for example ng Axie Infinity at nagdecide ako na i-donate ko ung SLP na naipon ko sa charity, di ba magkaparehas lang din un since \"I played to donate my earnings to the charity?\" Maghihintay kami ng iba pang benefits sa laro ninyo (if meron man). Titignan ng mga investors kung anong pinagkaiba ng laro nyo sa mga lumalabas na NFT games ngayon.",
