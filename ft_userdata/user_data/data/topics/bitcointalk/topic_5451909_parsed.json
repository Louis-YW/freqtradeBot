You can see Stompix explanation about how Binance still make money because they send to many addresses at a time, but Binance has to consolidate inputs too though.That is a pretty high fee it's around $30 they are making profits on transaction fees even though they own a mining pool they do still ask for high fees which are unfair. It is more likely they forcing people to use other networks including their own network to keep them active and currently, there is no lightning yet under the network option when withdrawing BTC. Meaning it is not yet enabled I can only see 3 options Bitcoin, BEP20, and ERC20.",

Its not a surprise though because they make nice amount of money via withdrawal fees and that's something that they won't give up easily.

      "body": "Well, at least there's a silver lining in this Ordinals fiasco. Thanks to it, the fees are growing exorbitant more than ever, pushing for centralized exchanges to finally support the Lightning network. In turn, when these centralized exchanges open up for Lightning deposits and withdrawals, they are also encouraging users to make use of the Lightning network. And when there are a number of users who are already into LN, surely wallets will also start integrating LN. This significantly drives up LN adoption. However, I hope this doesn't mean that people would be satisfied and treat the high fees as a normal thing. Nothing beats on-chain transactions, after all.",

Then they have to do their math very good and see how it's cheaper for them to rebalance/replenish their LN node to keep processing withdrawals. And one solution for that could be allowing the LN deposits (now I don't know how unbalanced is their deposits vs withdrawals ratio and that matters a lot in this).Quote from: yhiaali3 on May 09, 2023, 04:32:16 PMYesterday I paid about 8$ to transfer 100$ BTC from my wallet (previously I used to pay around 1$), this is happening for the first time knowing that I lowered the fee to the minimum when it would have cost about 30$ on the higher rate!! This is madness!!So you have a \"good\" history of overpaying for your transactions. This doesn't mean you should underpay exactly now, but it may worth taking a look at mempool.space now and then and also learn more about how the fees work. Maybe also make sure you use a good wallet.Quote from: KingsDen on May 09, 2023, 07:57:03 PMIt is not only Binance, a couple of other exchanges have paused bitcoin withdrawal and trying to implement the Lightening Network.Keep in mind that any reason to pause withdrawals can be in exchanges' favor (the money is in their pocket and they can use it if they want to).And keep in mind that since the exchanges don't like to see their transactions stuck for long, such a pause may only allow them change the fixed fee they use or improve their code for a dynamic fee that works for them.Quote from: KingsDen on May 09, 2023, 07:57:03 PMBecause of this challenge, many people will start using LN and many people will begin run nodes or atleast for routing.It's not that easy. People will have to open a channel (i.e. on-chain transaction) or send coins to a custodian that has also LN capabilities (i.e. again on-chain tx, unless they first receive a withdrawal). Plus learn about a new wallet.I do still expect quite some inertia in this.Quote from: BitMaxz on May 08, 2023, 03:25:18 PMMeaning it is not yet enabled I can only see 3 options Bitcoin, BEP20, and ERC20.Of course that they (still) prefer people withdraw wrapped bitcoin (especially on their chain) instead of the real deal.",

They charge me 0.001BTC, up to $28 to withdraw Bitcoins while in reality I have to pay max 0.000155 BTC, let's say max 5$ per transaction to get it immediately confirmed. And Binance not only charges you enormous fees from absolutely every trade, they charge enormous fees for btc transactions but here they have the deal, if you hold BNB, your trading fees will go down and if you withdraw BEP format BTC, then you'll have to pat $0.01 in transaction. This clearly indicated their real motives in this business.But it will be good if they integrate lighting network, at least they should really do something beneficial since 2017. But fees are going down right now and they just increased the withdrawal fee instead of having a flexible one, they are milking cash but they pretend they are learning from mistakes.",

As I said earlier, any problem pushes to look for solutions. Binance demonstrated this. Even though the problem of high transactions didn't arise not because of them, but it still cast some shadow on their reputation, even with temporary suspensions on bitcoin withdrawal from the exchanger. The user is not interested in the sources of the problem. The user wants good service, but if bitcoin withdrawl is delayed or suspended, then the user is left unhappy. To prevent this, Binance started working on the introduction of Lightning Netwok.Bitcoin withdrawal from Binance required a rather high commission even in calm times. With the introduction of Lightning Netwok, the commission will have to be very small amounts. This will benefit the users. Let's see what the result will be.It will be good if other companies also begin to develop towards the introduction of Lightning Netwok. No one wants to lose their customers and most likely will.",
