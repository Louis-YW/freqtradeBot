I keep buying gradually. and also be prepared if the decline continues by installing a buying net at several spot or support points. continuing to collect makes me calmer. although panic sometimes always comes when there is a long decline and even I panic when there is a rapid increase. because I'm not used to it. So to anticipate panic I prefer to enter little by little in this ETH coin.",

Ethereum maybe have reached the bottom when it was being traded below 1k but yeah this time ethereum is still undervalued and oversold. You shall try to spread your order and waiting for the bottom is not the best way as sometimes you can miss the best rate to buy ethereum. I have bought ethereum when the price already down even lower than 1k and i got decent return in a week. Im sure that recovery can happen anytime. Buying at the bottom has become the best opportunity for anytone. WIll you try to miss this golden chance to get cheap ethereum from the market?",

Yes definitely. Crypto winters let these gas gee back down a little but thats because many havent using the network unlike the bear market. But surely it will go up once this bear situation gone. Every other L1 also got lowered transaction fees and thats mean a decrease in usage or users. Bull market will take time but as it recovered slowly the fee will increase likely directly proportional to the market movement.",

I see Ethereum as the 2nd best long term coin to hold aside from Bitcoin so I think anytime would be a good time to buy Ethereum. Well, it's better if investors will buy now that we are in a crypto winter or bear market or whatever people may call to it.There are no changes or updates in Ethereum for a long time that affects it's gas fee aside from the EIP1559. Ethereum 2.0 might reduce it's gas fees by a little but we might still experience some high gas fees overtime in the future. Gas fees will soar up again for sure as many investors will come back again and invest. Many new projects will come again and develop under different smart contract platforms and that includes Ethereum.",

You mean to invest? of course, good time to get in as the price is very cheap. But I think it will still go down lower next year, so the best thing to do is DCA and then see how it goes.However, it's correlated, when the price goes low during bear market = low fees. Just like in bitcoin right now, you can literally transfer in even less than a dollar right as transaction fees and easily received it very quickly. But I guess the important thing is how to take advantage of this cheap price and fees and invest.",

Personally, I also buy some coins when bitcoin falls below 18k, and I will hold on to those even though I'm now profitable. As of now, I just aim to hold as much as possible. I mostly buy on centralized exchanges and transfer to my hard wallet, so I am not concerned with the ETH fees at all. As long as the price drops I will place a buy order.",
