It is an asset of value and its value has reach politics which is normal. \"Adoption\" means something entirely different today than it did a few years ago--people are buying it because line-always-goes-up or are using it as a day-trading instrument.  That word used to mean that merchants were accepting it as payment for goods & services, and I haven't heard much about that in a long time.  That's not to say that bitcoin isn't a good investment asset or that I'm disappointed that most online merchants don't accept it.  I've always thought it was a lousy form of money.  As to OP's question, I'd have to say that I'm less enthusiastic about bitcoin than I was maybe two years ago, but honestly I might be conflating bitcoin and bitcointalk.  The latter used to be almost addictive to me, but nowadays I can't even tell if AI programs are cranking out all of these insipid thread topics....but I digress.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 30, 2024, 12:23:20 PMIf people vote for Trump, bitcoin will become more relevant in the world. That's iffy.  As I've said, I wouldn't trust anything a politician says when they're in the process of running for election.  And when that person happens to be Donald Trump, well.  But if he does win, maybe those government alphabet agencies might become more bitcoin-friendly, who knows?  All I know is that this is going to be one hell of an election cycle; the country is probably going to end up being even more divided than it already is.  Again, I digress!",

So for this year's bull run, a conservative estimates of 6 digits is along the ways.And there will be no time in Bitcoin market that we are not excited about, even in bear market, because it's the right time to invest as the price is really very low and we look forward on how big our profits is in the future. And there will always be newbies in the market, so there's always this anticipation, and imagine the joy that it can bring to them when the market hits new all time high at $100k++.",

You yourself answered your own question, Trump or some world leaders are just starting to pay attention to it. That means things are just getting started, there is still a lot of bitcoin's potential for us to exploit. To be honest, I find this question a bit redundant. I don't see any reason to stop now, those who think it's no longer attractive and are no longer interested in it are the ones who have lost money or can't take advantage of it to make a profit. But for those who take the long view and look at the bigger picture, the bitcoin revolution has just begun.",

He can choose to be on the right side or left side of Bitcoin growth history.Bitcoin will continue to grow, next four years and more than that, with or without Trump's support. If Trump becomes a next President, and support Bitcoin has he promises, he will be recognized and recorded in Bitcoin growth and adoption history. The bottom line is Bitcoin does not need Trump as a mandatory condition to move to future.",

Nobody can predict how high the price will grow but there are speculations that it will get to $100k in this bull run. The next four years might also move the price to another height. The recent use of Bitcoin for political campaigns in the US has brought a new dimension to the to the industry. It shows that Bitcoin is now a major player in the global financial system. This current political acceptance might move to other countries which will promote the use of Bitcoin. However, there is a need to be cautious when dealing with politicians because they will always drive the industry towards centralization.",

I believe the invention of Bitcoin was a revolutionary idea to solve the limitations of the centralized system such as the boundaries between currencies in the international market and the dollarization of the world as well as total control of government over the financial system which people are meant to enjoy a reasonable degree of independence from it.Such inventions are monumental and are tailored towards solving long-term financial limitations faced by individuals and people at large. A lot of people are still discovering the technologies and new initiatives are built from it. Thinking that Bitcoin will attain its pinnacle now is not something I will come into terms with as far as my knowledge is concerned.",

      "body": "I'll admit, I've lost the romance.Quick story: I got into crypto trying to launch my own VPN platform and dealing with MBAs and VC's that wanted me to price gouge my users. When cost per user was ~$3/mo everyone wanted my data and for me to compete on price with $100/yr plans.The only way to not be surrounded by these vultures in 2019-2020 was to pivot to a non-profit model, but I wanted to leverage a DAO to guarantee my users \"ownership\" and leverage wallets as identities to protect my users.This sent me down the crypto rabbit hole and while I understood what BTC was back then, the lack of scalability, volatility, and no smart contracts prevented me from even considering it. After about 3 years in the ETH ecosystem I realized it's been co-opted by banks (ETH -> fragmented DeFi -> stablecoins -> banks). I also realized Proof of Stake is really just an oligarchy of validators as well and definitely not the future for a sovereign community of anons.So I dug deeper into blockchain technology and decided PoW was the only thing that could maintain it's social contract with users. Unfortunately, I've yet to find a chain that scales, supports smart contracts, and isn't sold on the idea of L2's as a model for scaling.The BTC community seems to be the worst. 90% of the active threads here is all about gambling (it's been >10 years, there's other use cases people) and anyone trying to have a conversation about updating this \"protocol\" is viciously attacked online. We love lightning network, but it's mostly custodial tx's and Phoenix is the sole provider of infrastructure for non-custodial txs making the infrastructure itself centralized. PoW chains seem to naturally turn into a plutocracy of miners and now that big banks are buying all the BTC they'll follow their old playbook and buy the miners once the returns start to diminish.The narrative online seems to correlate fiat gains with technical proficiency and performance, but this is just more zealotry. My positive outlook tells me that this attention should kick the core devs in the ass again to start having some serious conversations about how BTC scales in while supporting global non-custodial txs. The BTC conference this year seemed to have some heretics at least. Respect to Jimmy Song: https://snort.social/nevent1qqs0hn3kevh5lp5ftqzggzscymsqkdhp9e242ev5rzpjaahvaednq8czyzmuda53tnaf5chl76slqfsym6yvy0rvd3k3hrmzclxpqaylxplgzqcyqqqqqqgt5q25rSo I'm staying positive and hopeful, but I'm not holding my breath anymore. There are a number of other chains that are prioritizing distribution by choosing ASIC resistant algorithms, support sharding, subnets, and smart contracts. Some are even experimenting with a commodity backed stablecoin which will allow for proper DeFi without banks. Hype and Fiat gains are not a good measure of technical prowess. /the end.",
