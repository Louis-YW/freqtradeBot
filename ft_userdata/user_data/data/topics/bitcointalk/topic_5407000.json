I know your goals are very good, but a disorganized implementation system, without the full support and no real power, is like inviting people to go to war in Iraq and carry out suicide bombings.Go with the flow, play it safe, while you can still reach without needing to raise a war flag, and have limited power, just so you know we already have Bitcoin and their presence is more than enough.",

If your coins got exploited and who will you blame for that?  These days there are so many people with zero knowledge claimed to be good in business were issuing bunch of scam tokens. Have you told regulators in your country about the come of your coin soon? It seems they need to prepare everything.",

Well enough so the previous country treasury of the total fiat currency balance sheet should be to keep it balanced.There had been experiments with this like the Miamicoin, its not yet proven to work. A country having their own coin will be a lot difficult for other country to trade with. It could be easier for a government to coerce the coins to its people but the country will just be isolating itself from international trades. Using dollar which is the global currency reserve makes trading active to all countries.China and Russia didn't even try  this despite their capability in the world trades but they did create their own currency reserve  rivaling the IMF's SDR..
