You suppose know say know be all Nigerians dey do that burial thing and you don generalize am. You know say na mostly the christian communities dey do that and Dem dey see am as giving a \"befitting burial\".Â When people contribute to the dead dem dey feel say na last respect, at least dem no go get anything to contribute for the person again and culture and tradition follow join.You know say Muslim no dey do like that, especially core Muslim and northern Muslim.",

      "body": "Lolz. This your matter what I no fit laugh I think say na only my side e dey happen o. I no even know say e dey all over. Wetting me I see for that thing be say burial been no dey like that before. Burial dose days Dem no dey spend dat much. But nowadays people dey take am to another level, and meanwhile we Nigerians dey always like competition. When me a do we go copy when me B do we go copy Las Las copy copy don make burial a lucrative business. If person die now no be the person wey die wey Dem dey cry for, na expenses wey you wan come spend wey you go dey cry for.Sometimes I dey wounder how them fit reduce the rate at which Dem dey make burial dey expensive. Some people wey die since dey mutuary since because of say money never dey to do beffiting burial for them. My people who don die don die. nothing like beffiting burial. My advice be say if person die the best thing Dem ft do for am na to bury am with emediate effect as to avoid double expenses. Sometimes I know say some family get tradition concerning the burial of a thing but them fit talk am sothat Dem go do am withing the shortest period of time.",
