It would be nice if you can share with the community the white paper or at least a road map of the project that would get more people involved.Will your project create a new browser wallet or people will need to use addons like Metamask?",

All purchases will be made through our website, not external sites. We plan on providing an API as well, but payments should always be made on the payabl.cc webaite. Security is the main concern, and confirming transactions on our website give us more control on assuring all payments run smoothly.Your feedback is highly appreciated, and bitcointalk is great to get the more technical questions. Do you have any other examples of dApp security issues with Metamask?",

What is the role of the blockchain here, meaning that internal transfers will be centralized or will they take place on the blockchain, and if on the blockchain, how much are the fees?your site lookalikes PayPal isn't cause any problem.",
