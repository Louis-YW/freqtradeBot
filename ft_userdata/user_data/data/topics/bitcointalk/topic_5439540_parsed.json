  "content": "James had invested his last few dollars in a non-fungible token, hoping for a quick return. He had believed in the potential of the token, believing it was going to bring him the success he had been chasing for so long. But it was not to be. Despite his efforts, the token never sold, leaving James with nothing but despair. He was devastated and angry, feeling like he had been taken advantage of, and his dreams of wealth and success had been snatched away. He was tormented by his failure, and his mind was filled with questions that he could not answer. What had he done wrong? Was this just luck, or was he not good enough to make it? Was there something else he could have done? James was now left with nothing but regret, his dreams of achieving financial stability and success having been taken away from him in a cruel twist of fate. He was heartbroken and hopeless, struggling to find the strength to keep goinghttps://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/23005389916031419495497068831589288009900632785309905146382077432843596726273",

      "body": "^^^ Exactly!The only way you will win with NFTs is to develop something new and extremely catchy, or to find a way to use your NFT, by developing right inside it, a method to give anybody an opportunity to make lots of money just by using it. Of course, this would be a development thing, a programming, so it might be more work than making a simple NFT like most people do.Consider that the first Star Wars movie was the fourth Star Wars book. It's title was kind of like your thread here - A New Hope. George Lukas didn't start from the beginning of the story, because it made more sense to start where he did. Copy his genius, and start with what you know and what will work, rather than what other people have done in the past.",

Maybe build the Nakamoto diesel fuel saver and go around offering to treat peoples fuel tanks for free as a side hustle? You would be working for tips as you can't ask for the money! If you get a business license first then you can ask to be paid for the service. One fuel saver can treat thousands of vehicles, just make sure that you use a plastic storage container to keep it in when you are not using it. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403404.0",

Metaverse! What a joke.You just mashed together several of your distantly related opinions in one short reply. Let me try to separate my replies.- Bitcoin could, but it didn't. We don't talk about it and this is irrelevant.- [In-game and metaverse, both digital illusions good for entertainment, they don't solve any of the world's problems] - No, like 90% of other things that people spend money on. But the gaming and virtual reality industry is several times bigger than, let's say, another illusion that doesn't solve any of the world's problems - the movie industry. The gaming and virtual reality industry grows significantly year after year, unlike other illusions. Neither my reply nor the whole topic has anything to do with solving any of the world's problems.- NFT art in its majority is a scam, I didn't say otherwise. 99% of coins are scams - most people understand that.- It is very unlikely that nothing will change in how we communicate and entertain ourselves in the next 10 to 20 years, but it is possible that things will stay for the next 20 years as they were in the recent past 20. People laughed at the internet, cell phones, and other technology that was weird at the time. You can tell me what a joke the metaverse was in 5-7 years. I don't want to argue about it because I don't know.",

These whales hope to drum up enough interest in the mania that some poor sucker spends his life savings on a silly JPEG on the blockchain.Seriously NFT’s have no future & no utility. Invest your money in bitcoin, eth or stocks.",
