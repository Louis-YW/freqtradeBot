If you're asking for a more specific recipient other than the winning players then maybe to the owners when they decide to withdraw money to their own pockets. You could also add the Government to the list since they will have to pay taxes too hehe. How about the employees or the hired contractors they have to pay to keep the platform running smoothly?",

And the profit they receive is the money someone else loses. Sure the casino is earning their share, but they are also the one that have to pay taxes, keep the site running and hire support staff. If the casino would give back all the profits to the customer than they would go bankrupt. It takes people to lose money for winners to pay out their winnings. Lottery is the best example, 99% of the people are losing so that a lucky few get rich.",

Sometimes lambos and weed too. Since you don't know how to have fun with your money, you donated yours to the casino owner and he is going to spend it like a king.Quote from: cafter on March 07, 2023, 02:30:37 PM...i think many are losing in gambling and the casino sites are hugely profiting from us ,do you think that is the case .Of course they make huge profits. That's why they are in this business. You didn't think they do this for charity right?If you are not OK with this fact, you can always choose not to play.If you think they are making a killing and that's not fair, then you can create your own casino and do the same thing.",

But the truth is that most gamblers lose than win, because of that, gambling site pocket the remaining and grow bigger and have enough to pay if anyone win big later in the future.",

      "body": "That is just the reality with casinos and even then those winning players that we see posted by casinos could be losing players as well because these big wins aren't enough proof to say they're in profit. Also, I agree with swogerino the house edge you mentioned is now higher as most casinos have been offering games with higher house edge but it doesn't bother the players so they're probably making a lot more than what we expect. In the end, most gamblers lose even high rollers that's why we see gamblers usually say they play for fun and mainly go for the enjoyment of the game.",

You would lose any money in your account.Means: the gambling company has access to your account, as well as the balance you have, yes they will take your funds, if this happens it a 'Blocking' from the online casino.Different from other cases, for example: the customer/user chooses not to visit the casino again, in other words, the user deletes or deactivates his own account, in such cases the balance remains/frozen, the casino does not take it, if at any time the user accesses the account the balance is still there.Conclusion: your question regarding the funds in the user's account, depending on the case faced by the user himself, Blocking & deactivating different options.",

Many lose because of their own decision to take more risk trying to earn more money even if they are accumulating profits already. Also casino's is business so don't get surprised about this situation since this is normal, but if you can't afford to lost or get busted much better not to gamble especially if the amount you have is your hard earn money since you might complicate your situation if you lose all of it.",

Funny right? But then the best thoughts that come to mind is that, casinos need money to run keep their business going, they need to pay staff or site managers, they need to maintain their machines, or equipment or carry out regular website maintenance. What also comes to mind is that they would also use some of these monies to run adverts, promos, and campaigns. And not forgetting the most important, lost monies are used to pay winners.",

The same people that bears the burden when someone win big, is also the people that collects the funds when people loose. The gambling company have so much bills to pay before making profit. They pay their staff, tax, legal fee and other financial obligations, so they need people to lose so that they can make more money. They also have to buy new machines and upgrade thier security systems, maintain thier buildings or offices if they are offline or have physical offices. All these require money, but it is generally believed that casino owners and promoters makes huge profits.",

They will always be in profit unless some external anomaly occurs to them 'cause that's the thing that makes them file for bankruptcy.

When you win a huge amount with a small amount that you gambled with, you usually do not stop to wonder where all the money comes from, and at that moment know that you are not the only winner because the casino will have to pay the other winners with the money that some people have lost, In cases where there are more winners than losers, the casino may pay from their own pocket as part of the business to keep it running. In cases where there are more losers than winners, In addition to the commissions they get whether you win or loose, they make more money.",

Because one thing you just need to understand is that casino business is a very lucrative industry, of which if it wasn't you never would have seen any still in existence till date, because casinos are designed in such a way that they make most of the profits despite all odds. And it's typically logical that when a user bet and loss, its a profit to the casino, through which such casino uses it to repay any gambler who play and wins.So in conclusion, whichever money you lost, its a profit to the casino",

Maybe what I can add is that apart from the majority of gamblers who always lose, it never happens in a casino that most gamblers win here.So it's true what others say that winning in gambling always depends on luck and that's not what they call a technique, it's just a speculation that's all we have to be realistic. And with every bet we make, we will not lose the profit percentage of a casino for each of their players.",

It doesn't make sense to think about it as there are only two results in gambling, winning and losing, even if there will be more gamblers to win.
