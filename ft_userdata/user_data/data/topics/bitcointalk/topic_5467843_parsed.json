And the fact that you’re doing these in-house it sounds like is cool, too. Wow you made my day Max thank you  @neurotic fish thanks as well @rsincognito yes it was made using a laser it takes about 1.5-2 hrs per side. I know it is not the traditional way of coin minting some people wont like that, but it has lots of benefits to it! I can go from a design concept to a coin in hand a lot faster. I can get a lot of details into the coin. I can personalize the coin info like adding someones name, and custom addy to it. If someone wanted to make it a DIY coin for example they can give me their btc address I can have that info put onto the coin, and send them a coin with a DIY hologram then they can assemble the key, and holo with no risk involved. The only downside to that way of doing it is resale value, but if someone plans on keeping it forever then it is perfect. I still plan on doin non laser minted coins as well, but for now i am just enjoying making coins playing around with ideas. I will probably do a mix of both going forward Thanks for the compliments everyone!",
