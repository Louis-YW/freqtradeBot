I know Coinomi is closed source, but for small amounts I don't mind.Coinomi's last update in the Google Play Store was on March 19, 2022. Monero for instance has been broken since the network was upgraded a year ago. Coinomi never upgraded their support for the coin.I can't find much about it online. The website still works, but their onion site doesn't.It looks like they've abandoned the project but left some existing servers running.",

If you need another alternative, use Trustwallet if the coins you are looking for is not on Unstoppable wallet.Close source wallet are not recommendable.Unstoppable wallet is open source and you can also use it with passphrase to extend your seed phrase. But one issue with it is the syncing issue which is obvious with bitcoin and litecoin on the wallet.",

What an idiot.  Anyways, the app loads and syncs just fine. I thought it didn't because it was showing Bitcoin at $27.5k. I thought the wallet went nuts as I haven't checked the price today at all. Turns out there was decent pump today.The choice of altcoin wallet would depend, you guessed it, on the altcoins you have. I doubt you own that many, so I think you will get by by installing official releases by those projects. I often need Tether, for example. My Ledger does the job for that, and if I need it when on the go then TronLink Pro has everything I need.",

That was only out of convenience, not because I need it on the go. So Monerujo won't work. I tried the full wallet once (on a server), and it's much more resource intensive than Bitcoin Core, so that's not an option either. GetMonero has some options. As much as I like CLI, I won't use it for a wallet. That leaves Cake Wallet or Feather (or web wallets, but I won't go there). Cake Wallet exists in Beta for Linux, which leaves Feather Wallet.
