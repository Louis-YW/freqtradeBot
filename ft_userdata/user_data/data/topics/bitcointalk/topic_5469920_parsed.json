  "content": "Hi,I am new to mining, and am about to get towards the end of the month a new Antminer S19 95TH, so, as I have some time to prepare/plan, I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to set it up:- I was told that I need a separate line of 220V, however I was thinking to get a step-up trafo from 110 to 220V having 5000W. Is this OK?- I understood that the antminer comes w/o any power cables, so I have to get 2 power cables (similar like those for PCs) from what I could see on its picture, correct?- what software do I need in order to have it mine properly?- in order to configure it, is it possible to connect it to a monitor and a keyboard?- I saw on a tutorial video that the miner needs 2 cables, so would I also need a UPS to plug those cables?- as sometimes most of tutorial videos are pretty old regarding pools, and software used, is it possible to get a link towards a more recent video?- do I need a cold wallet? I have right now 2 wallets on Crypto and Shakepay, however I understood that more securely would be a cold wallet, so which one would be a good one to use?I am going to consult also this forum and see what I can find as information.Thank you",

Is this OK?You could, but I would advice against it, there would some energy loss in this process, better to install 220v.Quote- I understood that the antminer comes w/o any power cables, so I have to get 2 power cables (similar like those for PCs) from what I could see on its picture, correct?It's called C13, ya it's the same plug as the one you use on your PC, but sure thing is, it isn't the same rating, you are going to need each wire to be at least 1.5mm square thick.Quote- what software do I need in order to have it mine properly?Nothing, just your Chrome browser or whatever you already use.Quote- in order to configure it, is it possible to connect it to a monitor and a keyboard?No, you use your laptop / PC, write the miner IP address on the browser, and you will be inside the miner to do the pool configuration. Quote- I saw on a tutorial video that the miner needs 2 cables, so would I also need a UPS to plug those cables?You mean PDU? you can, or you can just get the Y split cable that phill posted above, the only issue with that Y spilt is that your breaker/socket need to handle the entire amp draw whereby using 2 single cables the load is divided.Quote- as sometimes most of tutorial videos are pretty old regarding pools, and software used, is it possible to get a link towards a more recent video?Nothing has changed ever since, all you need is pool URL and a worker name.Quote- do I need a cold wallet? I have right now 2 wallets on Crypto and Shakepay, however I understood that more securely would be a cold wallet, so which one would be a good one to use?Your mining payouts will be sent to whatever address to enter in the pool website, they don't know/care what address is that, which wallet to use is off-topic and should be taken to Wallets sections",

Were you successful with the transformer? [snip]try and find a 50amp single pole circuit breaker.and it needs more than  10 gauge wire it needs 8 gauge and there would be a proper plug to carry that much current.If OP and others are going to be serious about their mining set on the scale of what @philipma1957 does then better follow their threads. I have been a secret follower of their threads and seen all the types of experiences that they have shared. Whether it is setting up a new miner, bringing in a new mining rack that can hold a big set up, or may be cooling down the entire mining farm, they have always seen putting their actual pictures and explaining what is happening at their facility. I think that is the best way to go with it. You also share your experience and we can visualize the entire project with pictures. Please start checking out what they have done in the past. Moreover, there are detailed set up threads for dummies where one can get every bit of knowledge on how to proceed.",

I need only to send back the outlet and order the adapter.Have a great dayEither way should work.  let us know how it works out for you.Thank you very much philipma1957",

Therefore, u can also choose the variant with the 2 power outlet adapters, if a direct wired connection is not possible.",

Therefore, u can also choose the variant with the 2 power outlet adapters, if a direct wired connection is not possible.Thank you very much for the information.I could pull a cable from the router (2nd level) to the miner (basement), however it will be through the house, and it would not be practical.I could also pull it through the air ducts, however I need help, which I do not have right now.I checked the speed and it is 10Mbps, and, from what I understood that the server would need some 5Mbps, it should be enough no?Thank you",
