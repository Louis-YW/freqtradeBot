There are so many of us that are responsible gamblers and we only gamble to entertain ourselves not for making profit. Since gambling is done for fun, it becomes part of us, this is because we enjoy the fun, and some persons uses it to relieve them after a long day stress at work. We always assign some portion of our income for our gambling activities because it has become a habit in us. I know that some of us hasn't thought of quitting gambling because we are responsible gamblers.My question is this, will you continue to gamble till old age, or you have planned to stop gambling at a certain age?I am not referring to addicted gamblers that will learn a hard lesson before the quit, but only responsible gamblers that are taking all prevention measures to addiction.I will answer first.I will love to quit gambling when I am 42yrs because I don't want to give gambling much time and I will prefer to look for an alternative means to have fun.",

If you feel the need and your still capable of coming up with the predictions on games of interest, then you could as well keep up the gambling.I still see myself trying out some bets if I could still come up with my own predictions and have the funds for it. Perhaps gamble with some friends for meetups while watching some games but, I wouldn’t base my bets on a prediction that isn’t of my origins that’s where I can call it off on gambling.",

Well, its our money that would really be used and not on other people on which there's no way that people could stop us out on what we are tending to do as long we dont really wreck ourselves.Gambling doesnt really limit out people whether they would really be that old or young because we are really that free on what we do tend to do so because it is really just that for entertainmentin the first place. The only thing on here is that we should  really be still that responsible on whatever things which are really that our priorities but since we are old thenits not really that something that we do have in mind and we do usually be thinking about having some relaxation considering that we are already that bit old.",

Many gamblers do not know when they will stop gambling, they just have the believe that something will someday make them stop, but sometimes they never stop. If you gamble for long, it becomes more difficult to stop especially as you age, that is the same with any other habit that you start from a young age. If you have not accepted yourself as a gambler and you will not like to be a gambler in your old age, it is better you stop now while you still can before it becomes more difficult.",

After a while, we realize we were wrong. That's what you think now, but in reality, the need for dopamine isn't going to go away and you need something to fulfill it. Let's see what you say when you're 45. I'm sure you'll still be gambling.I haven't even thought about quitting gambling as it brings me more positive emotions than negative. I will probably quit gambling if I realize that it has become a problem for me.",

And according to the religion that I follow, gambling is an activity that is haram to do, so if I continue to gamble until I am old then I will only accumulate sins, which is when we get older, at this age we should be more focused on getting closer yourself to God.So if I could leave gambling right now then I would",

Not that i even need to but its just sometimes fun to punt a few hundred and see what happens. Half of the fun is probably the social aspect of it, talking to the people in the casino chatroom, putting up some rains for the chattors. If online crypto casinos dissapeared and only offline ones or fiat only were left, i would never gamble again.",

I don't think this is something that you can plan, we are emotionally attached to gambling at some point, and if we treat gambling as an entertainment portal it's hard to part ways on something that will give you happiness, your gambling days will be over just when you least it like you have something important to do or you find something that will replace gambling as a form of entertainment, there's really no specific time really.If you are in full control of your gambling you can end it anytime, it's hard to plan something when it comes to gambling, some quit for a time being and some permanently quit unexpectedly.",

I'm not sure until when I will gamble, or until what age I will gamble as long as I do it on my free time or killing my time as I entertain myself I would do it. In my country, there's nothing that much an elder person would do aside from taking care of their youngins or grandchild, their main thing to do is to play with other old people, I guess that's their way of feeding their inner younger self as an employee back then where they can't do much of their time and working for themselves. You can gamble as long as your happy with it, not sacrificing so much from yourself. The question would be, where will you be getting your money to gamble when you get old?",

Gambling is much more accessible now compared to the past after all so even in old age, one can easily get access to casinos that you can play in. There also aren't any restrictions, plus if you manage to get the idea of gambling in your head when your old, I reckon you have a lot of money for your retirement fund. If not, well, I don't think I ever will, I'd just probably plant a garden or something realistically. The idea is basically out there, just depends on whether I'd grab it though.Kinda curious, where did 42 come out? Is there a meaningful reason or did you just throw out a relatively middle-aged number there?",

I will stop gambling if I get bored with the game. But if we talk about age, maybe I will stop at 40 years old. In my opinion, the older we get, the more needs we have, such as our children's school fees or our children's wedding expenses. So maybe when we are old we will stop gambling because there are too many thoughts and needs, maybe it could also mean we don't have time to gamble.The most important thing is that I didn't stop gambling because I went bankrupt, that's a condition experienced by addicts",
