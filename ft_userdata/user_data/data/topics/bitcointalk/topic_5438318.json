If you decide to invest in something, you should be prepared to suffer losses due to a variety of factors, including depreciation, inflation, and volatility. Therefore, it means that not everybody should invest.You would be better off working in company, as other members have suggested. Plus, being involve in the cryptocurrency market would require you a thorough research that would support your financial decision, otherwise you could lose thousands of dollars in a matter of second.",

You have to understand that Dump-Pump has often happened in the crypto market, so all of that must be studied.You, as a beginner, must have the fear of not wanting to bear losses from what you invest, so it's better not to do it now until you really understand all forms of risk and also their functions.What was said above, you have a lot to learn to fight fear.",

You should first of all acknowledge the fact that Bitcoin/crypto is something that one does with the money he/she can afford to lose.

You will not gain anything either if you do not put anything at risk. There is a chance to reap rewards when taking risks. Therefore, you can select one of the two. First and foremost, only put money into investments that you can lose. Never use money that was intended for important use. If you are just starting out, only put your extra savings into investments. Additionally, be aware of the numerous rip-offs involving cryptocurrencies promising fixed returns. Any investment promise made by a stranger is a scam. People who send you direct messages should be avoided. In your topic, you will receive responses to all of your inquiries.",

If its only pump then how could we sustain a healthy market without having any correction or downtrend. Its not all about up and gains. There should be a balance for it to move forward in a healthy manner. Youll see history in that sequence. Try to check again and its started to become clear for you.",

I know it won't be as smooth as imagined, but at least with you already having the knowledge, you will do risk management to overcome losses, so all of that needs experience and when you experience a loss it is a normal thing because in cryptocurrency there is a pump and there is also a dump it depends on the trend that is happening in the crypto industry.Arm yourself with more knowledge and learn how to manage finances properly so that you are not greedy and wrong in making investments or dealing with other losses, and I think that many of the suggestions given can help you take action now.",

Your first task is knowing how to filter through the bunch of spam and find actual content which would benefit your Bitcoin journey.One way is to filter based on rank, but this doesn't always work as high ranked members could be spammers and newbies could provide helpful discussions. But filtering by earned merit could work as well. You can also just read content and verify them yourself before internalizing anything. This works with the Bitcoin ideology of verifying and not trusting.Read through posted links. The forum has a repertoire of information, you only need to discover them.The search option would be useful in this task.Good luck on the forum!",
