  "content": "Based on the estimate from bitcoinblockhalf.com, the 2024 halving will be end of April with other estimates calculating it as beginning of April, even as early as March. While not getting too bogged down in the timing which is dependant on whether there continues to be hash rate growth (to bring it forward) or not, when do you think the bull market will start?The last halving was in May 2020 and arguably the bull market started a few months after this, as instead there was consolidation around $9K for several months, whereas in 2016 the bull market more or less started immediately after the July halving, or even arguably around 6 months beforehand as price had already increased over 100% from the lows without a significant correction.I also remember in 2019 many were anticipating that price would increase in the 6 months leading up to the halving similar to 2016, which started to happen at the beginning of 2020 until the Covid crash occurred, hence instead price took several months to recover, although was slightly higher than it was 6 months prior to halving at around $7K, but not before re-visiting $4K.I realise when the bull market takes off will also be dependant on price action, for example if there is another black swan event at the start of 2024 then this could result in a delay like in 2020. But otherwise do you generally think the bull market will start before or after the halving, or otherwise more or less immediately after the halving, and do you think there will be any other relevant factors other than the halving? Interested to hear your thoughts...",

Interested to hear your thoughts...Generally I think there is nothing up the sleeve for now until halving except Elon musk pulls up something  . That is by the way but talking with my experience on bitcoin bull run, it is usually after the halving has happened but not immediately. This begins to happen few months afterwards although sometimes there is price action because of volatility at the time close to halving as a result of uncertainty in the market. This is what happened during the time before the 2016 halving, the price continued to be unstable with more volatility on the price increase before the halving eventually took price to around $21,000 in December 2017.",

      "body": "Thanks for this speculation and reminder. First, I was unable to choose any option from the poll because none suits my understudies about halving. My option is that the main bull run would start about 1-.1.5 months before the halving and this is still subject to what you mean by the bull run.Actually, a substantial bull run was predominant in the early months of this year, we might witness more of such still before 2024. In light of this, if it's a bull run that is attributed to halving, my early option stands, nonetheless, I will not do anything until my technical studies affirm it. I will never be a blind trader in the coming event no matter how real it promises.By the way, this is to reference my standpoint towards that time and the event. However, if Bitcoin could reach below $20,000 any moment from now, I will start buying immediately regardless of what happens before or after halving.",

As it will still be considered as something new just as the 2021 was actually a new bull run for which it has exceeded our expectations. But who wants that? I don't personally like to see it happen that there will be no bull run after the halving as the cycle notes and proved that there will always be the bull run every cycle and after the halving.Quote from: dragonvslinux on May 14, 2023, 08:52:36 AMwhen do you think the bull market will start?My estimates will still remain that it might start after several months but we'll see the ATH and actual peak of it by 2025. Just as what mostly are believing that 2025 might be the great peak price point of Bitcoin will be seen again.",

Right now the price is still correcting due to some FUD that has emerged, this is still quite normal because a few weeks ago Bitcoin was able to survive above the price of $ 30k and now it has dropped to the price of $ 26k. Halving will occur soon in 2024 and this will be a trigger for Bitcoin to be able to reach the ATH Price again, that's what everyone hopes for. May this year, according to the history of bitcoin prices, did experience corrections and some frequent sales. We'll just wait until after May and June, it is expected that Bitcoin will return to bullishness",

Interested to hear your thoughts...What I want to see in the next cycle, after halving, is how far the peak goes. This cycle has been the most disappointing in terms of returns, failing all forecasts that were made in 2021. For the next one I would expect $100K to be passed, but what if it doesn't happen? A lot of things would have to be rethought. Passing $200K is much more difficult. If for example the peak of the next cycle was $140K, it would be a 2x, coming from a 3.5x the previous cycle.The point is that as the price goes up, it is more difficult for the returns to be spectacular. The only good thing I see is that volatility tends to decrease as well.",

Interested to hear your thoughts...Generally, I think it would start before the halving as a result of people needing to purchase more fractions before the actual halving occurs, but that depends on several factors that could drive the market sentiments on the other way. People would not really know if the bullrun just started until we see the price having a good run that could potentially lead closer to the most recent ATH or break it anyway. This would usually happens after the halving, just like what we've seen from the past couple of Bitcoin halving.",

Since the price has moved from $17,543 to $27,543 in this month of may showed that bullish market is on ground till the price of Bitcoin reach $80,000 before the bearish season will take over the market. I believe, next year 2024 will be more better than this year because there are some signs in the market that make traders to believe that this bullish will reach next year to allow both long term and short term traders embrace massive income.",

We didn't even stay in the bear region like we did after the bull run of 2017.

Such is the dynamics of the market and it is always marked by a halving before it reaches its highest price, the calculation of the previous ATH race may be correct, in the six months before the halving bitcoin will increase slowly, but there is always no accuracy in the predictions and usually we only rely on the four year cycle. I think we will see a gradual increase in the next few months and will also see a correction taking place.There could be delays such as the black swan so that price action is delayed and not in accordance with the previous cycle, but if there is a delay that shifts at most by half a year and the halving moment will be back on track, other factors may also influence but there is no basis as a reference that we can convey because so far no one has been able to prove stronger.",

There are many possibilities about when bullish will come but even if we don't know, we have to be prepared for it.Meanwhile, the current price is still around $27k and it is far from the last ATH so it looks like we still have a long way to go to see the bitcoin price start to increase. And when the price starts to increase, we will not realize that it is the beginning of a bullish movement because the price will not go straight to the last ATH but will increase slowly.But that's just a prediction because we don't know how the bitcoin price will increase in the future. And before that time comes, we have to be ready so we can sell it at the peak price, namely at the next ATH. But I gave my vote to \"Less than 6 months after the halving.\"",
