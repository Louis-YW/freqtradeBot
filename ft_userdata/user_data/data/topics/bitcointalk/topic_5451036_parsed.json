  "content": "some days ago i discovered that my friend also invest in bitcoin and not have much knowledge about bitcoin, he just invested in it recently for doubling his money. Then i told him about what is bitcoin and how it's work, suggested some youtube channel to learn from but, he also did like many people do in greed of making fast and easy money and invest whatever coin is down(cheap) or trending. then i told him some lessons i learned in hard way like don't send your crypto to anyone it maybe scam, never invest listening to others, buy low sell high, never gamble with crypto and fiat also, etc. but after some days he came across a youtube video, video was live about tesla and elon musk giving away millions in bitcoin, the scam is like this: send 0.01 btc and get 0.02 btc back. I previously told him don't send crypto and there are many scams, but he didn't followed it and sent some amount of bitcoin and after some hours he realized that it was a scam! the question is how can we try to save newbie's from scams in crypto verse, we and many youtuber are saying that don't send bitcoins, there are many scams, etc. or we should not tell and left them to learn the lesson in hard way, I already listened many people those are in crypto for a while they said many things like don't be greedy, stay away from free crypto, etc. but i just listened and not applied and got scamed one time. what are the ways to learn lesson in easy ways and save newbie's from scams?BTW, i researched about their channel, they were live streaming about elon musk and cathie wood talking about some crypto related things which is very old video. then i checked their website where the people send crypto to double they are using one single address to get crypto, i checked their address in explorer and found out that they are making very good amount of money with this scam, like in millions. one more, sometime i came across trading signals telegram channel they are giving their paid membership for trading signals, then i searched their payment address in bitcoin explorer, and the amount was like $500-$600 million. i don't know that amount came from their telegram membership or some where else. but no one will share their personal address(i think that money was from users)",

But it didn't occur to me to send money. Quote from: cafter on May 03, 2023, 04:01:42 AMthe question is how can we try to save newbie's from scams in crypto verse, You won't be able to save them all. There is always someone who is going to fall, due to ignorance, greed, absent-mindedness or things like that.There are things that help you not to fall, like understanding mathematics, understanding investments and profitability, remember that if something is too good to be true, it probably is and the like.I guees your friend learned the lesson the hard way. That is also a good way to be careful and avoid falling in scams in the future, although a tough one.",

      "body": "Why it should be always easy? The difficulty what gives value in every aspect. If your friend got scammed then it is not your fault, it is his fault why he lost his money. The accountability to ourself is what we need, a lot of people are blaming scammers why they lose money without knowing that it is their decision in the first place why they have been scammed. There are now a lot of scammers all around the internet and sad to see that there are many people fall for their trick. I do not know why even though the scam is very obvious people still investing their money knowing that it is scam. As for what I know, I think they are been controlled by their ego. The lack of knowledge for me it is also a factor why victims are keep falling in obvious tricks of the current scammers.Let's become a man that is accountable with ourselves and the people surround us. If I have and he is interested on making a lot of gains from investing and avoiding scam projects, my suggestion for him would be: he need to allocate a lot of time on studying before putting his money on the line. Actually it is also considered as investment in the world of psychic if you focus on getting information and knowledge about what you currently doing. Take note that there are no easy ways to learn, it is always hard and difficult so you must accept the fact that you really need courage and consistency in order to become a good investor. Stay hard guys!",

Your responsibility is to keep teaching them about the Bitcoin space and exposing them to privacy and cybersecurity. The message is short and simple but very powerful \"Don't be greedy\". Any business in the industry that promises huge returns within a short period is a potential scam. Any crypto advertisement that gives you a clear prediction of how much you will earn at a certain period might be a scam because the crypto space is not predictable. Your responsibility is to inform them, it is up to them to accept your advice or reject it.",

Some typical shitty scams in the house. Anyway, I've seen this multiple times already not only in Youtube, but in different social media platforms. So many times already that I can't even remember how many times I've seen this type of scams. Unfortunately, there are still some newbie, greedy, and ignorant investors who are falling into this kind of trap.Quote from: cafter on May 03, 2023, 04:01:42 AMthe question is how can we try to save newbie's from scams in crypto verse, we and many youtuber are saying that don't send bitcoins, there are many scams, etc. or we should not tell and left them to learn the lesson in hard way, I already listened many people those are in crypto for a while they said many things like don't be greedy, stay away from free crypto, etc. but i just listened and not applied and got scamed one time. Like @Poker Player said, you can't save them at all.For me, I believe that in investing, investors will only learn if they experienced getting scammed. I might be lucky that I'm one of the few people who didn't fall into these type of scams when I was a newbie, but for sure there are many newbies out there who are still falling into scams like this because of their greediness. They always see Bitcoin as a rich-quick scheme which is very wrong.If people experienced getting scammed, that's the time that they will realize what they did was wrong. They will make some adjustments, they will learn after that in order for them not to get scammed again. Learning really is very expensive, and that's what I believe. There's no way for newbies to save them when they're starting unless they have a mentor on their side constantly giving advice for them in which assets or which coins should they invest their money with.",

Most YouTube channels broadcast old videos just to have fun and it would be very easy to do that and deceive people into believing that it's a live program. The rate at which social media is being used for scam these days is very high. And everyday, we hear stories of how people loss money not just crypto to scammers.  This whole thing is caused by greed. Why would you think that someone who you don't know, would want to double your money for you. He obviously wants to double his own and not yours.  I'm not saying that there aren't legit investment platforms out there, but at least try to do research. Ask your friends if you don't know how because this has helped me a lot. I would have fell victim several times but when ever I don't have and idea about something, I call a friend to help me out. Also, tell your friend to stay away from social media money making platforms as this would be best for him. And to teach him more about cryptocurrency so he knows that it's not about a get rich program because from look of things thats his own idea about crypto.",

Is this some charity or donation going through or they have abundant funds to distribute to each user? 4) You should have directed him to some useful resources on the forum only instead of guiding him to those crap YouTube channels which are not giving any informative thing rather then some knowledgeable things about crypto so avoid them.These are lessons which will help him to stay safe in the future if he considered this loss as lesson.",

One bitter-sweet way to save newbies from scams in the \"crypto verse\" is to let them learn from a first hand experience of being victim of a scam. Many may disagree on this ideology as been illogical but we all know that when you get a fire burn experience on maybe one of your toe or finger, when you see anything that looks like fire yiu will be the very first to escalate, avoid or distance yourself before anyone else would it.  And OP haven falling a victim of scam has a better understanding than anyone else around him, of the benefits of avoiding any social media, YouTube or online platforms with enticing crypto giveaways.  So at times it's a good thing learning through the hard way as it may save us from bigger victimization in the future.Quotewhat are the ways to learn lesson in easy ways and save newbie's from scams?The easier ways to learn:1. From other people's experience story.2. Always ask questions on things you lack understanding about, don't be too quick to engage (FOMO).3.Stay away from greed as crypto and greed don't go well together.",

You're right. The best advice and best help for newbies who want to get information about Bitcoin is to direct them to this forum.Every time I see people hoping to learn something from YouTube, especially when it comes to finance, I am surprised. Do people really not understand that the first purpose of posting any lesson or advice on YouTube is personal gain, that is, personal earnings? You may not be literate in crypto, but if you have subscribers who are easily bought or cheated, it will not matter what level of knowledge you have. And there will always be boobies who will invest their hard-earned money or, on the contrary, send it to any scam, following the crowd. Because many people think that the majority is always right.Draw your own conclusions; don't trust anyone who offers you a freebie, and the number of subscribers says nothing about the level of knowledge of your alleged teacher on YouTube.Try to learn on your own. This forum is the best place.",

Definitely, some will still fall victim, but at least they will learn. There is no possible way to totally change the fact that some people will still fall prey to scammers, but what we are doing still remains that threads like this will continue to come up, and also outside the forum, if you see some newbies to cryptocurrency or Bitcoiners that have a high enthusiasm to learn from you when you have the time to give them a few good educations about Bitcoin, just do teach them the right thing, and if they get benefits from the education you give them, they may also teach others, and by so doing, the rate at which newbies fall victim may gradually reduce.",

It is hard to control human greed.  Greed once triggered will listen to no one.  But even so, we should always make an effort to remind people we know to take cautious action and think for multiple times if the offer is too good to be true or it is for real.Quote from: cafter on May 03, 2023, 04:01:42 AMwhat are the ways to learn lesson in easy ways and save newbie's from scams?There is no easy way in learning, we have to strive for it to be able to acquire knowledge.  We need to give time and effort to fully grasp things.  As for saving newbies, it depends on the newbie's open mindedness.  Aside from that, respect and reputation also come to account.  If you have a good reputation, they might listen to your suggestion but if you are not known or is not respected in the community, then any advice you give will be ignored.",

Quote from: cafter on May 03, 2023, 04:01:42 AMbut after some days he came across a youtube video, video was live about tesla and elon musk giving away millions in bitcoin, the scam is like this: send 0.01 btc and get 0.02 btc back. I previously told him don't send crypto and there are many scams, but he didn't followed it and sent some amount of bitcoin and after some hours he realized that it was a scam! This is where greediness always lead us to, when you desperate to make it quickly then you should be ready to take any form risk and also likely to be losing it always. There are many scam tactics but it is double your money that attract intentions of greedy people and newbie.

I don't think there's anyway rather than given those newbies the proper knowledge and providing them with latest information about scammers new tactics and I believe that have  been happening, so it is now left for newbies to learn from other people experience.nobody is perfect but when you give listen ears, I believe it will help seriously and it will always guide you to the right part.",
