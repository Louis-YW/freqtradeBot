But you should always remember that Bitcoin investment is very risky. There is always price volatility in the Bitcoin market. When the Bitcoin market reached an all-time high of $69000, I was willing to invest because I thought the market would go up from here and might not go down. From there I didn't invest then when the market started dumping and reached $40k I invested. Since then the market has only been dumping, since then I have had a lot of losses. So I mean when a person invests bitcoin for retirement and in old age that bitcoin investment is like my investment then he will end up miserable. So I mean keep some money in bank or house in cash not just bitcoins for future planning. When losses occur after investing, I can use the money left to meet my needs without selling the bitcoins.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is really a valuable asset at the age of retirement but still comparing it with fiat for the retirement won't be a fair thing. The retirement fund and pension is totally a different concept because if you get retired as a government servant you will get your monthly pensions without any effort after the age of 60. I know the beginning process might be hard at the time of retirement because that process is really time consuming and requires some hard work and patience. And once you did that then you won't have to work any harder for getting your monthly pay slips.On the other hand if you hold Bitcoin at the age of retirement you'll still have to be a careful person because if that's the only investment that you have at that age then safety would be the most important thing for you. As you know that Bitcoin isn't prone to technical bugs and vulnerabilities that an OS or a software could have and if your system gets hacked that is holding your bitcoins then you might not be able to recover your stolen Bitcoin.There are also some other problems that you must have to handle if you want to get retirement with Bitcoin investment, and one of them is to always make backups of your wallets on different storage medias as any of them are prone to failure and can stop working at any time.I would still recommend to go with both of them if you have opportunity. Even with a job you can invest in Bitcoin and have the benefits of both the pension and the investment at the time of retirement. It's always better to have two options rather than once so you can be safe without any worries.",

Ideally many years before. Another thing is to have several sources of income. It can be jobs that you still like to do, like for example writing for pay, and passive income, like dividends.Then, yes, a certain amount of Bitcoin to supplement, and then you consider whether to make partial sales and/or leave it in inheritance.",

That's show you retired great.That's why many investors are still investing in Bitcoin, so that when that old age appear they will have nothing to worry about at the moment than to start using the bitcoins they store in the past to do whatever they want to do in the community. I don't think, I will miss my retirement benefits from Bitcoin because I have started saving some Bitcoin in my wallet so that when old age come, I will fall back to my Bitcoins and use them wisely to build some companies that will be bringing money to the family. And when the children grow up to see the investments in place they will definitely respect their parents for using the retirement benefits well.",

If you're working in a centralized company and your retirement will be paid in Bitcoin, do you think your Bitcoin will automatically arrive in your wallet? you're wrong because the company is controlling your Bitcoin, they can choose to not send your Bitcoin. This mean there's no difference between retirement paid in fiat or in Bitcoin.Quote6. Nobody will threatens or charm you for receiving retirement benefits from bitcoin since is not physical cash.They can go into your house and threaten you with $5 wrench attack.Quote7.

It has a tremendous amount of potential for growth and more importantly we are still in very early stages of adoption and far away from reaching mass adoption.But you have to be careful about the other options you choose. It depends on certain factors like where you live, your personal preference and knowledge about that asset, time, etc. For example these days the stock market is the worst choice specially in places like US and Europe where the recession is creeping in and majority of companies have been having lots of troubles with energy crisis, inflation, etc. that they had to fire employees or even some file for bankruptcy, all of which has led to more dumps in the market.",

Withdrawing it in a bank ain't that hard as long as you're withdrawing decent amount, unless you're going for too big cash that will make them suspect you on where did you get such large amount of cash, but I think it will still vary on what kind of work did you do before you retired, if it paid well, then I don't see any problem withdrawing big cash. The harm that could get to you is very minimal, unless your relatives or friends are bad people that want to steal your Bitcoin, or if you're bragging it on social medias.",
