If you think the rule of law isn't functional in the country, go and fault an obvious law and allow yourself to be caught by the law enforcement agency and that's when you will know that Nigeria has law and that breaking it will put you in serious trouble.Have you asked the likes of Goodwin emefiele, abakiara and a whole lot of politician that where put under bar because they where found wanting in the bridge of the law of the land. You can do anything and go out free as long as you're not caught but if you allow yourself to be caught, you go know say to stay for kirikiri no be play.I know that some politician do use their influence and money to will the whole judgement to their favour but ones anything goes wrong, na their body de tell them",

Make I back up wattin I dey talk, normally for Nigeria na 8 years be the maximum wey person fit operate for some political position, like governor, president etc. but for bayelsa state the APC candidate, timipre Silva don first rule for 1 year but Dem come commot am say em election been no dey free and fair, later e come contest again and e come win, e come rule for 4 years. And now e still dey come out to rule for another 4 years wey go make am 9 years, and person come go sue to court say e no go fit work, yet the court say, based on say no be e fellow political aspirant say the matter no go anywhere.

We all know what happening in this country, corruption is the most aspect which has to be controlled. They just need our vote nothing else again. If we should unite together cast a vote not by collecting bribe from others am very sure many issues will be solved",

Pray not to get lynched before the law enforcement agencies, particularly the police save you. The law is easily bent for those with more money or who have the money on the spot to bail themselves out from the calamity they find themselves in. The rule of law is still very much intact, but one has to know their rights and try as much as possible to keep proper evidence or proof of the right thing, so as not to fall victim of the ills that befall breaking the rules already set in place.",

So likely, the judiciary is also affectedly corrupted with briberies and surrounded with a monumental fears to give justify able judgements as fairly supposed to be.So the government is now been again the which then stands that laws of the government's and the judiciaries is only existence with the poor masses.A shame to the judiciary where the law court and judicial system has become a system of injustice bathed with corruptions",

You cannot have a lawsuit with any politian and you win.Politicians are people of respect in the public and they have more influence. This is not only happening in Nigeria but all over the world. Also it is like you are comparing someone that is very rich and influential to a poor person. Sometimes if the politician or the rich man knows that he (the politician) is wrong, he bribes/settle the victim with huge amount of money and case closed. Although, life can be disappointing for the poor and he or she may feel cheated. Not only happening in Nigeria but all over the world.
