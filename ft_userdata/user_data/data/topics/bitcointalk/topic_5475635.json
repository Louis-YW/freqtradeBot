      "body": "If we want to talk about something that could effect a rapid adoption of bitcoin i would say the government coming to fully support it. There are many people who still do not want to come in because of the government restrictions, so should the government actually supports it the way the do to their scam CBDC I think we will see a rapid increase in number of users. Take a look at how news of government relaxing its rules usually impact the price changes. But do I see that happening? No because the government doesn’t want this freedom and privacy that comes with it. I also do not want government interference into it. So this current adoption rate seems ok to me",

Let us discuss in this thread that one change which can increase the adoption of Bitcoin further at a rapid rate. How fast do you want bitcoin to be adopted? Because in my opinion, the popularity of bitcoin is increasing at a very fast pace, not slow. I think everything needs time and challenges, something that is accepted too quickly is not necessarily good. One of the important milestones we are working towards is the ETF, I believe that once the ETF is approved, bitcoin will soon be used globally. It can be said that the government is the biggest barrier to bitcoin, but I think once the SEC approves the ETFs, governments that are skeptical about bitcoin will have to change their views on bitcoin.",

Let us discuss in this thread that one change which can increase the adoption of Bitcoin further at a rapid rate. Bitcoins are already been accepted or adopted rapidly. This is the reason for which Bitcoins price suddenly increased to 69k usd from 20k usd. Regarding the flaws then, it can be blockchain transaction fees issue. That’s the only thing that I have seen people complaining. If you ask me then Bitcoins are perfect as a digital asset, it has very high capability to give you maximum profit in longer period of time.",

My point is that Bitcoin's adoption rate would increase a lot not necessarily by changing Bitcoin's imperfections but only by making people aware of the real situation of the currency they are using. Bitcoin is far from perfect, but the mainstream currency is much worse, not even worth comparing with Bitcoin. So, it's enough that the people realize how oppressed they are by the fiat system and Bitcoin adoption accelerates.",

Let us discuss in this thread that one change which can increase the adoption of Bitcoin further at a rapid rate. I don't know if this will happen because not all are supportive of Bitcoin, but the Government might be one of the reasons for Bitcoin to get adopted quickly.I know this isn't realistic because there are some countries that are already anti-Bitcoin and prohibit their countrymen from using Bitcoin, but if only all of the governments would allow their people to use it, and at the same time help at least to promote it then I believe it might be a game-changer. The government changing perception towards Bitcoin might change its adoption of it and can make it quicker.Overall, I guess there's no need to change. I mean there are many Bitcoin supporters who are constantly promoting Bitcoin in different social media platforms and with many people using social media, I believe that the adoption is much faster than what it was years ago. The only problem is how they look at Bitcoin. There's nothing wrong with the pace of adoption, but how people see Bitcoin is the problem because I believe many people don't want to buy or at least invest into it because they see it as either a scam or a faster way to lose their money because of its volatility. Adoption isn't the problem, its how we teach the new ones.",

In my opinion, the way to accelerate Bitcoin adoption is to increase the number of people who are serious about knowing how Bitcoin works as a financial transaction system and comparing it to how fiat works. When people know well about the greatness of the Bitcoin system in carrying out transactions, I am sure that people will no longer make their main interest in buying Bitcoin because it is solely an investment asset in the hope of getting rich but instead make Bitcoin a financial transaction system.",

Let us discuss in this thread that one change which can increase the adoption of Bitcoin further at a rapid rate. The fastest way in my opinion to make the adoption faster is by government not intervening in the widely used of it. When they remove the limitation of its use to their peoples and stop attaching negative words to bitcoin, it can easily convince people to embrace it for mass adoption of it and uses. Government is always the bedrock of any technology that comes new, without their acceptance, it becomes very hard for people to understand and embrace its use. Regulations is killing many innovations that ought not to be regulated, some of which are worth been regulated and some just for their own self benefit as the case of bitcoin. If the government really wants to have a say in this bitcoin adoption, and we want its mass adoption quicker, we will have to give in to their regulations and laws before we can comfortably use it anywhere in the world.",

Before only few countries talka about it but its a renowed commodity globally now. Maybe the use case isnt much that famous to others but there are merchants who keeps using it now and it will only likely to increase in the future as more people becoming engage and interested with its technology as a store of value and transparent utility for anyone.",
