We hope we can bring some support to those affected. For Moroccan users who receive these donations but are unimpacted by the earthquake, we ask them to pass the funds on to those most in need.”To my esteemed forum friends and family, this is indeed a one-of-a-kind. Let's celebrate the Binance company while we continue to mourn and show our kind support to the affected citizens of Morocco.https://www.binance.com/en/blog/charity/binance-to-airdrop-up-to-$3-million-in-bnb-to-users-in-the-morocco-earthquake-region-6962526806416134014",

Whether people hate or like Binance, they're always been helpful and sending amounts for the sake of those affected people.This gesture should be like the foundation of other big exchanges to help also in the times when they're needed the most. Or, it's just that they don't broadcast their help but also does their own charities and support to the choice of theirs.",

The good citizens who are not impacted but recieved the funds will use the funds appropriately. How about the bad ones who will not even disclose to anyone that they recieved any fund from Binance?",

In short, he did not pay anything and the price of the currency may be affected by the decline because he printed 3 million BNB.It is true that users can withdraw them into Bitcoin, but he is trying to kill two birds with one stone, the media coverage of this issue, the increase in the number of Moroccan users and the failure to pay anything, as this offer will only lead to a temporary decrease in the price.As a reminder, Binance owns ~343k worth of Bitcoin in the form of BNB & BUSD while it has ~618k worth of Bitcoin according to the Proof of Reserves[1] issued by them. In other words, about half of the bitcoins available at Binance in form of BNB & BUSD printed without any proof of their value.[1] https://www.binance.com/en/proof-of-reserves",

Moreover, I think CZ distributed this aid in a slightly inappropriate way and seemed more selective. Aid is only dropped to verified plus users, where the advantage of this type of verification is that there is no limit on the deposit amount. This means that retail users (lower class) may not want to complete this verification level.",

I'm not sure about this heart of gold thing, but, first, CZ didn't raise the amount and, second, the money wasn't really distributed to the affected victims. Please refer to hugeblack and noorman0's posts right above you. How I wish the money was given to organizations, government agencies, or certain efforts that provide direct assistance to those who really need it the most and not only to the verified plus Binance users. In fairness, he'll also be donating money to an authorized NGO but the money will be coming from the proceeds of a public donation drive that he launched. I hope he'll give all the donations away.Anyway, this is still a good gesture coming from CZ. Props to him for doing this.",

Seeing the videos online shows how seriously the earthquake was and people are going to be homeless. Some people that have worked their whole life to build or buy the house that they were leaving in will get destroyed and I just hope humanitarian helps reach all of them affected which brings me to what Cz just did with his BNB donation. Although his gesture are highly appreciated but he could have done the donation in a different way. I don't like when people mix business with charity, he could have easily converted those funds to stablecoin and done his donation without putting BNB under pressure because those that received the donation will have to sell at some point to get fiats.

This donation will do him more good than it might do those affected because not everyone will get the donation. The amount of publicity that both Binance the exchange and BNB the coin will get get is bigger than what would had been the results if that donation amount was been used for marketing. Media coverage, peer2peer discussion about the donation etc will all give Binance free promotion. Maybe next time the funds should be donated directly to an NGO that can meet those affected directly.",
