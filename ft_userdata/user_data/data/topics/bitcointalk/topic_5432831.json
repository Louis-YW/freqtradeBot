  "content": "so no one here wants a centralized bitcoin. But what has happened recently? I heard that there are two mining pools that are actually controlling 51% of the global hash rate.I felt heart-breaking. If btc is going centralized, then i don't know who i can trust. I wish i was wrong, but look at this:https://cryptoslate.com/behind-the-two-mining-pools-controlling-51-percent-of-the-global-hash-rate/Only true replies here.",

Bitcoin is not ideal, and neither is everything that surrounds it, whether it is mining, trading or the \"slowness\" of transactions. What I want to say is that if you're looking for a flaw in something, you'll always find it, it's just a matter of time.On the other hand, look at all the crypto alternatives that exist and compete with Bitcoin, and these are POS coins or stablecoins that do not have any form of decentralization, have people behind them who cannot be trusted and are easy prey for any government. To me, the winner in this comparison is quite clear, regardless of the fact that things are not ideal.",

Holding Bitcoin is not enough, you should also be able to show the effort and work you put into Bitcoin. The work and effort being the costs of mining Bitcoin, in this case. So however large the mining groups are and however centralized Bitcoin seems to be, the miner giants cannot be in control of the 51% forever. This is different with POS because simply holding Bitcoin has no effort/cost attached to it.Which is why as long as Bitcoin remains POW, we will never see true centralization. Bitcoin remains free.",
