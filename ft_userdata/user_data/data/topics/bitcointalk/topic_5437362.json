Can a mod help me out?I have checked BTC or Ethereum address you used ever in this forum but I did not find anyone. It will be better to provide some more information like when you post last message here and also You must have received the email change mail in your previous Email. You should provide this screenshot here so that moderators see your case properly.Quote https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1138263 This account is created in 2017 and still active and style of posting is same like earlier posts. it is very difficult to find out when it was hacked because there are two big breaks, June-2018 to Mar 2020 and APR-2020. There is nothing changes kn style of posting and The period of both two inactivity is the same.",

But even if he had, I doubt that would serve as any sort of evidence since it can be faked.@Fleshslasher you claim in that first post that email has been changed, while bpip shows that it hasn't been changed.

You won't get any help from the recovery team as long as you don't have signed message, so I guess this is tricky case. IP can change if you use TOR, it is not guarantee that the account has changed hands.If you have valid proof that the account has changed hands due to being hacked, then contact the recovery team instead of getting the thread.
