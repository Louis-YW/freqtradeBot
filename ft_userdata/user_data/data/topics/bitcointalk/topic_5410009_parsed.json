  "content": "I posted part of this on another thread already. But I found more accounts, and it seems like all of them belong to the same guy.I found a Brand New account Posting random words on bounty threads which is Spam. I know there are some threads to report Plagiarism and multiple account connections. But I don't know where to report Spam. So I created this thread. I already reported them all. I hope moderators will take care of those spammers. I quoted some posts below for reference. The Accounts are:1- As232- Magi233- Kolding4- Amisagol5- KolaKha6- Torebasdimu7- Luggi1While Reporting some posts, I get an error;QuoteThe last posting from your IP was less than 17 seconds ago.

Although there is no doubt that it would be much easier on the part of the person doing the report, but the moderator still has to manually delete each post using the user post history - which may not be the easiest way from their perspective.",

Which part if those spammer can be said as alt farm? AFAIK they're giving any merit to each other which is their effort are completely pointless. I'd say he's just want to trolling in this forum and didn't do anything related with money or abusing an event.2. Based on my research, those accounts already got banned.

But some of us don't read and don't take the rules and regulations serious, so they are supposed to be ban. It's in the law of the forum that pointless contribution is not supported and any pointless response is as off-topic, so if what they will be given is off topic let them be ban.",
