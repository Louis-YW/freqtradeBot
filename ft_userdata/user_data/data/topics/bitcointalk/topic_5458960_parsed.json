  "content": "Land is becoming lesser and not very available for agriculture as before, There is a lot of Urbanization going on and many land space are being built on to carter for the increasing number of persons. There will be lesser organic foods available for consumption as the worlds population increase and farming space reduces. Because of this, there now has to be an improvement in farming methods and I personally consider vertical Farming to be the future of organic food farming.In vertical farming, Plants are grown in stacked layers under controlled conditions like green house farming.In vertical farming,QuoteEnsures Consistent Crop ProductionOne of the biggest benefits of vertical arming lies in the fact that it is extremely reliable. That means, when you opt for vertical farming, you can be assured of getting consistent crop production throughout the year. This is further made possible because vertical farming doesn’t usually rely on the weather, allowing you to cultivate crops without having to get worked up about adverse weather conditions.Uses Space Optimally Reduces Usage of WaterOne of the biggest perks of vertical farming lies in the fact that it follows a Hydroponic growing process whereby only 10% of the water is used. This mode of farming also uses fewer fertilizers and nutrients when compared to conventional methods. Since the water is completely clean even after usage, it can be duly reused thereby reducing the total cost and cutting down on waste.Cuts Down on Transport CostYou can always choose to grow crops in an area where your customer lives thereby reducing transportation costs, carbon dioxide emissions, and the constant need for refrigerating your produce. At the end of the day, this not only contributes to the freshness of your products but also makes them incredibly profitable.Doesn’t Involve Chemicals or PesticidesWhen you grow food on a vertical farm, you have the chance of completely cutting down on the need to invest in pesticides. That is because your farming is practiced in a controlled environment that prohibits the entry of pests.Limits Occupational HazardsWith indoor farming in place, no farmer is exposed to the hazards associated with using heavy farming gear. They are also well-protected from a range of ailments like malaria, issues from harmful chemicals, and the likes of it.Since this mode of farming does not affect trees and animals around inland zones, it is also an excellent way to promote biodiversity.Larger ProduceProbably the biggest benefit of vertical farming is the fact that it helps produce more crops in general. As we already know, this mode of farming enables cultivars to produce crops consistently in a small area. Interestingly, it also boosts the amount of produce. What do you think about Vertical Farming, do you agree that it is the future of farming really?https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/advantages-disadvantages-vertical-farming.php",

There are two places to live in anywhere in the world. Either you live in Rural area or you live in Urban area. Now when someone was living in the rural area and moved down to Urban settlement then the place he or she was living at the rural area became vacancy, so occupying one place gives room to open another place. So that of the rural settlement space can be use has farming. I don't know of other countries, in my locality, there are enough lands to farm but nobody to farm. Specifically, my paternal home town is a ghost town now because urbanization has taken over 99% of the people. So lands full there to farm.",

So before anything bad or worse to happen government on agricultural countries should maximize their assets to increase their yearly yields since this could save their country to huge crisis in future also they might be the more progressive country since agricultural products might create more bigger demands.",

There will be lesser organic foods available for consumption as the worlds population increase and farming space reduces. Because of this, there now has to be an improvement in farming methods and I personally consider vertical Farming to be the future of organic food farming.When we talk about food produced in an organic way, then we have to start from the fact that such food is quite expensive than the one produced in a commercial way, and therefore it is something that most people in the world can not afford. The more people on the planet, the greater the need for food, and this means that those who promote genetically modified foods are taking up more space and offering more for less money - which combined with inflation means that fewer people are eating healthy food.I think that vertical farms have potential, but that they are not in the interest of large producers who solve the problem with the lack of arable land with deforestation, which is obviously cheaper and faster than the construction of vertical farms.The problem of healthy food is most pronounced in urban areas where most have no choice but to buy fruits, vegetables or meat in supermarkets, but this is the problem of today in much of the world where people have simply rejected self-sufficiency as one of the foundations of a sustainable society.",

If people are going to keep feeding well and get nourished then farming should be taking serious. The unfortunate thing is like you have mentioned also is the land or space to farm. Really, development is taking over land space for agricultural activities. Whether vertical farming or not, the government need to really take proactive measures to secure lands that will be meant for agricultural purposes and no interference of any capital projects, building of roads, bridges or other structures should not be done in such areas. Just like there is game reserves, the government should put land out and secure them for the purpose of agriculture.",

      "body": "Vertical farming may be good but not applicable to every crop. I think vertical farming is good in areas or places where there's limited agricultural land so instead of importing crops from other places, they can produce their own products. However, the downside of this is that it can be too costly. Let's take an example of my country the Philippines, which has agriculture as the backbone and the main source of livelihood in our country. There are a lot of lands available here with a great population of farmers, plus the weather that allows us to produce various crops we can export to other countries. But the issue is, there's already a lack of financial support from the government to help our farmers. The farmers can't even buy their own supplies for their crops and they're already earning a small amount of money for their hard labor. Adapting to a vertical farming won't be a practical choice for them. Vertical farming might be great for individuals who want to have their self-grown plants at home yet with limited land. Also for people in urban areas since it can also contribute to the environment, having a small farm in the city. Or countries with advanced technology or with great government support.",

It might be effective in subsistence farming where food is grown for household consumption, but it can not feed a large number of people. Vertical farming requires some skill, and can also be expensive and difficult to manage. Not many farmers will be interested in this kind of farming. I have always been an advocate of organic farming because it is healthy and maintain the natural soil texture, but I am afraid that the future of agriculture is now inorganic farming. With the effect of global warming, climate change, conflicts, and other problems I am afraid that the world will keep depending on genetically modified seeds for high harvest, syndetic pesticides, and chemicals to assist farmers produce more from limited farmlands.",

It's literally depends on your suitability or what you prefer since both needs maintenance and consistency. Farming is actually difficult if you don't have the knowledge in farming since it will be affected by the weather or the environment since we're talking about growing a living organism.

Because then the agricultural area can still stand.
