  "content": "https://twitter.com/OptimismGov/status/1579515114071302145\"When we first launched the OP token, we announced that the total supply would inflate at a rate of 2% per year. However, when we deployed the contract, the rate was mistakenly set to 20%. Later today, weâ€™ll be updating the contract logic to the intended 2%.\"https://twitter.com/OptimismGov/status/1579515115631968260\"There was, and will be, zero impact to the planned token supply as a result of this fix. Inflation of OP does not begin until next year. No new tokens have been minted or moved, and no tokens were ever at risk.\"",

      "body": "Good thing if the team managed to cope with the mistake. It simply shows how professional they are with their project. But I hope this won't mess their project in general 'coz for sure there will be impressions especially to those who are really meticulous with their prospects.But I'm a bit curious of how will OP team be able to control the inflation rate and using it as an advantage, annually. I mean, adding token supply could put the value at risk right? (correct me if I'm wrong). I do get the point that low inflation rate could stimulate a balance and healthy economy for a token but I guess it would be better if they will be focusing more on the aspect of attracting investors to theur project first.",
