If only other requests came with scripts, perhaps they would be implemented as well.

Many passwords (like \"123456\") have the same problem. Using 12 words instead of a password would already be better, but I bet then some people would use their Electrum seed phrase on different websites.Isn't it annoying every website has their own password requirements? Some have a minimum length, some a maximum. Some require certain characters, others refuse them because their system can't handle it. I always have to adjust the parameters of my randomly generated strong password for each site.One common thing is that many websites try to educate users on password security. That shouldn't be necessary, it should be common sense by now. Why don't they teach this in school? Probably because the teacher uses a simple password too.And the end result of many people being unable to keep a strong password secure, is that many sites introduce unsafe recovery options. A secret question adds an attack vector, a second email address adds one, and SMS password recovery adds another attack vector too. On top of that, the login on many websites gets more and more annoying: password, email verification, captcha, SMS verification, and more. They keep adding more hoops to jump through.It gets even more annoying if my bank demands I change the password every 6 months. Many people use a few different passwords that they rotate, and after every change they try every password they know, thereby basically compromising all of them!TL;DR: people should take their own responsibility and keep their passwords secure.I'll end my rant now",

Using 12 words instead of a password would already be better, but I bet then some people would use their Electrum seed phrase on different websites.This is one of the reasons why passwords haven't been standardised, which is a little bit related to your rant about having different requirements. The thing is, if you have a standardised approach to passwords, it almost encourages users to make it the same password as everything else. For example, if you were to implement a seed for account recovery, you probably don't want it to be 12 words, since as you correctly pointed out, people would just automatically use their wallet seed. So, by requiring 14 words or 18 words you'd at least add additional entropy to their seed. However, some would still probably use their seed, and just add additional words. Honestly, I'd prefer to have less than 12 for that reason, but then you're potentially making your forum recovery weaker. So, it's a balancing act for me, and I know this shouldn't be the case as this should be taught early on in people's lives, but we've got to somewhat think about clashing with other security implementations which might actually make our entropy weaker.",
