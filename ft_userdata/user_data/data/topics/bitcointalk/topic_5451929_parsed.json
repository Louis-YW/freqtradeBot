      "body": "I do believe that my verbal communication skills are efficient and clear because I do not have to be repeating myself. Despite that English is not my first language I made sure how to properly pronounce and annunciate when I am at work. When I was younger, my English was very poor and did not know very many words. I started practicing by watching English soap operas and listening to the radio. By the time I was able to get hired for my first real job, I felt more effective with my communication and confidence because I was able to communicate without any language barrier. In my current job I must communicate effectively to ensure the job gets done the first time with no mistakes. Certain job assignments require me to constantly be in communication with other people.",
