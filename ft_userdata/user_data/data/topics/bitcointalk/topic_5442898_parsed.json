I did participate in many slot challenges (multiplier contest) a lot in the past (done by duelbits) and I enjoyed it obviously because I do like playing slots and the offered reward was nice. In this crypto casino industry, the most popular challenge is multiplier contest but you can try something different because you have many different type of games. The thing is, multiplier contest is the most easiest challenge to be implemented in most casino games.",

There could be players who relish challenges that revolve around certain games or errands, whilst others might gravitate towards more overarching challenges. Of course there will be lots of feedback that will be conveyed and of course it will be different because every gambler has their own goals and ways of thinking.Maybe there are some gamblers who really like the challenges provided by the casino with a prize at the end of the challenge if someone can complete it.But the challenge will not be carried out by gamblers if the level of difficulty is not comparable to the prize that has been set or can be said to be unprofitable.I myself, if a challenge doesn't have a big prize then it's better for me not to take part because it will only waste time.",

What could be improved? Maybe these can be linked to some random events in real world, or I think it would be funny have some prize to be assigned also while in play and not only at the end of an event.-Best rewards is always monetary prize. But i think it could be funny also receive some \"badge\" specific discount in withdraw, multiplier in some games and some others similar activities ...",

My suggestion is to add other cryptocurrencies like MATIC polygon and XLM because both have cheap transaction fees and also please add bonus promotions new user deposits or other promotions that make gamblers feel at home playing at this casino.  Incoorperating new crypto currency features as a means of payment is a good idea because most gamblers prefer some certain chain than the other and this sometimes comes in as challenges because they would need to bridge or passing through the process of converting through a third party exchange which they might not be comfortable with doing and causing more transfer fees or charges like wise gas's fee too but when there are other chain option available, potential gamblers would definitely not waste time in the long process but rather, do direct transfer from which ever chain or Wallet they are holding and this would save them time and stress involved. Lastly, I would talk about the customer care service because this is another vital department of every organization. The way they handle situations, respond to their customers determine whether or not the customer would still remain doing business with them. It takes no or little time for a careless customer care to destroy the hard earned reputation of an organization which has been built for a long time. With this, I would suggest you handle your customer care with utmost sense of belonging because that department is another engine room of organizations.",

Challenge here should be something related to competition between players where players will be required to deposit and wager to complete the challenge. I dont think people will be trying to use multi account for such challenge especially if the challenge is hard to achieve with hard rules as well.

This is another point to make mate. It is not very funny though that you are playing with a bit related accounts owned by one person cheating and draining your hard earned resources. Even though you are ok with it, it is not alright. I wish a Chet detector not could be used for tracking multiple accounts holders on casino sites that would be fine. But looks cheaters these days are now wiser so your noticing them means you going extra miles to equip your casino with high grade wares to tackle that issue of cheating. These cheating accounts are the reasons casinos some times act funny by banning and suspending accounts with claims of defaulting their rules without considering the fact that they are denting their reputation just to safeguard funds for themselves in running their casino.",

Are there any specific types of challenges or rewards that you would like to see?A casino challenge would really be an interesting feature, to me. This is one of the best form of gambling, because it takes power away from the casino and gives it to its users, users compete against each other and not against the casino, though the casino still would earn a small percentage in the bets from both users, but then, this believe that *casinos always win* will no longer be there since right now, it's no longer the user against the casino but against another fellow user, and the most skillful or luck user wins.A specific casino challenge I would like to see is a card game, let me see a casino challenge where users play card games against each other, there is this card game called *whot whot* in my country, it's an interesting card game that can be played by up to four or more players at a time, I would love to challenge other users to this game.This is the game on Google play store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tonielro.naijawhotfree",

I know this is insignificant but in my country in which there are people who liked to gamble online but doesn't have much idea what Crypto is, you can recommend this site to them to explore. Additionally, on different platforms there are only limited events or games you can choose from, but we know that people not only those heavy gamblers, wants to gamble occasionally just to have fun or within their friend groups.",
