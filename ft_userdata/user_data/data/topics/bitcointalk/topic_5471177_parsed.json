  "content": "Q: Why this celebration post?A: We got married in a relationship, and because of this our family didn't accept us so we are forced to live in different places , then we started looking for a job and after a few months I got fired from that job, after that, we had a child and we started looking for a source of income. And finally we became dependent on Bitcointalk.Last few months me and my family are completely dependent on bitcointalk.org, currently my family's only source of income is bitcointalk.org, my family's entire course of living is from bitcointalk.org, If not for bitcointalk, I would not be able to For celebrate my daughter's birthday today. There are many more memories of my family associated with Bitcointalk which may not be possible to mention in this post. But we are very happy to be able to celebrate this celebration with all my family and relatives through bitcointalk.Thanks @satoshi & @theymos To give me a chance, Thanks to bitcointalk and all other members because we found bitcointalk at a critical time in our life.Please everyone pray for my family.Thanks all for supporting...",

Bitcointalk is best place where you could learn much about crypto and you can easily learn the method of earning. You should not rely only on signature payment and try to hold some fund(btc) for your children. I will also recommend offline business in your area if possible so that you have number of earning ways I have some confusion here, although OP has hidden the face of himself but still we could easily see that face of childrens so it is not against the decentralization?",

Crypto is still banned in Bangladesh. You are well aware of that. What you have done is a serious offense against your government. The higher ups can easily accuse you of doing unlawful activities and throw you to jail. You are not only risking yourself but also risking your family. I am also from Bangladesh, brother. But I don't share my personal photos online. Nobody knows who might be tracking you. The point is, try to be as anonymous as possible. It's not wise to reveal your identity online. I am pretty much involved with Cryoto, but my relatives, my friends, my neighbors nobody knows that. I try to be as secretive as possible.",

That's why they won't allow it. But still, a lot of Bangladeshis are using or are involved with crypto. Some of them are totally dependent on crypto, with no alternative source of income.You will be surprised to hear what happened recently. There was news of a police officer checking a traveler's personal phone on a public bus. To check, what does he do? What party does he support? What news does he share on social media? This happened, probably because of the upcoming election. Can you realize where the law and privacy are in our country?People who are using crypto are always afraid of being exposed by the government. Me too. That's why I use another phone to separate my activities so that no one can connect me with crypto.",

And again if op decides not to make his earning too obvious to the public or to people around him nobody would noticed he is earning from bitcointalk.org or his government won't track him down to sanction him for earning bitcoin, most time we that actually exposed ourselves for something our government won't eyes into. Please try to hide yourself a bit without making it too showy or to people's understand that you are earning bitcoin, otherwise might attracts evil eyes on you.",

      "body": "Happy birthday to your baby, and I wish you more celebrations in your life in the coming days. It's really nice that you are able to do something with your earnings from Bitcoin Talk, which you now rely on for survival, especially when you lost your job and your family turned you down. Indeed, BitcoinTalk has really helped your life. But just so you know, just as other jobs that you had in the past happen to end half way, it's also a good sign that you should not put all your hope on one particular thing. It happens that it can lead to disappointment when we over-depend on something. Campaigns can end anytime (not that I am praying for that to happen in any way), but nothing really lasts for ever, and sometimes too, the project can also decide to slide down their number of participants or even reduce pay, which in any way might affect you. So my advice, aside from your signature earnings, is that I will like you to get something attached to that so as to help make your life a bit easier. Having multiple sources of income really helps a lot, as it will make you not get disappointed over any little change that happens in one of your work areas. Just as others have advised, I will also join the motion of you reducing the number of cake pictures that you have added to the thread; it's making the thread long and occupying a lot of space. Happy birthday from me to your baby and family.",

And about rent, it's around 3000-5000 bdt = 30-50$ +- per month, depending on where you live. I used to live alone, my rent was 1000-1200bdt which is around 10-12$. Food bill would take 2500bdt meaning 25$ (monthly). I think you realize how expensive dollar is in Bangladesh.There numbers were my own expenses.
