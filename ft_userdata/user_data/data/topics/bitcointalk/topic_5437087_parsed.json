  "content": "Have you ever asked yourself what will happen if you lose your smartphone somehow ?I as a person stored so many important information on my smartphone e.g four different crypto wallets, passwords for centralised exchanges, 2fa Auth codes, e.t.c and I can't help but think what will happen if I lose my phone somehow what will I do? So I started practicing how I will recover my files, at least the most important files and information, Have you ever thought about this? Just do it once you will understand how scary things could get if you lose your phone, my advice for you is to pretend you lose your phone and try getting back your files, be prepared for the unexpected, some people don't think about this until they find themselves in the situation.Be the boss of your own files and assets, practice backups and restore, there are many ways you can do this, improve your security skills and take control over your assets. Since I use a Xiaomi smartphone it is very easy to do the task on this phone OS compare to others but there is another I tried with a rating of 4.5/5 from users review is MobileTrans https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/phone-backup-and-restore.html These aren't the only ways but some works better than others  Mind you, smartphones only stores app data, not recovery seeds and private keys, and I do not recommend typing your recovery seed in a note pad on your phone memory, the best place for crypto wallet seed and private keys is OFFLINE, also practice reinstalling your wallet and inserting the seeds to make sure you write down the correct seed before storing assets on the wallet.",

For high amount of money, you can try and setup a paper wallet, cold storage wallet or for ease you can buy an open source hardware wallet. For low amount of coins, you can use mobile wallet for it, but your seed phrase should be offline on paper backup in two or three different locations, not on phone, not to talk of an app on phone or computer.It should be an offline backup for seed phrase and the likes, while you can do backup for files that people can see in this way that you meant.",

      "body": "Good one Charles-Tim, the backup of 2FA Authentication apps works differently, with Google 2FA Auth you need another device to back it all up by scanning the barcode or clicking on export, I use Authy instead because it back up all my 2FA code into the original mail address I use on my phone to activate Playstore and Gmail, you can also make the choice yourself if you want to use another mail. Not everyone can afford a hardware wallet but yes it's recommend to write down seed phrases somewhere safe, I do not and will not recommend storing wallet seed phrases on your phone either through PDF files or .DOC files, they get compromised easily this way, few mobile wallet allow 2FA that's why the point is pointing to mobile crypto wallet too.",

Authy uses online cloud, the reason I can not use it.As for google authenticator, you can not be able to screenshot the QR code which can be used as backup, the QR code is used for export purpose, to export your 2FA into another device.The account you use 2FA for will first generated you backup code, you can backup the code directly on paper. The authenticator that I do recommend is Argis Aegis which is open source. Although google 2FA makes export to another 2FA app on another device easier, but it close source.",

Anyone who can afford a smartphone should also be able to afford some cheap hardware wallet, because I think that HW is even cheaper than a lower class smartphone. I know that some people have problems buying HW because the problem is caused by customs, maybe the manufacturer does not deliver to their country or there is some other reason, but using a smartphone for crypto trading, storage, and downloading various applications is nothing more than a big risk.I think there is still a recent story of a member who lost or had his smartphone stolen with a significant amount of cryptocurrency stored in it, and of course he had no backup. If you are already using a smartphone, then be especially careful with your every action, because every mistake can be expensive.",

You should have your 2FA app on another device entirely.That's the main problem that users have their wallets and authentication app downloaded on the same phone which posses a great risk in case your device is lost so the person who finds it have direct access to your wallets.This is why it's advisable to have separate devices and I would recommend air gapped devices for such purposes which have no internet connection to them for more security reasons.The users download malicious apps and clicks on various links on their devices which can also give scammers access to your wallets somehow but we need to be more concerned about our privacy.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 28, 2023, 09:15:07 AMNot everyone can afford a hardware wallet but yes it's recommend to write down seed phrases somewhere safe, I do not and will not recommend storing wallet seed phrases on your phone either through PDF files or .DOC files, they get compromised easily this way, few mobile wallet allow 2FA that's why the point is pointing to mobile crypto wallet too. If not hardware wallets then use non custodial wallets like Electrum to store your funds as it's also safe but backing up your seed phrases is a must which should be offline in any ways.Having them on mobile phone in any format is risky as it can be compromised by lot of ways so you can engrave it on steel washers or write them on paper and safely backup them on multiple locations in case one gets wasted.Most people avoid writing it on paper as if it comes into water or heat contact the seeds written over it can get erased or due to it's wear and tear nature.But keeping your seed phrases offline is must without using any phone.",
