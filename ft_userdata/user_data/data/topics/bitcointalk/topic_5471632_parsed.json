  "content": "The two methods in sports betting which most of use but are not aware of are the top-down or bottom-up betting method. In top-down betting you find a reliable source of information which is often sharp sportsbooks and look for better odds elsewhere which creates positive expected value bets. The advantages of top-down betting is that those who have used it have a proven track record of success, and with it, you only need minimal sports domain knowledge. The only disadvantages I have seen with this method is that it can be time-intensive and may lead to limitations with certain sportsbooks. In bottom-up betting method, you form your own opinion about the odds by building models or using qualitative insights and tools, which can be particularly useful in less efficient or derivative markets. The advantage of this betting method is that the bettor has a greater control over their analysis, it is suitable for inefficient markets. However, it can require more resources, domain knowledge, and may be harder to quantify the edge. I think most punters are bottom-up bettor. So which are you, a top-down or bottom-up bettor?",

Whether someone is a topdown or bottomup bettor depends on how they like to do sports betting. Some bettors might choose one way based on their skills and the kinds of markets they like. Your decision relies on your betting style and how much you're ready to put into it. Maybe bottom-up bettor too. I'm more of a fan of the sport than a bettor and then bet based on the analysis of the influencers I watch. But I also compare my analysis to them and then come up with my own.You have to be a fan of the sport in order to be aware of the game and its players. It's not going to be fun for someone who is not a fan and yet bet on the matches he won't even watch.",

I really do not like to follow other peoples advice blindly, but i do look at it and if they provide some advice/info that makes sense then i encorporate that into my own.",

Perhaps with basketball rosters and team 1 is dominant with the games but happened to not have their star players on their finals would I still bet on them? either strategy would be good especially if it works on your bets or that you are winning from doing so. There are orhers as well wherein players are using odds as their determinant. We are all guessing in gambling industry and we just happened to have different viewpoints on how we would take a bet. either would cause risk but what’s important is where you are comfortable using with.",

      "body": "I guess most of us here are on the latter, \"bottom-up betting method\". We form our own analysis without checking what most tipsters are putting. This could really based on our experience on that particular games and we have followed it since we are still very young so obviously we know the teams and the players already and we have in our mind what could be the outcome of the game and where are the value bets.Nothing is wrong with top-down though, but it's very hard to find someone that reliable as a tipsters. Unless you have been following him for years and you know when to follow him with his tips. So you can check those websites and then see how it goes with your bet as well to see if you have the same analysis.",

So which are you, a top-down or bottom-up bettor?Since it is a long time I don't consult any tipping site or predictions site which I used to back in the days I guess I am a bottom-up bettor as I only believe my insights that I have about each game.In Champions League I have a 4 games parlay in both teams to score,Lazio and Celting came true while I wait Newcastle and Porto which I believe have high chances of coming true,I have also another parlay with 4 other choices that are over 2.5 goals and usually this is what I bet not only in Champions League but every where I play.So far I am happy for the overall results that I am getting,winning about 2-4 bets with odds over 10 in total during the week brings me profit,so yeah I am a bottom-up bettor based on your description.",

In the end, we are fighting with the bookmaker's opinion (even if it is based on cash flows = the opinion of other players) and the margin which is against us. If I see distorted bets, then I easily bet on them. Placing bets according to a top-down scheme is very difficult, almost impossible, since you do not have accounts with each bookmaker and round-the-clock time to track quotes and catch a change of 1-2%.",

Whenever I bet on NBA games, for example, I have sufficient knowledge to be somehow assured that my bet is reasonable and has a good chance of winning. Of course, this includes opinions of others especially experts. Having said this, I rely on whatever analysis I come up. But sometimes I have my own analysis that I don't care what the experts are saying. Watching a DOTA II game, for example, you may hear commentators speak of how one team's picks seem stronger than their opponent's. After consideration, if this still goes against my own way of looking at it, I stick to my decision. So I guess that makes me a bottom-up bettor.",

And I will immediately place a bet but not bet big money. When I want to bet using my analysis and looking for more information about the match, I will look for it as best as possible to know which team can win. The most important thing about the two methods above is that you know how much money you want to use to bet and stay within the limit you can afford. That will save you from bigger losses so that if we lose, our losses will not be big.",

Relying heavily on external sources, even if proved, can waste time and put one at odds with some bookmakers.What about the bottom-up method, which shouts autonomy and control? Control brings responsibility. Modeling and qualitative insights are difficult. It takes time, money, and game knowledge to use this strategy. I believe the ideal sports betting strategy is a hybrid approach that makes the most of both worlds. Opinions on that? When we can use both methods, why limit ourselves?",

If that's what it's going to take for me to consistently win games and earn more money to put into my bankroll, I'd be willing to do the homework and spend time learning the things about that sport. Bottom-up players should not let their ego take a hold of their judgement though, cause if you got a little ballsy and bet on games that you don't know scat about, you're going to most likely lose even if you're the biggest fortune-teller on the planet lol.",

Like basketball for example, it's one of the most well known sports here in our community and we have a lot of members who bet on that game (including myself). And if you look at the tips, it's almost that it is based solely on their analysis and not on someone tips or something. Maybe there are a few here who find some reliable tipster and follow them, it might not be a good idea though as that tipster might encounter some losing streak or be on a negative for a certain sports.",

You just freeze more money and the average profit is the same if you just look for value and place a bet. Somewhere on the forum I saw a topic in which this was shown purely mathematically. And do not forget that one way or another bookmakers do not like those who hedge bets, it is clear that it is up to the player where, how and how much to bet, but this can cause problems in some bookmakers.",
