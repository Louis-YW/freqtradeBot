I know the admin panel isn't the greatest UI as it's very old system.  If this site starts gaining traction I'll port everything over to Apex v2 with the same admin panel as the coin mixer.Considering LBC recently closed, this could potentially be a good earner as millions of people were left stranded--------------------If desired, you may also view my resume to get a better idea of me at:    https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdfIf anyone here is good at marketing, has good experience and is interested, drop me a note and let me know a little bit about yourself.  Contact me anytime via e-mail at matt@apexpl.io.",
