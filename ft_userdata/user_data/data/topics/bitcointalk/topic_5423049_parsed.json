Participating in airdrops is like a game of chance. Before around 2018 I think, airdrops are just very easy to complete, and even how shit the airdrop is there is some value before, it was not really tiring at all if you can get a few bucks on it.But now, it's already new, very low chance to get an airdrop now but if you are lucky, you can get 1-time big time airdrop.That's why I am really amazed by those people who are airdrop hunters, they are dedicated to it.",

It's safe to say that this type of airdrops always went big especially if it was from pretty reputable exchanges like Uniswap. It was actually a hot pic on uniswap for people to got decent airdrop from that.Quote from: tech30338 on November 25, 2022, 02:10:31 AMWhat are the good side of doing airdrops?The good thing about airdrops is even without money , or what we call funds to buy tokens coins or bitcoin you can still have a chance for airdrops by doing small task and only consumes time and also small knowledge although some will post the process to do the task which makes it more easier, and then wait for further announcements from them.Sure it requires little to no effort. But majority of them are just worth nothing and even if it just takes like few minutes of your life, I would prefer to use my time to something else or participate on something uniswap-airdrop like later if there is any.Quote from: tech30338 on November 25, 2022, 02:10:31 AMWhat's the bad side?Well its not necessary that bad after all since you don't need to put in money just to have airdrops, but if you just participate in an airdrop that's just there to gather mass information of the people joining the airdrop that is just free, you just wasted time and effort, and also you will be just wait for nothing, imagine you have join like for example 10-20 airdrops, fill-ups forms sleeping late is so tiring.What's the ugly side?I think this was not a good one after all, since you have fill up forms and use your email etc. for this one, you might get expose, and be in the batch of emails that can received malware links, scam links, that might accidentally click, and be a victims of ransom or any form of crypto or hackers getting your precious funds hard earn money or even your other priceless coins maybe eth bitcoin or any other altcoin.Feel like both of them are on bad side so there is nothing to compare about. Do it with your own risk.If you just want pray with the luckiness of yours to get decent airdrop there without caring about the importance of identity then go for it, but I would recommend to not to do that.",

Every airdrops has bad side, but this one should be expected as the project might not be sincere or real. Some of them uses the hunters to spread thr goodwill of the project and create buzz bu if its not work up then they will simply abandon it. Thats how a new project usually do since they trying to make community and expand it to more and only will give a valuable drops once it become successful.",

But after that time and until today when the bear season hits the market, airdrops are useless anymore, many of them are scammy and have no market value.

I can say that the form of the airdrop has changed, forms like telegram tasks and spam tasks on social networking platforms like the old bounty campaign are gone, it is replaced by testnet or retroactive. About the reward, I don't know if it's big enough for you but for me getting 2k to 3k for an airdrop is huge for example aptos paid to hunters. These are just the notable projects and there are many more with rewards ranging from $50-100 per campaign.",

That will be too risky to do as we do not know how good the project will be in the future and better to search for the other airdrops if they ask you to fill out the KYC. It is not worth risking yourself by sending them your documents or doing KYC for just a few dollars. Even if the project can explode in the short term, it is still not worth doing KYC.",

Mist of the airdrops I've joined simply asked its participants to create an account on their platform and invite friends on their telegram channel (most of the time), also to share news about their project on instagram and such. There are also contests such as fanarts and more. The only thing which is bad on airdrops, are non-paying projects. Even if you didn't lose money, time is important also the effort of participating. But all in all, personally, I've made a decent amount from airdrops before. Nowadays, I think rewards are not as big as with previous years but as long as it is paying, I see no other reason to participate especially to those who are lacking money to invest.",

I have seen bunch of people have been trying hundreds of airdrop and most of them scam. It's up to 97% airdrop were scam. There was a little percentage like 1% from total airdrop refuse to distribute the reward. Some airdrops were also forcing their users to fill KYC which must be avoided caused by it has potentially to be a scam airdrop that will steal your personal data through airdrop.",

Hence they are stuck with a huge stash of such coins in their wallet but no market to sell in.Also because the supply is so abundant after the airdrop has happened and because the use case of that coin is bullshit, the demand for the coin is almost nil.
