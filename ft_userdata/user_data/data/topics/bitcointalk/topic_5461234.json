  "content": "Hello,I can't connect to my electrs, not even from the machine it's running on.My HW/SW:Intel NUC, 1TB SDD, 8GB RAMUbuntu 22.04 LTSBitcoin Core 25.0.0Electrs 0.10.0I've tried connecting with both Electrum wallet and Sparrow, both directly and via SSL, and none of it worked. I set up SSL by following this video.Electrum says nothing, the bullet just stays red. Sparrow says \"Connecting to tcp://127.0.0.1:50001...\" and won't connect.In electrs I have logging set to DEBUG and get these lines, respectively:Code:electrs::server] 6: recv {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"server.version\",\"id\":0,\"params\":[\"electrum/4.4.5\",\"1.4\"]}andCode:electrs::server] 5: recv {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"server.version\",\"params\":[\"Sparrow\",\"1.4\"],\"id\":1}Logs from Electrum client:Code: 2.54 | I | n/network | connecting to 127.0.0.1:50002:s as new interface  2.54 | I | i/interface.[127.0.0.1:50002] | looks like localhost: not using proxy for this server  2.54 | I | n/network | starting taskgroup (0x7f89842504f0).  2.54 | I | storage.WalletStorage | wallet path /home/sov/.electrum/wallets/test  2.54 | D | util.profiler | WalletDB._load_transactions 0.0010 sec  2.54 | D | util.profiler | AddressSynchronizer.load_local_history 0.0000 sec  2.54 | D | util.profiler | AddressSynchronizer.check_history 0.0001 sec  2.54 | D | util.profiler | Daemon._load_wallet 0.0103 sec  2.79 | I | w/wallet.Imported_Wallet.[test] | starting taskgroup.  2.80 | D | util.profiler | AddressList.update 0.0000 sec  3.02 | D | util.profiler | Imported_Wallet.try_detecting_internal_addresses_corruption 0.0003 sec  3.02 | D | util.profiler | ElectrumWindow.load_wallet 0.0593 sec  3.16 | I | gui.qt.history_list.HistoryModel | refreshing... reason: update_tabs  3.17 | D | util.profiler | Abstract_Wallet.get_full_history 0.0003 sec  3.17 | D | util.profiler | HistoryModel.refresh 0.0099 sec  3.19 | D | util.profiler | AddressList.update 0.0000 sec  3.89 | I | gui.qt.update_checker.UpdateCheckThread | valid sig for version announcement '4.4.5' from address '13xjmVAB1EATPP8RshTE8S8sNwwSUM9p1P'  5.70 | I | gui.qt.ElectrumGui | starting Qt main loopIn Sparrow logs there is nothing.Any idea what's going on?",

I don't know electrum though What falvor you are on, In case you don't know if the port is open. have you scanned it with nmap? sudo nmap -sT -p- 10.10.8.8How to open a port:https://www.howtouselinux.com/post/linux-command-open-a-port-on-linux",

And I didn't change anything.I've also successfully connected from another PC on the same LAN to my electrs via SSL.It wasn't about the ports, and Bitcoin Core was indeed fully synced.I think the issue was electrs still compacting the DB.When electrs indexed, the DB took 60 GB of space, then it started compacting and the DB kept shrinking. Last night it was 44 GB and I still couldn't connect. Now it's 42 GB and I can connect.The `starting txid compaction` message in electrs logs was the telltale sign, but it could have been clearer as there was no indication of progress and it took longer than expected to complete. My Bitcoin Core synced in under 72 hours, I was expecting electrs to be done within hours, and that most of it would be the indexing and not the compacting.",
