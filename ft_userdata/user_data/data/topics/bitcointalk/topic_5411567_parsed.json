WHAT IS WAY TO MAKE OURSELF AS NFT EXPORT/ WHERE I CAN SELL NFT WITH DIFFERIANTE WAY/ HOW I MADE AWESOME NFT/ You can easily sell them mostly on the NFT marketplaces like opensea. It's the most known and common marketplace for NFTs and if you're looking for a \"different\" way then you can just go back to the usual method of selling it through P2P but this is a harder way. It's like selling directly to those people that have the same interest as you with the NFT that you're trying to sell.Quote from: gullobhai on August 29, 2022, 06:55:07 AMWHICH NFT HAVE WORTH(SIMPLE,3D,ANIMATION)I'll give you an hint. A simple rock NFT was sold for $1.7M.",

It's basically a usual wallpaper but since it was using minting contract and then the wallpaper can use it to minting NFT and the wallpaper will have a unique code generated from the minting contract. So, if you wanna create your own NFT and then you can try to search some articles that will told you about how to generate your own NFT like this. You need only wallpaper with PNG format to be able to minting it. https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/non-fungible-tokens/nft-minting/",

I don’t see any specific category of NFT that excels on the current market because all of them is going down so if you are just planning to enter in hope to earn huge money to your new NFT idea then I suggest to postponed it for now because today is not the best day to release any investment opportunities in the market.",

Don't get me wrong but doing this is not a profitable idea. Instead of making NFTs hoping for something huge, better make yourselves comfortable in buying/accumulating potential coins rather than making yours. In this way, you are making yourself pretty easy, and yes, less hassle on your side. Whether you like it or not, investors will soon forget about NFT and your project will no longer be seen.",

Most people who are success sell their own NFTs with high price or the collection is the one who have power (Follower) or paid promotion to some influencer.The reality people bought NFTs for flipping the money, that's why they targeting NFTs from a someone who have power. So, If you don't have power (Influence) you cannot sell any NFTs even your NFTs is really good.One another things, the momentum of NFTs is already reaching the peek. You can check by google trend.",

And also you need a good reputation so that many people will get attracted on what you are offering to them so better work out on your portfolio first and create demands thru your supporter so maybe for now its better for you to build a community first before planning to rush all things here.",

If you are still new with the NFTs, better to keep on searching and look for every kind of NFTs. If you already have the idea now you can decide on where to put your money, NFTs are good but I think invest only on those who have the real usage in this market because most of the NFTs are just here without any utility and that's why most of them failed to rise.",

But the question is, how good is your design and graphics and it is something unique in the market? Because as others have said, it seems to have been saturated as well, just like the previous hype on altcoin market and then it will suddenly die down. And as far was we have seen, if you are one of those early birds then for sure he will more money out of it, jut saying.
