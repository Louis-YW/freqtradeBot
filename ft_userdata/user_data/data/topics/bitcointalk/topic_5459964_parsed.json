The idea behind the establishment of democracy may have been to bring general progress to the activities that influence the policies of a nation. However, maybe that idea has been hijacked by greed and desperation. The democratic system of governance has never been productive in the Nigerian political sphere and Africa at large. Until greed is eradicated from the heart of men, nothing will change regardless of whoever becomes the president of Nigeria.

Perhaps make we hope for the very best because God dey.Your last statement says it all “perhaps make we hope for the very best because God dey”. This is a statement many citizens don’t believe in any more. They’ve totally lost hope and confidence in this country to be better again but that’s not how it’s suppose to be. No matter the circumstances and hardship we face in this country, we don’t have any other country asides this and it is we ourselves that can make it become a better and condusive place for us all to live in. Despite the complain and hardship faced by many Nigerians, some people still don’t feel it and they’re still living their normal life, not because they’re not affected but because they’ve lost total dependency on the government and found a way to fend for themselves. These are not political people, but just a patriot Nigerian that have prayed for a better nation day and night but couldn’t help to make himself useful to himself and the family first. We are talented, let’s not wait for the government to intervene first if we have other means of helping ourselves.The country is comfortable to live in if you abide by the rules and regulations and not take part in illegal activities. The cost of living here is still considerable than other countries most of our people run to for a greener pasture. As we continue to pray for a better nation, let’s strive to make ourselves useful for the nation and our family too.",

Check out the amount(5 billion naira) wey FG bring out to caution the removal of fuel subsidy for the whole 36 states, make you and I just d look how the sharing formula of the palliative go be. Whether we go get a single penny from am. The huge money wey d FG brought out, go still end for our corrupt politicians hand. At the end, dem go tell us one or two stories of how them share am. And you think sae, for this our country make we hope for the best. Abegy that best of a thing no d happen anytime soon. You better begin to prepare yourself financially for the worst that is about to happen. Na my yarning be this, from me to you.
