I can post an auction and leave it be and come back and declare the winner, you can't do that witha raffle it takes more work and time, neither of which are free, so I have been told by a trusted and reputable source that the general rule for raffles is to set the price around double the value. It's all relative to how much you value your time really. That is why some raffles stall or fail I guess, in any case this one is going for CHEAP!",
