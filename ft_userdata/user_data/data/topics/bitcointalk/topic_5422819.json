Most of them a based on assumptions and not backed by facts. Elon Musk's comments are irrelevant because he is not a true Bitcoin believer. Bitcoin has passed the stage where tweets or comments from celebrates like Musk would have a meaningful impact on its price. Bitcoin is gradually becoming independent from external forces. Like you rightly said, our responsibility as true believers of this great cryptocurrency is to keep hodling until we come to the end of this challenging period. If I have extra money, I would take advantage of the low price and invest more on Bitcoin.",

Investing in bitcoin requires patience, trust, and not worrying, its price may pump at the end of winter or next year and it may reach more than $40,000. It is only a matter of time, so all we have to do is HODL bitcoin and never sell at all costs because the results of that holding will really be worth all this waiting. Just be optimistic.
