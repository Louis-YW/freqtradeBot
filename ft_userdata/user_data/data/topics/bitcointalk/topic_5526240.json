  "content": "I am leaving now, good bye bitcoin world.I see how my species is, I no longer want to participate.All forms of currency are greed, but if you are going to use one maybe you should make it fair?There is no reason that people born today are born into a 98% premine and in 100 years 100% premine.There is no reason that we do not all have the same stake or hashrate.I know what bitcoin is, it is to keep these $hit heads running on the unlimited hamster wheel.The fiat buys all the coins and miners at any price and can they can make your hashrate irrelevant. The bankers still win.I created 1000 homes and I do not own one.I create millions of pounds of fruit but can't afford to buy any.I no longer want to participate.I will be waiting in the afterlife for you.You will build me timeless homes and create me unlimited food, I will make sure you get bloodied up everyday at work with a beating sun or a freezing winter.Work (may) set you free, but for what you did to me here. Made me eat my own shit in prison and denied me my meals, sprayed me with LSD so you can force inject me, cooked me in a oven, while you claim my ancestors did it to yours is a joke.I did nothing but create food and homes, and play some video games.Good bye, for now. See you in the real reality, you showed in your temporal testament what you would do there, here. Your eternal karma will be just.This is my last message to you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhykQLVbJso",
