  "content": "New article on Xenomorph malware.https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1634131991216914432?cxt=HHwWgICwyeqYza0tAAAAThe Xenomorph v3 version is much more powerful than the previous ones that were previously discovered.The software targeted several banks Chase, Citibank, American Express, ING, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and other banks from around the world, as well as crypto wallets: Binance, BitPay, KuCoin, Gemini and Coinbase.\"Xenomorph v3 is currently being distributed via the Zombinder platform on the Google Play Store, posing as a currency converter and switching to using the Play Protect icon after installing a malicious payload.\"QuoteThreatFabric has included a list of all targeted banks in the appendix of its report, but it would be too long to present here. In addition, 13 cryptocurrency wallets, including Binance, BitPay, KuCoin, Gemini, and Coinbase, are targeted by malware.The most noticeable addition to the latest Xenomorph version is the ATS framework, which gives hackers the ability to automatically extract credentials, monitor account balances, make transactions, and steal money from target apps without requiring them to perform remote activities.Instead, the operator merely sends JSON scripts, which the Xenomorph interprets as a list of activities and then carries out on the infected device on its own.According to experts at ThreatFabrics, the [ATS execution] engine utilized by Xenomorph differs from its rivals due to the range of programmable potential actions that can be included in ATS scripts and a system that permits conditional execution and action prioritization.One of the malware’s ATS framework’s most outstanding features is its ability to record third-party authentication programs’ content, circumventing MFA (multi-factor authentication) safeguards that would otherwise prevent automated transactions.One-time codes can be obtained from Google Authenticator by extracting the relevant codes (ThreatFabric). It concerns that Xenomorph may access authenticator applications on the same device as banks, who are gradually moving away from SMS MFA and advising consumers to use authenticator apps instead.In addition to the aforementioned, the new Xenomorph has a cookie stealer capable of stealing cookies from the Android CookieManager, where the user’s session cookies are kept.In order to fool the victim into providing their login information, the thief launches a browser window with the URL of a reliable service and the JavaScript interface turned on.The threat actors steal the cookies, allowing them to hijack the victim’s web sessions and access their accounts. A significant new malware that entered the world of cybercrime a year ago was Xenomorph, an Android threat.It is now a far bigger threat to Android users all over the world after the release of its third major version. Users who download apps via Google Play should exercise caution, read reviews, and perform background checks on the publisher because of the app’s current distribution method, the Zombinder.https://informationsecuritybuzz.com/xenomorph-android-malware-steals-banks/",

I even heard about this Xenomorph Malware, But the first Xenomorph Malware was detected a year ago in February 2022 and has recently undergone a more advanced update with full features.https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-xenomorph-android-malware-targets-customers-of-56-banks/Feeling that nothing is safe anymore, when it's the same class as Google Playstore, with Google Play Protect, you can be tricked and infiltrated as a popular application that is widely used and in which malware is injected. Somehow the criteria that Google Play Protect has so that applications injected with Xenomorph Malware can escape.Even popular applications such as Cleaner and Fast for android phones, Keyboard applications and the like, are the most downloaded in the hope of being cleaner than Malware but instead, they fall into a trap.SMS and 2 Factor Authentication can also be penetrated, which will be very dangerous.Many lay people only use smartphones and don't pay attention to what applications are downloaded, and sometimes when visiting some websites or installing game applications, there will be advertisements that download applications automatically, this is very dangerous.Extracting one-time codes from Google Authenticator (ThreatFabric)Process of stealing cookies (ThreatFabric)Hadoken Security Group claimed ownership of Xenomorph Malware in May 2022Using a Discord Content Delivery Network (CDN) hosting service, it is not uncommon for malware authors to use services such as Discord CDN or GitHub repositories to hide their products invisibly.All security or Anti Virus companies seem to have to immediately update their Database so that not many victims suffer losses due to this Xenomorph V3 Malware.I am also an android user and start to be wary when I get news like this. Tried checking some apps and uninstalling useless apps.",

      "body": "Scary stuff. I don't remember hearing about this type of malware before, and I as sure as hell don't want to come across it.I have always guided myself by not being overcurious in installing apps that aren't essential. That has never failed me yet. People have become so lazy and want dedicated apps for every little thing they use in their life. This malware spreads through a currency converter app. Why would you need to have that installed on your phone? You can literally enter USD to EUR or any other currency pair and get rates from Google. If you want even more precision, use something like xe.com. Or check the rates at the website of your bank.I was having coffee with a friend at a bar recently. And as we were sitting there, the guy was browsing the Play Store and selecting apps he thought looked interesting. I asked him what he was looking for and he said nothing special, I just feel like testing some new apps. That's just inviting problems in your life.",

      "body": "I think it is also worth paying attention to the fact that the Zombinder application itself carries a big threat. According to the data, this software \"allows attackers to associate malware with legitimate Android applications, forcing victims to infect themselves, while maintaining the full functionality of the original application to avoid suspicion.\"QuoteAn interesting aspect of the campaign is the darknet service, which the researchers dubbed “Zombinder,” which offers malicious APK binding of malware to legitimate Android applications.Zombinder launched in March 2022 as a malware packer on APK files, and according to ThreatFabric, it is now growing popular in the cybercrime community.The APKs used in this campaign vary, with the analysts reporting seeing a fake live football streaming app and a modified version of the Instagram app.These apps work as expected because the functionality of the legitimate software is not removed. Instead, Zombinder appends a malware loader to its code.The loader is obfuscated to evade detection, so when the user launches the app, the loader will display a prompt to install a plugin. If the prompt is accepted, the loader will install a malicious payload and launch it in the background.https://impreza.host/new-zombinder-platform-binds-android-malware-with-legitimate-apps/As an option to avoid such troubles, the use of Linux systems again arises. As far as I know, these two software programs apply to Android and Windows. Although, of course, phone users need to be very careful with the installation of different programs. Since, according to the data, even the Play Market cannot guarantee the safety of users by allowing masquerading programs into their service.",

Some new app testers are indeed very vulnerable because we also don't know how safe the app is, even users also register their devices to be able to receive Beta Tester apps that are still not even released to the public and only those who register can get the app. This will indeed invite higher risks, if the device is the main device used to install wallets and some other important applications.

Apps coming from unknown sources are a threat, everyone knows that even your mobile warns you of that before installing, but what if the malware is installed from a trusted source such as the Google Play Store as mentioned in the opening post? That could be a serious threat for almost everyone who even doesn't install apps from outside Google Play Store on their android.People will need to avoid installing unnecessary or even unknown applications even from trusted sources since no one can really know under what kind of apps they hide the malware, and it is too risky.",

      "body": "In my opinion, it has become scarier now in the digital world due to the increasing sophistication and prevalence of cyber threats such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and data breaches. These threats not only target individuals but also businesses, organizations, and even governments. The consequences of these attacks can be devastating, ranging from financial loss to reputation damage and even personal harm.If you suspect that your device may have been infected with the Xenomorph malware or any other type of malware, it is important to take action immediately. Here are some steps you can take:1. Disconnect your device from the internet: This will prevent the malware from communicating with its command and control server, which could further compromise your device and data.2. Run a full system scan: Use a reputable antivirus software to scan your device for malware and follow its instructions for removal.3. Change your passwords: If you suspect that your passwords may have been compromised, change them immediately and consider using a password manager to create strong and unique passwords.4. Enable two-factor authentication: This can add an extra layer of security to your accounts and help prevent unauthorized access.5. Keep your software up-to-date: Make sure that your operating system, antivirus software, and other programs are updated with the latest security patches.6. Be cautious of downloads and links: Avoid downloading files or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious sources.7. Back up your data: Regularly back up your important files and data to an external hard drive or cloud storage service.Remember, prevention is always better than cure when it comes to cyber threats. By following good cybersecurity practices and being vigilant about suspicious activity, you can help protect yourself and your data from malware like Xenomorph.",

This powerful malware phenomenon makes all security companies overhaul their products in order to fight the sophistication of the methods used by the Xenomorhp V3 malware. Android users are indeed very vulnerable because they are the main target of the Xenomorph malware, but it is not impossible that all OS will be attacked. Linux OS users are still small, and not as popular as other OSes. It is not friendly to new users and uses several commands that must be memorized to be able to access it. Although now it has been adjusted and there is a Linux GNOME version that makes it easier for users to be able to access applications on Linux.Currently, the highest OS usage is still dominated by Android and secondly iOS.https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/",
