  "content": "Hi dear Community, Hope so you all are doing great, so first of all let me explain my current problem I am using the Firefox browser on Windows 10 and unknowingly it happened to me. I was using the meta mask extension for the regular transactions in my wallet but that meta mask account was created under an already created account and unfortunately I didn't back up my meta mask added account key. Today my Firefox browser updated and when I logged in again to my firefox there was no extension previously I was using. I was directly accessing my wallet from the browser with a password in the extension.  I have a backup of my previous Firefox default profile but I don't have the key to log into meta mask again. This is my biggest mistake I didn't back up my private key as I wasn't expecting this type of mistake from myself but you know luck was not by my side. Well, I tried to recover the data of the previous profile on Mozilla but it didn't work Metamask asked me again to import the account with seed and as I don't have both of these things I can try to find out Seed as it was just a raw wallet I didn't focus much to protect it but I remember when the first time I installed in browser a few months ago I backed-up my key. Now is there any solution to get back extension data and log in to meta mask without a key or seed all I had currently is the Browser backup profile with some bookmarks and extension files data.Well, I know the fault but I was not expecting a loss of extensions data after the update, so as a result now I will put double attention to the newly added account to export their keys. I am not 100% hopeless as still have previous session data and maybe I can find somehow the primary account seed if there is any possibility then please guide me.  Tip of the Dayback up twice your Added account private key. Don't trust the durability of the Extension data. Never Leave for the Next day.",

      "body": "It’s been a long time since I create metamask account but is it possible that you download your .json file of your wallet since this is a requirements before on creating wallet account aside from saving the wallet seed phrase. Anyway there’s no way to recover that if you don’t have the keys. This is just a wild guess but is it possible to revert your computer updates to the time before your firefox update. This way you might restore your firefox with your account still login.",

Don't trust the durability of the Extension data. Never Leave for the Next day. But you should have the key while creation of your wallet right no matter on which account you added that wallet so explore all the folders and let's see you got any luck on your side.Backing up twice or thrice or more doesn't help unless we keep the backup in hard copy because the system can corrupt at anytime, possibility of hard disk failure is there so the real advice is keep the seeds or private keys in an offline drive or physically written note.",

I was just trying by my all keys and randomly following the Single Seed method to somehow get back to the account and guess what I got it was really a small hope that saved my valuable funds even if they are small in amount haha.Thanks for your feedback to all members i will lock the thread now and i will post my learnings which i think new members should know if they go through such an incident.",
