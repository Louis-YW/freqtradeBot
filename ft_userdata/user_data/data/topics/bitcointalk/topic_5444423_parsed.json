Coinbase is a public American company that's obviously highly regulated, hence requirements will be greatly extreme.But since you know the person, maybe ask her what what Coinbase's reason for seizing her funds?",

I respect coinbase so much and I am curious why such a thing would happen. Yes. If you search for such result on the internet, You will find plenty of users' account was frozen. Coinbase has a big list of reasons that can cause freezing your funds. Most probably, your friend deposited Crypto in Online casinos or paid for adult content and services. Or maybe invested in pyramid Schemes. Most Users do not read the User agreement before they sign up. Coinbase Prohibits Plenty of Businesses like Investment and Credit Services, Restricted Financial Services, Intellectual Property or Proprietary Rights Infringement, Counterfeit or Unauthorized Goods, Regulated Products and Services, Drugs and Drug Paraphernalia, Pseudo-Pharmaceuticals, Substances designed to mimic illegal drugs, Adult Content and Services, Multi-level Marketing, Unfair, predatory or deceptive practices, High-risk businesses. Coinbase itself mentioned why they could freeze your funds: Quote from: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/other/does-coinbase-freeze-accountsIn extremely rare circumstances, and only where required by law or authorized by the Coinbase User Agreement, Coinbase may block or \"freeze\" customer funds on our platform. For example, we will take this action when:We are required to comply with an order from a court or other authority that has jurisdiction over Coinbase which compels us to restrict access to funds.We are required by law to freeze or block assets in compliance with a sanctions program, including, but not limited to sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).For more detailed information, I recommend you read this:[1] Does Coinbase freeze accounts?[2] Coinbase Prohibited & Conditional Use Policy[3] Coinbase User Agreement Read from 6.1 to 6.3 SUSPENSION, TERMINATION, AND CANCELLATION.",

They essentially give Coinbase the ability to close your account and seize your coins for literally any reason at all, and there is nothing you can do about it. For example:Quote from: https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states6.10. Suspension, Termination, and Cancellation. Coinbase may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Coinbase Services, and/or deactivate or cancel your Coinbase Account(s), with immediate effect for any reason at its sole discretion and is under no obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you. You acknowledge that Coinbase's decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your account for any reason in our sole discretion, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to Coinbase's risk management and security protocols. You agree that Coinbase is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you.At any time, for any reason, and they won't even tell you why, let alone let you appeal against it.And as we have seen from several recent court cases and bankruptcy proceedings, the instant coins are deposited to a centralized exchange, then legally speaking those coins belong to the exchange and you have absolutely no claim over them. There are thousands of such users who have had various centralized exchanges simply seize their coins with no explanation ever given.",

I don't understand why OP respects Coinbase so much, but this is the sickest user agreement I have ever read. To be honest, I didn't read their user agreement before today. But I wanted to dig into the reason, and I was shocked. I believe over 95% of Coinbase users don't know about this. Almost no one reads the user agreement when they sign up. If anyone does, I don't think they will end up signing up on Coinbase after they find what coinbase can do. Almost nobody knows what's hiding in their user agreement page. I Believe it needs a particular thread with awareness, and people should know about this.",

These requirements may encompass tasks such as verifying user identities, monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and reporting specific transactions to government entities. If a user fails to conform to these obligations or if their transactions are identified as suspicious, the exchange may be bound by law to temporarily freeze their assets until the matter is appropriately resolved.",

Actually account freeze is the number issue of coinbase before they become this huge exchange that’s is now regulated by the US. The only reason that coinbase will freeze someone account is the potential violation of there T&C. It includes bit not limited to suspicious activity on your account. I believe most of the CEX has this kind of condition for their exchange.I believe there’s a lot of issue like this against coinbase way back 2017 when the first ICO boom in crypto market because there’s a lot of investors depositing on coinbase using fiat to invest on startup projects.",

In it, I point out that their terms quite clearly state that they will lend out, gamble and sell your coins, all while keeping zero collateral, and you have absolutely zero rights if it all goes to shit.

I checked the user agreement of the most trusted (?) Exchange that I use as well. It's Binance. I use this platform to trade with my locals because I do not have other options to trade with locals. I checked Binance and Kucoin user agreements they literally said they can terminate your account and seize your fund for any reason without giving you any explanation. Also, they won't give any explanation to a third parties including the law firms as they already have the rights because you accepted the terms and conditions when you signed up.
