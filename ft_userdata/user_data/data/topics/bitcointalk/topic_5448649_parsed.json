If the bank don't want to accept any money related with Bitcoin, what you can do is trade via P2P and increase your security level in order to hide from getting tracked by your government. You can also move to the other country which is friendly with Bitcoin.",

They are against crypto, but they have not yet made it public that banks should trace all crypto transactions. That does not mean that we should make our transactions known to them that they are crypto-related. The government has always been against crypto, and Bitcoin looks like a trait to them. and not them being a trait of bitcoin. When it comes to the Nigerian government, I believe they are just looking for a way to earn from the crypto industry since they still don't have ways to do trading and involve themselves in it, which is why they are stopping banks and other financial institutions under the CBN from disengaging from it.",

I don't know how banks in Nigeria can get information about bank transfers related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I really think that they have to depend on reports from users together with other authorities.How will Nigerian banks handle those reports from their users?Screenshot from a trade means nothing as it can be faked easily.",

They have tried several methods to shut down Bitcoin, but it has been an impossible task to get control over it. I also recall that, some years ago, the government in my region tried the same policy by instructing banks to forbid any accounts related to cryptocurrencies, and police began to harass those who were involved in it. Despite all of this, cryptocurrency is still growing steadily.Currently, my region has some of the largest Bitcoin investors, and occasionally I get the impression that the majority of these government leaders also own Bitcoin. To this day, I still don't understand why they want to outlaw Bitcoin.",

My bank sends weekly newsletter to their customers and the risk of Cryptos usually appears at least once in a month. It talks about how bad the bitcoin is. They are afraid because if bitcoin is widely accepted, the need of banking system finishes. So they will try every possible things to prohibit the use of cryptocurrency within their remit. Couple of years back, even my government started doing the same thing. But now they have backtracked and imposed 30% tax on crypto transactions.",

But the government losing its grip on the people will eventually topple the government leader.If it's happening in Nigeria, it's also possible to happen to just any country today where people have been enjoying the freedom to hold BTC to which they could support or fund an independent leader opposing the president.",
