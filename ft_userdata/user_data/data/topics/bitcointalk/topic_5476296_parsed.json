  "content": "Hi.I inventoried my old coins, found a very interesting one – Americancoin AMC (fork Litecoin).  Mined by AMC in 2014. I installed an old wallet from 2013. It's fully operational today! The original blockchain. There was an idea to sell some of the coins and revive AMC. We need money and help from the crypto community.The prospects for the development and market of AMC are huge:1. The first attempt to create a national digital coin of the USA.2. After 10 years, the original wallet is alive, the coin is not forgotten.3. Most of the mined coins have already been lost, the value is increasing.4. If you add to any exchange and the availability of modern support, there will be a rocket.I will sell my coins 1AMC = 0.05$. The minimum transaction is 5 USDT. I am ready to send 1 AMC for confirmation before purchase to the buyer's wallet. We need money for the development of Americancoin.I will be very grateful for your help in support (creating a website, block explorer, updated wallet, listing). The reward for these actions can be given now only in the AMC.It is also an original Christmas gift (wallet + coins) .I will share my successes and my thoughts in this forum thread.",
