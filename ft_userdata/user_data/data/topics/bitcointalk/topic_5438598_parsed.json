  "content": "Failed electronic transactions are a norm across most channels, including internet banking, automated teller machines (ATMs) and point of sale (POS) terminals. It gets worse during holidays, which usually come with transaction spikes. A recent BusinessDay report narrates Nigerians’ disappointing experiences with electronic payment channels (e-channels) during the last Christmas holiday.Failed transactions happen when there’s a break or delay in communication anywhere along the flow.The communication failure can come from:• A failure from the issuing bank’s infrastructure hindering its ability to return a message to the switch network within the allotted time.• The switch experiencing a downtime stopping it from relaying messages.• A network failure at the acquiring bank such that it couldn’t receive a status message.• Not having enough cash minimum during withdrawal by the customer or by the pay point machines.What other reasons do you know is responsible for failed cash transactions?How did you tackle a worst case scenario of having a failed transaction?https://www.mariblock.com/exclusive-how-blockchain-is-processing-1-million-worth-of-atm-transactions-daily-in-nigeria/",

      "body": "Internet transactions gone wrong are frustrating. Payments and transactions might be tough to diagnose. Payments may fail for reasons other than communication. Incorrect card numbers, expiration dates, bank information, payment or shipping addresses. Call the bank or company if a transaction fails. Update information to complete the purchase. If the transaction fails, contact the bank or business's technical support. They can help you investigate. Keep calm and try again when transactions fail.",

      "body": "I hate these banks when we're approaching holidays, it's known that people will flock to the ATMs to get some cash. It's a problem that keeps on repeating that they'll never try to do some backups to help depositors avoid those times that the ATMs are empty.Lines in the branches are too crowded and with the covid-19 still around, they don't resolve it but stays with the traditional setup that used to do. It just keeps on happening again and again and I have to deal with all of it.I know that if someone wants to fall in line and avoid it, be early and the same goes with the ATMs but as a huge corporation, this is where the business reprocessing must be done.",

But blockchain proves better as it eliminate errors of failed transactions.",

But nowadays, there are fewer interruptions due to the weather and, more often, a delay or lack of the signal or something like that between the bank and the server temporarily.What disappointed me the most was when I wanted to withdraw cash from the machine, but it turned out that the ATM was short of money and refused our transaction. This also often happens to some ATM machines. And if that happens to me, I will try to find another ATM machine and check my balance. If the balance decreases but I don't receive the money or the balance remains deducted during the interruption, I will complain to the bank.",

I have been in such a situation and it was not a funny one. I had to solicit for assistance from some good Samaritans who understood my situation and offered me help in form of cash to assist me in getting home. Not everyone is as lucky as I was.For a failed transaction I had in a store a while ago, I had to return the items and leave empty handed, how embarrassing!",

It's better we converts our funds to Bitcoin till the country settles the whole shit of Naira cashless policies issues.Until Bitcoin can be use to buy our daily needs, I thnk we need to at least put a minimal savings in banks.  Keeping our money in Bitcoin is good but the moment we needed money, we cannot use our Bitcoin directly and still need to convert it to cash.Banking system in my country is at least good, in my experience so there is no need for me to take extra precaution and just do things I normaly do, save some of my income in Bitcoin and other in cash through bank for the reason that not all merchant accept Bitcoin and need cash to pay for bills and other payments.",

To solve these problems, I think using a mobile wallet is an effective solution, which allows you to top up when you want, solves the problem of not having enough cash, and helps to prevent failed transactions.",
