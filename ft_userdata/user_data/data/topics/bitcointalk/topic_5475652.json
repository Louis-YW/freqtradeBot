  "content": "Yusuf is a humble Taxi Driver in Gaza who has been receiving contributions from the Bitcoin community - now over 610 individual donations - in support of humanitarian relief. He has been showing his Proof of Work by taking photos of water and food distribution in a place where water and food are running scarce. He has provided an incredible amount of proof of work, and Geyser has verified him and his ID (https://x.com/geyserfund/status/1718630415559516654?s=20).This really goes to show how Bitcoin is a grassroots humanitarian bottom-up phenomenon.His latest update: https://geyser.fund/entry/2519Geyser Project: https://geyser.fund/project/wecollectdonationsforsacrificesofeidaladhapalestine",

      "body": "The suffering and despair of the people of Gaza is truly heartbreaking. The world must come together to find a solution to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and provide these people with the aid and support they so desperately need. It is not acceptable for anyone to suffer in such extreme conditions. Immediate action and solidarity are needed to resolve the plight of the people of Gaza. Yusuf's dedication to providing relief in a challenging environment is truly commendable. It's great to see the Bitcoin community come together to support people like him.  The story of the Bitcoin community coming together to provide humanitarian relief shows the power of collective action and its impact in addressing urgent needs. It also demonstrates the potential of innovative solutions, such as using cryptocurrency, to make a real difference in the lives of those facing crisis and adversity.",

This goes to show that bitcoin enthusiasts are not all about the transactions and business of making profit, but also to give back to people that needs help. I also commend the selflessness and sincerity of Yusuf, for being accountable in the distribution of the aid items to the vulnerable victims of war. I hope that the innocent people who are affected and are suffering hardship because of a war that they did not start, should receive needed aid from well meaning individuals, associations and organizations, to stay alive. I hope that the war ends soon so that innocent people in Gaza, can experience peace.",

They suffered a lot. Israel and Palestine war would prevented if the precautions were taken into action and avoid them with all alacrity from Palestine. In any country if you killed another country citizens then you are preparing for real war with them. Because the people you killed are from family and those family people will never be happy so they will definitely retaliate. God blessed the taxi driver for his selfless humanitarian service render at the war front.",

In times of need like these there will be always some people with bad intentions trying to capitalize off the good intentions of others, sadly it is something I have also witnessed happening on the internet.If those people who donated were more clever or more into Bitcoin, they should have asked the person to use a multi-signature wallet, and one of the keys could have been kept by a reliable international organization or even a reliable and trust worthy person, like Vitalik Buterin. Hopefully all the good deed we see are true and we won't lose even more faith in humanity. Good things and love is what is supposed to show in times of anger and death.",

My best guess if that the person being that handle has simply decided not to continue to update with more pictures or posts. Regardless of what happened, we are supposed to always be skeptical when comes to people we do not personally in the real life. Faking images of war zones would not the be the first time someone has done it, still one is not supposed to underestimate the dire and desperate situation of the people in Gaza.",

He has been providing an enormous amount of updates and photos. Check out FumbleBTC, he is helping the project out and providing more details photos. FumbleBTC is a recognized Bitcoiner in the UK space, a great guy. Check out his account for the weekly updates of aid being distributed to people in need.See here: https://x.com/FumbleBTC/status/1733218876811305330?s=20About the account being blocked:I don't believe the twitter account of Yusef is blocked, it has a black photo because of mourning.About using a multisig address Your proposed solution would not work because:1. Skills: The individual us not skilled enough to use a multisig, they are using custodial lightning which in this context is ideal for speed, micro-transactions, low fees, efficiency and easily spend.2. Tools: They don't have a computer, only mobile device.3. Reputation: the individual has already ammassed a lot of trust and reputation. 4. Technically: Lightning is better than Bitcoin onchain because it's cheap to send, enables micro-transactions, makes it easy to use for spending. And Geyser makes it possible for donors to spend onchain and for Yusuf to receive on lightning.",
