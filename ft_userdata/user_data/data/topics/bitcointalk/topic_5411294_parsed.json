      "body": "Going with what @MinerMEDIC said. I have fixed cost power so it's better for me to have a miner that will last forever, then the latest & fastest that dies after 18 months.I have stuff running that if WAY past being able to generate any BTC if power was a concern.Also, as a side note 110V power would be nice. Yes, I know the rest of the world uses 220 and building for the little bit that uses 110 is probably not worth it. But not having stuff that can run on 110V or lower amps for the rest of the world does limit some small home / hobby miner sales.-Dave",

The electricity costs more than ever before Which does kind of loop back to my low power QUIET mining comment.3 or 4TH at a couple of hundred watts to act as a small space heater.10TH as a slightly larger space heater. You can still make them dead quiet if built properly with modern chips. Bitmains R4 came out 6 years ago and did 8.5TH and 850WWhat can you build today that will keep my office warm or the back bedroom of my condo without blowing out my ears?-Dave",

      "body": "120V Power would be fantastic - So many miners are built to run on 3000+ Watts and require 220V+ Electricity. Scale them down! Same chips - less or smaller hashboards, smaller form factor... I understand that it is easier from an electrical engineering stand-point to design something for the most \"ideal\" electrical input. However, North America (the USA especially) is a massive, potential, market and there are VERY few companies taking advantage of the, nearly, untapped potential that resides here. That's my 2 sats anyway.... Aside from that - I personally try to seek out build quality and products that will stand up to the test of time.",
