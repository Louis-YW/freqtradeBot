So please help me out with materials, be it books, video, links or any other source that contains info about bitcoin.Thanks in advance.First of, you're highly welcome to the forum, as a new bitcoiner, joining this forum is a good start to aid you in your Bitcoin journey and adventure. Although this forum is more of a decentralized forum as your personal informations should stay with you, such as your real name and so on, so be guided. Secondly, as a new bitcoiner, I might have some important tips that'd also be of help to you, I'll quote myself in a comment I made on a similar Thread in the Beginners And Help BoardYou can also Click here to get all the tips and guides you need as a beginner and a newbie on the forum and as a Bitcoiner.1. LEARN ABOUT BITCOINyou need to learn as much as you can about Bitcoin, you'll not be told everything here so you can't rely on one source to learn about Bitcoin, read books, watch videos, look for helpful articles and PDFs that'll give you more insight about Bitcoin.2. START LITTLEIf you ever feel that with the knowledge you've gathered, you're ready to start investing in Bitcoin, as a newbie I'll advice to start with little amount until you've really understood the market then you can put in more money.3. KNOW THE NATURE OF BITCOINYou need to be familiar with the fact that Bitcoin is a very volatile asset so before you start investing you need to be ready for the ups and the downs. Sometimes you'll experience a DIP, in times like that you should remember that there has been times in the past that Bitcoin has experienced even greater DIPS to help you overcome the fear and anxieties of a DIP and to also help you make the right decisions of never selling during a DIP, and also when you experience a Bullish Trend in Bitcoin, you shouldn't always expect the market to always be like that, else you might end up being disappointed.4. STORE YOUR BITCOIN SAFELYI'll also advise that you look for a very safe wallet to store your Bitcoin, such as a Hardware Wallet. ( Highly recommend). Because that's the primary thing, if you're jeopardize the safety of your Bitcoin then you jeopardize everything as well, including the safety of your investment.5. WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERSScammers are working tooth and nail everyday, coming up with new strategies and innovative technologies just to swindle people's hard earned money so you need to equip yourself with enough knowledge regarding how to avoid being scammed because if you're not careful you can loose your funds to a scammer in a twinkle of an eye.6. LEARN HOW TO DCADCA simply means Dolar-Cost Average. As a Newbie, you might feel Bitcoin is very expensive now and hard to invest in, if you're thinking that then DCA method is for you, with DCA you can store up enough Bitcoin without breaking a sweat. It's process where you simply a bit of your income, be it on daily, weekly or monthly basis, you can choose a percentage of your earnings and use it to buy Bitcoin, just like putting money in a piggybank and before you realize it, you must've saved up enough Bitcoin for yourself, rather than waiting to have the money in bulk before you can invest.And it's never too late to invest in Bitcoin, everytime is the right time, so if you have plans to invest, don't let anything stop you from joining the moving train.There goes, I hope these tips would be of help to you.",

I was impressed to see the action of knowledge that you first of all identify your local community, or, I will say, who ever introduces you to this forum, try a lot for you because here you are allowed to even write in pidgin, so feel free to ask any questions and you will have to give the right answer or a referral to where you can obtain effective information.From all indications, you have already been provided with the needle and effective links so far to know more about bitcoin and how it works.

So sad to say, but ranking up is not something that is easy, as you just said, but is a long-term activity. You can't get merit so rapidly and think about ranking up because, with merit, even if activity is not there, you cannot still rank up the account. What I will say to you is to learn for now not to focus on getting merit; if not, you will end up omitting the forum rules like plagiarism and many more, and your account will be tagged or even banned from the forum. But I will share the rules of the forum for you and also things you need to know about merit and other things for your stay in this forum.You can click the follow * Newbies read before posting it will guide on how to operate on the forum.* Everything you need to know about forum activities,account ranks,merit system *  Bitcointalk rules and guidelines",
