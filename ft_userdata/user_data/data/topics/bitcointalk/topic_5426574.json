      "body": "You earned that amount of merits because of what you do which is helpful in its own way. However, some people can't do that but there's a way to earn merit evem though the merit count is not the same as what you have earned. Let's just say, you can earn 250+ or more within 7 months. I was not very much active in posting before but I managed to earn 250 merits within 7 months and that's why I ranked up to hero member rank. My point is, you don't have to be someone else to earn the same amount of merits, less or more merits but as yourself and see how many merits you can earn through your own way and effort. Congratulations.",

So congratulations to you.In fact, you have been willing to donate to buy laptops for the needs of students in his class, as well as teach in what you know about bitcoin that you publish on this forum, not only on the forum but out there as a teacher who teaches bitcoin technology in your area.",

It's not easy for some people to get 785 Merit in one year and you did well despite the many obstacles you had to overcome.the more you are rejected and ignored, the more excited you are to make quality posts.not only merit, in one year you also make 1000 posts and of course, but that's also more because some posts were deleted. you do not give up easily and continue to be active every day. You should be an example to other new members that the merit system is not an obstacle.congratulations on what you have achieved so far, your journey is still long and this is a start of what you started.",

Most of the new user in the forum really don't know that its just natural for one to be fully grounded in the forum. Firstly this kind of success really inspires and tell you that nothing is impossible to achieve only if you know and you are willing to learn and put your knowledge into action. Firstly the forum can be very confusing for those newbie like myself that are not willing to put effort in learning about this wonderful innovation which is BITCOIN. As a newbie all you need to do is learn and understand more about the cryptospace so you can be a contributor in different ways in which can be helpful to yourself and other through which you can earn all the benefits of this wonderful forumThis should be our motto as newbies if he can do it we all can",

If a newbie stays active and read the forum for 365 days they'll definitely within these period make a content that will fascinate the whole forum which will result to multiple merits. I appreciate your quality efforts and having a deadline is also important in getting good results. However, members, within themselves, should also learn to celebrate their activities counts just like others celebrate merits especially if the activities were useful to the forum. You are doing a great job too and people learn from your posts, though you may not be merited enough by members, but your quality efforts and precious time spent here matters. Don't relent because you've got lesser merit counts, some have more activities while others have more merits and we all need them to rank up. Not all good posts will get merited by many users, but it counts in the activity section and you only need merits to rank just like OP needs activity count to climb up to hero and legendary rank respectively. The difference is waiting for time and people. Keep it up mate, the knowledge you've harnessed within a short period is quite commendable.",

Some of the posts you created in the forum, were stories of how you raised awareness of cryptocurrency in your community.This is only a big accomplishment in my opinion; the next day's celebration will be for a thousand merits and above.
