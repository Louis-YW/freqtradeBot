  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm sorry if I write with errors, I do the translation through a translator because English is not my native language. I registered on this site about 2 weeks ago to bet on Rolland Garros, baseball and basketball. Passed 2 levels of verification on the site. Since May 21, she has made deposits of more than $100,000. Here are some of my additions:1. https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc63728abc2e4e67654a181cc620fe1f9506b25b8365e928b04a461011c8ec7b52. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1314e03025d3b9046b4623b276baf5dd2f8b42fc0a857a77a329e3bd556925243. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x944ebe77e3a5310edfdbcd7017ffdfda6cb581f03fe7c6f93bba98d937eeab9cI made withdrawals for about a total of about 80 thousand dollars, mainly due to winnings in the slot machine. I was also assigned the status of VIP platinum 3. After that, they made me the maximum bet on sports top events is very small and I wanted to withdraw my remaining 40 thousand dollars, but I was not allowed to do this. I contacted the chat and they told me that I need to write to them by mail, so I did. I waited for an answer by mail for exactly 5 days and they told me that I needed to send a selfie with a sheet of today's date and with a passport in my hand. I sent them everything they need. After waiting 3 more days, I received the following response:Hello,You have been banned on all of your accounts as you have been found guilty of breaching our terms of service (creating multiple accounts) as stated under item number 11. Prohibited Uses - Personal Use. Please see https://stake.com/policies/terms for further reference.Regards,StakeI have no idea what multi-accounts they are talking about, and why was it necessary to ask me for my selfie if they are not going to pay anyway? My account is currently in the \"withdrawal stage\". But any conclusions are prohibited. I wrote to them in the chat, they also answered me that I need to write to them by mail. But the mail has been ignoring me for the 4th day. Please tell me who has come across this site and such an attitude towards customers? where should i file a complaint against them? I tried to write to Curacao, and I'm waiting for a response from them. I am also attaching some of my sports bets in case they suddenly want to accuse me of fictitious matches, as well as other participants in this forum. All bets were on top events.1. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33689466&modal=bet2. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33712166&modal=bet3. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33709748&modal=bet4. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33652169&modal=bet5. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33713208&modal=bet6. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33708570&modal=bet7. https://stake.com/sports/home?iid=sport%3A33802000&modal=bet",

But contests could be cheated by such accounts. Then I think prizes paid could be kept by Stake during their investigations, but there is no reason to keep all his funds.

Check their Email response and my summary about it.It isn't due to match fixing or rigging. From what I have seen from past cases. Stake is usually descriptive with such cases and leave nothing for interpretation(I checked previous allegations upon stake on this forum).This one stands out as a genuine case and seems very 1xBet'esque.Quote from: aew on June 04, 2022, 02:56:07 AMThank you for the effort. Many signature compaign users will come to say stake is big blabbla I see a lot of scam accusations against Stake last few monthsHope everyone to becareful. Maybe stake has joined the likes of 1xbet, casumo and other scammy fiat books. I hope not.This is what I mean by 1xbet'esque : https://youtu.be/ABj7peI_R2M",
