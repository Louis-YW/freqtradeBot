Please everybody should vote for the right person, we should not sell our rights to anyone no matter how huge the offering may be. I have suffered a lot in the country comprising you no matter how rich you are, we all have suffered in this country. Both known strong parties can't afford to lose this coming election. The labor party candidate isn't forcing anyone to vote for him because the new Nigerian is in the hands of the youth just as our ex-president GOODLUCK EBELE JONATHAN did. So please let's do what is right. My vote goes to PETER OBI, the obedient and well-respected man.",

Good to hear that your vote goes to PETER OBI, everyone has the person wish to vote for, this coming election will be a very tough this time, due to some things I'm seeing, but what I have for my fellow people is that any one who try to give you money or bribe you, collect the money and vote anybody of your choice, now that money is the issue of Nigeria now, I guess no one will follow you to where you will put your tumb and vote and see maybe you vote for who you are giving money to vote for, don't let any one to use you this time.",

There is this popular saying which says the devil you know is better than the angel you dont know,  i think every Nigerians are just shying away from the main question which is ::how sure are you that the actual person in your mind is the right person to vote but i guess its just the frustration everyone is currently experiencing in the country that makes everyone think your chioce but the funny thing is that we can actually have the person in mind to vote.",

I love the statement the president made earlier about being neutral which is the best and also doing the right thing by voting for who we feel is the right person, not just voting because of our selfish interests, most of us have forgotten how to do the right thing just because of what we get from this politicians, every decision will make will all affect all of us lets not allow history repeat itself, I believe Nigeria can be better again the pen is already in our hand to write a new story.",

Nigeria and Nigerians needs stand up for better offer than the kangaroo politics we have been experiencing in the years past. Lots have happened and lots are yet to be corrected. This is the opportunity we have now at hand to make a quick correction if we care otherwise it will forever hunt back for the next eight years as it has been the tradition of our  politicians to rulefor two tenures before the thought of handing over comes to their head. This is the right time to make the right decision on who to pilot the affairs of our great nation to the height and position it ought to be. We made mistakes in the past and we have learnt our lessons in the hard way. Now is another opportunity at hand to made and effect the change we have longed for. The table is now in our court to make possible changes we want and longed for.Do not sell your conscience. Do not sell your vote.Vote wisely for a better Nigeria.",

This election is what will determine if Nigeria sufferings will continue due to bad leaders or it will come to an end. I see Obi as a man that is different from the other two candidates, I believed if he is given an opportunity, he will put smiles on the faces of Nigerians.",
