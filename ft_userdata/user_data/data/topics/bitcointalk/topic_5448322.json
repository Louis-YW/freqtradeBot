Thanks to this post, I can now be prepared  Lets see if the same kind of sell-off occurs this year.On-topic.

The month of financial year end and month for the Government to get paid enormously enough! I am not sure how much taxes they are levying on US people but most of the countries are going in the window of 30% tax slot. That’s vigorous taxation just to remind everyone that Government is still in charge of everything and they would go to next level to stop the crypto transaction. However, this time there won’t be much taxation. People might be buying more around this time to hide their assets and manipulate the sheets. USA will surely gain more capital as compared to rest of the world considering the number of crypto related businesses and individuals based there.",

If you don't like them fight to change them don't complain about them.If I pay you $65 to wash and wax and detail my car you are supposed to declare that as income. If I give you 1 gram of gold (worth about $65) you are still supposed to declare it if you convert it to fiat. If gold goes to $100 a gram and you sell it then you are supposed to declare it at $100.

I don't know what you realized from the report but IRS. lied to us. there really does need to be some overhaul of the tax system. i'm surprised no one has done anything about it but tax returns are too complicated and take too much time to \"figure out\". it shouldn't be that way. thousands of rules, probably tens of thousands. who needs them?  QuoteThey lied us that they aim at wealth people but I see it differently.

That’s vigorous taxation just to remind everyone that Government is still in charge of everything and they would go to next level to stop the crypto transaction.so you make 40% return in 2021 and pay 30% taxes on that profit. 2022 rolls around and you end up buying back into bitcoin and losing all your profits you made putting you back at break even EXCEPT, you paid 30% on your profit that you won't get back...that's why it's not so easy to make money \"investing\" in crypto. not if you're having to pay 30% in taxes. kind of a waste of time in my opinion...  now if there was a way you could invest in crypto and not have to pay ANY taxes at all then maybe that could be a possibly interesting thing to do. but you still have to be careful and not lose money.the short version of the above is this:the house always wins. and you aren't the house. the house is the irs for example. no one wins except them in the longrun when it comes to paying 30% on profits in trading. there may be profitable traders but they are in the minority and even they lose more than they should because of how things work...",

Enjoy.  You might owe some taxes too so make sure to pay them.It's unbelievable how far Bitcoin has come, and now it's time to deal with the outcomes of its triumph! The IRS has always been searching for something to tax, and it was just a matter of time before they targeted Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are now being recognized and are making a name in the financial sector, which is truly exciting. However, with every new opportunity, there are new obligations to fulfill, and paying taxes on your Bitcoin income is unquestionably one of them. This reminds us that regardless of how innovative and groundbreaking the technology is, there are still rules to adhere to.",
