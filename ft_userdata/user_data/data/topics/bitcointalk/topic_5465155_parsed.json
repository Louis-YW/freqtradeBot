While you have stated there's a posting quality, but most of the thread in your forum are created by AI or copy pasta from the other sources, do you think it's a high quality? with such payrate every user will create many thread as much as possible and wouldn't replying someone else thread.Quote from: https://iforumtalk.com/office1. Spam: Is not tolerated on the forum and it will be removed immediately. Sending unsolicited private messages is considered spam, and you will lose 1000 Points per each report. If you continue to spam the forum your account will be banned for life. Stay safe!3. Posting quality: I don't want to see gibberish or posts that don't offer helpful information. Your posts should be quality enough. They need to be helpful and supply the reader with valuable information so they can join the site.",

I think it's better if you can be transparent to share the TX ID.I see you changed some of your rules, but it's still incomplete, how much is 500 points? before you said 1000 points is equivalent to $1, I guess 500 points is $0.5.If you still use different payout for creating thread and reply, people will choose to create the higher one. I don't like scale reward system, quality post is subjective and you can choose to pay with lowest reward.There were many questions above, try to reply it @OP.",

You made it specific there is no range now my advice is to add more categories and interest I also noticed there are no sub-boards is it possible to create sub-boards so members can post more, the more interest the more active your posters will post, and what kind of script are you using, I'm sure it's not an SMF and how do you monetize your forum or are you planning to monetize it after you see a lot of activities.",
