It's great to see new people interested in cryptocurrency.While Bitcoin has gained significant popularity in recent years and there are many people who believe in the potential of decentralized currency that can provide greater financial freedom, I am suspicious about the data you provided. Can you provide any sources to back up the claim that 80% of the world's youth are interested in Bitcoin? It is always a good practice to research and verify any claims before accepting them as fact, and I don't believe that I have ever come across this information before.",

It's a good thing to find Op's thought on bitcoin and the exaggerated percent of people he claim were aiming to have a currency like bitcoin. I don't understand it the same way you just did. Bitcoin is so good a currency for people to admire it or think of a currency that operates like bitcoin before Satoshi launched it. They're lots of digital money that existed before bitcoin, like e-gold, a sign that people craved for a currency that would operate without a middle man. However, my agreement with his exaggeration is not even, just that I understood his view differently. The fact that people mostly youths waited for a currency, bitcoin, doesn't mean they'll be interested in bitcoin when it launched for some reasons best known by the individuals. \"You asked for change, we gave you coins.\" - Casascius",

For example, if 9 people under 40 buy bitcoin and one over 40 does the same you have 90% of the buyers being millennials, but there are still only ten buyers.Quote from: decodx on May 13, 2023, 07:34:49 PM\"420 million crypto users\" is approximately 5.3% of the total population of the world, that's not even close to 80%.With the mempool clog happening with just 400k transactions, I really believe the 400 million! \"users\" number is pure bull!",

Can you share the source of your information?I think many other people who have no connection to this forum are responsible for the promotion and development of bitcoin, but of course Satoshi was active here in the beginning and shared his vision of bitcoin.This forum is still relevant as a source of information about bitcoin and as a gathering place for the crypto community.",

Nearly all work has a purpose and I believe leads to the fulfillment stage of responsibility, but the question is how the former system can allow people to save money value in the future and almost certainly lose more value.While bitcoin is a generation that can be adjusted to save the value of the currency you have, the method is very simple, namely by buying and holding according to the desired time period.

On your figure of 80%, you should understand what that means because I don't think that bitcoin has spread and has been adopted by everyone all over the world. Read and understand any article that you are reading and don't just jump into conclusion. The second advice for you is that when you are posting from an article,you should always drop the link,so that we can also go through it and have a proper understanding of what you are saying.
