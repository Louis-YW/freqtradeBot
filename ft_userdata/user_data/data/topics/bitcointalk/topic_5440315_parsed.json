Each 80 byte is a block header of a block in chronological order (so you have the block height this way too).

I tried on my device, but mostly it only contain zeroes. I suspect Electrum only request needed block header rather than all block header.Yes, although I simply read the file as a byte stream not with hex editor, the file starts with the genesis block's header ie. 0x01 followed by 35 zeros (previous hash) then 0x3b (merkle root) and so on.I've had my Electrum for a very long time though. The file was created in 2019! Maybe they changed some stuff like after the introduction of checkpoint header.Edit: Yeap. They've changed things. Downloaded Electrum 4.3.4 on Ubuntu and let it sync, even deleted the blockchain_headers file and let it be downloaded again. In both cases the file contains all zeros up until block height 747936. Which is a waste of space if you ask me!!! This also means what I explained above won't work using newer version of Electrum.",

I just found out Electrum protocol also have API call which can ask single block header[1] and block headers starting from specific height[2]. But those API call i mentioned could be used as alternative to obtain block headers.[1] https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-methods.html#blockchain-block-header[2] https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-methods.html#blockchain-block-headers",
