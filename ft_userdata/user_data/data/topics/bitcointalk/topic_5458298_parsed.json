Some people for my area don pack their cars and dey enter public transport because if you buy fuel for 530 na air filling station go pump for you. If na waka within your area,you go for use bicycle but if na far place bros you no go for use bicycle if not muscle pull go catch you and you go reach very late. Now wey we dey raining season I no think say bicycle na good alternative because if you starch your shirt come dey ontop bicycle rain come meet you for road na e be say yawah don gas.",

      "body": "Bicycle riding is aerobic exercise good for the body to stay fit and in shape, and also good for short distance journeys below the range of 0-1km due to the increase in fuel price, because this is not the first time the price of fuel is climbing up to #600 to #1k per litre and yet we still survived and we will keep on surviving despite anything that happens, as we Nigerians are good at adapting and we have already adapted to this removal of fuel subsidy long long time ago. Because there is already an update now about how to connect cooking gas to generator to power electricity, and people have started using it, and what remains now go be who go discover how to use that same cooking gas to power car, and I bet you, we go all just leave fuel for them to increase am anyhow they like now.",

That's the problem I have with Nigerians our dependency on one thing is too much, and that is why we are always affected seriously every time the government implements any policy, if we had other means of public transportation the subsidy would not have bothered anybody, However, it appears that 80% of transportation is now done by road, which is not what should be the case. Building rails would make interstate travel much easier. If you look at developed nations, you'll see that they hardly ever use their cars. Instead, they take the train or bus. Bro cycling is also a good idea. If you have enough money, you could just buy an electric bike, which eliminates the need to worry about purchasing fuel. All you have to do is charge it.",

One of the ways wey bosses for offices fit help people durin this hard times na to reduce the working days and institute hybrid work. So unless say you dey work for factory and for some other places wey be say e dey very essential say you come work everyday, I nor see the reason why we go dey go work every day of the week during this time for work wey we fit still dey house dey do. This one na another solution for office people. Factory workers them fit try to dey join staff bus or encourage their oga dem make dem buy staff bus if dem nor get. I drop my own suggestion.",

If na to move within only the city e better pass to dey enter bolts but come to think of this what if rain fall wetin you go do to fast track your movements, knowing say with moto you go dey fast than using bicycle. Well, make i just say anything wey get advantage also get disadvantages because you can't compare both since we are in the wet season and rain dey fall unannounced and anytime wey im like in dey fall. The only way i think say entering moto go even better pass na to dey go another state or another LGA wey far from your city e go worry pass.
