So once the month is over - the 'hero' is chosen. because the nature of telegram chat superstar is more like contest that won by 1 person is understandable they checked it once a month.i'm more curious with task that give reward to everyone like reddit task and youtube task, how long they gonna process the reward?all of my task from 2 days ago are now in \"complete\" status, looks like the checking process take 2 days.",
