By purchasing lottery tickets, players can not only participate in the game and potentially win prizes but also become shareholders in the game. The allocation of shares based on ticket price ensures that all players have an equal chance to become a shareholder, regardless of their financial resources. Moreover, the fixed percentage of Stable Tokens injected into the revenue pool ensures that the game has a stable and sustainable source of revenue to support its operations and future developments. By introducing multiple rounds of LOTS and gradually reducing the number of shares available over time, X WINNER incentivizes early adoption and rewards those who believe in the project's long-term vision.However, our team also employed ChainLink VRF for RNG, and uses an algorithm for the fairness of the game results.

Recognizing the shortcomings of the traditional lottery system, we are introducing the ERC-3525 protocol to revolutionize the industry. This innovative movement in the Web3 space will establish a decentralized lottery organization that is owned, governed, and celebrated by the people.I have considered a decentralized lottery system before, which is possible and very easy to build, just requires marketing to sell that many tickets. However, I realized that since we have so many casinos and gimbling going around in the crypto world, making another decentralized one, which already exists, doesn't really interest the investors all that much. I am not saying that it would be a bad idea, try it if you want to and in the end it is your efforts and your money that will be gone if you are wrong, so I can't say don't do that.However, if you really want to make money from anything in crypto, I would say do not start your own project, but instead help out the people who want to start their own project, that would be more profitable.",
