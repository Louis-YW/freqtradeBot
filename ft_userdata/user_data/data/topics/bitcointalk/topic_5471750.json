They could tag you with any illegal activities they have in mind and seize your property, and you cannot appeal because they have 'evidence' that the crypto you have is used for illegal activities. It seems like they're just trying to make everything easy for their daylight robbery. QuoteOne of the provisions of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill permits the recovery of crypto assets used in crimes without conviction, as some individuals may avoid conviction by remaining remote. The legislation also aims to combat the use of digital assets “for the purposes of terrorism” or related reasons.So it's like robbery, then. They just take your coins and pin you with no crime whatsoever, as long as they believe that you are related--or at least your coins are--to any illicit activity. Sounds super convenient to them.",

All they have to do is get a base of buyers of hardware wallet devices, who probably have bitcoin that should be confiscated. What’s also funny is that they previously pretended that the bitcoin didn't exist and was a nothing, but now they want to confiscate it. Has the bitcoin really become of any value to them now? Soon the governments of all countries will begin the hunt for bitcoiners and the contents of their wallets.Which country will follow UK 's example and pass a similar law? We place bets.",

      "body": "I think that if people commit financial crimes, their funds should be seized proportionately to the damage they've done. But that should account for cryptos, fiat, property, stocks, and anything else a person might own and might have obtained as a result of illegal activities. There also needs to be a conviction to take the funds or an investigation with strong evidence available to temporarily freeze the funds.So, to be honest, I don't get it how a legislation that targets crypto holdings specifically and allows seizing funds without a conviction makes sense. What if a person turns out not to be guilty? What if it's funds that at some point belonged to criminals, but the current holder got them legally and wasn't aware of how those coins were previously used?",

I remember news that Coinbase was the platform used by the authorities, but later it was proven that this may not be entirely accurate after the platform was subjected to prosecution by the same authorities.What is certain is that in the absence of a legal framework regulating the issue, the matter will remain suspicious and may put the authorities in an embarrassing position by asking about the fate of the confiscated funds every time. Today, the United States is considered one of the largest owners of Bitcoin in the world, without any regulatory framework at the present time.",

So you have to be careful when choosing a wallet. Let's use open source wallet software because community experts can reproduce it from source code and review it.Need a wallet?Open source, non custodial to go.Need a wallet review?https://walletscrutiny.com/Exception is if you made criminal activities and you get caught by police like Jimmy Zhong. Then they will be able to seize your bitcoin by getting your private key, of course they get it from you.",

Sounds super convenient to them.How many times have you walked on the street and got stopped by a police unit arresting you and confiscating your 10 phones, 10 kilos of PBX and 10 000 coins you have no receipt for and got pinned a crime you have no clue on you?  Besides, it's seizing! Seizing does not mean confiscating, that can ONLY be done with a final court verdict in the UK!Unless you're proven guilty in a court of law they can't \"rob\" you of your coins!When we have laws about seizing coins, why do we have them, it's turning the country into a police state! When we don't have laws to punish or actively seize funds like in the Do Kwon case, it's the state's fault, those damnd laws are so permissive!!!",

Let us say that a criminal stole satoshis and then used those same satoshis to buy from a legitimate store owner who accepts Bitcoin. He could buy several hundreds of dollars in merchandise and leave. What will stop the UK authorities from knocking onto the door of the business and seize those satoshis from the legitimate business owner ?It is an scenario which could easily happen, because someone who is managing a business may commit the mistake of reusing addresses or using an address from an exchange, from there it would be just matter of time for police to get their name and address.Hopefully nothing similar to that will ever happen .",

There are multiple countries like US, China, Saudi Arabia etc. Not every news come out in open especially from the middle eastern countries. Please don't tell me that it wasn't expected.

And as such, I doubt if the governments will be able to successfully seize/freeze people's Bitcoin, if only such isn't done manually by law enforcement agencies, or another way through holding developers of coins suspected to have fraud and scammed people to repay the scammed funds.",
