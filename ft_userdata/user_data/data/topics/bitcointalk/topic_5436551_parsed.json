Instead of posting an Etherscan link that happened to have a keyword that you recognized using your very limited intellect, how about posting something that explains your suspicion? Make sure to include the reason you want to defame BCGame so badly that you are willing to lie, cheat, threaten, and steal to accomplish this. I look forward to your response.",

Make sure to include the reason you want to defame BCGame so badly that you are willing to lie, cheat, threaten, and steal to accomplish this. I look forward to your response.It's quite serious that you said this to the OP dude, why is that? in what way? He tried to fraud and cheat you you with your friend? is this OP a scammer? I'm just asking.Then when I looked and looked, I didn't see OP's strong basis for his accusation of Bc games. I don't know what OP's deep reason is why he made such a topic here in this forum. And besides, I don't think he'll pay attention to you to answer your question, for sure he'll ignore you.",

Since your profile shows you just woke up after a long period of inactivity.i think the same as you.but after seeing all the posts made by the OP he seems to be a gambling streamer. but I'm not too sure if he really is a gambling streamer.let's see from the post the previous OP made he made a thread about the Paradice scam and after that made another thread this one about BCgame.or just a casino racketeer by boasting all his stories.because I think BCgame is fine, there are no problems at this time, and if indeed the OP can provide a more detailed explanation and concrete evidence, maybe we can understand.",
