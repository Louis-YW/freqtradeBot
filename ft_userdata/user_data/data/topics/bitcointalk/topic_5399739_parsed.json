      "body": "Interesting site, a kind of trading signals for trading. Gem is unlikely to be found with these settings, but for statistics and analytics it may come in handy. At least, this is the first time I've seen such a project. You could also attach charts of price changes to visualize it all and see the mood curve around the project. It would also be useful to bolt in a blockchain, on which the projects are deployed.",

      "body": "But APYs keep changing every minute, hour, day. One day old info and it becomes obsolete,,, why not just use something like 1inch or Plasma.Finance that checks the actual on-chain info in 24 hours or 7 day or 1 month period?Then you always get highest immediately,,, simply by sorting from high to low Not criticizing, just wondering why this is better than a wallet connected to aggregator",
