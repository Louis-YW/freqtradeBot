      "body": "becasue mining is random number finding. even if you change difficulty every block you cant exactly control it to be a precise 10 minute intervalyou will end up getting alot more blocks being less than 10 minutes as soon as you drop difficulty if something marginally went over 10 minutes. thus end up having to offset that next quick block by making the next block alot more then 10 minutes..sometimes the simple fix is the one that works best. as the result of over complicating things doesnt make much of a differenceas for efficiency.. hardware already does this. thats what asics are already doingas for geo location latency. the ping rate of international data is in milliseconds so already not a problem.. afterall once the pool broadcasts to 7 main continents of the first distrbution hop/relay of a solved block its then in enough 'local' regions and there in milliseconds..the issue is that non mining nodes dont connect to other local nodes to only collect block broadcasts locally.. . so less about mining or needing to change mining algo..  and more about geo locating all full nodes to make the peer connect regionally rather than random connects around the world.. problem with this is that it then centralises the network where shutting off some super node connected to pool from america then would lock out all american nodes that connect to that super node. this causes some centralisation issues, identity issues, and also only results in a few millisecond differences per relay.. which if you knew of the \"8 degree of separation\"( 8 nodes distribute to 8 nodes distribute to 8 nodes) 88you would only need a few hops to get the block to be seen by the entire network. so not really a big deal over allit was one of the debunks against blockstream fibre which wanted to organise the distribution of block solves... becasue the risk was if governments were to take out fibre and it would cause node access chaos if nodes relied on fibre too much as the first source of block distribution internationally. so people didnt rely on blockstream fibre for block sources. so it didnt really get adoption.. because the benefits were marginal (milliseconds)",

If you just change it to other Algorithm it will change the whole machine today and need lot of people agree with you. if don't it would be hardfork and made the coin as a altcoin",
