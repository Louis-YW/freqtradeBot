A two days old exchange that have been found, used and trusted already by a stranger?That sounds strange. Anyway, I didn't proceed to check the website as my browser has given me a warning if I continue.",

      "body": "It looks like a complete rip-off of exchanger.ws, and they don't even have any terms at all. I wonder how people are supposed to use a service that doesn't even have terms laid out.It's brand-new, and we have a newbie account shilling about how great the exchanger is. I wouldn't recommend anyone to use it due to the shady behavior. Very likely a scam.",
