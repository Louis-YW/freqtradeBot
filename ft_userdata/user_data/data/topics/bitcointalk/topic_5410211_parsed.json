The citizens know all this",

Obviously the orange piece of lard didn't help by discrediting the election process, so the nutjobs now have one more excuse to not vote like normal people but bitch and moan on the intertubes and dream of the day they can kill people they disagree with.",

The reason is simply that all these events are individual events and have nothing to do with organized plans.The reasons that lead to the civil war are mainly ideological reasons, motivated by ethnicities or religions through various manifestations. This does not seem to me to be the case in the United States now.As for the economic downturn, it is a global crisis facing the whole world, and I do not think a country is able to overcome it even if it fought a civil war.",

While it seems that those issues are present today, they are nowhere near as they were back then. Polarization is going to become a larger issue as we go forward.  The pendulum is swinging further and further in each direction and that means more and more craziness.  I feel like after 9/11 it seemed like Americans were feeling patriotic and coming together, but cooperation and patriotism has been on the downhill slide since then.  This recent rise in Trump supporters has seemed to buck the trend a bit over the last few years, but I feel like that's just a blip.",

If a second Civil War ever begins, it will probably be because the elites calling the shots found a way to make it profitable to themselves.It's the people who can't think very well who join in a civil war. Meanwhile the thinkers among them reap profits wherever they see an opportunity.For example, a shoe and boot maker doesn't have time to fight in a civil war, because he is making shoes and boots for both sides.",
