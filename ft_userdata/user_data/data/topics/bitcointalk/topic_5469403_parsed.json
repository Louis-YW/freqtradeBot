This is probably due to the several threads we have that are all based on the mentioned topics or areas of life. this discussions have become really so extensive that I personally feel that many of us have lost touch of what or why exactly we are here.I don't know about you or what you think, feel or believe, but I personally believe that the majority of us are not here to discuss politics nor economic situation of our dear country, but rather, we are here to find solution to our financial issues, we all wanna make money, become rich, wealthy and maybe powerful, we all wanna afford a good live and also be able to buy those things we've never had..This is why I want us to shift our focus a bit from politics and economics discussion because, being here and complaining about this things all day, week and months wont change anything, but you focusing on changing your financial status in a positive way can indeed change a lot of things about politics, economy and life in general for you.We all are already familiar with Bitcoin as the head and corner stone that holds the entire cryptocurrency market, so I don't need anybody to tell me anything about bitcoin for it is most important for every cryptocurrency investor to have a tangible investment in bitcoin.On this thread, i want us to focus on altcoins, you all will agree with me that diversification is very important in investment, and how do you diversify as a cryptocurrency investor?. You diversify by investing in some really good and promising altcoins alongside Bitcoin.Â And you all will also agree with me that; aside bitcoin, several altcoins have also made a lot of people millionaires out there, I wanna become a millionaire too, and Bitcoin halving is coming, a season that in previous time, have always been accompanied with massive bull run, and this time, the speculation of another bull run is on, we all know how some potential altcoins does rally hard during bull runs, I don't wanna miss any of those altcoins anymore, and I know you don't wanna miss it too.This is why I am creating this thread for us as locals to discuss altcoins with potentials, what is that altcoin you feel will make its holders millionaires in the coming bull run, based on developments, use case and other facts and evidences you have?, please share with us, I am particularly interested to know and find new altcoins to invest in through this thread.And a bit of a Disclaimer here..For newbies with no idea, please don't just go ahead and invest in any altcoin any user post about on this thread, make it of utmost importance to do your own due diligence, research and fact checking before deciding to invest or not invest in any altcoin, investing in altcoins is highly risky, you and you alone is responsible for your decisions, whether it leads to profit or loses, you are solely responsible for the outcome of your decisions.",

You diversify by investing in some really good and promising altcoins alongside Bitcoin.Not totally true because all cryptocurency follows Bitcoin and when you dey diversify you no support diversify for a related market. Assuming altcoins get their own trend and Bitcoin get e own then investing in altcoins when you wan diversify for dey make sense but since na Bitcoin dey control the whole market, anything wey happen to Bitcoin go still happen to altcoins so e just better to stick to Bitcoin. If you wan Invest for altcoins make e be say you wan just gamble or play with your spare money dem make you no go put for mind say you wan diversify. To diversify well you fit invest for landed properties like land or buy houses and rent am out. You fit still invest for the Nigeria stock market as people dey make better block from their.

During bull market, altcoins may not reach all-time-high again or in time. Some coins are shitcoins and some become dead.Let me give you some good examples:Bitcoin increased to $69000 in 2021. Now at $29300Dash increased to 478 in 2021. Now at $31.80Filecoin increased to $430 in 2020. Now at $4.2Solana increased to $259.9 in 2021. Now at 23.17Most altcoins are still 10 times lower than their all-time-high in 2020/2021, but bitcoin is just not more than 2.5 times lower.In 2020, bitcoin got to all-time-high above $19600 of 2017. Its price increased to $69000 in 2021 which is the present all-time-high. There are many well known altcoins that did not get to all-time-high at all in 2020/2021.Examples of coins that did not get to all-time-high in 2020/2021:EOSBitcoin cashZcashAnd many other coins. Like I have once mentioned, your topic is about bitcoin and this can be taken as an investment assets, but altcoins are gambling assets and only use them to gamble. After a significant bear market and if you are able to risk your money, risking the amount of money that you can afford to lose, there are some altcoins to go for, but not for long term investment except ether, but which I will not encourage anyone to invest on due to privacy reasons and centralization. There has been no coin like bitcoin.I can only advice people to invest in bitcoin which is less volatile, most decentralized and most secure.Altcoins are good investment for gamblers. They are worth the risk because with $100, some altcoins can turn it to $1000 or $10000 or more, but likewise can be their fall. I see it as gambling and if altcoins give you high return, best to convert it to bitcoin after making enough profit from them because their fall will not be a surprise as many will even fall back to their prices after this next bitcoin pre-halving period after bullrun.Out of 100% of money to be used for investment, I can invest like 30% on all altcoins but 70% on bitcoin. If bitcoin can get to â¦100 million ($1000000), that is enough for me. But I think bitcoin will increase above â¦100 million.",

For the fact that both bitcoin market and altcoin market follow the same trend and what male altcoin more volatile is the low gem price/value and bitcoin being too expensive to give small investors higher returns,Â  so that makes gambling with altcoin becoming the only preferred diversification of investment even though altcoins investments are just gambling which can either give you high return or total lost. So this needs to be understood,Â  I like the general idea of this thread since there hasn't been much discussion on altcoin investments in the local board but more of Bitcoin discussion and politics.",

But for gamblers, they can use the money that they can afford to lose to invest on altcoins. As it seems that some money someone invested on altcoins, that their prices is increasing more than expected, it can be otherwise. I have a friend that invested just some months ago on a coin called Osmosis because of its 21% APR or something. Bitcoin has just increased from $15000 to $23000 at the time, he thought if bitcoin could reach $30000, that he will make more profit in Osmosis and its APR profit. As bitcoin increased to $30000 several times, this coin continued to decrease in price and the APR is reducing. Altcoins might come with either big surprise or big disappointment.One thing about real estate is the capital that can be used to start it. If you have sufficient capital, it is a good investment.",

It is listed on exchanges like HTX (formerly known as Huobi global) and Bitmart. But your other post about the coin is entirely right. Even if I want to gamble and get some altcoins, Pi can never be in my mined. A coin that its marketcap is not yet known to the public. I think there maybe something shady about the coin.",

To me I just think most of this scams get a large pool of investors through the influencers and influencers make money by post agreements . Also, most of this are not even solid projects Â even some are deliberately created for noobs who literally have no idea of crypto that's where Bep scams come in , scamming hundreds of people on just a token which isn't completely stable. Â But what can we do? Nothing Â this Â is not even applicable only to crypto Â even to grow a nonsense Â account just Â go through an influencer .Â  That's the world we are building today , generallyÂ  altcoins can't be trusted .",
