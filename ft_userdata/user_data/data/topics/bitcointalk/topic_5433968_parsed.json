      "body": "Thank you for the alert.These spying or phishing applications have become very common on the Internet, where the hacker creates a fake application similar to one of the well-known applications (chat - wallets ...) that contains malicious programs or Trojans that steal sensitive data.I don't know if this StrongPity is only spying on phone calls, text messages and contact lists or is it also stealing sensitive data such as passwords and hacking wallets?But regardless, users should not install any software from unknown sources, and it is also necessary to keep your anti-virus software up-to-date. It is also necessary not to keep any sensitive data such as passwords, seeds, etc. on the mobile.",
