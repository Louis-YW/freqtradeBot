  "content": "With the BRC-20 tokens taking up the majority of the block size on transactions sent to the bitcoin blockchain in the past three weeks causing chaos and having users of bitcoin paying enormous fees, one of the first exchanges in the US have had enough.They sent their customer base newsletter out in an email late yesterday about a certain token known as pepe.The email entails and describing the Pepe meme as a hate symbol co-opted by alt-right groups has drawn significant ire from the PEPE memecoin community.source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-calls-pepe-a-hate-symbol-prompting-calls-to-boycott-the-exchangeOnly 24 hours ago the pepecoin backers with the community on twitter were asking Coinbase to list the BRC-20 token on their exchange with screen captures of the symbol on their own webpage, either real or photoshopped on several of crypto influencers twitter feeds.But now they are all up in arms against the American exchange with these mass emails being sent out with no hope in sight for their beloved green frogfaced meme which was created back in 2005 and made the rounds on huge online media sites such as reddit and 4chan.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/11/coinbase-newsletter-flags-rise-of-pepecoin-and-brc-20-tokens-irks-crypto-twitterSince then, there was some news about pepe & memecoins topping Coinbase in trading volume just today.Uniswap Volume Leapfrogs Coinbase Thanks to Pepe and Meme Coinshttps://decrypt.co/139594/uniswap-volume-leapfrogs-coinbase-pepe-meme-coins\"Uniswap still looks to be slightly ahead of Coinbase, with $1.2 billion volume compared to the San Francisco-based exchange’s $948 million.\"Very interesting how these tokens which have no utility or intrinsic value except to the one's holding it, has up ended the king of all crypto and has caused a flurry of problems for the over 14 year cryptocurrency.",

      "body": "Ofcourse, it's important to let them know that they are being used to power up the price of something that is considered a hate symbol. That should discourage the victims from patronizing things like pepe, which will consequently ruin the value.  Being a hate symbol makes it an evil product. Evil product should be worthless rather than worth more. Things like that are basically Nazi things and the nazis operate in both the left and right but tend to be more open in the right. They typically adopt dual/multiple meanings for their hate symbols/terms to make them hard to catch. There is even the Ape NFT. The pureblood is probably another recent nonsense with dual meaning which they use for the unvacinated & inbreeders(pure race). It's also important to let the community know that blockchain should be mostly for light data rather than for storing pictures, videos, songs or other heavy files.",

So less of a direct connection to their beloved bitcoin.But the reason for this topic are these ones are on the BRC-20 blockchain a fork off the BTC network.",

It should be far better to promote more news about the uselessness of the tokens so that the buyers will lose interest in those non-useful tokens that hold no good value for the the ones who hold it.The ones who are holding those tokens might lose all of their savings if the developers manage to find a way to stop that crazy BRC-20 protocol.

However, it is essential to approach these coins with caution, as they are often considered short-term investments with limited long-term sustainability. One should be aware of the potential risks associated with holding on to meme coins for extended periods. Investors who become emotionally attached to meme coins may find themselves in a precarious position. The market for meme coins is highly volatile, and sudden price fluctuations can result in significant losses. It is crucial to keep in mind that the value of meme coins is primarily driven by social media trends and speculative hype, rather than underlying fundamentals.This thread isnt exclusively about memecoins and how their market was created. It is why Coinbase thought it was a good idea to segregate between their customers of what they choose to use and what authority they will allow them too.They released a commercial which will be one of many they plan on releasing on cable television over the course of the next couple of months. You decide on what propaganda they are pushing on their customers with these and you be the judge for yourself:\"Money has come a long way since goats and teeth - And it still has a long way to go.Thankfully, crypto helps moves money forward.\"https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1661406372897103873",

I don't think it was just me who experienced the same way, some may have used altcoins instead for a faster and cheaper transaction.
