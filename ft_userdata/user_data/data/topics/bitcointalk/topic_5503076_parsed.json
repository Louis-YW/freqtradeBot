People want to try him again and see what he could do since lots of people are tired with what Biden do for past years also his crypto crackdown policy that's why many people don't like him.For now its early to tell and lets just see what he can do in this industry and for sure he would create more better judgement since lots of crypto institutions and well known personality supports him so for sure he would comply to what he promise and make US a crypto friendly country on his term.",

That's not difficult to understand, and just because Founder BitMex denounced Trump doesn't mean he's as bad or as many people criticize Biden, doesn't mean Biden is as bad as people say. If you rely on celebrities to evaluate Mr. Trump, you should not ignore that CEO Kraken or Cathie Wood and many people in the cryptocurrency industry are supporting Mr. Trump.

If he is elected, most of the crypto legislation that is passed will be for the benefit of these large exchanges which have donated millions of dollars. It is uncertain if the average crypto user’s needs will be taken into account, that’s why Arthur Hayes is saying people shouldn’t put all their faith in Trump. If crypto is your main issue, you should support the best ideas regardless of where they are coming from and reject anything that is harmful, like extreme compliance measures that aim to take away our privacy.",
