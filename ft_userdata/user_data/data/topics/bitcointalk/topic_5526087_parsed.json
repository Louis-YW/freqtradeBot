There is a famous proverb - \"My home is my castle/fortress/citadel.\" However, any fortress/castle/citadel can perish or be taken by storm. In my opinion, a true Bitcoin enthusiast must be paranoid. He must constantly ask himself questions. What happens if my house burns down, drowns, falls into the ground or is blown up? Will I be able to save my Bitcoins? What happens if when I go outside, I am arrested on a fictitious basis and spend 20 years in prison? When I am released, will I be able to regain access to my coins? Asking yourself such questions and trying to find answers to these questions, you can create the perfect Bitcoin storage system for yourself.",

You pointed out in the right direction that we must have multiple copies of our seed that are stored at different geographical locations. In case one copy is destroyed, we have another in place. For security purpose most of us do not store seed digitally rather write it on paper, it's also the simplest and safest way to secure your seed. Just as OP mentioned there can be incidents of fire that can destroy the paper.",

Overall, I find it stupid to have 24 words seed phrase because 12 words is already enough).Buying a fireproof and damage proof metal backup solution is a must but it doesn't 100% solve the problem because when there is a big fire like this one, there is a high chance that when everything settles, someone might steal the plate or they won't be able to find it, so it's a good idea to remember seed phrases or have another backup on a different location.",

I would like to first express my condolences to the people affected by the wildfires in California. This is a sudden event. There is probably nothing anyone can do about it.I feel so sorry for the poor grandma because she lost everything in this fire and is completely destitute. However, she was a little less careful about holding Bitcoin because if she had Bitcoin, the seed of the wallet where she kept her Bitcoin should not have been written on paper but rather it should have been written on a metal object or she should have used a hardware wallet.Every Bitcoin user should be very careful about holding Bitcoin, but the most important thing is to store the seed of the Bitcoin wallet very safely so that it can be recovered later even if it is damaged by various natural disasters.",
