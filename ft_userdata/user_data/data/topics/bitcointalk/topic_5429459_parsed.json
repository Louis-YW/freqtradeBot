So we can only hope that 2023 could be the start of our way to recovery at least in Q2 if we are going to base in in 2019's data.",

But bright hope should always be ahead, we hope about that.I think recovery happens at all times because BTC can't just dump and dump more or remain stable at one price. Many times we are at $17k but later on we are at above $20k and then the price will fall again under it. It was only a small recovery in short but it might be true that big or real recoveries can only begin by next year, so that by the time we hit 2024 the price is already ready for a bull run because 2024 is going to be a special year for BTC.2017 was the second big break of BTC, so it's normal that its fall were also heavy, same as on 2021 where BTC also reach its third highest ATH. People must have expected that a year later the price will also dip hard.",

This means that 2023 will be a year where we will probably hit the 30-40k range and that's it, I am not expecting crazy price increases during that period. After that, we are probably going to end up with a huge increase all over again, and will probably end with a high price. I do not know if this data takes the 1st of January price to the 31th of December, but I can say that there are bigger ups and falls between the year as well, which means maybe things could look good a bit more, but I am guessing a 30-40k range for 2023 and then 100k range for 2024 as realistic by looking at this.",

What resources will be used to conduct the bullrun? Now it is worth hoping that Bitcoin at least retains what it has, and does not fall even lower.It because they've come up with that idea from the bull run that has happened for both 2017 and 2021. And that's already stuck in their minds and think that every holiday season, there's a potential to rise. Well, there is actually but not for this year as the bull run has passed already and we have to deal with this bear market.Quote from: Ratimov on December 16, 2022, 04:19:27 PMWith just over 2 weeks left until the end of 2022, Bitcoin is at risk of closing Q4 in the red, meaning that 2022 will be the first all-red year in history, quarter-by-quarter. 2022 brought many anti-records to bitcoin. True, too many incidents happened for this year but still it's considered as a good year despite that it's 2nd to the worst after 2018, this bear market proven a lot for bitcoin. Well, this is at least for those that have been in the market for years, those that have seen the ups and downs of bitcoin for different years.",

But since many investoors are minding other problems, we cannot push everyone to put their 'bets' right now given that there's no assurance of when will the market recover. Thus, temporary profit loss (if you'd be caught by dumps the moment you enter) would be lasting for a period. The question is; would you be able to endure it? It is for sure easy to say that you would but it would be different once you are into the projected situation.",

CZ explained that a normal situation for us is sometimes a money outflow and sometimes a high money inflow. So before the end of the year, BTC is having its second worst year, but I think this year is a candidate to be the worst. Let's see at what price it will make its annual closing.

However, it is important to note that the price of Bitcoin is not the only factor to consider when evaluating its performance. Despite the ups and downs Bitcoin suffered, the cryptocurrency has grown enormously in popularity. In addition, it will continue to be widely used and appreciated as a form of payment and store of value. Those who invested in bitcoin in 2022 have more than enough reason to be optimistic about future price development.If we compare 2022 with 2014 and 2018, it is certainly possible that Bitcoin will rebound in the 2023 but the question is how big will it be. There are a lot of external factors that can influence the price of Bitcoin, such as legislation, regulation, the state of the global economy, and many more. In my opinion, it is hard to predict the price of Bitcoin in 2023 but we can make some predictions about what will happen in the next years. In years to come, we may look back on 2022 as another watershed moment for the history of Bitcoin. Let us just hope that 2023 will be better for the cryptocurrency than its predecessor.",
