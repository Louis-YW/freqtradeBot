      "body": "My opinion is that it is practically impossible to happen in free countries. Even if a person is \"addicted\", the individual is free to make the choice to gamble or not. It is not an activity where the company forces the person to gamble.Just make the comparison with addictions to drink and cigarettes, nobody is forbidden to buy or consume.There can be discouraging actions, but a certificate like this I find extremely difficult.Controlling countries can easily make gambling illegal or not allow the individual.I believe that most gambling sites contain a readme with the information that everyone is responsible for the bets and the money.In your opinion, who would issue this certificate? Who would have the right to decide whether or not the individual can bet?",

How can they even monitor such things? What are the responsible gambler traits should be like?No way the government will ask \"online\" casinos to implement such things.",

Who will issue these certificates and what are the criteria that will be used to issue them it? Even addicted gamblers will get the certificate from authorities because  I don't think there will be any means of identifying gambling addicts except through their financial statements. And most crypto gamblers always want to keep their gambling life secret which is why they prefer using cryptocurrencies. In my country, most people that don't want the Covid-19 vaccine were able to bribe hospital officials with money for vaccine cards or certificate. That is how gamble addicts will have unhindered access to this gambling certificate. People will always lose their wealth to gambling if they gamble without control. Government should increase the rate of addiction preventive awareness mainly among underaged gambling because children are prone to addiction.",

Sounds like a lot of paperwork, and if other casinos don't follow it then the effort simply is just wasted. Besides, casinos are a business, they may take into account a users personal interest by offering warnings, but no way in hell are they going to put out manpower to handle all that stuff, it's a loss of potential customers (since a lot would probably just not do it since a pain, kyc already is, imagine this being added). The idea made me think up of a centralized group that handles registrations of gamblers though, so that there's like a one for all account type of thing so that KYC is only done once and tracking is much easier but, well, the hard part is trying to get a centralized group that can handle casinos in all countries to form though.",

In a country where gambling is legal people have the freedom to gamble or not,therefore a certificate will not be required for you to have access to gamble. Addiction is a common thing as long as we are humans,if you give so much time to whatever activities you are into it then becomes an habit to you. Sex,smoking, drinking, gambling, taking of hard drugs can easily make you an addict and can lead to destruction of one's life,if not gotten rid of. There is always a warning to these kind of activities because the company and government knows their implications. So if after been warned,you went ahead and become an addict whose fault is it ?",

The gambling sites have some ways like articles that gamblers can read for not to be addicted, but how many gamblers are reading that, also that the gambling sites prefer people to lose so that they can have money. So it is gamblers that should be wise, not addicted, and they should be gambling in a responsible way than thinking that the government are ready to restrict gamblers in a way no freedom again.",
