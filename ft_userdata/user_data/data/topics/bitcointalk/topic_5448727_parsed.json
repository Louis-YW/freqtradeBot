There is nothing about the back or side of the shirt. I am sure that the sponsers will find a work-around or a loophole of sorts to smear their logos on. Reducing promotions of ANYTHING is a good thing for players because we as the viewers, came to watch the players and watch them play. We did not pay for tickets to watch advertisements 24/7. But as I said, its unrealistic that there will be no more gambling or other advertisements, they will just find different ways to show them.",

I think it has possible effects on other sports too. This might have an effect on the short term but not likely to reduce some good amount of gamblers.",

Let's face it though, 99.99% of people who use these sites are likely to lose their whole deposit in the long run and you've just got to hope that they do not deposit every penny they own trying to scrape back to breakeven. It will help, but the fact that the animated boards around the side of pitches are still allowed - I'm not sure how successful it'll be. Those boards are potentially much more eye catching and are still highly visible on TV screens.",

It's like putting your son on a no-phone ground after you find out he's been using the blender to mince frogs. But going back, yeah players will still be able to promote gambling sites in other ways, and even if they don't nothing's really stopping a dedicated gambler to play his favorite sports betting match. So it's a matter of futility really if you'll ask me. But whatever, whether they crackdown on sports gambling the industry will remain, they may even settle to another game or organization if ever, there's nothing that effectively stops sports betting from ever reaching its target audience really.",

The best places for such advertisments should be where adults are the ones capable most of visiting, such as this site, Bitcointalk. It is said that gambling ads would be removed from the front of players shirt, maybe this would mean another thing in a way they can advertise it through another method, but such ads are not good. The gambling sites should come to forums, like Bitcointalk for advertising, not where kids will be watching them.",

There's no denial, gambling online is very popular now -so i don't think anything could control it unless the government will impose a strict regulations in gambling.",

But I think it will depend on how those sports view the issue and the impact that gambling sponsorship has on their brand and reputation. However, it is unclear news and it could be the impact of removing gambling sponsors from matchday shirts is difficult to predict.",

What do you think?It will lessen the exposure of gambling platforms but I do not think that it will have an effect to the gambling industries. Â Even though the banners of the gambling platform is removed from the front of the athletes matchday shirts, there is no regulation preventing them to put it on the back or on the short of the athlete. Â Even if they completely remove these banners from the outfit of players, they still have banners everywhere in the stadium.

Â About the outfit of players, if it became a regulation then others will follow, else, it would be waste if a team lost sponsorship so I think other team will think hardly about following it.",
