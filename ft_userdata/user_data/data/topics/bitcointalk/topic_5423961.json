Just by asking a question like this, someone can tag your account, and also if we notice any strange activity on it, we can assume that it has changed owners.Right now I'd say your account is worth nothing, although there are those who are always willing to pay any price that seems favorable to them at that moment. My advice, don't sell.",

I was simply wondering what it was all aboutThere is probably not many things in this world which couldn't be sold for money. Bitcointalk accounts isn't exception. Especially considering that it can be monetized well through signature campaigns or used for scams. You can browse through Invites & accounts section here to get image how much Bitcointalk accounts cost. Though, probably most of these users who sell accounts is scammers who don't really have accounts.",

Apart of that is still shady. Background and writing style is changing. It's not the same person. Even more, it's ban evasion.And maybe in a day or a year the deal is caught and the account tagged. If it took long enough, maybe there is ROI, but it's not guaranteed. The risk is very high.Spammers... they may be fooling themselves that nobody would notice a smart and useful member, instead of improving over time, suddenly becomes spammer.How long until the account is tagged and it's value drops to irrelevance?So no, sorry; I stand to my initial conclusion: it's stupid and shady.",

In selling of account, there is a lot at stake and should be considered.Your account is you and it tells of how well your reputation have been on the forum and people would always value your account as such.Buying and selling is always an ask and bid so, you really get to quantify what it means to you and value it knowing that, you ain't just selling some user but, your selling a part of yourself, your reputation to be used as fit by someone else.I would say, you shouldn't do that.
