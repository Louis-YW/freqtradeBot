Several approaches have been sent to my Telegram account. First, I check if we shared a group, if not, then I get careful. My name, location, and gender are all I can tell an intruder in my PM, aside from that, I try to keep my identity private. Messages sent privately are suspicious, so don't be fooled by any approach.",

They are attractive by stories like Bitcoin Pizza but then they believe in Altcoin pizza stories that are not realistic. Very few altcoins can survive after many years and can help them to gain good profit like Ethereum, BNB, Dogecoin. They are barely seen altcoins. Other altcoins only make them poorer.Quotei said exchange where you can buy cryptocurrency, exchanges like binance,kucoin, etc.she said \"oh, i am with binance \"she does not know anything about binance and basic terms just made an account following her mentor.she is so dumb to scam her.Nothing is wrong to believe in your mentor until a moment your mentor asks you to send him or her money. If my mentor asks me to do so, I am out immediately.It is a common method in life and not only exist in cryptocurrency. So I don't feel strange if anyone tries to scam me with this method.A good mentor will teach you do do things by yourself, not doing things on behalf of you and if it is related directly to your money, it sounds like too good to be true mentor, more like a scammer.",

The woman is a novice following someone's advice and directions, but at a time she wasn't too comfortable with her mentor and she decided to contact random people to seek their opinion if it really agrees or differs from what her teacher teaches her to do.But in all, this could be leading to scam.
