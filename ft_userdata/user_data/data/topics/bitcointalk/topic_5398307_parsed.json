As a crypto investor; with recent lessons learnt from Luna and UST; i believe it is good if you move your funds to usdc or busd for the time being or better still move your funds to local fiat and be happy. Don't play hard game with usdt for the time being. All the same, please dyor; this is not FA just my humble opinion",

      "body": "USDT is possibly a major scam also because it is impossible to audit their reserves which means they may not have the assets to back their tokens.The good news is, almost every major crypto exchange participate so it will be a lot harder to bring usdt down. The bad news is, that day will come sooner or later so it is a good thing to keep that in the back of your head.",

There are ton of FUD around USDT, it has been so from the start but i have full trust on tether and busd, but i wouldn't count on DAI right now.",

I know that you are feeling worry after seeing that if the stable token has been going down to the bottom but in my opinion if usdt far better compared with ust. Im holding all of my assets in the stable token right now. Im sure that if you are also feeling panic after seeing the price of usdt was going down a little bit.",

      "body": "USDT is different from UST and LUNA, USDT is backed up by the original currency, namely USDT, while UST is backed up by bitcoin, the fatal mistake made by the UST team is that they liquidate the backup from UST for reasons that I don't understand myself, but it may have something to do with The price of bitcoin has fallen for the past few days. In addition, UST is a stable DeFi coin they are not used as a stable coin but rather an investment with high interest rates.",

Anyway but in the question, if the Tether Developer can mint more USDT and dump it in the market will its highly possible, but so far there is no indication about that scenario so it will remain as speculation.",
