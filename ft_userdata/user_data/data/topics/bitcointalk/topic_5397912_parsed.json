  "content": "Previously, when I was engaged in pools for farming and so on with the best APY, I searched through some sites and incomprehensible sources, but now everything becomes much easier because projects such as AnalytEx appear on the market, which includes many functions and one of them is just this one farm aggregator on binance, phantom, air, which on TVL and apy shows the most profitable farm on which you will earn more, very convenient and easy to use for everyone who was interested in this issue, I leave the link https://analytex.app/service/farms",

      "body": "Personally i am not the type that is impressed about staking/farming; neither do i even like to do so because it leads to inflation and then a massive dump in value of the token. But since the market is bearish with investors hopeful; the bear market remains the best time to enjoy staking/farming protocols; why? because you buy low, stake and forget about them until the next bull run. All you need to do is make sure to buy a valuable token that is bullish longterm",

      "body": "It wouldn't be best to determine a project based on its APY. I think you can have a high APY, but that coin's value might be non-existent or something. Some stuff is incomplete based on the site, though I don't think it's enough to establish.OP, how do you use the site? Do you have any history on it?",
