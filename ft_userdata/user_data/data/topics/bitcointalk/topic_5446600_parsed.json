      "body": "I hope you are not here looking for someone to scam? This may later lead to scam. If you are not a scammer, I will advice you not to trust anyone. Learn trading yourself. Do not use more than what you can afford to lose to trade. If you have $100000, I will advice you not to take more than $10000 to trade, and this should be after you have learned how to trade and become an expert. If you are losing more than winning, better not to trade. As a starter, having $100000, do not use more than $100 to learn. If you learn and understand very well about trading, you can use $1000. If you make successful trades and gain far more than losing, then you can use $10000 and you should not go beyond that.Learn how to trade yourself. Depending on someone will only get you scammed, especially in a forum that you can not link someone's to their real life identity. Even the people that you know can still scam you, you will know that if you are reading news very well.Know that newbie traders are prone to lose. Leave emotion aside and start little as I explained.It is good to also tell you that investment is less risky than trading, if you invest in good coins like bitcoin. Altcoins are like gambling too, they are highly risky.",

Also know that scammers are everywhere. Do not make the mistake you made in the past.If you have been failing in trading, know that trading is not for everyone. Trading is not gambling, but it is like gambling and highly risky. If you are losing, best to quit trading. I will advice you to go for investment. You can invest on coins like bitcoin, ether or other better coins after making research about them, but I will advice you to go for bitcoin. Do not sell and do not panic when you think you are losing, they are just unrealized losses that will later become a profit. You can start to DCA now, and invest very well when bitcoin drop to around or below $20000 again.Investment is better.",

Can I find someone who wants to earn money and work for me in daily, trading method will be at my home.Perhaps you don't like it after reading but let me give you honest advice (with an assumption that you are not trolling).Your writing goes from invest to trading. It means you are not sure what you will do with your money. Invest or trading, you must decide it first.Trading is more risky than investment. Especially trading with Margin, Leverage and Futures, stay away from them. If you want to trade, trade with Spot only.Invest? Okay, if you want to invest, let's invest in Bitcoin only. If you want to expand it more, let's choose some more like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), don't choose Play-to-Earn, X-to-Earn tokens.I am sure that you will receive many PMs from scammers and if your question sounds like you will lose your money very soon.Invest or trade, read this one Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsQuoteI live in Miami.Don't dox yourself.",

If you have $100,000, then learn crypto fundamentals first.  If you give someone your money to trade with, most likely it will be scammed by a scammer. You can try with yourself. If you don't have any trading experience, you can be starting with the investor role.1. Investor Role: Dont care about the market movement and do the dollar cost average (Eg: DCA 12 months: You buy a bitcoin every month using $1000)2. Trader Role: If you have more experience in the first one, you can try this one.",

If you are looking for a trading partners, you can check there trading history and check if you are comfortable with their results before thinking of copying there trading. You will need to watch well and do your quick research before admitting for any trading partners. Having a profitable results in trading is not as easy as we may think but I would advise you to watch well before accepting anyone as your trading partners. I wish you good luck in your endeavors.",

Just forget trading at all.I mean with that huge amount of money that you have, you can invest into multiple assets with that. Buying Bitcoin and holding it, buying a stocks that provides annual dividends. I mean why pursue trading if you aren't profiting from it. Trading isn't for everyone like they're saying. I tried trading already, but most of the time, I'm losing money more than I'm winning so I stopped it already.Quote from: The_Hunter_Trader on March 28, 2023, 11:31:11 PMThank you all for these great tips.

Please be cautious and don't trust someone so easily, especially since $100k is a significant amount of money. Instead of looking for help here, consider finding a licensed company that can assist you with your goals.

If you can't or don't want to learn, you won't make a profit.If you have over $ 100k, I suggest you buy bitcoin gradually or the DCA method. You buy when the bitcoin price has fallen several thousand dollars. The DCA method will greatly benefit you because you can have more bitcoins when the price is below. And you also don't need to analyze the price every day.Once you have bitcoins, keep them in your personal wallet and you don't have to look at the market. Set an alarm that will sound if the bitcoin price hits the highest price you want. For example, past the last ATH price so you can sell it at the highest price after the last ATH. And you do not need to look for a partner.",

I live in Miami.Cheers,$100,000 is a very large initial capital.  Such capital can be increased by an order of magnitude (10 times) using conservative trading methods without engaging in short-term and medium-term trading.  In my opinion, in your case, you are very likely to be able to increase your initial deposit ($100,000) to $1,000,000.  To do this, you need to use the HODL (buy and hold) strategy.  At the same time, only Bitcoin (not altcoin) should act as an investment.  Yes, you will not reach your goal very quickly, you will have to wait (maybe several years).  But with a high degree of probability, you will increase your initial capital at times (and this is a worthy result).",
