Holders make profit because they did not sell when they are losing, just like Microstrategy.Know that altcoins are riskier, I prefer bitcoin, but ethereum is not bad among altcoins. Know that altcoins holding is like you are gambling, I can not advice anyone to hold altcoins.",

But to choose this potential coin, you have to do some research to find the right coin. If you just invest in crypto without doing research, it's the same as gambling and you probably won't be able to profit like everyone else.Maybe you should try investing in bitcoin and try to buy more bitcoins if the price drops. But before investing in crypto, you should know how much money you can invest and don't spend all your money on it.",

Etheruem is also as reliable as bitcoin so hodling it is lesser risk to shit coins. The volatility is all over including bitcoin, it also give you profit like it drops your profit. If you don't like the volatility then you don't need to invest in cryptocurrency or you only hodl in usdt.",

Never.Don't keep all your money in fiat currency. You should diversify it into gold and other things like real estate (if you don't invest in crypto).With cryptocurrency, Bitcoin should be your first one for your portfolio. Next one is ETH by that I mean you chose a good one but a little bit bad because you put all money in ETH.A next one is BNB. I think fiat currency, gold, Bitcoin, ETH, BNB are good for your portfolio. Don't diversify more in more altcoins. You will lose money with altcoins.",

If you want stability, invest less volatile coins. That on the other hand brings less profits as well if you don't know when to enter or when to exit. Also there's time frame. You should invest in terms of years, and not to panic for first real bear.",

They are both high market cap and seems the only different of Ethereum right now is the upcoming The Merge update which you can say the volatile is high for this but for me it's already done, from $1,000 and tested the $2,000 earlier, for me that is already the effect of The Merge update of Ethereum.",

However, every time when there's a bear trend market, it's good to increase the amount in your portfolio, buying in a DCA way will potentially make a profit.  For now, I discourage you not to sell your asset since everything was down the price in the market, just wait until your profit were there and never sell under the price.",

Think about this so many people earned bunch of money by diversifying their portfolios into the low cap coin as well. This must make you think to invest in the more coin.

So diversification is the opposite of gambling or risking all your worth in one single coin. ETH must be a good choice but diversification is a lot better especially because going all in into ETH means you left behind Bitcoin which is undoubtedly the most important choice of all. I advise you to diversify to a few solid coins. Bitcoin of course should always be part of your portfolio. You may add ETH or XMR or LTC.",
