But recently I have read a lot of topics as regards to gambling (addictions) and it negative effects on individuals and how we have warn against it,  but at this time I am beginning to think that we are focusing too much on gambling addiction rather than employing ways to avoid addiction but at the same time gamble and have fun to the fullest. The topics and discussion about gambling addiction is becoming too much and too often to the point that most newbie may likely get scared away from gambling which will not be ok for the casino revenue generation so at this point I am force to ear my view of this topic of gambling addictions, becoming too much in this board.

Or what do you think? I agree with you. Topics on gambling addiction being posted here are just too much . It is basically the same idea being said a thousand different ways but with only the same solution. That is why the comments of most users on this forum on those threads similar to what has been discussed in time past.Aside from what I think, what should we do about it. Are these topics really helpful to those addicted and newbies or are they made just to add up to the weekly post counts? My suggestions is that the moderators should lock those topics once it passes the 5th page.",

Also a means addicted gamblers will know that they are addicts and avoid what could later might happen to them just like what is happening to addicted gamblers. I have noticed that the gambling addiction people are bringing up here are about real life event of someone that lost huge amount of money or someone that gambling turn into something else. If there are such news, let them bring them up on this gambling discussion board so that new gamblers and addicts can gain. Do not believe that gamblers and newbie gamblers will not gamble like before, gambling is fun if done rightly.But we can come up with a single thread that we can continue to discuss about gambling addiction if you think it is polluting the gambling board.Quote from: alastantiger on June 16, 2023, 08:17:49 PMAside from what I think, what should we do about it.

The gambling board is all about gambling relation topic as you stated, so it is obvious that gambling addiction would be one of the most created  topic on this board.  About the profit of a casino, I do not think people who read about gambling addiction will be dissuaded of engaging in gambling platform.  I believe the most impact it can give is for the player to be cautious in engaging in gambling thus helping them to minimize the effect of gambling to gambling addiction of a player.",

It's just that there aren't that much new information members are giving out on this topic. I'd appreciate it if they give out something more intricate and fresh on the subject, but so far none of the replies on same topics have provided that. I'd love to read some fresh new topics on other subjects that doesn't include the topic of addiction, but I guess most of them have been discussed in the board anyway, so new information that is relevant to those topics are what's lacking.Anyhow, report function still works well.

Or what do you think? Depends on how you would take it 'coz for me, that's the harsh reality behind gambling. Gambling addiction topics are simply and should be a warning to those gamblers who are not aware of what they are doing. Indeed it should be enjoyed by players but that's not how this industry works. People are gambling not for enjoyment but to get profit from doing so. There's even this mentality that gambling could be a shortcut to being rich and such. Personally, would you encourage someone to gamble? I won't. We do not need to do so. This is not a sinple game wherein you can invite as much as you want. Money is involved here and we all know how important that pice of paper is. Such idea should be an enough warning that we ain't just playing here. If you get too involved, you might reach the point that you'd be too frustrated to play to get back with what you have lost and this includes borring huge amount or selling some of your properties.",
