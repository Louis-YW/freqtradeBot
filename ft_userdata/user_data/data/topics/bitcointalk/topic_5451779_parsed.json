Crypto miners are generating a lot of revenue from fees that should be enough to cover their operational costs, and if their feel they are being overly taxed it ok to opt into other alternatives source of electricity generation to catch down the cost of energy consumption and bills.",

Some of us have been to places where mining just doesn't make sense at all because of high electricity costs.Speaking of levying taxes on electricity used for mining Bitcoin, it's one of the most stupid taxes I have come across.Shouldn't they be taxing electricity used for playing video games or electric cookers as well? Since most of these Governments are bitching about Bitcoin mining contributing \"posing environmental threats\" but so does any other form of electricity/non-renewable energy usage.",

If they have generated 7 million dollars from the fee then it's their right as they have allowed miners to earn way more than that with low cost electricity they are providing.The best thing about that country is that they aren't putting higher taxes on the ones who are willing to use renewable energy sources for the mining operations. I think they are trying to direct miners towards green energy and that's why they have increased the initial taxes on the mining operations. A miner is still lucky enough to have mining operations in that country because they can still generate enough revenue through mining of Bitcoin in that region. I think that's enough for someone to settle their if their main goal is to run a hue mining farm. Because with such low electricity rates a miner can earn a lot from mining.",

Maybe it's not in the sane mind if anyone complains about that, because the 0.0023$ is almost like you don't pay for electricity and if there is a payment now because it became 0.01$ kwh, it still doesn't feel that way. expensive for my opinion.",

He is afraid that Russia's appetite for crypto mining in these times will force the Kazakh government to accept the introduction of a tax which would cause a fuite of hashrate to Russia (which has a huge influence on the country politically).
