  "content": "In case you haven't heard of this tool, bitcoin-chart-cli is a nifty little Bitcoin price tracker written in NodeJS that also spits out some technical indicators as well as support for some altcoins (though I only ever use the BTC tracker).It's only downside is that it uses an aggressive API service CryptoCompare that will ban you if you accidentally leave the program repeating every few seconds. To get back, you need to pay them an expensive $75/month (not year) for an API key.Now, I've been thinking, why don't I just rip that API out and replace it with another, unlimited API just for fetching the historical Bitcoin price?Since I'm not in the business for writing APIs, I figured it would be best to outsource this to someone else. Now that there are a bunch of Preev clones out there, I'm sure at least someone is willing to take on the task.Rules:- There is no application, you are supposed to develop an API and host it, and notify me about that in this thread.- You must make two endpoints:--One for fetching historical price data for each day, for most common fiat currencies (the bare minimum is USD) as an array sorted in chronological (oldest data first) order.--The other endpoint must return today's price for a specified fiat currency.- There must be no periodic limiting requests. Basic rate limiting (say X requests per second) to protect yourself from DDoS attacks or using Cloudflare is fine, but the whole idea of this contest is to make an API that you can hook up price charts to without paying extraordinary prices, so no silly stuff like limit 100K requests/month.- You need to include all daily prices starting from 2013 to be eligible for the reward - the aim is to make as complete of a price tracker as possible.- The API must be usable without requiring an API key or registering for an account.- This contest is open for a maximum of three months (90 days), and is subject to close at any time, such as if I select the best API;- I reserve the right to pay out extra if you make a particularly good API (such as adding more fiat/cryptocurrencies or endpoints). I also reserve the right to not pay out the reward at all if every submission is (in my opinion) not good enough.- If you win the prize, you are not allowed to take down the API, except for maintenance or if you have financial problems that prohibit you from paying your hosting, or you will be red-tagged.- The prize will be paid out in BTC.- I reserve the right to modify the rules.You may use this thread for submissions or for discussing APIs, bitcoin price trackers, or the contest.",

People will even have to host the server, which is impossible to host for 50 usd forever without any limit.I might increase it to $200 or $300 (or possibly even $500 - that particular amount won't be done now though, as I've already splashed 400EUR on ProtonMail's \"Visionary\" plan that should cover my email, cloud storage and VPN needs for 2 years. So a second payout this size would put me over my monthly budget.For now I can't justify any prize amounts higher than $500 for a simple price history API like this. After all, the odds of the service going \"viral\" are very low, and even if that does happen, a simple donate button on the site's webpage should cover maintenance costs - I mean I've done just that for BitcoinCleanup and raised about $100 for it [its funds are in a completely separate address that won't be mingled with anything else].Yes, I have used the Binance API before and it's pretty good.

But first let's see if we can make one that is more simple for devs. It's impossible to make an API like this without a third party, the bitcoin price comes from the value on the exchanges and we have to request their information if we want that data.To make your own API with unlimited calls then you have to request all the past data and start filling a database, then each API call will be a request to your data base and not to the data provider, and then you need to keep updating the data base information each X seconds.Mount this kind of servers aren't cheap because you need a VPS with a nice amount of ram and cpu for all the calls, a huge hard disk for the DB and a big bandwidth.Just think about the data base with a line for the bitcoin prize each 2 second since bitcoin gets on the markets, that's a huge amount of data.I hope this information makes you see the full context of your request. A project like this could take months on API calls to create your own DB. The api calls isn't a big deal, is just make request to the db and print the data in json.",

The only way someone would provide what NotATether requested is if someone already has all that infrastructure and he wants to share it for 50 one time payment (basically a donation).I think the best solution would be to use the free apis, which have all the data he requested, or to pay for the api if he need more calls (I don't think he needs, binance is basically unlimited)It looks  simple just to have an api like that, but it is expensive because you need to make requested every few seconds/ minute, otherwise you will have a delayed data.  A database,  etc like you said.I think that using those free api are enough. The historical data is the most problematic because you won't find since 2013 for free... but you can just merge coindesk api Data with the binance api. I can help with that if needed.",

First I tried to hardcode a simple workaround where it connects to a Tor SOCKS5 proxy, but this API doesn't like that.I have gigantic 3TB of Proton Drive storage that is just sitting there and collecting dust, so perhaps I could scrape price data and package it up there for safe keeping. The only problem is that that doesn't have an API, so it will be slow periodic manual uploads, while I query the Binance endpoint, which I have experience in doing.",
