May be future is bright Tg : https://t.me/MuuInuTwitter : https://twitter.com/MuuInuOfficialI am sorry to break this to you but there is no way that Muuinu is the next big memecoin and you probably already know that. I know that you are part of the team and it is just fair to promote your \"project\" everywhere you can in order to maybe attract some new investors but i really think that the chances for that are very slim for several reasons. First of all the timing is just completely wrong at the moment. The whole market is in a downtrend for months now and new projects have a very hard time in general to attract new users and investors. Second and most important, your project is just another useless meme-coin and thank god the meme-coin hype is over for some time now.",

May be future is bright Tg : https://t.me/MuuInuTwitter : https://twitter.com/MuuInuOfficialNo, you can't assume that it will happen. Please think about meme coins, they are far from getting big and of having market potential, they will just be ignored by the investors. I guess you are part of this project. You can tell everything good about your project, that was a sort of marketing strategy. However, you can't please people and look into this project knowing it was a meme coin, it ended the same with others.",

Well, I'd like the idea of promoting the new project for us to be aware of but unfortunately, it was a meme coin you'd tried to promote and encourage us which I think was not worth trusting. I'm sorry but honestly, meme coins aren't on my list even if you will push that it was potentially profitable, I will decline definitely. I don't see any hopes for these meme coins as I was also a victim to these meme coins and suffer big losses after the spike.",

Any meme-coin becomes big and profitable only for one reason, it gets actively promoted by some famous and influential people through various social networks to give this promotion virality. Then the meme-coin very quickly attracts new users and the price rises just lightning fast. This, and only this, is the secret of meme-coin success. All this utilitarianism, swaps, and meme-coin wallets investors don't need.",
