      "body": "Quoting from the other topic:Quote from: BitCheques on May 20, 2022, 12:51:53 PMActually, there are some very good methods of selecting an arbitrator. For example, each party submits 3 arbitrators, from which one is chosen by the other party. The two arbitrators select a third. The panel of three decides (2 of 3) from between solutions submitted by each party without alteration as to what funds are released to what party. This prevents a \"splitting the baby\" compromise.The main problem: no matter how good the arbitrator is, it's not trustless. If someone wants to pay me with a private payment system which means I have to trust some people I don't know, I wouldn't accept it. I'm not into Bitcoin to trust people, I'm into Bitcoin to be my own bank so to speak.QuoteWhen a BitCheque is purchased from the issuer (me), guarantee funds are locked up for a specific time period and/or until it is redeemed. If an unopened BitCheque is emptied of funds, this would indicate fraud or carelessness on the part of the issuer, and trigger arbitration - if the issuer does not promptly compensate the holder.So if you sell 1000 Bitcoin in BitCheques, you'll need to deposit 1000 Bitcoin accessible from the private keys on the BitCheques, and another 1000 Bitcoin in the arbitrators' posession. Who's going to fund that additional 1000 Bitcoin?QuoteThis type of contract can be written in Solidity or possibly a taproot layer.We're a long way from smart contracts being common in Bitcoin, and if Ethereum is any indication of what's going to happen, nobody will truely understand the details.Quote from: BitCheques on May 22, 2022, 04:11:55 AMThe Central African Republic has just declared Bitcoin to be legal tender, but 90% of the population doesn't have ready access to the Internet.I assume that percentage will only go up the coming years.QuoteI am exploring safe ways to use Bitcoin without having to connect to the Internet for every exchange.It's like sending an email: you can't do it without the internet. You can print the email and send a letter, but if you do, it's no longer an email.QuoteIdeally a paper wallet could be created in a manner that prevents anyone from memorizing or recording the private key before it is sealed.That's not possible. I can print a paper wallet with my eyes closed and seal it, but you'd have to trust me on this. I can setup an automated production line that seals the paper wallets before they come out, but you'd have to trust it doesn't store the private keys. You can watch me burn the production line, but you'd have to trust I didn't use pre-generated private keys. The only way to be sure nobody else knows your private keys, is by generating them by yourself.QuoteI am also exploring a smart contract that guarantees (via escrowed funds and/or multisig) that no funds are released until the BitCheques are opened.\"Smart contracts\" always remind me of Ethereum's DAO scam, in which they called the only person who understood the contract \"The Attacker\", after which they let go of their \"code is law\" and hardforked it into a centralized shitcoin. Let's not go there with Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Of course, complete trustlessness is an ideal toward which we strive. Most bitcoin transactions over the Internet don't meet that criteria either - especially if someone uses a custodian or widely shares his public address. Another ideal is simplicity. Having to memorize a password for transactions fails that test. Using bitcoin correctly requires a steep learning curve. A currency shouldn't.Initially,  the guaranteed amount will likely be more like 10000 satoshis. As the production process becomes more secure and anti-counterfeiting measures are improved, larger denominations will become more feasible.I believe that you greatly underestimate the potential of smart contracts. A complex DAO shouldn't be necessary in this case anyway. The lightning network allows transactions to take place without being verified in real time. Paper notes would improve on portability.",

Having had experience with fiat, the bitcoin note is more attractive. While bitcoin is currently volatile, a wider use of bitcoin will gradually stabilize it. Its value is also likely to continue increasing as it becomes more widespread internationally and halvings further cap the supply of bitcoin. It's our job to make BitCheques as trustless as possible.",

Just Dollar bills are IOU papers.From my understanding BitCheques are something different and no matter how you fold and laminate the paper, somebody may counterfeit it. Since they are not IOU, when one will try to spend the underlying bitcoin and will see they were already spent, it won't be pretty.But, again, I might have missed something, since the current collectibles kinda risk the same problem: somebody skilled enough could counterfeit them or sell them after peeking on the private key. I don't know though how the seal can be replaced with an identical one; but in your case, at least at first glance, it looks simpler.",

Also it could be a device, like an ATM for example, shared among a group of people that could just go there to verify their coins/bills, without the need for them to have an internet connected device themselves.I think this could be potentially more secure than a simple QR code printed out, since there are specialized NFC chips that protect for certain known attacks.",
