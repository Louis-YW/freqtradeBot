To pull crowd in social media nowadays is not by being realistic, as far as you know how to tell a convincing lies your channel will be the most viewed one.Quote from: Jating on July 23, 2024, 08:11:53 AM“Bitcoin isn’t about getting rich quickly, it’s about not getting poor slowly through inflation”That's old belief to the new folks in the industry. The attention has been shifted from hedging against inflation to money making machine. That's their perception of crypto in general, hence, it is a scam when the reality hit them.",

The thing makes Bitcoin better than fiat currencies is it has only 21 millions cap that means with time, inflation rate will become smaller every 210,000 blocks (about four years). After 2140, it will become deflationary but I don't hope to live till that year.Same total supply, population continue to grow, demand on Bitcoin will grow, it will help price.Controlled supplyHow is the 21 million bitcoin cap defined and enforcedMore people read The bullish case for Bitcoin[url], understand it and take action, price will grow more.",

Simply because they hedges their values on your income throw extractions of taxes while under their watch of centralized commodities.Ummm...  I tried to visit this riv.com website but says it can not be reached. I would be interested to know more about them pertaining their utmost interests on this Bitcoin with their speculations.",

First, if one day you become rich quickly, what will you do? And second, if one day you find yourself in a poor situation, will you hate Bitcoin?1. I will do nothing, why you need to have \"reason\" to get rich or when you have x amount of money? this is why people most people can't being rich because for being rich, high salary jobs and successful investment aren't enough, you need to understand how to protect your wealth.When they have money, they buy big house, car, luxury lifestyle, party everyday, luxury clothes etc, these will not make your wealth to grow.2. Let's say someone DCA-ing Bitcoin and use all of the money only to invest in Bitcoin, turns out Bitcoin price drop to $1. There's no one in the world will not cry and not blame Bitcoin. Investment is always talk about profit, no one want to loss.",

They continuously printing money and then it's losses its value in our hand.While in Bitcoin, regardless on how you accumulate, it could be DCA or one time buy and then you just hold or wait for our dip to buy, not a get rich scheme, but in the future it will give us financial freedom and we have a weapon in our hands against inflation.",

Perhaps there are still people out there who think that Bitcoin is a way to get rich quickly and need to understand that this is wrong.A good message doesn't always have to be in a serious advertising package, it needs to be tailored. Sometimes useful advertisements have to be packaged in a comedic way so that they are remembered because they are funny.",

In just a minute, they were able to explain why you should buy bitcoin in the simplest form possible and managed to advertise their services.One of the most impressive commercials of recent times would be one from coinbase. It’s very engaging, fun and creative and most importantly it captures the essence of bitcoin which is decentralization.It doesn’t matter much to me if they are advertising their own platform as long as they can educate a larger audience and attract more investors.",

First, if one day you become rich quickly, what will you do? And second, if one day you find yourself in a poor situation, will you hate Bitcoin?It is a simple but powerful message. It summarizes Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and also has some lessons for those who assume that Bitcoin is a get-rich-quick investment.

Maybe River should also consider promoting the advertisement because it contains information that the public needs. If you have a video titled \"How I made millionaires Bitcoin in a few days\" people will rush to view it, especially if you do some publicity.",

If bitcoin price drops 70% the impact in the company will be huge, only time will show us how they act in the had times.I will read more about the company, i'm curious about the logic behind the business.",
