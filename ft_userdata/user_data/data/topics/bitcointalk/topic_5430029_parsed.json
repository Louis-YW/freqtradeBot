Any ideas what markets or use cases this data/software might fit and how to go about monetising it?",

The software was developed to be flexible, allowing you to use your own data sources or blockchain node/vendors/exchanges and automatically schedules/updates price, transaction, trading account data over any time frame. It already has a vanilla blockchain explorer, advanced charting, flexible/configurable dashboards as well as real-time price charts. Have included the ability to download your own cryptocurrency investment accounts/transactions into your own accounting sub-ledger for full reporting and analysis etc. A simple scripting IDE was added as well for bespoke analysis or on-chain/pricing studies.The database currently supports btc/eth/bch/ltc/doge and all digital asset price series as well as other asset types Â (ie equities, fx, commodities, futures etc). I think you are right that the monetisation will be what value can be added to this data. Creating new on-chain metrics or using ML/AI on the data would be one way of doing this...I would need to reach out somehow and engage others though to ensure that there was a demand.",

For example,1. Dual licensing system. 1st license is open source license (usually AGPL v3) while 2nd license is propriety/commercial license with customer support and optionally more feature.2. Software as a service (SaaS) approach where you charge your customer based on subscription duration and their usage (e.g. personal, small company and enterprise company).On paper it would seem that there are a number of ways of monetising the database/software. In practice it will be difficult. Creating API services could be a good way though. I guess data value or USP could then be improved by adding various related services:ML/AI to help predict/identify blockchain eventsExchange proof of reserves/liabilitiesBespoke delivery frequency/methods/formats/reliabilityBespoke on-chain analysisNormalisation, modelling and consolidation of defi and transaction dataI'll take a look at glassnode etc and see if there are tools or areas not currently covered...",
