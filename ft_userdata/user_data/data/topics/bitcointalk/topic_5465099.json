If you want to spend from some specific address, right-click on the address and click on \"Add to coin control\". After that, you will see the status \"Coin control active\" and other information about this specific address. See the image below.If I am not wrong, The fee depends on how many input and output a transaction has (More input and output consume more size).",

One of them is worth 1 BTC and the other one is worth 2 BTC. Whether you spend 0.5 BTC or 1.5 BTC, your transaction would include 1 input and the fee would be the same. If you spend more than 2 BTC, electrum has to use both UTXOs. This is the default behavior of electrum and as said, you can use coin control to select any of UTXOs you want.",

The coin selection in Electrum is both deterministic and random but with some conditions. You have to look at the source code for the details but generally speaking Electrum creates \"buckets\" from your UTXOs from each address and tries to deterministically choose a \"bucket\" that can produce the best transaction that has the amount you want to pay and produces less blockchain bloat.",

But it's possible to freeze addresses and that may be helpful to you. To freeze addresses, tap on your wallet name at top left corner of the screen and go to addresses. Tap on any of addresses you want and then tap on \"Freeze address\".With freezing an address, you tell electrum that you don't want to spend any fund from that address. As there is no coin control on the android version of electrum, if there are multiple UTXOs received in the same address, there is no way to tell electum which of those UTXOs you want to be used and which you don't want to be used.",

As you said, mining fees are increasing, usually a very low fee can keep your transaction unconfirmed for a long long period, so be aware of what exactly you want to do.Just to give you an idea, if you put 8 sat/byte, it will take more than 1000 blocks to confirm, so if you put 7 or 6 sat/byte as the fee, you may have to wait a lot longer.https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/fee-calculator/",

This means that if you make a transaction with the fee rate of 6 sat/vbyte now, your transaction will be probably rejected by most nodes and it won't enter their mempool at all.",

And not like just the regular Bip39 wallets BlueWallet supports the importation of seeds from electrum wallet. With most features lacking in Mobile electrum I will advise Sidney986 to stick to Electrum Desktop and then compliment it with a Mobile BlueWallet if he wishes to have his wallet on his mobile device.

The best thing is to use a transaction fee that is considerably low and also top priority base on mempool to get them consolidated fast. If the transaction fee  for high priority or medium priority confirmation is not suitable to you then I would say don’t initiate the consolidation yet but wait till then.",

Right now you can see that in order to get your transaction confirmed, you need to have above 14+ sat/vbyte and this may increase as we move closer to the Bitcoin halving.So, if any want to spend from his wallet, he would have to pay this high fee, So it is better to consolidate the inputs during the weekends as i noticed that in the last weekend the transaction fee fell as low as 7 sat/vbyte.",
