But still education plays a crucial role in financial literacy. In education people can learn about important financial concepts such as budgeting, saving, investing and how to manage debts. With that individuals can do the right decisions about their finances and they can develop a good financial habits. Everyone has different opinion on the role of education on Financial Literacy and I respect that. At the end of the day you will be responsible to your own financial literacy, so better yet study and research on your own.",

      "body": "Actually, when it comes to fundamental financial literacy, it is more or less common sense. Here in my country, however, there is a growing demand that teachers, especially public school teachers, undergo financial literacy. That's basically because they seem to be the primary prey of loan sharks, investment scams, and all kinds of offers. Many of them fall to these schemes and are buried in loans. I wonder why this is. They are educated people. I bet they must aware of basic money management, credit or loan management, responsible spending, saving, and so on. I guess this isn't about the lack of financial education anymore. It is more of financial self-discipline. It's more of overall awareness, of knowing how to distinguish risk and red flags, and not just in finance.",

While studying economics and finance can be helpful, the cryptocurrency market is unique and often behaves differently than traditional markets. As with any market, there are many factors that can influence the price of cryptocurrencies, including speculation, regulation, adoption, and overall market sentiment. Engaging in trading and closely monitoring market trends can help investors gain a more intuitive understanding of the mechanics of the cryptocurrency market. That being said, it's important to approach trading with a cautious and disciplined approach, as the cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile and unpredictable.",

The teaching material taught in high school is also different from what is taught at the university because the levels are also different, including our thoughts at high school and at the university.Lessons in closed spaces such as high school or university classrooms are nothing compared to the education we get from outside interactions.Let's just say those who are not interested in crypto are a small group that will bemoan their fate in the future while waiting for death to come.For us, the government also doesn't matter much if they are not friendly with Bitcoin. At first glance I think some of them are personally very active with the crypto world especially in investing in Bitcoin. They just hide from superiors or leaders.",

However, the question remains: what is the role of education in financial literacy?The problem is that governments are not interested in the population knowing about finance, they prefer them to be illiterate in this sense, otherwise much more content would be included in the curricula.If people become aware of the swindle that is the monetary system or of the theft that inflation entails, it could lead too many people to be unhappy with the system, and that is not what those who benefit from it want. On a personal level, today there are more resources than ever to acquire information with the internet, but you have to be willing to do so, and not everyone is. Part of it has to do with the conception that we have been inculcated since we were children to see money as evil, to think that all rich people are evil and things like that. If someone thinks that, it's better not to get informed, lest they get rich and become evil too, lol. At least that's the subconscious thinking in many cases.",

That's why education in economics and finance can provide a solid foundation for people to live a normal life, when people aren't stuck with loans here and there every time they need money. Therefore this literacy is important to pave the way for people to avoid problems.While the literacy relationship in the Cryptocurrency field may be slightly different, even though at first glance they have the same view, when people decide to get involved in bitcoin or cryptocurrency investments, the main thing that must be learned is about the problem, for example trading analysis and experience is needed so that you don't stuck with uncertain conditions, through learning we will gain experience because we will be taught together every time we try to invest.",

In today's digital age, the most important thing is to change awareness, thinking, and take the initiative in finding and learning facts flexibly. it is not just the scope of schools, education that we learn and train. Additional knowledge from a variety of sources also requires practice, enhancing our journeys of experience and continuous skill acquisition because it will be followed throughout our lives by the bond of money. That is also the reason why we need to seriously learn and improve our knowledge every day as Marxist-Leninist philosophy has affirmed: \"study, learn more, study forever\".",

In fact, some government educational institutions don't even touch on financial matters at all. However, it's still not a bad idea to pursue formal education because it shows that you're still interested in learning and discovering new things.Those who have a thirst for knowledge and always want to learn new things are more likely to comprehend and understand information easily. This is the positive impact of education on financial literacy.Having a high level of education doesn't necessarily guarantee success.

I remember growing up and learning all sorts of sophisticated algebra and mathematical solutions that have rarely been needed in life. However knowing the basics of things like credit cards, loans, mortgages, interest rates, pensions, stocks, bonds, etc. can be revolutionary in the future prospects of younger generations. It's easy to fall into all sorts of predatory financial traps when you're young, but it's extremely hard to climb back out of them again - often setting back people many years or even decades of possible growth in their money.",
