  "content": "The previous ATH of Bitcoin before its current ATH was around $65k in April 2021. And after that, the price of bitcoin suddenly dropped but due to the hype, many investors were encouraged, creating another ATH which is our current ATH $69k. Many thought that the price of Bitcoin will reached $100k, so many of the investors bought around $69k, but what happened? There was a sudden dump in the price that plugged many investors. And many of them who bought around 69k price were still holding their Bitcoin today. Maybe they think that if Bitcoin reaches this price, it's time for them to sell. It is certain that there will be selling pressure when the price of Bitcoin reaches such a level.As we can see in the market today even though the halving of Bitcoin is approaching, it indicates that we are in the bullish market but more on consolidation.Do you think it is possible that the price of Bitcoin will reach $100k immediately after the halving? Yes, very possible. Many of the old investors are still willing to invest more, and more investors to come which will result in a strong demand to overcome the selling pressure at the ATH level.",

      "body": "Regarding the question of whether we will reach $100,000 immediately after the halving? I don't think we will suddenly grow to 6 digits after halving, and it's note though what will be the price pre-halving? That is the most important question before we can see the price jumping in months and short term to $100,000 (I'm assuming that this is \"immediately\" as per the OP).If it hits $50,000 before halving, then maybe specially if there is really that big news to trigger that massive growth like the news of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval next year by SEC. So really hard to see and speculate, but one thing is for sure, there's a lot of hype that our new all time high will be minimum 6 digits so even those who have bought at the previous all time high of  $69,000 might still get profits if they continue to HODL on it or just go and accumulate in the bear market.",

For bitcoin to rich six digits, that could take some months as people continue to buy than sell. Quote from: jeraldskie11 on October 15, 2023, 01:37:42 AMYes, very possible.

In the next all-time-high? Know that there would be a peak, but which we do not know for now. After the peak price, likely selling pressure would be strong again. But bitcoin would have increased more in a way a the price before the halving would not be gotten to again",

So it seems, for the next halving, Bitcoin still needs time to reach its latest ATH.And for people who already bought Bitcoin at $69, they probably won't sell Bitcoin at around that price. They will have a higher selling target, $ 75k- $ 100k or even higher. That's so they can get big profits. But people who bought at the current price or even at $15k-$17k can sell when the price exceeds $69k.But whatever the high price of Bitcoin later, you have to determine the selling price you want so that you can take the profits. The important thing is that you can still accumulate more Bitcoins.",

Selling pressure in the ATH area is normal because that is the reason why the price of Bitcoin or alts dropped. Well, the ATH zone is the strongest resistance meaning it cannot be broken easily. So it really needs enough demand to break the ATH. In fact, if the ATH is broken, there is no other resistance that needs to be broken so it is easy to reach the $100k price of Bitcoin.Quote from: Texac on October 15, 2023, 09:58:58 AMIf they can confidently hold bitcoin for years then there is no reason they would sell it at the price they bought it at, which sounds absurd to me.  instead, if we talk about selling pressure in the market, why don't you think that people who buy bitcoin for $15k, $20k, $30k...will sell bitcoin when they have the profit doubled or tripled?  so, there won't be any selling pressure that can stop bitcoin during the upcoming bull season.  but everything will have a limit in each bull cycle, selling bitcoin at what price depends on the vision of each investor.  I see your perspective, but the reality is that you are referring to the small investors that purchased at that price. To be honest, if they sell their investment because they have already made a profit, the price of Bitcoin will not be changed significantly. The institutions and whales are the reason of the impulsive candlesticks on the chart. So those selling pressure in ATH, they are the possible cause of that. Based on my observation on the chart, the selling pressure is strong in the ATH area.",

As you said, this can be overcome together with new investors.100k is a dream for many people. This dream has been around for years and I wonder what might happen in the market when it comes true. When a price comes that many investors have been waiting for years for, there will be a lot of selling pressure. If the price reaches 100k, we can see a lot of selling and buying there. It will not be easy to pass 100k, but I think we will pass.I agree with what you said about the halving. In addition, I can state that, as the halving approaches or after, I think there may be some movements in the market depending on the behavior of corporates.",

Many of the old investors are still willing to invest more, and more investors to come which will result in a strong demand to overcome the selling pressure at the ATH level.I don't think it will. First of all, bitcoin's price isn't directly related to halving. You could see some examples of it over the year. Halving is one of the factors that influence price growth and may lead to FOMO, but it doesn't have to. After the 2020 halving we remained in the 10k zone for months. In July 2019 the price was around 12k and a whole year later it was actually lower, at 10k, despite it being months past halving. There's no rule that says price has to go up right after halving and it hasn't happened in the previous cycle.I think that the pressure will depend on the road bitcoin takes to 100k. If the road takes years, there won't be significant. If it happens in 2024, the way you speculate, the pressure will be big. Obviously if we go to 80k in 2024, fall down, move back up and reach 100k in 2025, people will be more confident than if it suddenly spikes to 100k in less than 6 months.",

Crypto analyst PlanB's popular S2F model predicts Bitcoin's price at $100,000 in 2024. However, with the 2024 Halving, i think we will not see Bitcoin's performance similar to previous halvings, as the bear market after the Halving event could hinder Bitcoin's upward momentum. Market sentiment and macroeconomic factors can influence the overall direction of the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, the rise of competitive and innovative cryptocurrencies could threaten Bitcoin's dominance.As new digital assets emerge and become mainstream, they may cause some investments to shift away from Bitcoin. After the halving, rewards will be halved and cost calculation for miners will take center stage. This will increase the cost of mining operations and miners may not want to do their work. This could directly affect the transaction verification process and undermine the security of the network. In summary, I'm not too hopeful about the 2024 Halving and we may not see the price rocket like in the past.",
