Then lock this thread and create another one after a month or better join a signature campaign with strict rules and try to rank you can have a better deal if you are a veteran of signature campaigns or have a good rank, I seldom see a lower rank offering a signature for rent but if this what you want then good luck, looking forward to evaluating you after a month.",
