The blockchain doesn't do transfers. The blockchain is a ledger, it records transfers.So if your actual question is: \"what we can find on blockchain?\" the answer is \"records of transfers\".Transfers are made from \"the system\" to the miners, transfers containing the block reward and the miner fees.Transfers are made from addresses to addresses.If an address has transfers towards it (inputs) that it didn't transfer away (didn't spend), their values, added up, makes the coins that address contains.",
