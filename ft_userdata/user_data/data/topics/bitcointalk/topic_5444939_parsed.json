I have experienced that if you change the withdrawal address that you usually use, it is possible that they will lock your account. That's what happened to me when I was still trading on Poloniex. I really needed the money that time so I withdrew, but I just waited for almost two weeks to keep submitting requests for their support. But eventually, I got what I withdrew.That's why those who keep withdrawing from the exchange should be careful, it's better not to change your withdrawal address because it may take a while before you can use your money or you might not get your money.",

I know there's a chance someone get robbed and the criminal access the account with the original device used by the real owner, but it will cause a problem with an innocent user.",

You shouldn't have any problem if your 2FA is active and you use one IP address all the time, maybe you keep inserting the wrong code a few times, and this is when you will get your account locked.",

Usually, exchanges will lock your account if you have suspicious log-in IP. Something suspicious change in geo-location that triggers their security on your account. However, if your are real owner, you won't have problems to withdraw it by some verification steps.I did not use Poloniex last two years and I don't know how the exchange is nowadays but eventually you withdrawn without problems. That's good.I have never experienced that my account is locked because I submit a withdrawal to a new address, never. On exchanges, you can whitelist your withdrawal addresses but they don't lock your account if you withdraw to a new, non-whitelisted address.",

That's why I submitted more ticket.By the way, my account was locked only when I was withdrawing and not when I logged in.I mean, what do you expect from a centralized service? Most of them take days to respond to tickets. You're quite lucky if they respond to your request in under 3 days or so unless they don't have that many users to begin with. Unfortunately, this is one of the risks that you have to accept if you use their service. At least there are alternatives as mentioned above.That's a bit odd IMO, most exchanges that I know of will lock your account when you log in if they detect you use different IP. Asking them to ask the reason is probably better than guessing here.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on March 15, 2023, 09:24:31 AMHowever, it is not necessary to change your withdrawal address, it's your account and you can do what you want. I just want to inform to those who use CEX not to be so confident. We don't even know what they are thinking from time to time.Some exchanges that I know allow you to add more than one withdrawal address in a form of contact. So it doesn't matter if you log in from another location but withdraw to one of those addresses. However, this doesn't remove the IP abuse protection. IMO it is necessary to do that since not every user is smart enough to activate the necessary security measure to secure their account. Their slow response definitely needs to be fixed though.",

Quote from: https://twitter.com/CoinbaseSupport/status/1158794577320521728A combo of several factors can get a transaction flagged as unusual, like if the funds are being sent to a new address or using a new device. But yeah, the fact that it could be one of the reasons for unusual activities still ridiculous since we know most wallets change your receiving address after every use... it's also an advice you hear a lot.",

It's been a while since I have tried Poloniex but maybe with Justin Sun being at the helm, maybe it's one of the things to do?In other exchanges like Binance, you could have multiple withdrawal addresses as long as you verify and have the OTP correct and other authenticators needed and it could be done. Just like what others said, it might be because of unusual activity and not just based on the withdrawal itself or something.",

So I guess this isn't just about changing withdrawal addresses alone. It may have something to do with a change of IP address, for example, or a change of location, or perhaps the withdrawal to a new address is made after a long period of inactivity in the account, or other possible triggers. This is one of the disadvantages of keeping your money in a centralized exchange, especially when there is an emergency or an urgent need for that money. Lucky for you, you got it after almost two weeks. Some are asked for KYC and each time they submit they got rejected.",

That's something unusual that these exchanges do to their customers. But probably due to the strict compliance that they're doing towards the policies of the government that they're working with, it's like a measure that they should do to most of their customers.
