May I know how it was done? I believe Royse777 don't have access to change this username. Only theymos may have this rights. Why would theymos change either?Sorry Royse777, I couldn’t put you apart from this. I had to publicly posted your name here.",

But for foreign bodies for are alien to the forum, it won't be easy to detect the real author of the post. I believe it is because of external factors that Royse777 made the request to theymos and not bitcointalk internal issues. From legal view, the author of the topic is anonymous, and nothing about the post would be legally associated to the original creator.",

These people are in deep trouble but these same group of people are too shy to ask financial help from others too. They will not eat for two days but is not going to ask money from you. I discovered it in person.What you said here is 100% true. A few years back, when I was still in college, we were in the same situation when we had a financial crisis but was too shy to ask for help from friends and family members. We would skip a lunch or dinner for over 3 months until we were able to sell our property and settle the debts. [...]So everything is clear to everyone. Certainly for personal reasons the author of the OP together with the admin decided to change the author's description.",

A new member who is unknown about the forum, and does not know me (even it could be an unregistered visitor) they will obviously become a little off when they will see the recent bad name I earned. I did not want to let that happened so decided to remove myself from it. Theymos left me two options. Removing it keeping the creator of the topic anonymous, replace anyone else as topic creator. I did not bother to contact anyone to request to be the OP not even any of the escrow, I was just not in my usual mental state. So I picked the first option.Besides, I wanted to reduce my involvement which I do voluntarily for the forum. This place is an emotion for me. It does not effect me when a criticism against me is valid and does not cross the border line but when it cross the border then it effects my real life and people around me.
