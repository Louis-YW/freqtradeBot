I don't play EV-games regularly, but I have tried slots in cryptocurrency casinos and what I see is that they usually have several providers like NoLimitCity Hackshaw and others. If in any case there were slots that were the casino's own I didn't even notice. In any case, I have done it just to pass the time, knowing that it is EV- and trying several, without having in the end much preference for some over others, I guess the same thing would have happened to me if I realized that some are from the casino itself instead of an external supplier.",

(Original vs 3rd Party Slots) I would choose 3rd party slots for few reasons such as the variety of grid lines is a lot so it wont be boring. Other reason is about its better graphic or sound than most original provably fair slot games. Features in 3rd party slots is absolutely more and attractive compared to original slots. Although I also like original slot but I have to say I play 3rd party slot much more than original slots.",

I will also use original games with a better RTP to build my balance to play more 3rd party slots. (Example : Dice strategies or Crash)",

But even if you play in original casino slot games or slots from third parties, you still have to have luck.Slot games from third parties vary greatly, especially in terms of images, background music, or the amount of bets so that we can adjust it to what we want to play. Sometimes we can play several slot games from one provider at a time. But sometimes we only play one slot game from one provider.",

Not really into dlots or have not engaged that much but have experienced playing. According to other users, third party slots seem to be a slot machine offered by a specific gambling platform while third party slots are the ones being offered across different platforms, if I got it correctly. However my point of view of third party vs original slots has something to do with the platform being used; online vs land based (feel free to correct me). Some would also say winning in third party is more advantageous over the original ones but is there really such thing? If you are lucky then you'd win; applicable to any gambling game right? What's obvious with third part is that there are many possible combinations to win from, unlike with the standard. But there are just people who are into simple UIs.",

Â Could switch up in between but most of the time i would really be sticking with those known providers which does have different themes on their slots too. In comparison with RTP's then i dont mind much though on whats their differences.Also it would really be depending or varying on my mood because there are indeed slots who could be able to caught up my attention via just looking those designs or whatsoever.If i do find out to be interesting then i do just simply dive in and play. Overall when it comes to slot gaming then im not really that much serious about on winning but i would prefer on having Â those small winnings on every other roll than on keeps on losing on each roll and less chances on hitting Â up some reels.It does really matter on your preference though because not all gambler would be having on the same taste when it comes to slots but with having that saturated market about slots thenit would be no shocking that we might be having the same choice most of the time. There are known providers which most people been diving in.",

To me, its enough that the casino is reputably fair and secure.I guess the only telltale sign could be that the same slot game is available on other online gambling casino platforms?You could try to email/message the casino itself and ask about which slot games are original and which are not.

Anyhow, it doesn't matter to me as long as the site involved is reputable and legit while on the other hand, the game provider is popular and doesn't have any history of being a shit provider.Out of curiosity, is there a crypto-casino currently that not using a service provided by third-party providers?",

If you play regularly in an online casino specifically slots, whether fiat or crypto, you should see the game providers list on the header in most cases. If not on the header, maybe on the part of the site but it's something you can easily see right away. If you don't see any, we can assume all slot games there are owned by the said gambling site but I don't see any gambling sites nowadays that only have original slot games on their platform.Using a 3rd part slot provider is also a way of attracting users as some hardcore slot players are loyal to a game provider because of some reasons such as; they won big at that game provider regardless of the slots, they always feel lucky at those slots under that provider and something along those lines.",
