      "body": "This looks like a plain semantics issue. Therefore, petty. Therefore, a non-issue. I don't think Satoshi claimed that he/she/they made everything from scratch. He/she/they actually acknowledged people and their works that led to the creation of Bitcoin. He/she/they created Bitcoin out of materials and resources that were already there. And Satoshi didn't miss pointing that out. It's probably the very reason why Satoshi used we instead of I in the whitepaper. QuoteThis further persuades me that Bitcoin was not invented by a single person, making it decentralized.Is this how decentralization is to be understood? I don't think so. I guess decentralization is not about whether a system is invented by a single person or not. It is immaterial whether Bitcoin is created by a single man or woman or a pair or a group. What is important is that the blockchain is not under the control of a single person or a handful of individuals. Ripple was also not founded by a single person. That fact doesn't make Ripple decentralized.",

Kroc stole McDonald's idea and franchised it without really changing anything about it.Satoshi invented a new payment system by using existing technologies and experience from other failed projects. Saying these two are the same is like saying the inventor of the first car stole the idea from the inventor of the wheel!QuoteThis further persuades me that Bitcoin was not invented by a single person, making it decentralized.Number of people who participated in this invention before release is not what makes it decentralized. Otherwise centralized shitcoins with multiple developers would also be decentralized.",

Bitcoin has been one of the biggest advancements in the payment system of the past decade or two.",

So it's quite normal to say that Satoshi would have used existing technologies to create bitcoin.Even today, websites are being built on existing technologies and we all still use them at our convenience.It's the effort of putting in the extensive research and hard work to build a finished product out of the raw material.Satoshi has pretty much done the same thing to create bitcoin.",
