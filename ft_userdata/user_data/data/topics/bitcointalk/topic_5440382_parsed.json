They have active live support which they want to be the main point of communication instead of here but since user canâ€™t do anything when talking to their support, Complaints always posted here since CS is not helpful at all. Itâ€™s useless mow to taint their reputation in case those scam accusation verified because they are not active here. They are once connected with Sandboxcasino that display malicious attitude on dealing someone profit that get in legit way. And their current departure only shows how they didnâ€™t like already the forum for helping the victims to retrieve their money. Honestly itâ€™s already scary playing on their casino knowing that they are not here since their CS took a lot of time on dealing concerns based on the previous accusation against them.",

For some people and businesses the forum has been a hostile environment, and that isn't a secret at all. People have to deal with cheaters who try to abuse their system and after getting their accounts locked they come here to start a scam accusation, some businesses are not up to dealing with that kind of trolls, and that's why some companies decide to leave the forum because for them it represents a bad experience.",

I'm still not sure why the thread was kept off. But their exit from the forum will bring negative perception which will expose them to great losses in the future. I hope they temporarily turn it off for some reason or they come back again. If they have to develop their project then without this forum they will not be able to develop it easily.",

It does not help just leaving like that.

Only if the claims have real merit otherwise they will be fine. We can not ignore some users make noise because they actually think the community will take their side (accusers).",

Well there isn't much of a problem to that if that's the route they wanted to take and are actually resolving those issues, but locking threads here means they don't want to get a lot more accusations against them that will destroy their reputation which is really, really fishy.",
