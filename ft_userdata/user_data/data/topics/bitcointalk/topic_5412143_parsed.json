  "content": "my power source is lithium ion battery packs powered by solar panels with a nominal voltage of 58v.can configure the Antminer S19+Pro Hydro to be able to accept this voltage by putting the 58v in series across 4 hashing modules ?This would be far preferable and more efficient than converting the DC to AC using an Inverter and then back to DC using the standard power supply.The installation is on a boat to use excess power from solar propulsion system when the boat is not is use.Can someone please also provide more details of the water cooling system.?What is the typical exit temperature of the coolant?",

      "body": "Quotecan configure the Antminer S19+Pro Hydro to be able to accept this voltage by putting the 58v in series across 4 hashing modules ?No!The voltage applied to the strings of ASIC chips is controlled to very specific levels and is set by the miner controller which talks to the PSU. The voltage applied to each chip is called Vcore and has a very large effect on how fast it can run and how much current it pulls at any given speed.As for cooling... The water flowing through the miner MUST be very clean because there are several very small passages it flows through. You cannot just suck in water from the river/lake/ocean and pump it through the miner.",

      "body": "No, it won't work this unit PSU requires 380v to 415v so you need to provide enough voltage to make it work and I think you are trying to use DC to this which it will never work.Since you mention you have solar power with battery, you need to convert DC to AC to be able to convert it you need the inverter to turn DC to AC.What I think is you are trying to use the DC voltage 58v directly to each hashboards? I think it will burn the hashboard because the required voltage of each hashboard is 17v-21.6v according to PSU specs.The PSU of s19+pro hydro has two DC outputs you can provide 17-21.6 volts output at 380v input or provide 12v output at 220v input. So I think even if you have an inverter you will need inverter that can provide 380v but I never heard that there is an inverter that can provide a much higher voltage output you might need a step-up transformer to be able to reach that voltage.",

      "body": "You can likely trick the miner by starting it with a low wattage inverter, good luck @that voltage, lol. Then you still need a multi kilowatt pwm dcdc programmable Buck converter, your dc is way too high for any hashboard. This item is also a trick to source. Now that you’ve added all this extra overhead your roi is in the bilge. An L3++ or S9 could run very nicely on 12v but those days are past. You know what, now that I think about If you knew an EE You may very well be able to hack your power supply by gutting the AC to DC stage and entering your own PWM frequencies. A power supply is just a very complicated device for turning AC into DC with transformers and diode‘s then adjusting the DC down at the request of the control board with PWM(buck converter) MOSFETs. I’m not the type to shut you down by telling you why I think can’t be done, I will tell you what you need to do and you can decide if that’s within your capability. Sounds to me like you may have a little money to throw around just for the bragging rights of having a miner running off your boat’s power plant. So that’s what you’ll need.",

      "body": "While it is theoretically possible to provide the required voltage for a miner using a solar array, there are considerable design challenges that arise if forgoing an inverter is a must. For one, the standard SMPS that provides power to the hash boards and control card requires constant communication with the controller, which is handled with some digital protocol such as I2C or PMBUS. Even if you could provide the hash boards with their nominal operating voltage (and that's a big if, loading characteristics of a solar array are not at all similar to the loading characteristics of the SMPS) you would still need to secure a reliable 12V source as well with a DC DC buck, and that's on top of the DC-DC conversion that will be necessary for providing anything resembling nominal output characteristics for the hash board power. At this point, you would need to design something with complexity that is on par with the stock SMPS. Since nominal wattage will likely be in the 700-1000W neighborhood, you'll have to go for higher power DC DC Buck topologies with synchronous rectification, MCU controlled SR gate drive, and feedback loop based PWM generation among a plethora of other things. You would also need to ensure the MCU you use can convince the control card that it is in fact communicating with a Bitmain PSU which will be nearly impossible since it's a matter of FW compatibility. All of those fun things quickly add up to a tremendous time and money expenditure which could be easily avoided by simply using an inverter. It boils down to this: The miner itself works fine as is and is quite happy with it's highly integrated power and control ecosystem, so the easiest and most reliable solution is to simply provide what the miner already asks of you--a stable AC power source.",
