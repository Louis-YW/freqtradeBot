      "body": "I want to reply with the complete number of 2 at the power of 256 but that would take quite some forum pages space and how would you possibly steal from such a huge number, the probability to get it right it is negative, less than 0 and that is why the Bitcoin algorithm is one of the strongest. We also have ready made post quantum computers cryptography algorithms and encryption so I wish you luck in your idea and let us know when you will be successful in the year 2140 after all of the Bitcoin has been mined, maybe up until then your theory can hold up and prove itself true  .",

Just as it's impossible for the human mind to visualize the true scale of the universe, it's impossible for the human mind to comprehend the sheer size of 256-bit numbers.So if you have any doubts about the safety of your 256-bit number, it's either because you didn't use a reliable enough random number generator, or because you don't appreciate the magnitude of the numbers we are dealing with.",

I'll give you 5 tries to guess that number. Did you get it right? Cool.Now I have a number between 1 and 1000000 and I'll give you 5 tries to guess it. Did you get it right? No? huh.Now I have a number between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337 and I'll give you billions of guesses. Did you get it right? No. You can't because you aren't fast enough in guessing numbers before the universe ends. And that's what the bitcoin private key range is.That's exactly what the puzzle is proving as well. You can spend lots of computing power, even pool the work with others and by aggregating your computing powers be able to go through a much larger number of keys but it still is not enough to break a key that is in a much smaller range, as it is evident from how increasingly difficult it is getting to break the subsequent keys in that puzzle. It is impossible to break the 2256 range.",

No, hashes are irreversible meaning you can not compute the public key from its hash. Knowing the range of the key does not give any kind of advantage on that either, because the hash is still irreversible.",

So there is way to come back from hash to original data, knowing the range.Also remember the bsgs or Kangaroo approach are based on public key using the point mathematics utilizing the birthday paradox for solving it faster. But that's also a limiting factor that it can only be applied to 1 public key at a time. Not for all of them together.",

It is impossible to break the 2256 range.This experiment will become also useless and a kind of disaster since you will just spend tons of useful resources and not directly mining and supporting the network!Meanwhile you're trying to get some coins... it will be more safe and sure spend all this effort in just find the next block. I call this as \"the tale malevolent operator\". Some one is tricky you to find a key (or to spend resources in a \"new bitcoin\"). You are spending tons of effort without any guarantee of results. Even if you get a key that has been used, are you still sure you will find a balance ?",
