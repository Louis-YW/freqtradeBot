  "content": "Hi thereI have been playing some time now on justbit.io. Won some money, and my account stands approx 8 mbtc. I asked to withdraw 5 mbtc and today they asked me for KYC procedure (ID and other stuff). By their site states explicitly that they do not ask for KYC if crypto was used to deposit. Update: They confiscated today all my winnings without any other notice, nor waiting for me to send them the documents.",

SIR, in the middle of their page they have just \"NO KYC for Crypto Players\" statement. I really don't see the point to check the terms anymore if this is stated in the front page. If it was for KYC I would play on Betfair, Pinnacle and WIlliamHIll not in some shitty sportsbook like this",

There are many casinos using this no KYC strategy in their title or front page, but after some users check in their terms, they found if the casino is asking to submit KYC whenever they want.

This sounds me like scam. They will not pay meHere you made another mistake of trusting their statements before making deposit to their site, what you should have done first is to pass through the kyc procedure despite they state no kyc because i know too well that whenever they noticed a huge amount in your account to withdraw they won't allow you to do that because they may suspect unusual activity on the account which may warrants them requesting kyc. At this point you have to be very vigilant while submitting kyc because to any slightest mistake it could be declined. However you may moved this topic to reputation.",

And that's why he/she was attracted on it to play on that platform because of the \"promise\" of no KYC in the beginning and it's screaming on their page.But after some winnings and OP wanted to withdraw, suddenly the casinos ask for a KYC.So obviously there is a issue between the OP and the platform as there could be some misleading statements from the gambling site itself.",
