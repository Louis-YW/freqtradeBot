Drm5516@gmx.comIt seems this guy is not getting any response from spamming through emails which is why he takes attempts to try it here in Bitcointalk, this is never going to work he is not getting anything here unless he posts what kind of business that is going to open soon.The basic rule of inviting people to invest is to be transparent and open, hiding what you're offering means there is hidden agenda on it.",

Not like I had much money to invest :-(This kind of posts are very frequent in this subsection, but I'm still not sure what is the main reason to do that in most cases  because as I said, for reasonable people, no information no decision, apart from the decision to opt out.",

Drm5516@gmx.comLet us define what is big by posting the link to your project, you're not going to get any investors by not being transparent on what you're offering and I warn investors and those who are curious to avoid sending them inquiries unless you are not easily deceived by schemers like OP.If he is serious about getting investors he will post everything and be ready to answer any question about his business.There's no seriousness on OP's part, so don't take him seriously too.",

Drm5516@gmx.comIf you are serious about your business and you can confirm others that your business can be big and profitable for the investors then you should share details of your business here rather than putting your e-mail address in hope that a good investor will send you a mail. I don't think that any good investor would ever send mails to someone who doesn't even describe about his/her business, and just asks for investment by saying contact me via e-mail. If you are really sure that your business can solve a problem that's currently present in the world then you should go a describe your business in detail. If someone who might be interested in your idea wants to invest in the business then still you aren't a high rank member that investors on this forum can ever trust. Your account is very new, it was created just few days ago, and you are still hoping that someone would invest his/her hard earned money into your business? I don't think that you'll every get anything specially from this forum.",
