Although we can't be entirely certain since we're not Ted Cruz, his actions suggest that he might consider making Texas more Bitcoin-friendly, especially with its many mining facilities.Some skeptics might argue that politicians often make promises they don't keep, and once they're in office, they could change their stance. However, Cruz has emphasized the advantages of Bitcoin mining for the Texas energy grid. Texas has the potential to become a major Bitcoin mining hub, which could lead to growth and greater Bitcoin adoption in the United States.Listening to discussions on the \"What Bitcoin Did\" podcast about Bitcoin's role in Texas has been eye-opening. Bitcoin miners can help stabilize the energy grid by buying excess energy that would otherwise go to waste. This benefits both the grid's stability and Bitcoin mining. It's also worth noting that Ted Cruz appears to be optimistic about Bitcoin.",

But if this is true it would be good news for the crypto-currency enthusiast in the state and also I think they should spread Bitcoin mining awareness and help with loans to people who wants to start up Bitcoin mining. also spread Crypto-currency awareness generally in the state.",

But besides this, that's a good and important point for the miner, but honestly, big miners do not give a fuc**k about such news.Lebanon might have lower mining costs for Bitcoin but there are several factors that need to be considered like local regulation, hardware accessibility, political stability etc. Texas might be costly for bitcoin miners but it has a more friendly environment than lebanon for bitcoin mining companies. This is the reason we have seen a surge in bitcoin mining activity in Texas, especially after China's crackdown on bitcoin miners. A higher hash rate means a more competitive environment for miners but a higher hash rate provides a more secure network. Mining companies might be running at a loss but as we are near halving prices will surge once again and they will recover their loss soon enough. Big miners can get discounts on hardware and they can buy for a better unit cost for their electricity consumption so why they should care! It seems mining cost is not the only factor miners should think about. They are mostly thinking about current and future prospects.",

And if you think that the electricity price is high in Texas and the US why do you think everyone moved there and not to Lebanon?1) Nobody mines at Google results price per kwh!QuoteAfter accounting for the savings and revenue from each of the strategies, Riot told investors its electricity cost in 2022 was 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour. By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents. For residents, it was 13.5 cents.2) Lebanon might have cheap electricity, but not enough electricityCut Off From Life Itself Lebanon’s Failure on the Right to ElectricityLebanon without electricity after power plants run out of moneyQuoteAccording to Anadolu, the power cuts have lasted for two hours in the morning and two in the evening. However, the erratic nature of the power supply in Lebanon means that most of the population get their electricity through private generators rather than rely on the state-run power stations.Do you see miners moving from Texas where they receive money for not running their gear to Lebanon where they might not even have the chance of running their business for a whole hour at a time?",

Although, it's true that cost of electricity is much cheaper in Lebanon than Texas but still no one wants to mine Bitcoin in a country like Lebanon because their political system is unstable and is highly affected by corruption as compare to USA and the miners want a safe place for their mining operations. If a state's high status personalities are promoting Bitcoin mining then surely they are supportive with miners, and that's another reason for miners to continue their mining operations in Texas.",

Texas needs it, it can afford it and the landmass would accommodate an energy plant to this effect. Mining with its energy consumption has been a real issue, but with success from individuals who have tried other ways and energy alternatives to sustain their mining machines, I do feel now is the right time to do it the way Ted believes in. El Salvador has made a success out of BTC mining, the western world is on the verge of adopting this new decentralized network and system that is part of a solution to world economic problem, everything is definitely in order and would work as planned should Ted Cruz go ahead with implementation of his BTC energy mining beliefs.",

The fact that he's showed support would really just push people from across North America to Texas, which will literally hurt the people by making technology scarce and even more expensive, which in turn will literally force a pitch fork protest to drive bitcoin away from the state. I think bitcoin mining should be allowed, but at the same time should be regulated at the minimum until such a time when bitcoin mining could be supported without causing a huge power stress on their grid, or at least without any other cryptocurrency detriments.

Have in mind that the “D” and “R” in the brackets means  Democrats and Republican political parties, respectively.

If doesn't matter if the miners are using their equipment to mine BTC or altcoins.In times of peak solar energy production, the grid requires peak energy consumption as well. The crypto miners consume electricity for mining, but they also consume electricity for cooling down the mining equipment. The problem is that all this electricity is just wasted away(according to the crypto haters). Why not use that electricity for the producing actual goods instead of mining crypto? That's a valid question the crypto haters keep asking.Anyway, this seems like yet another politician shilling for Bitcoin without any clear reason for him to do so.",

Who is going to defend Bitcoin the most? Someone who believes that the state is the best guarantor of rights and freedoms, or someone like Cruz who believes that the best guarantor are self-organizing individuals? Like De Santis or Bukele.
