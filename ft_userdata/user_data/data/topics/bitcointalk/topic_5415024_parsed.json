You may also find other alternatives in kycnot.me (make sure to check the exchange TOS and support pages).If for some reason nothing worked for your needs, there is paxful.com but note that they are centralized, has KYC required for US people and imo on the stricter side. Some states are restricted as well, see: https://paxful.com/support/en-us/articles/360025513353-Restrictions-For-Users-In-The-States-Of-New-York-Texas-Washington-And-West-Virginia",

And I think the other guy misunderstands how 'land of the free' work. You're free but only within the boundary of the laws. You don't want that kind of freedom where humans reduce to the wild beast, freely to do anything, including murder and rape.To be honest, no KYC, alternative to LocalBitcoins.com or equivalent sound like a honey pot. You definitely don't want to associate with BTC come from whatever cartels out here are doing to washout and laundering their dirty money.",

Or is it just for us here in Asia? But yeah, aside from Bybit, localcryptos like others mentioned is one thing that I remember that can help you trade P2P with no KYC. It's unfortunate that all these P2P exchange are slowly dying out in the era of CEX domination. KYC is also slowly creeping in on a lot of exchanges that were previously not affected by KYC. We know that this time will come but it's still quite saddening.",
