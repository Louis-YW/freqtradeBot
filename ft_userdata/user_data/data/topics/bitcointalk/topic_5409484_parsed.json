Ok after some minutes of conversation on Telegram with OP, i confirm that OP is a scammer trying to motivate you to create an account of a shady fake exchange. He doesn't use BTC official network ''for security reason'' and wants only to do a internal transfer on his fake exchange.I cannot say that I am surprised...https://imgur.com/a/fNSi5Q0",

Yeah I was 100% sure that OP was a scammer when I have first read his topic. I don't want to scream ''SCAMMER !'' without being sure or having proofs, so I always contact them before. I spend a lot of my time to waste some scammer's time Compared to Reddit, or social medias websites, I think that here we don't have so many of theses scumbags, I am quite surprised about that. Maybe moderation is more efficient here ? Maybe scammers knows that this is not our first day using BTC/cryptos when we are here in general ?",
