Let the US/Nato get out of Russia's back yard... think about how the US would feel if Russia and Canada, or Russia and Mexico, made a deal, and Russia brought Russian troops into Canada or Mexico;2.

And if it continues so the crisis will never end.The trouble is, if NATO left today, the war wouldn't stop today. It would take a little while for Russian police action to make sure of Russia's safety, and Ukraine's safety from the Nazi militants. And there would still be the question of equitable dealings regarding the land that the 3 big American companies bought from Ukraine, and some of the 46 American backed, Wuhan-style labs that Ukraine has. Some of might have been legal, and still might be legal and right, even in the eyes of Russia.",

Russia aims to pressure the global economy through the policy of sanctions in exchange for gaining more allies who will enjoy privileges from the Russian economy, including major countries such as India, China and many countries in Africa.",

The soldier is a \"tail\" operating on orders from the \"head\", and to cut the tail will only mean that it will grow back, that is Russia can simply send in more troops. But cutting the head will have a better effect, that is if you had said the death of the person who is giving orders to the Russians which is Putin will bring an end to the crisis, I will not dispute.",

But for peace to reign, each party must ensure that they make sacrifices. Ukraine should pledge not to join NATO and Russia should also agree never to invade Ukraine and take its territories.  Has the Ukraine joined NATO as of this writing? No! But that doesn't stop NATO soldiers from European NATO countries from fighting there for Ukraine ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5413806.msg60949633#msg60949633 ). And it doesn't stop the US from supporting Ukraine with money and armaments.This means that if Russia agrees to not invade Ukraine, that it is a one-sided deal against Russia. Besides, Russia is only protecting Russians in Ukraine, who have been allowed to live there for ages in the past... because the countries are full of people and children who are mixed Russian and Ukrainian.The thing that would stop the war is honesty between the countries. Move the US and NATO out. Let Russia trade freely. After all, the US is about freedom, isn't it? So why are they not giving Russia her freedom? Why have they been supporting Ukraine against its own people (Russian Ukrainians) since 2014... and really before this?The US and the big banking system don't want peace in Ukraine. They want war, and they are proving it.The good point is, this is the last chance the Big Bankers who control the US and the Ukraine war machine, have. Russia was becoming too strong for them, and that is why they want the war. Who will win? Personally, I am for free, honest trade... both inside nations, and between nations.",

He is doing it out of their will and 300k army is meant to mobilized in coming days, another source said 1.2 million. sadly this is not the first time Russia is doing it, the last time also failed. This is not a country that encourage immigrants, so the citizens are the victims. A war the trained soldier could not win, how will the untrained perform better?  A lot of the citizens are looking for avenue to travel out, some looking for scholarship, some through cars, boat, to add salt to their injuries the flight fee has gone up. Everyone is the target even the well educated",

Today began the process of local referendum in four Ukrainian regions to vote on joining Russia. Non-governmental organizations assert that the referendum is sham and that these provinces were actually annexed to Russia by its military surrender to Russian forces.With the increase in the number of Russian soldiers in the war after the call-up of the reserve forces today, other regions will be the target of Russian expansion.",
