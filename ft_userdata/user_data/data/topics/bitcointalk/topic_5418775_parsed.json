So you can't expect anything with them, the only way is contact them in any way e.g. telegram, twitter, reddit etc. That's would force them to take care of your complaints, as long as they're a trusted casino, they wouldn't scam you. IMO if the amount is small, it's better for you to forget with your money and just gamble with the money you have currently.",
