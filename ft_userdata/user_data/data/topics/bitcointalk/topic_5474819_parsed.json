But our strategy is to move towards them gradually. Initially, the focus will be on artificial intelligence.Finding and Investing in AI: Our first step is to actively seek innovative AI and services. We will collaborate and invest in promising projects, taking the first steps in creating a sustainable ecosystem.Building Our Own Artificial Intelligence: We will develop and implement our own AI. This step will allow us to control and shape the technological base for future research and innovation.Services for CGTX Tokens: The scope of artificial intelligence and services will expand. All developed services and AI will be integrated into the ecosystem, providing their services in exchange for CGTX tokens.Our approach is to develop step by step, starting with a key area and gradually expand our horizons.",

But no there is telegram.The term \"artificial intelligence\" can be interpreted in various ways. In the context of Cogitex, we mean the development of programs capable of learning and self-improvement. Examples include machine learning systems, neural networks, and natural language processing algorithms.Space Exploration:At the moment, we do not plan to rent a rocket. Our concept is based on gradual development and partnerships. For example, we may collaborate with existing space agencies or companies to launch satellites for research and development purposes.Funding:The funding for our project is currently sourced from investments and the team's own resources. We are also exploring opportunities to attract external investors.Website and Domain:We fully understand your perspective regarding a website. The decision to use Telegram initially is driven by the desire to quickly interact with the community. However, we are actively working on creating a comprehensive web presence where all necessary details and resources will be provided.",

Each project in this field contributes to the overall progress.When we talk about developing our own AI within Cogitex, we aim to create unique algorithms and solutions that can find their own applications and become part of larger systems. Our goal is not just to create, but to integrate AI into various aspects of our project, including the services provided for CGTX tokens.Regarding the blockchain, we are keeping up with the concept of decentralization. A record on the blockchain provides transparency and immutability of data. In the context of Cogitex, this can be used to track and validate transactions, collaborate with AI and other aspects of the project. The ability to certify that data cannot be overwritten provides trust in the system.",
