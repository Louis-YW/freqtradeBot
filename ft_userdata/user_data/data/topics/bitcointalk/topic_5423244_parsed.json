      "body": "Do not invest in cryptocurrencies. If you want to invest in a cryptocurrency, then invest in BTC; do not mix these things up as many altcoins do not have any potential or utility, so you might as well ask should you invest in BTC or start your business?It is your money, and the choice is yours! You want an opinion then i would say do the both of them, that is good diversification, use some part of your money and invest in BTC and the remaining to start your business, all of this while you are still working as a freelancer is a great plan.Or you could use all of the money to start your business, and since you are still working as a freelancer, you could then start buying BTC with the income from your work using dca strategy, that way you already have a business you have started with your savings, and you have a growing portfolio. Cheers!",

So, if you invest now, you can expect a benefit from it for at least two years. if you don't have a problem with waiting so long, then investing in cryptocurrencies is acceptable. Definitely keep in mind that you don't need all your assets to invest in it.I don't know what kind of business you have in mind, but if it can bring some \"guaranteed\" profit in the short term I would go for it. when it starts, you can always reinvest part or all of the profit in cryptocurrencies. that way you'll have both ways.considering that the market is in decline, you certainly still have a good period ahead of you that is suitable for crypto investments.",

I ended up selling part of my crypto holding and save some for my crypto savings. I decided to just split my asset just to make sure I can start my business and generate profit while still involved on crypto investment.I’m currently have a stable income on my buy and sell business while my remaining crypto assets only lose few amount since I’m not holding huge amount compared before. I’m now slowly DCA on Bitcoin using part of my business profit. My target is to exceed my old Bitcoin holdings slowly using my business profit only.Securing a stable source of income in the form of business first is best way then just enter on crypto if you are already generating profit. Bitcoin investment needs a lot of time commitment for your money to grow since the current market will give you high risk of losing more to your original holdings value. If you have the capital to do both by splitting it then I suggest to do it but don’t all in in crypto if you have a business plan.",

Investing in cryptocurrencies(preferably bitcoin) is a nice idea especially now that we’re currently in the bear market. But for you to reap the benefits, you would have to hold for a long time. Having a start up isn’t always easy and as with all things, comes with challenges. But the idea of having your own business is a noble one as you would be an employer of labor. I would advise you to start your own business and later on, if you’re still willing and financially buoyant, then you could delve into investment of cryptocurrencies.",

      "body": "But why not do both? Or are you trying to say that you will trade actively hence you cannot do both as it needs an ample amount of time? I suggest you start a business of your interest rather than trading. You can start a business and then invest long-term in the top and more stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  Trading is not an easy job. Based on my experience and observation of people I know, in order to earn regularly in trading you need effort in technical skills and you also need to follow the news and trends. You also need the experience because every now and then some strategies aren't going to become effective forever. And besides, the risk of losing is always there and it might be too stressful for newbies to handle.",

Whatever you intend to invest in, you should certainly do as thorough a research as possible, which will try to reduce the risks for your investment. There are certainly businesses that could pay off in times of inflation, and there are also those that could very easily fail in just a few months.I will ask a simple question - why not divide the money into two parts and start a business and also invest in something else? It doesn't necessarily have to be BTC, but it can also be real estate, gold or something completely different that you think could bring profit in the future.",

It would really suck to get losses these days just from how our current economy goes lately.At the end of the day, if you have some money that you afford losing, then that might be the cue for you to buy some crypto though I would advise you to think about it thoroughly.
