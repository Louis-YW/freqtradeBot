Getting some fresh air and a change of scenery really helps get my emotions back in check.If I can not go outside, I will focus on a physical sensation in my body and that helps put my attention on something occurring in the present moment.A good book and a slow movie being on my couch.

It's like a physical illness when the best cure is to prevent it to be happening.I think people need to stop worrying, about their life, job, relationship, or whatever. Just be happy-go-lucky once in a while enjoying the moments whether or not you are in the ideal situation (according to your expectations). Be more grateful and don't be too disappointed if your life doesn't go as planned. Often, you don't know what's best for you and only realize it after some time in the future.Putting pressure on yourself is good for growth, but remember to always keep your happiness in check.",
