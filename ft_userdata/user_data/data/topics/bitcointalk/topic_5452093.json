  "content": "Hello,I am attempting to use Electrum to send BTC out of the wallets on my Ledger Nano S because I lost my 24-word recovery phrase and the firmware is outdated, leaving me unable to send using Ledger Live.Using Electrum, I connected fine to my Nano S and can view the contents of my BTC wallet, however when attempting to send a small amount of BTC out as a test, I continually run into the error \"no sig for\" and then a long string of seemingly random numbers and letters. What is the cause of this error?The firmware on my Nano S is 1.6.0Thanks in advance for any help!",

      "body": "To begin, write which version of Electrum you currently have and which OS you are using.After updating to 4.4.0 and 4.4.1, I had problems with the Android version, and I read that some users had problems with those versions and the Nano S. Since you don't have a seed (which is a risk), I would first try to download the latest version of Electrum from their official site (https://electrum.org/#download), and in addition, I would check if the BTC app can be upgraded for your Ledger via Ledger Live Manager. If none of the above works and no one offers another solution (you can present your problem here (https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues), your only option is to upgrade the Ledger firmware and hope that everything goes as it should.https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware",

Do not be careless with your seed phrase. Even when you buy hardware wallet, it comes with seed phrase paper which you can use for backup of your seed phrase.For your question, contact ledger support after you have updated to the new electrum which is 4.4.2. If you update it and nothing good come up, contact electrum support.",

      "body": "Hi! That sounds similar to https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8365Which version of Electrum are you using? Please make sure you are using the latest.If so, could you please provide debug logs for when the error occurs. In particular I would like the exception \"traceback\". That would probably greatly help in reproducing and fixing.(Feel free to comment on the github issue too. In fact I would notice any replies faster there, and probably reply faster myself.)",

The fix will be released in 4.4.3 (perhaps later this week but no guarantees).In the meantime, you can go back to Electrum 4.3.4, which should not have this issue.",

If you update it and nothing good come up, contact electrum support.According to what the OP wrote, the problem is not in the HW itself, so there is no point in contacting Ledger support, who would advise him to upgrade the firmware anyway, which is always a risk if you don't have a backup. What should be emphasized is that Electrum does not have official support in the form of an e-mail or something similar, and the only way to report a problem is through their official github or hope that someone like @ghost43 will read your question.",
