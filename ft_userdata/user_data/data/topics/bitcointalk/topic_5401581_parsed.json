If the fee is not shown, you can click on 'view on block explorer' instead, but which will connect to blockstream, one of the blockchain explorers that details you the transaction in which the fee is included.",

I'm not really that familiar with Electrum's scripts, but it should be possible to write something that does that. I found this[1].Alternatively (if you have the technical knowledge) you can always use a blockexplorer's API[2] to watch your addresses and retrieve the transactions history (with the fees).[1] https://gist.github.com/chill117/58f22c073db8f9d230ae[2] https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/blockchain-data/unified-endpoints/get-transaction-details-by-transaction-id",

Would creating a watch-only wallet on Android would make that info displayed? That works. I just tried it by importing a random address from mempool.space. The thing is, for some reason it doesn't display the fees for all outgoing transactions. I had to browse down a bit and as you can see, it's visible for outgoing transactions. But for the most recent ones that were made, the info is not there.",
