  "content": "The digital world continues to evolve from time to time. Various works and innovations were born with various advantages to facilitate human activities in all sectors.Bitcoin is clear evidence of an innovation created to make it easier for humans to deal with transactions in the digital sector.The convenience that exists in Bitcoin is able to lure many people to make it a future digital currency asset.Because the Bitcoin transaction process is quite easy, everyone only needs to save the address and private key to keep it accessible anytime and anywhere as long as the internet is still around.I was inspired by an activity carried out by a bitcointalk account on this forum. He donated BTC to buy a laptop from the proceeds he got from his signature campaign work and taught them about Bitcoin. For me that is an extraordinary thing.Have we ever thought on the sidelines of our minds being bored while in front of a computer/laptop/android and so on, who will continue our activities in this forum? If our answer is children, can they be as consistent as we expect? Are they able to divide the time between formal education and time learning about Bitcoin?Can we hand over the account password and private key to access our Bitcoin wallet from now on?I want to find answers in this forum related to what I think.What's the way out?",

If our answer is children, can they be as consistent as we expect? When many members here were children, Bitcoin had very likely not been invented yet, so no one really expects children to take over the forum.There is no point at which the current forum members would collectively abandon the forum, there are users of all ages here and there would be a slow transition as time goes by.Quote from: yudi09 on July 25, 2022, 07:43:23 PMCan we hand over the account password and private key to access our Bitcoin wallet from now on?Again, no one is handing over their private keys to children, and imo, no one should ideally be handing down their account password. Social platforms are not heirlooms which gets transfered or inherited.",

Quote from: yudi09 on July 25, 2022, 07:43:23 PMwho will continue our activities in this forum? There was when I was scared that there won't be continuity. I created a topic in the beginners and help board where I was asking who will be our researcher if Fillippone is no longer here, what happens if the likes of DdmrDdmr LoyceV are no longer available in the forum. But after I read about someone like Lauda, Vod, Tman etc that I didn't meet, I laughed and concluded that some excellent users we see now are maintaining legacies and some are not 100% good from onset. But when the time was ripe, they became legends.Quote from: yudi09 on July 25, 2022, 07:43:23 PMCan we hand over the account password and private key to access our Bitcoin wallet from now on?I don't understand the place of this question in your post.

I have seen many loss their Bitcoin because of inability to save it for long period of time. The best advantage I can say is for security and liberty. there are many many options to store the private key/seed. there is no limit to options that make it easier for people to keep long term. your not forced to keep one copy and have to protect it with your like (unlike a gold nugget)if you consider bitcoin from the prospective of 'if you had to make a transaction using only pen and paper' then yes noticing the cryptography of signature proofs make it very complicated(i read the code and done stuff some in that area for other projects(re-typing it out not pen/paper ofcourse), so i know its not childsplay)but from the process of a user experience. just copy and pasting an address/qr code scanning, typing in an amount and pressing send. it is easy. compare it to bank notes. to pay someone you have to physically go to a bank ATM type in a pin number get the cash. travel physically else where and hand it to the recipient. is less easycompare it to debit card fiat. for an online purchasehaving to type in a long number, expiry date, CVV number. your name, billing address. and sometimes have the bank do a random security 2factor check. is less than easyfor me bitcoin is easier to secure value in what fiat world would describe as a offshore trust account. its simpler in bitcoin by just paying a bitcoin multisig address in the bitcoin world. no bank managers are needed no accountant or no lawyers to contract multiple people to a trust needed. you simply fund a bitcoin multisig address and its done, funds are safe. and control is equally shared between who you hand keys to without giving any of them individual control.",

Just like a formal school, you progress or you are promoted to the next class or membership rank when you acquire a certain level of knowledge. All things been equal, the level of knowledge of a member cannot be compared to the experience of a Hero or Legendary member. If you hand over a Senior member account to someone that has the knowledge of a Newbie, what would be the outcome? If a lecturer who is a professor, hands over his certificate and appointment letter to his son and instructs him to take over his lecturing job because he was retiring, what would the first degree son teach? If my child is interested in Bitcoin or the forum, he needs to build his own career because that is the only way he can learn and become proficient.",
