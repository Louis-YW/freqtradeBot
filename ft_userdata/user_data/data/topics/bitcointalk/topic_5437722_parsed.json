Bitnaka can reach $10 in the future it is a mistake and never believe this nonsense.Obviously, Bitnaka is a scam under the guise of a Ponzi scheme that they are running, we already know in general with Ponzi schemes it will eventually run away investors' money and I hope beginners don't get caught up in their pumping seductions.",

I mean seriously just chatgpt would produce better results.And so far i haven't seen ANY projects with picture of certificate that isn't a scam. It's pretty much guarantee of a scam:And this is so stupid guarantee that it made me spill my coffee, and i am not talking about spelling errors, anyone can see that scam is \"Garanteed\", it's like someone who made this was: \"f*ck it, anything goes\":But who cares, you can invent your own reality when you are a scammer.I am guessing they are not doing KYCs but if they are, they are going to sell them in black market so it's your own fault if you gave them anything.",

      "body": "Quite apart from the fact that this site is a scam, if anyone in this world had a bot to double income in ten days, there will be no one else having anything of financial value anymore right after one single year using the bot. Even investing only 1$, the amount after one year would be higher than all money existing on this globe. A rough calculation (2^32) of course ignoring the fact the bot just can't work that way, but nevertheless ... So, why would someone with such capabilities put up a site like this? .... exactly.So one may neglect deficencies in elementary spelling, may even neglect the fact, people on this site are hiding their identity or the fact, somebody unknown uses anonymous payment methods to steal our money. But do never neglect: if something sounds to be too good to be true, hands off!",

There is a detail on what is their program all about. You can also check their faq page for this.The service that they offer is a trading bot but it's already configured by them and I think they will also operate it for us. Interested customers are only going to deposit some coins and they will now automatically receive a profit depending on the plan that they choose. They are still things which are questionable so all must be careful about it this one.",

But if not, it will be a loss for me. It was only $10 anyway.But unfortunately, the coin has not been listed on a centralized exchange, so it has received less attention from traders or investors. Or am I wrong?I'm curious about the deposit process that will enter after 3 confirmations, but the withdrawal process can be up to a maximum of 24 hours. Even though we know 3 confirmations can be less than 1 hour. Isn't the withdrawal process automatic, @OP?",
