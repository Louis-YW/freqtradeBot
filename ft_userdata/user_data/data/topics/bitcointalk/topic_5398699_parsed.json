Don't invest in crypto if you can't afford the loss.This should be; don't invest in anything more than you can afford to lose. Investments bear a certain level of risk, with the possibility of losing your investment. Do not put in more than you can spare.Also, do your damn research. Not every asset or currency should be bought; that's not diversification, it's simply creating more ways you can get burned out.",

This just one of the pump and dump coin with selfish interest from developers and influencers. Having diversified portfolio and minimizing risk would have reduced the panic but unfortunately it is already late",

We should invest only what we can afford the loss. I only apply this rule to trading, not investing. I have almost all my money in bitcoin and I convert some to stable coins sometimes and back to bitcoin. Is this risky? I think it is worth going for than holding fiat.But the rules applies to altcoins because some altcoins are just shitcoins and a good one just like how Luna was before it become a shitcoin, we can say altcoins is like you are gambling so should treated that way. There is still nothing bad to invest 10% of my bitcoin on altcoins, out of 10% taken, some should be profitable, but this will be after a significant bear market which I am still expecting. After bull market, converting it from altcoin to bitcoin is not bad because altcoin falls significantly than bitcoin.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on May 14, 2022, 07:29:00 PMDo not invest in pump and dump shit coinsTo be serious about this, nobody expected Luna to be a pump and dump coin. I hope people should be wiser by this time not to invest on altcoins unless they see it as gambling and be treated as gambling.",

If anyone really wants to be in crypto then be in bitcoin, as simple as it is. Just imagine this, if there were no bitcoin then would there be any crypto. No. So why play with fake digits when you have the real one for you. It's not that you have to have a whole bitcoin.You want to buy $10 worth of crypto? Buy bitcoin.",

So no, they can't be compare to ETH and all any other competition right now is just a copy cat version.
