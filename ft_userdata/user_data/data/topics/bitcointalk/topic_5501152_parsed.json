Of course I'm Satoshi. In fact, we're all Satoshi. Each Bitcoiner becomes a part of the network. But if you're asking what I'd do if I was Satoshi, that's another story. I'd keep working on the project to make it as decentralized as possible. How to fix today's current landscape you say? Easy. I'd devise a mechanism that would help prevent any single entity from \"owning\" a large portion of the circulating supply. An equitable distribution of BTC among peers. This eliminates the risk of centralization or the concentration of power among the wealthy. Giants like BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and even centralized exchanges won't be able to accumulate large portions of BTC and use that to manipulate the network to their own advantage. Bitcoin would be fairer than Fiat, and truly-unstoppable. But I'm afraid greed has taken over the minds of core Bitcoin developers (and retail investors, too). So they will carry on as usual without giving a damn about decentralization, and equitability. With the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and whatnot, I'd bet Satoshi is upset of the path his creation has taken. Don't you agree?",

I doubt Satoshi even if available can make any changes or improvements without assistance or acceptance by the community. Bitcoin has no head, meaning satoshi doesn't necessarily have the power to change any protocol in the Blockchain without public acceptance.

Because they would have to tell congress? I think there's a reasonable chance that Bitcoin could have been a government project but this argument makes no sense it me. Especially when the protocol first launched and the legal status of the token was more hazy. I think much more likely is that Satoshi did not send any because they just didn't feel like it, or in the case of it being government affiliated, the entity behind it wants to play the long game and wait for mass adoption before revealing they have a substantial treasury of the stuff. Like I could see maybe in 2075 they de classify some things, reveal Bitcoin was some DARPA operation, and now the US has the largest individual share of the world's most desired asset. Although if I were them I'd want a bit more than just 5%.",
