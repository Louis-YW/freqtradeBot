  "content": "I recently migrated my BRD wallet to the CoinBase wallet app. I’ve made a few smaller transactions since importing from BRD.I made two transactions from the app (outgoing) several hours ago and they still have 0 confirmations.  Normally I wouldn’t be worried, but I just downloaded the CoinBase Wallet app on another device and imported the same wallet — on the new device there is no sign of the transactions AND it’s showing the wallet balance as $0?!?! I also ran the first transaction through an accelerator to no avail.Can anyone take a peek and let me know what could be wrong?Transaction Hashes:aa6183eb476f2b41ae98893e4a55b8d7dc80e068e3c731f8d11516e9c982eb2085dcef97d8e99491201c577e9165f328c4def1a749c7b26369561aa056d6e37b",

I will advice you to use Electrum wallet (to import the seed phrase), you will be able to make use of RBF instead to pump the fee which is better and will save you fee. You can not use RBF on Coinbase noncustododial wallet and most other wallet as they do not support RBF feature.",

      "body": "If you can't see the transactions now, I doubt you'll see them once the transactions get confirmed. It must be a visual glitch. But as mentioned above, you should go with Electrum instead. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to restore your wallet (for BRD users)[1]. The transactions should show once you complete the steps.[1] https://bitcoinelectrum.com/restoring-your-multibithd-wallet-in-electrum/",

I also ran the first transaction through an accelerator to no avail.It should still be there since your two transactions are still valid,it's just the Coinbase Wallet app doesn't check for BRD wallet's derivation path by default, so it takes time for their server to check for the balance.If you need to speed it up, enable \"Toggle BRD BTC Scanning\" in the Advanced setting.BTW, the transactions aren't confirmed yet due to the network's average fee rate is quite high at the moment.",

Check this Lucius thread, it is active again: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5332642.msg60349909#msg60349909Paying Accelerator will demand for high fee which can be up to or more than $500. So, using the free accelerator can be helpful. Both of your transactions are more than 10 sat/vbyte each, so post the txid and the help needed on Lucius thread.Edit: Sorry, both each are not up to 10 sat/byte, not sat/vbyte.. According to the rules, it is in byte, not vbyte. https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator",

It's not worth paying an accelerator if the BTC you transfer is not big. And Viabtc currently does not accept fiat they only accept BTC, BCH, and LTC.Why not import your wallet to the Electrum so that you can bump the fee if the transaction is already in the blockchain.?",
