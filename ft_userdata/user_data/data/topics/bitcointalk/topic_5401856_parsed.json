But before a miner should start mining, he should consider certain things before starting, like the weather, if cold, suitable for mining. Also the electricity cost should be considered.

How profitable it is, you can do the math yourself, ignore the fancy numbers they claim, you're wasting thousands for pennies. The fact that the only one that was a bit legit ended it's program (viabtc), is a clear sign cloud mining is nearly dead.Hashrate Fee  $0.0602/T/D Electricity Fee $0.0531/T/D Static Output  $0.1291/T/D1.5 cents profit per TH a day, and you pay 10$ for 180 days.",

The reason why they still exist is probably that no one has done anything to stop them from doing what they are doing - and if they are really in the EU then it can make the investigation easier.Quote from: Tigge1982 on June 23, 2022, 01:51:06 PMI would show someone my transactions if there is a chance to get something back.The longer you wait, the less likely you are to trace these coins, because they have probably been mixed up so far and it may be impossible to trace them.
