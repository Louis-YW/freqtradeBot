Most nodes have a default setting to keep transactions alive in the mempool for 14 days.After this happens, you can resend the transaction, and be sure to choose a higher fee (if possible, have no idea because I've never used Cash App). This is my favorite reference for checking how busy the mempool currently is:https://mempool.observer/So right now 13 sat/byte gets you in the next block. For your tx that would be 0.00000013 x 630 = 0.0000819 BTC.",

A Bitcoin unconfirmed transaction that has taken 2 weeks time can be canceled if your wallet allows it. Cashapp is the receiver, not the sender. Cancelation (which actually means replacing the transaction with a new one paying higher fee) must be done by the sender. The only thing Cashpp can do is CPFP, but they won't do that. And the 2 weeks period you are referring to is the default time that nodes drop the transactions if they stay unconfirmed. Unconfirmed transactions can be cancelled (replaced by a new one) by the sender at any time.",

What do you mean by reversal?Are you saying the transaction has been made by Cashapp?If you are the receiver and you have full control over the receiving address, the only thing you can do is to use CPFP method.CPFP means spending the unconfirmed coins in a new transaction with high fee, so that miners include both transactions in the same block.

There's not much you can do except complain to them that they sent your transaction with a fee that is about 1/5 of what it should have been on the date of the transaction.Seriously the cash app platform have been too negligent on fees for bitcoin withdrawal, since the issue of this network congestion started I have read complaints of user’s transactions getting stuck due to extremely low fees. I even had to check and I saw that they three different bitcoin withdrawal fee charges depending on the block the user wants the transaction complete. The first two are calculated based on the congestion of mempool with charges of $3 for high priority and $2 for medium priority. The last they say is standard which is free and they give estimated time of 24 hours for confirmation. Maybe this is what most users use, but still it is a problem from the platform because they should have Atleast deactivated the last option for now. This is also a good to warn people on storing their bitcoin on centralized platforms like this that they don’t have control off",
