  "content": "Russian dark web where major drug dealers transacts using cryptocurrency got hacked by Ukrainians living in the US and they proceed was donated to Kyiv charity. A total of $25,000 worth of Bitcoin was moved from Solaris drug market’s master wallet and diverted to Ukrainian Humanitarian Charity.The Ukrainian Cybersecurity expert Alex Holden who chose to play the dark web Robin Hood has refused to disclose how he did this. He only pointed that he was able to take full control of much of the internet infrastructure powering Solaris, an accountable percentage of administrator accounts been run on the illicit bazaar, the source code linked to the website as well as its users' database, including drop off locations for drug dealers. It is reported that for a period of time, his team took control of  Solaris' \"master wallet.\" This happens to be the wallet buyers and dealers used for deposit and withdrawal of funds, which served as the exchange provider for this drug dealers Quote from: https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/12/22/russian-dark-web-drug-market-hacked-by-ukrainian-bitcoin-donated-to-kyiv-charity/?sh=7b4f6fc16386Holden showed Forbes multiple screenshots of access to Solaris admin accounts and the master wallet, and a Ukrainian cybersecurity expert confirmed the screenshots did indeed appear to show access to backend Solaris accounts.With money quickly going in and out of the wallet, it rarely contained more than 3 bitcoin, worth $50,000, Holden said. That meant there wasn’t a huge amount for him to siphon off, though he did manage to grab 1.6 bitcoin, worth $25,000, and sent it to Enjoying Life. Hold Security is also making a separate donation of $8,000.",

If you observe the way Robin hood acted, you'd notice he stole from the rich and selfish and donated to the poor. And if you note, these guys use this fundings in their savings to buy more Cannabis and continue to help Killnet destroy websites of the US, Norway, Italy and others to mention a few.  I think he in his way is helping to fight the war against the Russians.",

Ukrainians are in great pain and suffering, and Russia is not reducing the rate of attacks. They need all the supports they can get.It must be taken into account that Ukraine is in a state of undeclared war with Russia, Ukrainians are defending their freedom and independence from Russian invaders. The Russians are now taking out absolutely everything that can be stolen from the occupied territories of Ukraine: equipment from medical and other institutions, agricultural machinery, grain, museum valuables, even scrap metal from industrial enterprises they bombed. Also, civilians of Ukraine and especially children are being massively forcibly deported to Russia. This is a horde that takes everything out of Ukrainian residential buildings, down to toilet bowls and worn linen. It is estimated that only the damage caused to the ecology of Ukraine by the Russians is at least $700 billion. The total damage to Ukraine will be measured in trillions of dollars.Therefore, the usual rules of the civilized world do not apply to property belonging to the state of Russia and Russian citizens in Ukraine. In Ukraine, all Russian property is now being nationalized, whether it belongs to the Russian state or its citizens. Crimes must be paid for, and Russians are unlikely to voluntarily compensate for the damage caused. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Ukrainian hackers did the right thing. Moreover, we are talking about the money of Russian criminals.",

Support for a terrorist regime is not only a promo vote for Putin and his policies, it is also a tacit CONSENT and no resistance to this vile regime. This means that you will also have to answer for the passive role.The expropriation of the assets of the Russian state, companies, and other structures that directly or indirectly support the economy / war / power / .... is a normal process. And this is just the beginning. Further, this process will become international, and in addition to Ukraine, many more countries will demand reparations from Russia, as the full legal successor of the USSR (which they themselves appointed). This will be Finland (for the attack in 1940, and the annexation of part of Finland), and Bessarabia, and Poland, and Latvia, and Lithuania, and Estonia, and Moldova, and Georgia, and Ichkeria and many other countries affected by the Soviet / Russian occupation .ANY assets will be expropriated - industry, banking assets, real estate, natural resources, ... including cryptocurrencies, on accounts on exchanges owned by Russian citizens. No one will understand \"you are a resident of Russia who supported terrorism or silently sat cowardly on the sidelines.\" This is called collective responsibility for the crime!Hmm ... It's too late to run away from Russia - the iron curtain is almost lowered. Exit from Russia only through a \"Special Military Operation\" and death .....And what we read from the title of the topic is the beginning of the process of forced withdrawal of reparations!",

It may seem like Superman coming to help, but stealing is stealing is not a good action for it. It's true that charities will be the scapegoats in all of this, and it seems that negative views will be on them too even though charities are basically doing nothing.Quote from: Majestic-milf on January 07, 2023, 08:27:17 AMI strongly applaud the actions of Alex.

Hasn't the way of raising funds with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies been done and worked well in the past? even in this forum there are people who are trusted in making these donations, reinforced by the Ukrainian president who has received quite large Bitcoin donations from donors and that is going well. It would be nice if the good results were channeled into a good way anyway. Maybe they act like Robinhood, but I don't know what further to say.",

Anyway, this feels like a personal sentiment to me because an Ukrainians cybersecurity expert choose to hack into Russian's dark web drug market and took 1.6 bitcoin instead of choosing to go over some other website so yeah",
