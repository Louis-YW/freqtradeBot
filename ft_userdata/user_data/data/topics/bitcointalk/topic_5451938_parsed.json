If we fall below $0.025 I will buy a few thousand more and send over to ledger with the rest of the Gala i have as that would be too good a price to miss out on.Wondering what everyone else is doing with their Gala are you holding strong or did you sell?",

The ratio was still 1:1 but the thing that makes me feel so bad is if gala didn't have long term vision. It can be seen from how gala was launching its V1 token without thinking about usability from the token itself which has proved if the company didn't care so much about that. The usability for the token should have become the main concern once it has being launched.

The volume keeps decrease and people have lose their interest to buy the blockchain gaming token. Im still holding some blockchain gaming tokens but it's very hard to increase unlike the blockchain related token or coin.",

      "body": "I like them but I'm not willing to buy them right now thanks to the clogged network of Bitcoin since I've got also other altcoins can I use to convert it into gala but they're not that much.So, I only got Bitcoin but that's not a wise idea for me to just convert it onto Gala since I've got no spare as of the moment and these alts that I've got as a reserve aren't also that much. If you know what I mean that my buying strategy is to buy on bulks into alts and not that little amount just as what we do in buying bitcoin, it's just different in my case.",
