All the best!  I did not use chart, but I used decreasing volatility. If the last all-time-high was $69000, multiplying it by 3 make it $207000. If we should guess that bitcoin will increase to $170000 or not, I will guess that it would as the volatility is not up to 3x. I calculated that bitcoin will increase to almost $170000 or a price that is slightly above it.",

Will it be $600,000 or less?I have my methods mostly using mining as a foundation that acts to stabilize the lows of btc price.if you use satoshi's watts turn into wealth concepts. sha-256 mining of BTC is about 15 usd in coin for 84 kwatts or  17.85 cents in earnings for a watt of power if you have the best gear the Bitmain s21scrypt is $12.60 for 74.40 kwatts or 16.93 cents in earning for a watt of power. Using the L7My gold standard is cents earn per k-watt spent.now above it looks like BTC is better but btc is facing a 1/2 ing soon and I used a new piece of gear the s21 which is not really available and scrypt had its 1/2 ing and I used an older piece of gear which has been around for years.So the standard of cents earned per k-watt favors scrypt not btc.Its only 1 factor but to the huge miners with 20 megawatt farms or more they look at this shit.so there is a pressure on BTC and sha-256 mining from LTC/Doge scrypt miningto me as a miner my fix for this is own both L7's and s21'sIt's different for a buy and hold guy. I keep pushing BTC in the short term by that 1-10 years.But 10-30 years LTC/Doge looks better.I still think we could see a very surprising uptick this cycle for btc maybe 500 k by dec 2025.But in the future 2032-2042 I see miners shifting to Ltc/Doge",

With that relatively small increase of the price, you're already planning to sell your Bitcoin? I guess it's too early. Indeed the price has already doubled since 1 year ago, but to have your worth double is a very low goal. We're still even halfway to the latest recorded ATH.And then why now when the halving hasn't taken place yet and its effect on the price isn't felt yet? Why now when large institutions cannot yet invest in a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US?I think this isn't the perfect time to take profit. On the contrary, this is the perfect time to accumulate.",

For 2024 , I think Bitcoin will test a lot new price areas and that will shake a lot of investors out as the volatility on the next bull run should be insane ( ups and downs with 5-10k$ swings will be absolutely madness and I can't wait ) and if this happens , 2025 will bring a legendary run for Bitcoin. True , once we go over 69k we already in ATH and Bitcoin could stop there and I think a lot of us would still be happy with the run. That's why I do think 2024 will be the year where Bitcoin will test ATH and won't hold it for much but that will be just a warming for what is to come.",
