But indeed, it's good to remind people now and then about it (I would have been expecting this in B&H though).Quote from: CryptoHFs on March 28, 2023, 07:27:25 PMis remembering 12 words that hard?It's not.. until it is. Just imagine a stroke, or a (motor)bike crash, or many other things the can happen to you.Plus, mind is a very strange thing. In a year or two you will be certain the 5th word in your seed is \"about\" and in reality it was always \"above\".So no. It's not difficult to keep in mind 12 words for a while. But the longer that while is, the more chances for something to go wrong.",

Then maybe use other, more reliable ones? Metal, plastic. Plastic? I don't remember anyone suggesting this option. Sure, it's not the best way, but it might be better than paper. Although it can't withstand fire in the same way, neither the tears of bitcoiners nor water can spoil the text. Easy to apply: heat iron dies and press against a piece of plastic.Two copies may not be enough. At a minimum, you should start with 3 pieces.I see it like this: 1 carrier of seed phrases on paper in easy accessibility, which is not a pity to lose. 2 media on plastic, for example, stored more securely. 3 carrier - on metal and hidden in the most reliable way in the most inaccessible place and being the very last reserve.",

Karena kalau beli langsung jadi itu mahal, maka juga berinisiatif membuat sendiri dengan membeli lembaran plat SS304 secara online. Murah, tidak sampai 100 ribu, dan masih bisa di potong beberapa bagian sehingga masih sisa banyak untuk nyimpan yang lain. Dan kebetulan juga sekarang ini lagi ada kerjaan workshop dan ada alat untuk melakukan tempering logam, maka saya berinisiatif untuk melakukan pengujian sendiri terhadap ketahanan panas plat SS304 yang saya beli tempo hari. Biar nanti tidak ragu, karena plat SS304 yang saya beli tersebut bisa jadi bukan yang sebenarnya, sehingga kalau terjadi sesuatu misalnya kebakaran, meleleh atau tidak kuat menahan panas.1. Plat saya potong sedikit (hanya sebagai spesimen), berukuran Panjang 65mm, lebar 33mm dan tebal 3mm. lalu saya stamping.2. bersiap melakukan pemanasan atau furnace dengan menggunakan alat ber-merk Nabertherm asal jerman.ketika sudah mencapai suhu 900° C, plat saya masukan dan menunggu 10 menit 3. Setelah itu saya keluarkan dan dengan bantuan teman untuk menyiramnya dengan air (mungkin lebih baik dibiarkan begitu saja tanpa menyiram dengan air)4. Dan, gambar di bawah adalah penampakan setelah dipanaskan dan tempering, tampak tidak ada perubahan, tulisan masih dapat terbaca walau sedikit menghitam5. Untuk menghilangkan kehitaman, saya berinisiatif mengamplasnya, dan tulisan sudah nampak terang terbacaJadi kesimpulannya, Plat SS304 (memang betul-betul SS304 asli) yang saya beli di toko online tersebut cukup kuat menahan panas di suhu 900° C selama 10 menit. Karena pada beberapa kejadian, suhu 900 tersebut adalah suhu kebakaran rumah tertinggi, dan 10 menit itu adalah waktu tercepat jika ada mobil pemadam yang menyiramnya dengan air. Mungkin ini bisa dijadikan patokan dan dasar buat kalian untuk mulai menyimpan word mnemonic seed di logam berjenis SS304 tersebut.a. Dasar saya ambil suhu 900 [1].[1]. https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20201023194626-12-562173/suhu-api-kebakaran-kejagung-capai-900-derajat-celsiusb. sebenarnya respon time pemadam kebakaran datang itu 15 menit [2]. namun karena itu terpenitng dalam hidup saya, dapat dipastikan jika memang terjadi, plat SS304 tersebut akan saya sangat perhatikan, mungkin jika (amit-amit) terjadi, itu dulu yang diselamatkan dari dalam brangkas. Jadi 10 menit itu maksimal, bisa jadi kurang karena yakin sih safenya berlapis.[2]. https://sippn.menpan.go.id/pelayanan-publik/sulawesi-selatan/kabupaten-soppeng/layanan-response-time-penanggulangan-kejadian-kebakaran-c. kalau ragu (misal beli online) plat misal ss304, titanium, dsb Asli,  baiknya di uji komposisi di lab, namun ya itu mahal, tidak sebanding dengan beli asli yang bersertifikat. Saya melakukan manual pengujian di atas karena memang ada kesempatan aja, kalau pun memang kepepet dan ragu, bisa diuji coba di atas kompor gas, tapi musti izin dulu sama emak.",

What my friend did was that he would write 12 words down, but one is incorrect, then he would try to memorize the correct word that was omitted, and that which is incorrectly included, so whenever he wants to import his wallet, he would eliminate the incorrect word and replcace it with the correct word he had in his memory, at the time i thought this was a good thing to do.After close to a year, my friend couldn't remember the correct word he committed to his memory, it was surprising and i can even call it a traumatic experience for him because he kept trying and thinking, he was successful in less that 24 hours though, but it was a risky event, imagine if one can forget just one word, what about 12 words. Memorising seed phrases or trying to be too clever while backing it up is so risky, just do the simple things and have more than one backup.",
