The situation you describe is so improbable that it is not worth worrying about. In the unlikely event of that happening, we would see what to do, making decisions on the fly, but I prefer to plan for the price to continue to grow in future cycles, albeit less than it has done in the past ones.",

Bitcoin has been in existence for over a decade, and its growth has been significant. This has attracted the attention of governments worldwide, as they seek to exert control over it. While it is possible that governments in the future may have some control over Bitcoin, stopping its growth completely is not that easy. The bull run is not a one-time event, but rather a cycle. If the market goes down, it will eventually go up again. By observing the past, we can conclude that the bear market period for Bitcoin comes to an end after each halving. We can be rest assured that the next bull run will occur approximately every four years. However, anything can happen in between the time periods of 4 years.",

A market only is an actually market if it has waves that include bull runs and bear runs. Along the way of bull runs and bear runs, there are boring times when market has very minor fluctuations, stuck with very low trading volume. Sometimes it will have good dead cat bounces, recoveries and you can enjoy profit if you are patiently enough to wait for such times to gain profits with market bounces and recoveries.A market is no longer a market if it only falls down forever. Everyone will exit it and never come back.The two types of altcoins - An investor view. It is about altcoins but you can read it to understand about the market too.",

Personally, I am very much positive with bitcoin future but we should also be prepared for all situations. Nothing can be guarantee in present times and we must also be prepared for worst situations. There's two sides to this story. Let's assume we do not see any bull run for next 10 years, but we do not see any bear run as well. Which means the price of Bitcoin will stabilize. That will be great for Bitcoin because then Bitcoin will be used for transactions and not for investments. It will create adoption opportunities for the merchants. Price stabilization is a very important thing for transactions. An unstable currency is not a great mode of payment, but when it stabilizes, then a lot of merchants will consider it as a mode of payment.Now if we see a bear mode in the market and the price starts dropping, that will create panic among most of the investors which may not end well. But then you will see a lot of other people jumping into the bandwagon to buy cheap Bitcoin. So it's almost impossible to say what will happen but these are two sides of the story I just tried to explain.",

You know, dude, do you only hope for the bull run and believe that you will make a lot of money in this industry? Even if there is no bull run, if you have extensive knowledge of Bitcoin trading or cryptocurrency, you can't expect to make money in the bull run. That's why there are different types of trading here, such as spot, derivative, perpetual, copy trading, futures trading, margin trading, and others.That is to say, bitcoin was not created just for us to hold it and wait for the bull run to make a lot of money, dude. Bitcoin was not designed that way. Because if I save bitcoin, it's because it's better to have savings here compared to saving fiat in the bank. Second, it's safer to use Bitcoin compared to putting money in the bank. But of course, that depends on people's belief in the trust they have in the bank.",

Bitcoin has many advantages. I don't invest in Bitcoin just because there will be a bull run. Bitcoin protects us from the dangers that may occur in banks. There are many reasons like this. If I owned Bitcoin just to make a profit, I would wait for the bull run and invest only then, but I want to take advantage of all the positive things Bitcoin has to offer us.Today, everyone's priority is to make a profit. Bitcoin always gives us profit in certain periods. The rest of the time we should enjoy the full benefits of Bitcoin.",

If that was to happen and we won't see a new ATH in the next decade, Bitcoin's ability as a store of value would be questionable.But it kind of depends on what do you mean. We might never see another bull run (meaning a sharp increase in price) but we might see e.g. Bitcoin moving up slowly and gradually, not making anyone a millionaire overnight, but beating up inflation rates (i.e. becoming something similar to gold). Such scenario would probably be better for Bitcoin than the bull-run cycles, although it would attract a different type of investors.",
