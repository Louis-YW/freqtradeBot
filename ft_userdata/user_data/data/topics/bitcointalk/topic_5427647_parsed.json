  "content": "This is a great news for Polygon community and market.  A well known chain of store that sells coffee called Starbucks had launched its Beta Web3 Odysey on Polygon Network.What is Starbucks Web3 Odyssey?It is the test of the experimental program combines customer loyalty rewards and NFT collecting and other gamified elements.Here is a video that tells about the news of Starbucks launching its Beta Web3 Odyssey : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoui0NIWmU&t=512sHere is an article that gives an analysis of the said Starbucks Web3 loyalty programAccessing the programQuoteStarbucks Odyssey will be accessible using the same login as Starbucks Rewards. But because these stamps are actually NFTs under the surface, Starbucks system needs to have a wallet address for each member.They will likely provide the option for members to 1) connect your existing wallet or 2) confirm your email address to have a custodial wallet created for you. In either scenario, Starbucks will have a confirmed crypto wallet address added to the Starbucks Rewards profile for each Starbucks Odyssey participant.Distribution of NFTsQuoteThe NFTs are called “stamps”, and there are two classes of stamps: “Journey Stamps” and “Limited-edition Stamps”. Each are distributed in different ways.Journey stamps can be earned by completing challenges or games. This means that upon completion of the challenge (take a quiz about how coffee is made, purchase all the different flavors of espresso Starbucks has, etc), the Journey Stamp will be transferred to the member’s wallet. After this transfer is completed, Starbucks can’t remove the stamp!Limited-editions will only be purchasable, not earn-able. They will be purchasable via credit/debit cards, and concepts like interacting with Polygon’s native token (MATIC) and paying gas fees will be abstracted away from consumers. The Limited-Edition Stamps will be rare and unlock more expensive experiences.MarketplaceQuoteStarbucks Odyssey will have a built-in marketplace in their web app experience where consumers can buy, sell and trade their stamps. Starbucks made it clear that this marketplace experience will be available for “limited-edition stamps”, but they have not confirmed this will be available for “journey stamps”.Benefits, perks and “utility”QuoteThe benefits and experiences that stamps can unlock may include:limited edition merchandiseaccess to experiencesability to connect with other membersThey teased some of the experiences they were considering making available to stamp owners, like a virtual espresso martini-making class, invitations to Starbucks Reserve Roasteries or even trips to their coffee farm in Costa Rica.Redeeming the benefitsQuoteRather than gating the benefits based on which “stamps” you have collected, Starbucks is introducing a new virtual currency (”points”) as the mechanism to redeem benefits.This implementation of loyalty reward of Starbucks via Polygon Network is a great boost and promotion for Polygon Market.  Basically this will give a huge exposure for Polygon Network and at the same time make people aware that Polygon is existing aside from well known BTC and other leading cryptocurrency.Source:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoui0NIWmU&t=512shttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analysis-starbucks-web3-loyalty-program-connor-kelley/",

      "body": "- This is another great adventure and points to all crypto lovers in this industry. I also just read something that was said in the article:QuoteMembers can also purchase 'limited-edition stamps' (NFTs) through a built-in marketplace within the Starbucks Odyssey web app experience. Limited edition stamps are available for direct purchase by all members with a credit card. No crypto wallet or cryptocurrency required – Starbucks Odyssey makes it a fun and easy way for members to access this new technology and take an ownership stake in their Starbucks loyalty.My only question is the number of Starbucks branches worldwide, has this been done, or do they plan to make it accessible to all their international branches? Then it wasn't mentioned how much each stamp (NFT) cost they said, it was just mentioned that it has an expensive price if I'm not mistaken.But the good thing about what Starbucks did is that they use POS(Proof of Stake) blockchain technology built by Polygon. That for me this big decision they made was the right choice.",

This is mostly a marketplace where other Starbucks customer can find each other and sell stuff that are on their accounts. And it's easy because those that have accounts in Starbucks Rewards, they can use their login details there to Odyssey. I guess it's a good application and usage of NFT on Starbucks behalf by naming it as a \"stamp\" and about the pricing cost, it'll depend on the sellers and they're free to price it unless there's a scheme that Starbucks will release as a guide for pricing. But expect that there will be overprice stamps and the opposite.",

But just a company wanting to be on the cutting edge of something. If we think this is something to feel good about then we should think that every big company that has their nfts are great for nft adoption too. Which is not the case.Most companies come in late and try to be part of something they can barely grasp. And to ask that their customers would understand it better is a reach.",

But whatever it is, we also need to remember that this Starbucks idea is news that has a very positive impact on crypto as a whole.",

      "body": "Cool this is masterpiece man! I love the whole idea of hunting the tickets and stamps to go through the “journey” of Starbucks. They have come up with good utilisation strategy of blockchain. This will do both the things, help spread the word of blockchain and ultimately the crypto world (by means of NFT) and also flashing their coffee everywhere on the blockchain. This is really cool idea tbh, and I hope they get grand success in it. In addition to all, it’s a Starbucks so their NFT’s will definitely go crazy High over the period of time. Peeps will love to buy them all the time.",

I think the current price is not cheap anymore. Also the news about Starbucks is not strong enough to lift the price of $MATIC significantly, one of the things that can help the majority of altcoins right now is the good news regarding $BTC and also the upcoming bull market.",

Many platforms are trying to create their own native token, but Starbucks has a completely different approach, and it seems to me more correct. I think it's a great collaboration.",

Bahrain is a small but super-rich emirate that is very interested in cryptocurrencies and the technology it brings. Starbucks is a huge company with massive public exposure, it helps immensely in promoting further crypto adoption either from its customers or even other companies, and governments since they will have more confidence to follow.",
