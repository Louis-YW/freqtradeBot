You should post this on services section instead of goods if you want to promote the said exchange here in the forum. It's odd that the thread is deleted instead of moving it on the right section. Probably someone reported your thread assuming it contains referral link which is not allowed here.Nevertheless just create a new proper ANN thread on the right board.Edit:Even scammer 1xbit is still allowed to post here and freely advertised in the forum so I don't see any censorship here.",

Probably someone reported your thread assuming it contains referral link which is not allowed here.Services announcement board is the proper board of the thread based on what is written. Also, the main reason it was deleted instead of moving it on the right board is because of the submitted report, no other reason i guess. About the assumed referral link in the thread, it wasn't there, so probably its not about the referral link.",

For me, the forum is much easier to understand than most of those projects that spring up every day like mushrooms after the rain, and disappear even faster.However, if it will comfort you, there are many members, even the highest ranks, who do not know how to choose the correct board for their topics, which is completely incomprehensible to me. Instead of accusing others of censorship, start with yourself and a completely wrong approach - if you cross the street when the traffic light is red and the police fine you, are you going to say that they are censoring where you can walk and where you can't?",

I first posted it on Development and it was deleted. I made a separate post asking why, and I was directed to repost the thread in Meta.I did that, but it got deleted again.Even though I can't find the  forum rule I'm violating, it's clear to me that I'm doing something wrong in this community. Not the first impression I wanted to make.I'm looking for feedback and a discussion regarding the theoretical structure of a project I believe is worth advancing. If anyone could direct me to the appropriate person to ask permission, or the right place to repost my original thread, I'd sincerely appreciate it.Thank you!BBIMHO, Development is more appropriate since what you mention befits the subforum's \"Organization of Bitcoin and related projects, bounty campaigns, advertising etc.\"Or perhaps try messaging one of the mods/ staffs for clarification if you need assurance?",

You should have moved the topic with the question to the Meta section, not placed a topic describing your development.Secondly, in my opinion, the moderator probably regarded your topic as begging, which is forbidden on the forum.

As far as I'm aware, the project is open source and anyone can audit it.You have been already answered by the staff that the exact reasons can be given by the moderator who deleted your post based on some report but as there were already two ongoing topics of the same project you should have been continued it there only.But as you said you are new and don't know which board to post then it's not a big deal and you can learn it with time but if you say about censorship then we can't leave forum without any moderation at all promoting scams on the forum right? It's open discussion forum but also have to be maintained in way that we don't have mess up situation with lot of scam threads (not saying to you) so if moderators find it is useless or repeated thread or say wrong board they can handle it accordingly.So don't need to worry about it a lot and learn about forum rules and how to write posts here.Quote from: BB1... on December 26, 2022, 02:21:19 PMHello, I made a separate post asking why, and I was directed to repost the thread in Meta.I also think it has been deleted because of the donation address you have mentioned in the last part of your post which is why it might have been reported to the moderator.Also the Meta board is specifically for the forum related discussion or suggestions only not writing your other post which we should keep in mind and see which board fits for our post.",
