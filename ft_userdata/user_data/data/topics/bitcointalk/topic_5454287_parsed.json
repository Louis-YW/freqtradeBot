  "content": "I had saved 2 private keys starting with K and L respectively which is a 52 characters key along with address some small balances of 0.01 and 0.006 thought i lost them luckily it was saved in my gdrive in a notepad But when i import the key to a electrum or other wallets it shows a different address and not able to access the address with which it was generated for, even tried bitaddress and other sites offline but it shows different address, when I try to use a python script it gives a another new address . Not sure what is the issue please help. So the key i have is in compressed wif format. As i remember taking the private key and the address correctly on a notepad before reinstalling windows few years back.Key 1 - Ky............Key 2 - Kz............Original address to Key 1 - 15W....Original address to Key 2 - 16Q...import results on wallets- 1JkZLnm ( Incorrect) 12BtFD (Incorrect)Python scripts generate - 12BtFDzzSJ9J6PMtpgNq2txazTpiQsx2n2 and 1JkZLnmFfpVFLT2ZMtKzc6BuXMdmY41EHA ( Incorrect)got laid off recently, any advice would really help as running short on expenses this could really help me for couple of weeks.",

Sorry if you already answered that, I'm on mobile tunneling into my laptop so scrolling through the post is not easy.-DaveSo the script was based on a post i saw on the forum, Here it isSo the first thing you'll need to do is convert from base58 to binary and then throw away the first byte (this is the version) and the last 4 bytes (these are the checksum).  What you'll have left is a binary representation of the private key.Next you'll need to perform the point multiplication on the secp256k1 curve using the private key as the multiplier.  The resulting point on the curve is the public key.Like a WIF private key, a bitcoin address also contains 3 pieces of information embedded in it (version, RIPEMD160 hash, checksum)I'll assume that you are trying to calculate the compressed key address?If so, you'll check to see if the Y value of public key point is odd or even.  If it is odd, you'll set a leading byte in front of the X value to 03, otherwise you'll set the leading byte in front of the X value to 02.  Then you can discard the Y value.Next you'll calculate the SHA256 hash of the leading byte concatenated with the X value.Next you'll calculate the RIPEMD-160 hash of the result of the SHA256 hash.You'll then place a 00 byte in front of the RIPEMD-160 hash result (this is the address version byte).Now you'll need to calculate a SHA256 hash of the leading 00 concatenated with the RIPEMD-160 hash result.Now you'll need to calculate the SHA256 hash of the SHA256 hash that you just calculated.The first 4 bytes of this most recent SHA256 hash is the checksum for the bitcoin address.  Concatenate this checksum onto the end of the earlier 00 byte concatenated with the RIPEMD-160 result.So you should now have a 00 byte followed by the earlier calculated RIPEMD-160 followed by a 4 byte checksum.Convert this value to base58 and you'll have your bitcoin address.So when i created a script with the above methods with the same private key i get the correct address but the same private key shows different addresses on online converters, bitaddress etc... I am not a programmer or cryptographer its all very confusing to me",

And maybe you don't actually have access to this address.",

Yes i remember it saving for the correct addresses.Last time I asked ChatGPT to make a python script that requires specific Bitcoin Core RPC commands,I ended up spending 30minutes teaching it why it wont work. (about 3 iterations)So it's not recommended to use it unless you can correct what it provided.So the script that you've created is based from ChatGPT's AI-generated code?Care to share it to us so we can check which part is faulty? (either use [code][/code] tags or pastebin website)",

Could be the writer of the script did something malicious and only gave addresses that they had the private keys too. Could be they just messed up some code.-Dave",
