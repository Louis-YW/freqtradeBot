No one can guarantee profits/a good return in any investment. Cryptocurrency are a speculative asset class and come with risks of losing your funds (the market has performed well so far but no one can know whether it'll definitely continue or not).If you're investing with small change you don't care about then it's fine to invest and just hold onto it, if you're investing with more than you can afford to (and maybe something you could end up selling at a loss) you're much better diversifying into more stable investments like stocks or a bank account/bond with reasonable interest.",

      "body": "Investing over longer period of time will simply make your entry price a weighted sum of your purchases. This isn't statistically increasing or reducing your gains or losses in any way. In hindsight you would be able to tell if it was better or worse than making a lump sum investment, but this is meaningless. Bitcoin is not a stock, which can be traded based on data about its company, it's not a commodity which can be traded based on economic data about markets and industries. Bitcoin is pure speculation. This is why it's so volatile, unpredictable and has huge bull runs and crashes. There's no investment strategies that are mathematically better than any other. If you can afford to hold Bitcoin for 5 years and not sell it for some reason, you will likely be rewarded. And if in 5 years Bitcoin is not higher than it is now, then you just accept the loss and move on.",

With the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, I suggest ditching the idea of \"leaving your coins and not touching them\" and sell them as soon as you hit the profit. The good thing about volatility is you can take advantage of multiple short-term investments in a span of a relatively short amount of time compared to any investment platform.Though I also recommend HODLing, if you are really concerned of price fluctuations in the 5-year span, then better do short-term investments and sell it once profits arises. At this kind of method, you avoid losing more money and earn lots. The only downside is, you better observe and check regularly the price of BTCs in order to maximize profit.",

      "body": "A 5-year investment plan is an excellent way to get into a new asset class without having to put up your life savings. However, just like any other investment, there are risks involved.Bitcoin is a volatile investment. It has been volatile since its inception. Every time there has been a major bad news event or high profile hack, the price of bitcoin tends to drop dramatically. If you are planning on investing in Bitcoin for the long-term, you need to be prepared for fluctuations in price. I would recommend that you do not invest any more than you can afford to lose. I know it is a cliche, but it is true, especially when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies. The real issue is that there is no guarantee that bitcoin will continue to be valuable for long-term investing. It could crash tomorrow and lose most of its value overnight (like many other currencies have done), or it could go up for years without stopping (like many other currencies have done). So if you are going to invest in Bitcoin, do so because you believe in its potential rather than just because it might be trendy at the moment. And by the way, you should not base your investment decisions on opinions from random people on the Internet.",

I.eTo do this, you must control yourself and your coin very well.To control yourself: you should put your coins in places that can not give you instant trading orders.

It looks like you are trying to use the Dollar Cost Averaging strategy but at the same time you are scared of market fluctuations, which does not make sense. The main point of DCA is to enable you acquire an asset at specific intervals over time without you having to worry about market crash incidents. What you are aiming at is long term, not short term.It's been so far so go for anyone who invests in Bitcoin long term.",

If we take into account that Bitcoin reached its highest values in the period after each halving, then we can assume that this will happen again in the second half of 2024 or the beginning of 2025, and again in the year of the next halving, 2028.If you stick strictly to your 5-year plan, it is possible that you will sell BTC during a bear market and profit significantly less than what you could have done if you had reacted at the right moment.If you ask what you can expect in a period of 5 years, then you are asking a question to which no one can give you a concrete answer. The probability that good and bad things will happen in that period of time is something we cannot escape from, but if you only invest as much as you can afford to lose, you don't need to worry too much - life itself is a risk.",

As long as you believe in the price bitcoin will return to ATH it doesn't matter if you start buying on this day. Especially your project is long-term. History over a period of 4 years of repeat Bitcoin always gets new highs. If you buy at a low price of course you will get the maximum profit. Although this year's period is a little different due to poor global economic problems. But I hope Bitcoin still has confidence as digital gold is better than gold. I expect BTC to be in accumulation and that ATH period continues to exist.",
