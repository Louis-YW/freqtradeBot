  "content": "Hi, the big instutional funds and whales they are not special all they do is they use capital together as team to make profit.So we have to do same.My idea: we collect money with money we buy up the coin.Each one who invest funds for pumping will get info early when we start pmp so you can go on long position.Once we have bought up the Market we gona dmp so our members can take short position early.Our members will always earn sure money and they know always first.Im not sure how much each of you will pay but it depends how many of you want to get into this.By the time we getting bigger and bigger so we can aim for even bigger goals.But first let's build up the team asap and collect funds and choose exchanger where we gona do the price manipulation.So how many people come to join ? I think fee for admin should be like 5$ for start and then the pmp ammount 50$-100$ ....or u have better suggestions ?",

Here in the forum? I am sure no one will join --people here fully oriented of possible scam.",

May be millions of them. It does not profit their members but the few people who actually own the groups. They will buy a shitcoin then they will post to buy it because they found the shitcoin will pump. Members go and buy. The volume of the shitcoin obviously is low so it pumps. They sell in profit then tells the members to start selling. Coin dumps. Who got the benefit?Quoteor u have better suggestions ?Stay away from pump and dump.Quote from: Ryker1 on November 11, 2022, 01:25:05 PMAre you reputable enough to hold the fund?Can you give assurance the fund is safe after collection?There are no collateral LOL",

I am a holder. I don't care much about fiat although it excites me when it reach new ATH. Someday I hope crypto becomes mainstream and replace fiat. It's a long future we are looking at though.Anyway, it's wrong when you are deceiving noobs and making your pocket heavy.",

      "body": "Points of correction, whales, sharks and financial institutions are special in the financial market trading, which includes cryptocurrencies as they sustain the markets. Truly, they have the big money to trade and perhaps might team up at times, but this should not be frequent since it would amount to market manipulation which is against the law. Also, it's nice noting that whales don't have much say in the crypto market anymore, if they do, they would have manipulated the market more often, but I hardly see their effect like before.That said, please note that your concluding plan is heresy in trading. The too many armies of foot soldiers teaming up for a collective goal in trading would amount to manipulation too despite that they will be highly difficult to coordinate.",

Or you just want to gather some money from people and exit ?",

      "body": "SmilesWho do you think would give out their funds for just price manipulation if I may ask how much do you think you have to control the market where whales who hold billion dollars to control market, and you are hear saying of $50 to $100 per person and how many people do you think of assembling to raise some billion dollars to maneuver price in any exchanger as a matter of fact, not even $100k will ever affect or effect the market of billion dollars. So I don't see your reasoning would have any impact in the market or could yield a meaningful results also to get your attention keep in mind that it could be very hard for you and I to release our funds for such expensive joke with this bear market.Maybe you need something else that could enable you to make profits or better still buy as it's dip and what for the next change in price to make your profits and stay away from assembling funds from people you don't know. Besides I don't even think a newbie like you would come deceiving those who knows more about the forum than you. As a matter of fact you need to be tag for intending to defraud people by collecting funds from them which you and I know is not possible to just manipulate price with just $50 to $100.",
