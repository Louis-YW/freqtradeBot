  "content": "I've basically  traded synthetic indices  for over a  year  and there are happy moments  as well as sad moments and in my early days of trading synthetic indices (volatility 75), I made over $2k within 48 hours and those days were my happiest days but unfortunately  I lost the whole money and at some point I felt the market was manipulated but I got to discover that I was busy chasing my losses and ended up blowing my account.After taking some time off to figure out what was really happening,  I started appreciating every win but this topic was prompted after I visited  a friend and he complained how he traded synthetic  indices (Boom and crash) and lost everything  over 5k dollars and he doesn't want to hear anything about synthetic  indices.Now I want to know if the synthetic indices market is manipulated.Let's discuss please and the thread is open to everyone, as I will love to know the experience  of others Who trade synthetic indices and if at some point, you ever feel the market is manipulated?",

It does not want to accept that you actually lost a trade for genuine reasons and looks for the next easiest excuse, which is market manipulation.Same thing happens with all other types of financial instruments Stocks, ETFs, derivative contracts etc. For every form of trade, let's not only look at the profits, let's always look for ways of managing loses just in case things don't go our way.",

      "body": "You should have run away when you luckily gained 2K through the synthetic index, it's not unusual for people to gain and lose more through it. They call it \"synthetic\" for a reason, no true market factors drive it, it's purely simulated, which gives room to manipulation. If you are first gaining from it, they might use that to lure you and they carefully designed it for you not to suspect a foul play. But the moment you invest your money, you will start to realize the fact, while some will make sure that you build trust in it before you start losing money.There are lots of ways these days to get your money from people by companies, it's you that needs to be smart and deal/trade with something real and verifiable, not something that could be rigged against your position by in-house dealers.",

      "body": "Many people can manipulate the market situation and it depends on how we anticipate it and even take advantage of it. Supposedly when we have made a big profit from one or several coins, we must exit from the market and take profits because the market situation can change at any time.We must know when to enter and exit the market to avoid losses. But unfortunately, many people still want bigger profits even though their profits are already large. And that's a human being who can become greedy when he sees profits but still wants bigger profits.We must learn from the experiences we have gained so that we do not experience other losses in the future. And whatever the market situation, if we know when to enter and exit the market, we will take advantage.",

The best strategy is building your strategy in the direction of the spikes. Well the truth is that the trading industry  is already  very risky and irrespective  of what pairs or asset you trade, the volatility  is what determines the profit and losses and at some point,  I also felt the market was manipulated but  I also know of a brother who lives a very comfortable  life off trading synthetic indices and nk matter the area we choose to  trade, good risk management  should be paramount  as that is what truly makes a trader a good trader because it helps checks ones loss in check.Quote from: GreatArkansas on June 02, 2023, 01:49:43 AMI believe that it's always possible that synthetic indices can be manipulated because they can affect by pump-and-dump schemes or insider tradings.For me, manipulation of prices can occur in any market especially when you are in cryptocurrency, but this manipulation comes in a lot of ways.That's true  but I think there are trading pairs that aren't manipulated like the currency pairs and  since synthetic trading isn't a real live market readings but synthetic  then I think  the manipulation  might be more over there.",

Maybe we can discuss this in more detail if you can share which broker you use and how they work. I'm unfamiliar with this type of trading, but quick research shows that it is similar to ETF[1]. Some sources don't explicitly state that the price is randomly generated, and instead track a group of assets[2]. At the end of the day though, I guess it is best to assume that some sort of manipulation always exists, either directly or indirectly. Small traders should try to limit their risk and analyze market movement before they jump into this kind of high-risk high-reward trading activity.

But when the time that we're losing, we're changing thoughts and that's normal. While many markets are said to be manipulated, if they're not manipulated then they're heavily influenced. While for particular of synthetic indices, you'll see articles say that it's not heavily influenced by anything so it's not manipulated.But once you're inside the market, you'll get to realize that everything is possible in each market to get manipulated.",
