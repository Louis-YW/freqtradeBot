  "content": "CryptoHFs - Last AttemptNiceHash Solo Mining PlanTarget 333 shares aka 0.0333 BTCPlan management fees 50% 1/3 1/4 1/10 of net profitsSo I've been around solo mining for a couple of month trying runs, direct rental, nicehash rental, nicehash pre-solo and team mining packages and I have come to some conclusions and I've built the last attempt plan and looking for participants to join so there can be that motivational spirit to execute this exhausting plan as it is which I will keep enhancing it even while working.On boarded successfully:1.iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 (Payment-Pending)2.nalien2000 (Payment-Received)3.yahiaali3 (Payment-Received)4â€¦â€¦?Be the next one!My plan is about nicehash team gold(it is like group runs but mostly it rents 350 phs for 4 hours per run) I am looking to collect 333 shares which is 0.0333 in BTC to be managed as follows;10 attempts x1 share10 attempts x2 shares10 attempts x3 shares10 attempts x4 shares10 attempts x5 shares10 attempts x6 shares10 attempts x7 shares5 attempts x8 shares1 attempt x13 shares, or reversed based on the starting date and last found blockThe average ROI of team gold is 35x per hit so, whenever there's a hit during the 76 attempts and based on the scaling scheme we recover everything and keep going.The maximum attempts we will be joining per day is 10.Okay, now moving to the second part if we got a hit the minimum return is 35 shares we will then go for 3 attempts x10 shares each if all three failed we will get back to the first strategy until at a time the x10 shares will hit and the return will be 350 shares at that point we will go 3 rounds each x100 shares attempt if it failed we go to the previous step, if it failed we go to the one before until we succeed in this at that point we will have around 0.33 btc we will use it to go x10 attempts of solo rental on external pool (8 hours x 38 phsÃ—-) if we got a block that's our goal if no we will get back to the previous step, etc.And keep doing that until we get a block worth now $200,000+- or losing the $1,000 that we are risking completely.How does it sound risking $1 for $200? Along with a clear hard to wipe balance plan?The total shares are 333 each share 0.0001Even if you're not interested, participating won't ruin your life. I still invite you to join! Let's make it possible.Last Attempt plan NH deposit address:Use this template after payingNH Address: failed or DM for lighteningspeedReturn Address:Txid:Number of shares: min 1=0.0001 max 34=0.0034 | recommended min 0.001",

Nicehash release a new run every 1 hour x10 hours a day so everyday I spend 10 hours straight monitoring and changing shares per runs based on the results. And if we got a hit during the 10 I remain more time for scaling. The money management plan of this hard working run is not easy. This is why I valued this exhausting plan fees 50% then made it 1/3. If I say 10% or less for all the effort I may end up stealing the reward because the outcome doesn't satisfy the hard work process. So, I reward myself well to keep going. I appreciate your comment and truly happy that you look at my message and took the time to comment. Thus, i will downgrade my fee for the last time for 25% and I hope it works this time and viewers can relate the effort that's going to be done in it. Not to mention that this money management system will save a lot of money from random entries and whether you hit or not. Here you have 76 attempts even if you pay $3 all this should deserve the profit share at least imo. I still want you to join",

Replying from my alt.Apparently when I started using rentals nicehash had better rates, interface and more this is the reason I am using it. However, I will be considering MRR for a test in the future but not now as I have set up everything based on nicehash. Also I don't know if MRR has team gold and it seems to be no for now.Regarding fees people do forget about the outcome.. so you leave a chance to earn a net of up to 150x of your money because someone else will have a portion? Like paying 3 dollars to be 450 but someone else will benefit? Fk no!.. this is not the kind of people I need to join me.Regarding the alt coins you mentioned a very important point that I am building a plan for dual ltc and doge mining but shouldn't be released now. We need to success in this package first and focus on only one thing.Yes, I will never consider anything but solo pools for the last step however before that nicehash teams are more like pplns and the time is locked for all the people so you know the reward rate before it comes.I appreciate your comment and wish you to hop in before the last day of tomorrow to join. And don't think about the fees think about your reward if we succeed.Thank youEditWe only need another 74 shares to operate successfully from tomorrow. However, it would be much more better if we get close to the capacity.",

I understand your intentions are good, the above has nothing to do with you as a person, I am only stating simple statistics and probability.Hey Â While this is broken down into 76 attempts it means you do join 350 ph/s for 76 times. 4 hours x 76 which is 304 hours or 12.6 days of 350 phs not 30 minutes or so. Every attempt is a whole run of 4 hours so in short your break down the risk into 76 times or being able to participate in 12 days of 350 phs and having the chances in share amount is to act like if it was a straight run for 12 days not many ones each 4 hours so whenever there's a hit you can recover and go on.I do believe that we may have a slight difference from our point of view as I came from trading nasdaq and others to crypto so I have some experience creating strategies and I am trying to combine my experience here and there together. Maybe this is the reason I am leaning more to my plan but yeah12.6 days of 350 ph will never equal 30 minutes it give you more chances and lower profits that you can keep working on the same way to raise it until you go the solo attempts this is why b and c will never equal a due to nicehash team gold usage. In business people think first about losses than profitsÂ  and securing the capital so I'd rather go 76 attempts that may even make the 333 shares 400 only which is less than 20% raise than just losing it all at one time this defines the difference between gambling and putting a plan.I appreciate you commentingÂ   and it seems like most of people isn't happy with it so I can't complain but I hope they have seen it the way I do",

Maybe this is the reason I am leaning more to my plan but yeahThere is a huge difference between trading and attempting to \"break luck\", one is proven to work, another is scientifically proven NOT to work, there is no way to solve luck, luck is random.See I really have no issue with you trying to experiment whatever you want, after all, it's your money, but the people who join the runs should be aware that the math states that they will end up losing money using this strategy with 25% fees.Good luck.",

Maybe this is the reason I am leaning more to my plan but yeahThere is a huge difference between trading and attempting to \"break luck\", one is proven to work, another is scientifically proven NOT to work, there is no way to solve luck, luck is random.See I really have no issue with you trying to experiment whatever you want, after all, it's your money, but the people who join the runs should be aware that the math states that they will end up losing money using this strategy with 25% fees.Good luck.Tried to send 1 merit but failed as CryptoHFs is banned until tomorrow (as i got banned for a week for PM ad spam while i was trying to promote the service). I appreciate the insights. At the end all of us our goal is to make money for a better life. Having that said if we 100% give up or lose I will refund all the participants after I purchase btc again soon. At least as an appreciation for them taking the step to participate. Have a lovely day ðŸ’•",
