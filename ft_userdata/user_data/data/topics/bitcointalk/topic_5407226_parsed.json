      "body": "Haha, the guy is so funny. Now he tells smth about changing details. Let me describe the situationThis person bought from me Binance account. Before buying I sent you the account details to check it. He told everything is good and paid for it. I asked him to change phone number and email of the account on his own because  my email which was attached to the account I use for many accounts which I sell. He told me that he would change all details on the next day. While I was sleeping he made 2 BTC transactions in that binance and successfully withdraw them via P2P to his bank account. After that he asked me for a refund because his own binance account was fixed. My argument is that I can't make a refund as he already used an account (who knows for that he used it???). His arguments - 0. Once I offered him (the 4th time) to change details of the account on yours he refused.I wanted to send you screenshots of full conversation but that clown deleted it and wants to blame me that I took money and didn't give him full access to the account. People who worked with me from this forum know that I'm a legit seller and looking for long term partnership. I am not a fucking schoolboy who would ruin his business on the forum for a couple of bucksIf this guy ever contact you to buy something just fuck him off or he will call you a scammer if you won't do what he wants. Just a clown",

If you would see the full conversation you will be sure that I am not a scammer here. He used an binance account and asked for refund because he doesn't needed it anymore as he said. When I asked him a couple of times to change details on his own and take the account because he already used it - he refused. This man is just a dumb",

A couple of days ago, this account requested re-verification and blocked the ability to withdraw funds. And I can’t go through re-verification, since the acc was verified for a person with whom there is no connection. And on the account is about $ 1000 (mine)So, you're a legit seller of verified accounts and you buy accounts from somebody else for your personal needs?Common, just drop it, there is nothing legit in your type of business and there are a ton of shady things happening here, not to mention you advertise full legitimate EU account when your accounts are created with Russian credentials.Anyhow, OP, using a bought account to trade or what's worse even to withdraw money to your bank account is asking for far more trouble than 70$ is worth.",

This email I connect only with VPS + SSH. When somebody buy an account I just change the email on new account’s owner. It’s comfortable for me to use it2. I don’t care what my clients use accounts for. This is their business and they’re responsible for that. If interpol would like to find you - they will do it 100% one day and nothing will help3. Wtf are you talking about Russian credentials if you don’t even know how I make accounts? I find people around EU to make4. I bought an account from somebody else because I had reasons for that and this is definitely not your business, Sherlock Holmes",
