You might have many of the tokens, but they will be less valued compared to the price that they were at when you entered the market.",

      "body": "I see no mention of a rebase on their page... and I think I heard you needed a minimum of 50 Unibot tokens to be elegible to receive shared fee revenue. Also I see the suppy is fixed at 1 million... which partly explains the current price action. I bought rebase tokens before ( Sphere finance ), trust me, they tend to advertise this feature all over their page to lure in new buyers. With Unibot, is basically the innovation of a new product that fits a demand in the market that attracted me, and it already has a growing user base and revenue stream ( unlike other projects ). Crazy price action doesn't hurt !",

The reward is automatically credited to your existing balance.It's not a rebase token like OlympusDAO etc. The fees you receive for holding the token is the revenue share from the tax and from the bot usage; pretty much like stock dividends. The way Unibot does it is just the fact that you don't need to use a stake function like how most tokens do it.",

Although I  never got to know that its rebate token but its been on the lips of some influencer group as a token to look out for and also a token to have in one's portfolio. Once you do your own research about it, you won't have a hard time holding for long if all your boxes for investing are being ticked. The tax shouldn't deter anyone from buying as long as your financial projection works well for you.",
