(currencies dont need to be legal tender money)its like digital gold, which is why the production is called mining, not minting, not printinghowever common daily use money.. bitcoin is not meant to replace fiat where by we get taxed on fiat money each time we receive it for our wage.. and taxed on it again when we spend it through sales tax. losing value through inflation and tax at every transfer.bitcoin meant to be a new option to get away from the economics of moneylets leave that crap inflationary economic model for fiat, where by fiat money is something to get rid of, out of our hands as fast as possible, not to keepbitcoin should work differently to fiat. so lets not treat it the same as fiat, otherwise, whats the point of having bitcointhink of bitcoin as a separate state, separate country in the digital world, where we find different ways to use it that benefits ourselves instead of government leadersyes if fee's were not dev-politicised into fee war surges, we would use bitcoin more regular, but in time devs will sort themselves out and stop playing politics for their sponsorsso for now lets look into ways to use bitcoin, on bitcoin, as bitcoin, without all these side distractions of being diverted and offramped to other assets, pegged/wrapped tokens and crap the dev politics are currently trying to play around with",

      "body": "Real money has two main functions - a payment function and a savings function. Bitcoin can perform a payment function, for example, it is very convenient for cross-border payments. You can also make a transaction for a very large amount by paying a relatively small commission. However, the first cryptocurrency is not very suitable for buying a cup of coffee. Bitcoin has technical limitations that do not allow for a very large number of daily transactions, this number is limited. Therefore, bitcoin cannot play the role of an everyday means of payment. At the same time, bitcoin is a unique means of saving. It is not by chance that it is called digital gold. Being an incredibly valuable and rare asset, bitcoin is a decentralized protocol for transferring value in the virtual space. And as this virtual space develops, the value of bitcoin will grow and over time will significantly exceed the value of gold.",

Keeping Bitcoin shields one from their money losing value over night. This is survival not just greed. People are HODLing Bitcoin because the alternative is worse. But Bitcoin can’t be just a store of value forever. It cannot become money if no one spends it. A money that nobody transacts with is merely another asset. Indeed, holding makes sense right now. But Bitcoin has to be used if it is to be the revolution it was supposed to be. Right now, we’re in a necessary phase. People are HODLing since they want protection. That’s OK. But eventually, Bitcoin has to move. That’s the real test. If it never makes the leap from store of value to everyday currency, it loses its purpose. Right now, it’s a tool for exiting the system. In the future, it needs to be the system itself",

Using bitcoin for buying and selling of goods and services online by the Satoshi Nakamoto Whitepaper p2p has been sidelined and taking over with buying, hodling and selling to another user. As it is now I don't think bitcoin is a global currency since it is not widely used for buying and selling of goods and services.

Bitcoin is going on the same path which it's creator Satoshi have laid down, while we still have it come more earlier than expected about the fortune in it, they never even knew it could have gotten to this extent much faster or this big, which means bitcoin has been serving on every purpose for which it was created, there is nothing to lose or fear about it, because either way you found it interesting to you, it is made applicable in solving any financial challenge on that same field, so don't look towards bitcoin in one direction.",

Let me tell you Op, the attractiveness of bitcoin that has brought it this massive adoption so far is the potential values that users can either trade or invest on it for profits. Exempt this bitcoin would be as common as the traditional currencies. No one will ever care of it is decentralized or digitalized but that profitable value is it main point of attraction but meanwhile using it for payments as subjected has not been ignored rather there are less payment adoptors than income adoptors.",
