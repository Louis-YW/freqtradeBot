  "content": "Ledger started a one-week discount campaign where you can get free shipping on your Nano S Plus or Nano X purchases starting today. The offer is valid until 17 October and doesn't require the entry of a discount code during checkout.  Halloween is coming up and maybe there will be other promotions and discounts from hardware wallet manufacturers. Due to the current state of the economy and the everlasting chip shortage, I doubt we will see big discounts. Offers such as free shipping or free accessories might be the best they can offer for now.",

It is a pity, I would love to take  the chance to save some money in a good wallet but it appears this year will be about the same as the last one, in the case of Trezor and Ledger.On the other hand, if the online electronic shops have good enough offers for their components it would be a good chance to build one's own hardware wallet, like the Trezor Raspberry Pi.What are the chances some less recognized hardware wallet makers take advantage of the lack of offers and manage to pull off their own discounts for the sake of advertisement?",

They are sill in the same mess like everyone else. It's even harder to make a decent profit for smaller companies that can't rely on quantity to stay competitive. It's easier to lower the price if you sell 200.000 units a year compared to only 5.000. Inflation, material and chip shortages don't make it easy for anyone.  Quote from: jackg on October 11, 2022, 03:28:23 AMThis seems like a strange offer considering they have official stores on sites like amazon and are able to offer free delivery via them (unless there's an additional price factored in somewhere that covers delivery from them to a distribution place). I think free delivery is only for Amazon Prime customers. You don't enjoy free shipping just because you are buying over Amazon, do you? Amazon Prime subscription fee is about $15 a month the last time I checked. So even though the shipping itself is free, you are paying that money for something else.",

No way, really? You generally speak very highly of Ledger you sweet talker. I was never a big fan of their Nano X model due to Bluetooth and the battery, but users like Lucius have had one for years and they aren't complaining.Quote from: Lucius on October 11, 2022, 09:42:11 AMIt seems to me that free shipping is something that has always been available, at least when it comes to the EU? Maybe I'm wrong about the recent past, but I'm sure I haven't paid any additional costs for my devices in the past. Maybe it's free when the total value is above a certain amount. Here is an archive of their shop from January 2022. As you can see, there is a free shipping tag under the Nano X but there is no such thing under the Nano S. Something similar is mentioned in this reddit post. The OP claims he was asked to pay around $16 for the Nano S. That was two years ago. In the comments, people are saying that only the Nano X has free shipping. Another post by someone who maybe worked for Ledger at the time wrote they stopped offering free express shipping.There is also this thread by our favorite crypto personality jerry0 who wrote he also needed to pay $18 for express shipping. However, he lives in the US I think. @Lucius didn't you order your Nano X with a discount during Black Friday or something? Maybe free shipping was part of that promotion.",

Is this action related to some event? Also, it would be good to indicate the source of this information. I checked on the official website and saw that the shipping was marked as free. It seems that this is indeed the case.",

Good question. I didn't think about that and the fact there are different shipping methods. From what I can see, it's not express delivery. It's tracked delivery with DHL, Colissimo, or some other provider depending on where you are in the world. I entered some fake details with fake addresses from various parts of the world just to get a delivery time estimate. Turns out you will need to wait anywhere from 2 to 21 business days. Again, this depends on where you are. Within the EU, the estimate is 2-5 business days. Outside of EU 14-21.   Quote from: m2017 on October 11, 2022, 12:39:40 PMAlso, it would be good to indicate the source of this information. I saw it on Twitter first but there is also a notification at the top of the page on https://shop.ledger.com/. I can link to the Twitter post, but it contains no additional information.",

Maybe free shipping was part of that promotion.  I bought X right on the Black Friday discount, and the total discount was 35%, with the fact that the basic discount was 30%, and then on the last day they added another 5%. If I remember correctly, the total amount was about $90, and the shipping costs were free, as you can see from what I wrote in this little review.I think it's hard to expect something like that to happen again, because not only did I buy the device at a 35% lower price and get free shipping, but I also didn't have to pay any additional customs costs because I'm in the EU. For people who want to order directly from the manufacturer and live outside the EU, this is a good opportunity to save at least on delivery.",

It is, yes. When determining the quality (or lack of quality) of something, you can't just take into account the things you want to see and neglect the stories you don't like. Ledger is shit, hence I only consider and like those who call it shit. Those that don't are losers. And those who can't share negativity about the company are lying. There is obviously a big difference between the Nano Xs they have been manufacturing in recent years and the older ones before the battery pandemic.       Quote from: dkbit98 on October 12, 2022, 07:01:31 AMOn positive side, Ledger just started selling their devices in Target stores, so no need for shipping if you have one in your area, and if you want to save waste less money: Target is a US-brand and most of their stores are in the US. So it's good for Americans and Canadians. I don't know how many locations they have intentionally. I could swear I saw a Target store in a German mall not that long ago but I am not certain of that.",
