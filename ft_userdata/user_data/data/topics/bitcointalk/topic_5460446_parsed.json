It's an extra layer of protection. If you can't manage a single-signature wallet, then managing a multi-signature wallet might be a bad option.",

While at the same time if one key is LOST, you can still just use the other two keys to generate your actual wallet.Great combination of security and feasibility.EDIT: Important to also SAVE the master public key, otherwise restoring with able to restore your wallet with only 2 of 3 seed phrases.

It is not hard at all to setup. It can be an extra layer of offline security, but it may not be online security. 2FA wallet is better for both online and offline, if done properly.

I would appreciate more leads through. If you feel you aren't capable of holding multiple keys on your own then there is an option that offers paid multisig setup like Casa which ensures that your keys will be will be stored in multiple places but its all based on trust which is against the nature of bitcoin since it encourages trustless system.I will suggest you go for hardware wallets that are better than SPV wallets cause its less likely to be affected by malware and no burden of managing multiple keys.But there are different kinds of wallets available for different user needs so pick yours based on your needs. And if you are just okay with a small amount then single signature Electrum wallet is enough along with passwords that ensure unauthorized access when device gets stole and buys you enough time to import the wallet with seeds and move the balance in that wallet to the new when the person is trying to brute-force your password.",

Op don't have to follow the general public for some personal decision, if he can't use such wallet. multi-signature wallet is secure and there is no dispute in it but single signature wallet is more easy to use. And if you can't manage multi-signature wallet it is better you stick to the one you are using. Well experience is the best teacher so if you want to test it, OmegaStarScream has given you the full guide to go about it. You can try it and compare the two and choose one to use.

Here in case OP just wants to have better security for his assets that are stored in a wallet like Electrum and looking to increase the security further.But running their nodes on their own servers is mandatory for anyone who seeks the utmost privacy and is not willing to rely on third part servers.",

Thanks for this crucial info.
