Doesn't take a lot of money to make a ton of money. Simple math.Telegram: https://t.me/Komainu_EthWebsite: http://www.komainutoken.com/Can be bought on UniswapContract: 0xFe88c952dFd9595F266BAE053DaaaC411CcfAF07We chose to launch on the Ethereum network because we love the leader Vitalik Buterin, and it is one of the most popular networks that people use. We used one eth Liquidity Pool and as soon as we deployed it for Komainu, it was swapped out of our deployer and went right into Vitaliks wallet. So it is his responsibility what to do with it.We also bought 10% of the supply and sent it to him, so he is the largest holder and has the biggest responsibility of the project to hold the floor and lead the way as he has in the past. We didn’t want to lock the LP on Team locker or Unicrypt because that is too centralized.ABOUT:Welcome to Komainu, the start of an amazing journey! We are the original Inu. No we did not have to add “Inu” in our name to blend in. According to Wikipedia “A Komainu often called a lion-dog in English, are statue pairs of lion like creatures either guarding the entrance or inner shrines of many japanese Shrinto shrines” This “lion dog” is a protector of sacred Japanese history, hence the reason why we chose a Komainu as our mascot.We are pushing towards decentralization and counting on the hands of the community to be the leaders and to push Komainu. We like this because it gives the investors the responsibility for the project. We have not paid for any marketing and don’t plan on it because we are a zero percent fee token. So if you want to promote Komainu we will support you! We want everyone to push the Komainu dream.In an age where dishonesty & dishonor are all too common. In a world where those placed in power abuse their authority, & in a cryptospace where the greedy are in control. Komainu has awoken from its slumber to make a change. The protector against all things evil has been given a new task to provide a shelter in his temple for the innocent  and appoint a trusted leader, with the keys to freedom while also providing them a path. Those with evil spirits who steal from the innocent and abuse the gift of Decentralization will be annihilated! With KOMA and our trusted leader Vitalik Buterin in complete control of these tokens they are giving power back to the people while taking it from the corrupt.There is no stopping us, as honesty and honor is restored and the innocent who have been given the path to freedom share it with the world, together they will again take over the cryptospace!We are united, We are Family, We are The temple!",
