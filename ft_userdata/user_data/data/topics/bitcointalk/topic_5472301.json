  "content": "BTCITCOIN UNVEILED: Revelation of Bitcoin as a divine phenomenon.        BTCitcoin has been a subject matter of digital archeology for its mysterious invention and we are thrilled to reveal the invention origin of Bitcoin has it roots in the bible. Our purpose is to take Bitcoin out of the origin myth of \"creatio ex nihilo\" or \" creation out of nothing\". Bitcoin is a permissionless, chiefless, peer-to-peer decentralized electronic cash system that invented a native value layer in cyberspace. The bitcoins are energy packets of transactions bundled into a block, time-ordered, cryptographically interlocked and wrapped by a cryptographic hash function to form matter or energy(let's say digital gold) in cyberspace. So unlike the common narrative scarcity doesn't give bitcoins a value but a price.    The book of the Watcher Ezekiel is one of the sealed and closed books of the Bible. And Ezekiel is one of the greatest men to walk the earth. By the scrolls he ate or higher consciousness he acquired he was exalted to the decree of beings called the watchers. Legend has it he was the teacher of Pythagoras himself and the revelation points to this watcher for a consciousness and persona behind Bitcoin. In the book of this watcher, we open a reading of Bitcoin's invention origin.Bitcoin is defined in the book of the Watcher Ezekiel as a seller-to-buyer financial system, that doesn't allow the seller to return to which that is sold, even though they are there, and is a vision that touches the whole multitude thereof. This above sentence is a dark sentence written in the white paper defining Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer network, that solves the double spending or reversibility of transactions problem and which is also a decentralized system.   As a divine command of God to the watcher we see the watcher making a chain for our financial system and to track everything. Block is just a bundling of transactions and the term blockchain denotes the time-ordered cryptographically interlocked chain of transactions. If we do block analysis on some important blocks we see them encoded with divine messages. Let's not forget the 1st block or the Genesis block of this chain has the message encoded in its coinbase that reads  \"The times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks\" and another headline hidden under this that reads \"Isreal prepares to send troops and tanks to Gaza\" it is astonishing that after fifteen years history is repeating itself and we are at almost second bailout for banks with their endless printing of money and we are in times where Isreal now has ground operation in Gaza. And what a lot of people might not know is that the 666,666th block or the Apocalypse block has a message encoded in it that reads \"Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good\" It is a verse from the bible.    And we have all the evidence to reveal that Bitcoin has always been a divine phenomenon. Read The full paper entitled \"BITCOIN UNVEILED\". It is one of the revolutionary papers written about Bitcoin since the release of the white paper fifteen years ago.Full paper here:  BITCOIN UNVEILED",

Proof of Work required to generate new valid block, where certain amount of Bitcoin is created.I'd just say commonly known phrase \"correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation\".Yeah brother bitcoins are not created out of thin air, to your surprise this is is a major emphasis we made in the full paper we provided down the post. So we recommend you to read the whole paper entitled \"Bitcoin Unveiled\". When we said \"creation out of nothing\" we are enunciating the myth concerning the profile and out of the dark appearance of the Bitcoin protocol not the actual coins.Yes  correlation doesn't in every case imply causation, then again read the entire paper, and you will know how correlation is the basis for causation",
