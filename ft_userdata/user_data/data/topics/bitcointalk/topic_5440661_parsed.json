I believe that my Router is secured enough, because even when I shared with my gaming console it shows NAT TYPE: STRICT, not OPEN, I believe this should add more security layer? Wrong or right? The question I have for my Bitcointalk forum Family is how safe is my Electrum wallet or other Bitcoin wallet when I connect my smartphone to my router?

Do not see this as a problem at all because your connection with your own router is secure, although your internet service provider can spy on you too.Use a very strong password with your router, it it what you can always access.You know that for privacy and anonymity, you need Tor.For better wallet security and safety of your coins, use cold wallet or reputed hardware wallet.",

Highly unlikely.For better security, your electrum device should not be connected to the internet, but if you must, running it through your personal connection does not pose any additional risk.",

Assuming if their is an actor (attacker) that just know the password and using the router for browsing, that does not pose any risk to privacy. But if the actor is able to gain access to the admin panel if the user do not change the admin password from default, the actor will be able to know the victim's browsing history through the admin panel just like public WiFi. As for security, no security risk, but privacy can be affected if the admin password is not changed from default. But if a strong password is used, it will be difficult for an attacker to know the router's password, before he can even think of accessing the admin panel.",

Your electrum wallet on the PC should be safe provided that you're not connecting the mobile device through router to be interconnected with the computer being used for your wallet, that's why the computer should be an airgapped device with no internet connection, you should also make sure that you don't import your wallet using the private keys to your mobile device which means getting connected through the mobile device can also be a vulnerability for the wallet to get get hacked, always disconnect your device from the internet if connected to your wallet.",

So that leaves the question if it's safe enough, and the answer depends on your personal preference.I connect my smartphone, laptop and other devices in the house to my router. Many people do that, and it's not something I worry about. At least the router uses NAT, so that's an additional barrier between the outside world and my device. I'm not sure if my mobile data provider does that too.The next later of security is only using small amounts in your hot wallet: don't keep all your Bitcoins on your phone! Use offline cold storage for the majority of your funds, and only expose funds that you can afford to lose to the internet.",

When you want to send Bitcoin to the exchange, then you will need to use internet connection since that's the only way to access it. There's no problem about it, actually the risk of centralized exchange would take all of your coins are higher than unsecure internet connection.",

People are the one that contribute hundred percent of exposing your wallet seed phrase, electrum what have a higher security functions which you safeguard your coin using electrum, but were it get exposed is the process whereby the seed phrase is been save via online, but the process whereby it's documented offline it's when your privacy will be assured but basically or depending on the level of the offline documentation.",

If you do see somethings suspicious connection which had connected into your router then the best thing to be done is to reset that router and try to put up a 8 or more characters as password or make it hard as possible.You cant really be hacked on your electrum wallet if you do try to access out your device on the said router, it is really just a connection and there's no way for someone to send out someones coins into their wallets without touching or having an access on the device itself. I do understand sometimes that being paranoid in towards security is much better rather than on making yourself that confident.",

What danger lies ahead using this type of internet connection? That is not a problem mate but what i think you should have done has already been said. You ought to reset your password and set a very strong password for it. No one is spying or being connected to your router. Then for the question of a wallet been safe, that can not be guaranteed even by the developers of the wallet as they tell you to protect your passphrase too.Normally, using public hot spot is very risky as it exposes your details to hackers that is the reason you are advised not to use public wifi to do transactions because the safety of your details are not  guaranteed at that moment.",
