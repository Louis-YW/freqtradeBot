You can compare it with Bitcoin Payment processorsAccording to ---> https://coinremitter.com/ they have a free offer and a PREMIUM PLAN which requires paying around $99.99 /Months in addition to the crypto processing fee (0.23%) which I find very expensive and the free version has a limited number of coins, and the service requires trust as money It is deposited to the user's account.In general, although there are other options, the free version is good if it contains more currencies and the fee is 0.23% without any hidden fees.",
