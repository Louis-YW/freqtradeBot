The traditional gaming will remain as is it which is currently being controlled by Steam, EA or various game pass providers. There will be an emergence of web 3 gaming where the cryptos will be extensively used. Since the market for web 3 gaming is very different than the traditional gaming, it would create a new breed in the market. The kind of dominance steam 9r similar platforms have, would not be easy to eat into.",

For example, if in CSGO you can buy some items with their own token, or in World of Tanks. Then you can count on success. And the main thing is that the number of tokens will be limited.",

So, it's possible that it will be abandoned or it may not. It may not, in the sense that people are getting used to it. The main thing and what's I like about integrating crypto on gaming was the feature that you own your identity instead of a centralized entity like huge corporations out there.",

There's a huge difference there.Quotebut considering Play to Earn is now less in demand so could it be that they will be abandoned in the future?I don't think so. The industry just needs to be cleaned up so gamers wouldn't have to be victims of rugpull and exit scams.Some reputable gaming platforms continue to explore NFTs so that's a good sign that the we will continue to experience P2E games.",

There is a lot of growth potential in the future if gaming companies choose to accept Bitcoin payments and reward their players and some of the big names in the industry have publicized the possibility of accepting cryptocurrency as payment.Yes, With Technology cryptos, gamers can make money without risking their health. All this means that the future of gaming is definitely backed by smart contracts and different game mechanics that will help keep gamers healthy, instead of becoming slaves to their computers without social connections, but at the same time making a lot of money.",

But if they were really serious about building a game that could be both really entertaining and potentially help players make money, people wouldn't leave play to earn. I will believe that play to earn will improve and will return to the market with more quality games, play to earn is really potential.",

I saw the Play to Earn game but because it looked like the previous games, people became less interested. Moreover, they were required to buy a lot of items to level up. And if they went the normal way, it would never be easy. Maybe the team needs to think about how they can make it easier to play and make money in other ways to make players more creative in playing and making money.",

So cryptocurrency also won't have much effect if the game developer can't make Game play to earn, which in addition to producing but also having to focus on increasing the fun of the game itself. this is why gamers rarely play the Play to Earn game.",

It will take time and a lot of development, many games I tried are very simple, and I didn't find some play-to-earn game that will interest me to play a bit longer. In order to get into the gaming industry, crypto will need some better and more interesting games... simply people are ready to spend money to play some better games, and people are earning money playing LoL, DOT-a, CS, and other games... So crypto is young, it's getting into gaming slowly, but we definitely need something big that will make a breakthrough and attract the masses to play it!",
