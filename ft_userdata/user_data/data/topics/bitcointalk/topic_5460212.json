Restarting the computer... DO NOT start Ledger Live, just start Electrum and see if it detects the device2. Plugging the Nano X into a different USB port (windows should detect it as a \"new\" device), then see if Electrum can see it",

Thank you very much.You don't need to use Ledger live for anything that than for firmware update, but if connection with Electrum is not working than I would reinstall both Electrum and Ledger live.If Electrum is not working after that for some reason than you can try installing alternative Sparrow wallet that works perfectly with Electrum.Maybe it's something related to MacOS but I can't help you with that.Â Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 18, 2023, 10:51:21 AMWhat OS are you using?
