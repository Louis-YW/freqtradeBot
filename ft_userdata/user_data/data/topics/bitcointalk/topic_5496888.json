  "content": "The BTC puzzle is to find the privkey in a certain range for an address. And I found that some people solve this problem just like mining BTC. Such as the pool ttdsales/66bit/login.php. I found that the pool probably generate a random address and you should submit something relevant to the privkey of the address as a proof of work. And the pool client is not open-source. I think maybe someone cracked the software and submit the answer once the privkey of the random address is found. So if the solution is found,the hacker may gain more reward than usual. And it may cause the pool can't find the solution.",

      "body": "It’s hard to actually identify whether someone actually has an advantage. You probably would not be able to verify it nor can we. The best thing you can do if you are really concerned about this situation is to raise this concern to the administrator of the pool. They then need to act on it and secure their software to prevent more of this from happening. It’s a shame that hackers come down to this but we should all play fair.",
