So, when you created this account, you were 14 years old? How was it possible for a teenager to become interested in a crypto and bitcoin at a time when it was not as popular as it is now? I'm really interested in this. It's great to hear when crypto made it possible not only to speculate on the price, but also awakened a new hobby and made it possible to get a useful profession.Not only for you, bitcointalk means a lot and has changed the lives of many. Probably, the forum also owes you something for your contribution over the years.Don't forget to put in the profile, in the age column, instead of N/A 10 years.  Congratulations.",

I'm very surprised that how a teenager who was just 14 years old got interested in a forum related to a crypto-currency which wasn't that much popular in those days. But, anything can happen because people are different and they have their own abilities, and you're are one of the examples of those people. Your words can show that how good days you spent here on this forum with all those amazing members of the forum. I know that those memories can't be explained with words, but I really can understand that those memories are one of the best memories of one's life, especially that of playing those online multiplayer games together. I warmly congratulate you once again on completing 10 whole years on this forum, and you truly deserve such respect. I would also wish you best of luck to have better life with the help of web-development because that profession is a very nice one, and earning potential for web-developers is quite higher these days. You just made me remember one of my memories that I spent while playing multiplayer games with my friends, I know that we can't bring those teenage days again, but still the memories are living with us and they touch us very deeply in the form of emotions.",

I'm really interested in this. It's really crazy that he thought so much in his teenage years and made a life changing decision that not many of us get to make. Which has now given him a freedom to live a beautiful life. I could have thought about playing sports at the age of my 14, never having the knowledge to be interested in Bitcoin. So I respect his talent and effort.Congratulations to @minifrij. I hope your ten year journey on this forum was one of the best times of your life as you had many friends.",
