  "content": "From my perspective, Bitcoin is currently undergoing a multitude of attacks let's break them down one by one.Political / Legal. The current political attacks being lead by senator Elizabeth Warren and cronies was initiated after being directed by Jamie Dimon (who has since been appointed as the AP or Authorized Participant for the largest BTC ETF). These attackers seem to be doing their very best to legally separate plebs from their sats while aligning Wall Street to become the custodians of our freedom money.Technical / Social. The L1 Bitcoin network is currently being spammed by Ordinals and Inscriptions which is prematurely increasing the L1 transaction fees. This is pricing out many lower net worth folks from participating in L1 self custody. This attack seems to have a large amount of buy in from NFT pushers and alt coiners as well as a good chunk of the miners as most of the larger miners are being short sighted and looking to maximize profits in dollars as much and as quickly as possible. This has lead to a huge battle within the Bitcoin community and it currently remains to be seen how this will play out.Wall Street Attacks. By now everyone knows that Wall Street is here as they have had their ETFs green light. If the first two days of trading are any guide of what's to come, then I'm afraid to say its starting to appear they're going to buy OTC and dump spot market in an effort to control the dollar price of Bitcoin. Just look at what Coinbase has said with respect to their reported $7,000,000,000 USD of OTC traded the first day ETFs did. None of course can be independently verified by any of us plebs. These ETF / Wall Street folks are asking us to invert the ethos of \"Don't trust, verify.\" into \"Trust us bro.\" In my view Wall Street would gladly take a substantial loss on these Bitcoin products so long by doing so they believe that it would greatly harm or destroy bitcoin in the process as Bitcoin is the largest threat to their way of life.Great so what now? Any good news or anything we can do about it? Absolutely and glad you asked!From my perspective the best part of all of this is that Bitcoin is still alive and is getting more publicity than any amount of money could have bought it! That being said I believe that all of this noise will get people to understand what Bitcoin is, why it's important, and eventually will understand that the only way to get it to succeed and create a more just and equitable world for all will be to hold Bitcoin in self custody. IMO they will realize that to do this in the most effective way that they will need to minimize their spheres of trust and will learn about how to create their own entropy with simple analog methods offline (such as flipping coins 256 times) and creating their own BIP 39 seeds. They'll also learn how to run their own nodes for verification and to transmit and receive their own bitcoin transactions. These actions will allow for the dollar price of Bitcoin to break free from their manipulation efforts and will eventually get us to a better bitcoin centric world that will break the monopoly of value creation and distribution from centralized control.",

Because it is the transaction fee that made people to navigate to use other coins and if the transaction fee is low, the matter the attacks are many people will still be strong and use Bitcoin daily and weekly. And most of those that attacking Bitcoin is because of the decentrality of the currency which they wanted to control but they can't so they use different names and method to Â attack yet no avail.

Coinbase is the biggest bitcoin [fiat] exchange but it only has about 4% of the total market's trading volume. It is not longer 2013 where one exchange (Mt Gox) has 85% of the total volume where manipulation like this were easy, you just had to dump in one place and the rest followed whether they wanted it or not.If you dump in Coinbase, the arbitrage traders would thank you but the market wouldn't really move.",

Notice that loads of the projects that has spurred out of bthe blockchain space has been mostly from startups powered by youths. Also, the adotpion of Bitcoin and blockchain entirely is first moved by the youths even before the government starts working towards adoption.",

I totally agree that there's no way that any kind of attack against bitcoin is possible at succeeding but I'd like to add that it will only be true if the bitcoin or the crypto community makes a move against those attacks, our indifference to the issue that bitcoin is facing is a detrimental thing even if we don't think so and just keep on turning a blind eye, it's cheesy and cliche but the future of bitcoin is in the hands of the community that's keeping it alive.",

The truth is that they are promoting centralization because they are mainly focused on profit maximization. You might be surprised that very soon people will assume that the only means of investment in Bitcoin is through third parties. They will only become aware of self-custody if any of these major ETF companies for bankrupt or make them lose their funds. These investors might have some influence over the market but the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin space will still make it very difficult to be manipulated.",

But when the price of Bitcoin crashes to break $30k, this certainly needs to be watched out for and prepare a reserve fund to buy back. All the news about Bitcoin and some events described by the OP will have an effect, important or insignificant bad news/FUD will remain an obstacle on Bitcoin's rise.",

The L1 Bitcoin network is currently being spammed by Ordinals and Inscriptions which is prematurely increasing the L1 transaction fees. This is pricing out many lower net worth folks from participating in L1 self custody. This attack seems to have a large amount of buy in from NFT pushers and alt coiners as well as a good chunk of the miners as most of the larger miners are being short sighted and looking to maximize profits in dollars as much and as quickly as possible. This has lead to a huge battle within the Bitcoin community and it currently remains to be seen how this will play out.Wall Street Attacks. By now everyone knows that Wall Street is here as they have had their ETFs green light. If the first two days of trading are any guide of what's to come, then I'm afraid to say its starting to appear they're going to buy OTC and dump spot market in an effort to control the dollar price of Bitcoin. Just look at what Coinbase has said with respect to their reported $7,000,000,000 USD of OTC traded the first day ETFs did. None of course can be independently verified by any of us plebs. These ETF / Wall Street folks are asking us to invert the ethos of \"Don't trust, verify.\" into \"Trust us bro.\" In my view Wall Street would gladly take a substantial loss on these Bitcoin products so long by doing so they believe that it would greatly harm or destroy bitcoin in the process as Bitcoin is the largest threat to their way of life....I'd say the \"biggest attack\" on Bitcoin is the approval of spot ETFs on the US and abroad. That's because big institutional investment companies will acquire a large portion of the supply, leaving the \"little guy\" out of the system. With this move, governments will finally be able to control Bitcoin (sort of). The high network fees are not a problem, since they can be lowered with subsequent network upgrades (subject to the community's approval). In fact, high fees makes the BTC network stronger over time (prevents spam). You are basically paying a \"premium\" for transacting on the most secure and reliable payments network in the world. It's the \"Wall Street\" problem (ETFs, futures trading, etc) that we need to solve. If we don't do anything about it, Bitcoin will ultimately fail in replacing the middleman (eg: banks) for good. Who knows what the future holds for the project?",
