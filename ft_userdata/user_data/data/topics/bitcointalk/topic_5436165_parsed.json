  "content": "There was a stampede at the Basra stadium just before the kick-off time, and this stampede happened as the football match fans matched up their way to the Basra international stadium for the match between Iraq and Oman. According to the Iraqi football association 4 Iraqis dead, 20 suffocated cases and about 80 injured during the stampede which the match organisers allegedly blamed ticketless fans for the stampede as they tried to scale through several possible loopholes and avenue to have access into the stadium. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/sports/2023/1/20/stampede-mars-iraqs-3-2-victory-over-oman-in-gulf-cupI understand this to be a sad moment for the Iraqi people as many lives of family members have been loss due to this unfortunate incident which would have been possibly avoided given the antecedent of situation outside the stadium early before the stampede took place.In recent years there has been cases of stampedes in events such as this in different parts of the world. And my position here is, who's to be blamed in such situation just like this one at Basra stadium, Iraq. Is the fault from the side of the football fans or is due to poor organisation from the side of the organisers?  Can we also recommend possible ways with which such cases can be arrested or adverted in the future.",

Pretty sure they already realized that there are a lot of football fans in the area that would really love to watch the game, so maybe they could have set up large viewing screens outside of the stadiums too.

In this case I would blame the government not the poor fans would could not afford the ticket or the entrance fee to the venue. Things like this do happens once in a while and I hope other government bodies would learn from this so it wouldn't happen next time. For those that had lost there lives at the process, may there soul rest in peace. I don't see this as an avenue to blame the officials that are in charge of the stadium because they may not be conscious enough that things like that could ever happens.",

Its their responsibility indeed which it would really be just common sense that they should tighten up the security because tendency of stampede would be always there considering if they do sawthat there are lots of fans around the venue which doesnt have any tickets and one desperate move of a particular person wants to see the game will really be the catalyst which wouldreally spark up that kind of panic and desperation to get into the venue and doesnt mind on what would happen next.If they had just put up those big screensoutside or particular place for die hard fans or who does really want to watch out at least then they might be able to avoid such incident but well its already late.",

If you know you don't have the ticket, why are you joining those ticketless fans pushing yourself inside?Expect that there will be chaos if those people will act like that, since you are in thousands outside the stadium, stampeded is indeed imminent.You can avoid this situation happening if you won't go to overcrowded events. If you don't have ticket, then don't go hoping they will let you in.Would be more peaceful if you will watch it over your TV at home. It may not be a personal experience but you will save yourself from such horrible incident.",
