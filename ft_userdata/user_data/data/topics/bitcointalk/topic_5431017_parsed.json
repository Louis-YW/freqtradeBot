But I am beginning to make sense from what he said. The weather is becoming unpredictable and very dangerous. In my region we just have two season; Dry (harmattan) and Rainy (wet) seasons. When I was growing up we could perfectly predict when each of these seasons would start and end, but currently it has become unpredictable. The rainy season that was supposed to stop in October, now lasts till sometimes January, while the harmattan season that normally begins in October now starts in March. I heard the news about the expected storm in the US and I became thankful that I didn't move to that country for my PhD. course.",
