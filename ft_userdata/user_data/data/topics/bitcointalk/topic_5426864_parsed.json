Or the value is not worth anymore as compare to like 2017 or early 2018.Worth it or not actually depends on the project being worked on. If the airdrop is held by a crypto project that has good potential going forward, it will certainly give quite good results. Although it is not easy to get points. Because most airdrops give a few points for one task performed.To get lots of points, you usually use a referral link, the more people who join the referral link, the more points you get.But regarding telegram groups that limit members, usually because the member quota is full. The member limit for telegram groups is 200,000 Members. I have several times found groups with 200,000 members and even created two groups to accommodate these members.",

Well, if you have another Telegram account in the same airdrop you may not join that airdrop. That means if you abuse the campaign.If they disallow linking accounts with the same person, you should respect that and open a new account. I guess you broke the airdrop rules too.",

You could just delete those channels which is not useful to you for sure there are so many of it on your list is not active already so this is much better thing to do rather than creating a new account just to fulfill the requirements.Or maybe you want to abuse the contest and try to participate multiple times but you are not sure about what you are doing then you ask if this thing is possible and will not be detected by them? so if you think about that maybe best to stick with one account then play fair for other participants.",

I experience a problem like this before. This happens because the airdrop that I join is a very popular one. It would be better if they will monitor their groups and then stop accepting new entries by the time it goes full so that the effort of other people won't be wasted anymore. Dunno maybe some are just doing it for free advertisement. For those who are legit companies, they can also add a group extension.This is possible, I saw some who also did it. There is no need for you to add another telegram or discord account on gleam if the groups are already full because the results are still going to be the same. While I don't think you will be disqualified if you disconnect your accounts on gleam.",

You might even risk your wallet getting hacked from malware since I even recall some airdrops I joined back in 2017 (there were plenty) and one project in particular just tried infect my device and steal my wallet for obvious reasons.",

I am not an active airdrop and giveaway participant but I used to participate in the Gleam contest, and about your question yes you will be disqualified or they will not count your entry, you should be in their channel for the duration of the contest until they picked their winners if on the new airdrop will not allow you to join then you have to choose between old campaigns that are not yet counted and the new one that you are joining, when it comes to Gleam contest it's hard to cheat they check and they update your points, Gleam contest and giveaways are always random you are not guaranteed to win.",

It's very simple, just follow the rules and guidelines they have on the channel, but if you violate something, you will immediately be kicked out of their channel or you will not be able to access it unless you create a new account TG or whether it's Discord.Also, airdrops are no longer a good source of income, instead of spending time there, it's better to turn to bounties like altcoins campaigns or Bitcoin signature campaigns.",
