My best guess without tx id would be that the transaction is unconfirmed (usually because of a low fee), but without looking at the actual transaction, the only thing we can do is guess...",

On an independent block explorer?If you copy the transaction id, and verify it on an independant block explorer (like blockchair or blockstream), and you are 100% sure you're using the actual blockchain.com wallet (and you did not fall for a phishing scam), and you're 100% sure the address showed on blockchain.com is exactly the address shown on blockchair or blockstream when looking up the transaction, and you're 100% sure the transaction is confirmed, the only thing left to do is contact blockchain.com's support dept i'm afraid.",

For mobile, you can use Electrum, Bluewallet or Samourai. If it is Electrum, you will have the check ✔️ BIP39 when importing the seed phrase and also the derivation part is native segwit for bc1 addresses.",

It doesn't have to be that you're using a fake wallet, but if you can't access the funds on your wallet even though other independent blockchain explorers show that the transaction is confirmed and you claim that the receiving address is correct, the only remaining explanation is that the problem is with your wallet.",

This is very likely the same problem you are facing. You could try clearing the APP data, update the app if necessary and Re-login to see if it solves the issue, but I advise you to change the wallet to another one as suggested as soon as possible.Blockchain.com is a closed source wallet that can not just be trusted. You don't know what's happening behind the scenes.",

Within these 2 years, have you frequently used Blockchain wallet?  If so, you might be familiar with the problem you encountered. I tend to agree with the comment above of my post, since I suspected it was a bug, try to refresh and might it work.The problem with this wallet when you reach their support might take a long time for them will respond to you, as there are a bunch of tickets unsolved. Have you done with the idea of importing your blockchain wallet to the non-custodial wallet?",
