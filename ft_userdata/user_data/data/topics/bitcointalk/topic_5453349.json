Move topic to Trading discussion board.pros and cons do you see when scalping Bitcoin vs. other assets such as NASDAQ. Pros: 1. Bitcoin and other crypto assets are more volatile, makes scalping easier2. Bitcoin and other crypto markets are always open regardless of the time or day, unlike stockscons:1. Volatility can also drain your account in minutes if you don't have a good risk management strategy.Quote from: david678345 on May 19, 2023, 08:59:48 PMIs it possible to trade NASDAQ on bingx or bitget? in copytrading I am following a trader on bingx who is trading USTECH/USD but I don't see it as a pair in my perpetual futures account.it's possible to traded NASDAQ on bingx.

But for todays market i guess you could be fine just still depends on your trading skills.",

The obvious pro is that Bitcoin is generally more volitile than other assets, so whether long or short, there is more money to be made than traditional stocks, or alternatively lower leverage is required to get the same gains you would need from traditional stocks. Then the obvious con is increased volatility generally means less liquidity and therefore a less predictable market (at least on short-term time-frames).Quote from: david678345 on May 19, 2023, 08:59:48 PMWhat assets do you recommend for scalping other than Bitcoin and what platform to use for those assets?You could try some of the bigger cap altcoins, because generally they are even more volatile than Bitcoin, but again the risk of that this comes with a much less predictable market due to less liquidity.",

If you need some leverage you can get 3x margin or trade the leveraged ETFs. If you want to go degen then you can always trade the options for nasdaq.In my option trading crypto is easier because there is more transparency. With stocks you are going against very large instititions that have more knowledge and money than you. Hence itâ€™s a lot harder to make money that way.",

If you compare Scalping between Bitcoin and Altcoin, it will match and can be compared to which one is better. NASDAQ assets will not have price fluctuations like Bitcoin, more likely to run slowly. But if in crypto such as Bitcoin and other altcoins, it has high volatility, with a larger number of transactions, thus providing fast profits on scalping. And you also said that you do Copyrading, this does not match what you will do. Scalping does not use any copy trading, it is a manual method of fast trading, utilizing every market movement to make quick profits.",

There's a difference between doing it and having the transition that one has to make for the adjustments. It's true that those other markets are lesser in volatility but sometimes, they're also as volatile as Bitcoin. But it's interesting to wait what OP has to say on this one if he comes back.",

Different scalping technics also work well in sideways markets, and Bitcoin market has been about that lately.The biggest problem to me with scalp trading is the screen time, It takes a lot of time and maybe the trading fees, they become significant if the leverage is so high with the take profit set on small price movements. For the screen time problem, I think it's much better when one has a scalping bot set up.",

Another factor also is the platform that you've been choosing and how reliable it is.For Bitcoin, as I said if you have a good knowledge of it then, there's an opportunity to make a potential profit by scalping since due to its volatility, Bitcoin can deliver quick profits if the scalping strategy is executed effectively, that's the pros on it. However, the cons would be the volatility of Bitcoin can work against scalpers, as sudden price reversals may lead to significant losses if not managed properly.That's why many people prefer Bitcoin investment for the long term, not the short term, and purchase it by using the DCA method which is a nice move.",

Scalping trades are not easy because, in addition to price movements that have to go up and down as often as possible, we also have to prepare a certain amount of capital to start.And this scalping trade can be prone to high price traps because it could be that after we buy, the price will immediately drop to the bottom and stay there for some time. If this happens, we have to wait until the price can go up and give us a profit. That is why this scalping trade is also a difficult trade for beginners.",

The first pro of Bitcoin trading is its volatility, and if someone masters that thing then Bitcoin scalping can be very profitable for that trader. Another pro of Bitcoin for scalping is its huge marketcap, because even though it's prone to volatility but due to that big marketcap, its price can't move with a single persons command and thus it works best for scalpers.A simple con of Bitcoin scalping is the news trend and that thing can sometimes work as a disaster because the news can move the market so quickly that even well strategic, and best planned trades can go wrong.I recommend you to find some good altcoins for scalping as they might be better than Bitcoin for scalpers. I recommend you to do scalping with ETH, LTC, BNB, and other well known altcoins with good marketcap and huge ecosystems. I won't recommend you to trade the pump and dump altcoins for the purpose because they can be really harmful for your capital. I won't recommend you that copytrading thing because it's not a good choice to follow someone blindly. The other traders that you're copying might be the cause of huge losses for many traders who copied their trades. It's always better to learn trading, and specially if you want to do scalping then learning the concepts of trading is a very important thing.",
