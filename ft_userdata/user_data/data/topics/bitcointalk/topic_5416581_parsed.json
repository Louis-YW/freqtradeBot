The OP is not new in crypto casino and I think he knew how hard the requirements of this bonuses to be completed yet there's no harm in trying since he can always forfeit the bonus once he feel that he might lose all his bankroll before he can complete the bonus.Most of the gamblers ignore this but bonuses like this is one way to have an edge on the casino due to the extra bankroll for your gameplay.",

You might encounter multiple issues such as KYC requirements as you'll be visiting multiple platforms. Also, those bonus requirements to be eligible for deposit bonuses may cost you almost all of your bankroll depending on the game you'll be playing. Lastly, you might encounter some withdrawal issues for those bonuses as most casinos won't allow you to directly withdraw them.",

Maybe, you didn't notice that. QuoteOnce you make a deposit you will get a bonus offer. You have 7 days to claim the bonus and after that 30 days to complete the bonus.Of course, they have a 35x wagering requirement and I doubt you could withdraw that even if you had received it.",

Hahaha.Just as I've thought, one of the most common issues you'll encounter if you try to challenge yourself is to try getting a deposit bonus in most gambling casinos. It's a fun challenge but it's kinda hard to pull off, especially since you will need to meet all the requirements such as the wagered amount and bet requirements. I've only received these deposit bonuses a few times at different gambling casinos, and I often deposit again to even reach those requirements.",

Taking betting in the casino as a system to win money, unless it is with poker or a specific sport is usually a good system, paradoxically, to lose a lot of money, exacerbated by tilt.

But as for bonus, all the gambling site I have used made it compulsory for the gambler to gamble with the bonus, some gambling site even go the extent of saying that only the winning amount is what the person would take from the bonus, while some gambling site would give you all the reward. Sometimes reward is not profitable as it seem on some gambling sites, but at least, it is still bonus.Quote from: Bitinity on October 11, 2022, 03:26:26 AMWhy do you want to take the deposit bonus with high wagering requirement?

I remember in the past when I still like to register and bet on some gambling sites with deposit bonus offer, it was actually good.",
