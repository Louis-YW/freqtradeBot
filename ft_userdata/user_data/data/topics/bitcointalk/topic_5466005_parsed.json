In time at the market cap grow singular incidents will have less and less impact. BTC is kinda linked to the US market but as the globe catches up it will dampen that influence. In time it will become stable as you suggest.If I use BTC for a purchase (rare) I buy the BTC the day of and spend it. This is the idea behind bitcoin cash BCH, which I have used a couple of times.",

But the thing is, fluctuations in price of BTC can not be stabilize due to a lot of factors. Like demand and supply, news outlet, market sentiments, FA etc. These are just few factors.To make BTC a pegged stable coin you need 1:1 reserves to back the supply of BTC. But we know BTC is deflationary and decentralized coin and it's price solely influenced by D&S and by some other factors.Quote from: jp123 on September 07, 2023, 02:57:20 PMQuestion,Bitcoin and other currencies A and Prepare B.A and B are equivalent exchangeable and can also be equivalently exchanged for Bitcoin.Not really understand what you are trying to emphasize or asked here but it kind a like the same query which I think I already answer above",

Bitcoin needs a huge liquidity to pegged the price on a certain price level the way stablecoin backed by the fiat.Stabilizing the price is very hard to achieve now that we purchased on different point and we all aim here to gain profit so buy and sell is inevitable which makes the price volatility. Adding huge liquidity is the solution to your question but who will provide this liquidity without gaining anything?",

Volatility will persist as long as the benchmark measuring our wealth remains FIAT.In my opinion, Bitcoin ATMs are operating effectively. They provide an instant trading mechanism based on the prevailing market prices at that very moment. This mechanism is undoubtedly more convenient than relying on luck through hodling Bitcoin when its purpose is to stabilize the BTC price.If you desire something stable with blockchain technology, then USDT is the option you should consider.

You can try to keep to these for the moment being.Remember that the beauty of Bitcoin technology is the volatility that it brings with it. It becomes more appealing to some investors as a result.But increased liquidity and availability of alternative currencies for exchange may result in a more balanced market and a reduction in excessive price volatility. Nevertheless, it is essential to understand that Bitcoin prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including market demand, investors mindset, and other regulatory developments.Although, it will be difficult to achieve total price stability for Bitcoin, but more liquidity and exchangeability might assist in reducing some of the volatility.",

This is why I believe that Bitcoin for now is meant as an investment because that is the main purpose of most of us we buy and invest in Bitcoin because we want to earn profit on it. I mean for sure there are a lot of us that already use Bitcoin as a mode of payment but we can notice that it doesnt really suit us well because of the volatile market price if you're going to accept Bitcoin on your Business or going to use it as a payment to something, there is a possibility that you could easily lose money since the price might probably drop or increase already the time you're going to pay.Maybe in the future, we are going to see how the cryptocurrency is going to adapt as a mode of payment but for now in my opinion Bitcoin is better as a investment just because of the volatile market price.",

Bitcoins will not always be this volatile, as more people adopt bitcoins, the prices will tend to stabilize more. The way we can contribute to this is to continue introducing people who are willing to bitcoins, and properly educating them giving them the reasons why they should adopt bitcoins because as already mentioned, the more it is adopted, the more stable the prize will become. Because it will take a while for people to be educated enough to adopt it, stabilization of the prize will take a while to achieve.",
