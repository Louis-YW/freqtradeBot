  "content": "https://ibb.co/dBqm3swPatrick Hughes is the original concept creator and developer behind Property Equity Network (www.propertyequitynetwork.nft) which is a big part of the future for decentralised Property and creative Art Assets. Decentralized assets and blockchain are the future of the world. In 2009 the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was launched. People worldwide started to realize this decentralized asset's true potential slowly but surely. And the good news is that it is only beginning !Patrick has teamed up with some savvy and yet down to earth People to fulfill the dream of going from Web2 to Web3 decentralised democratisation of Property . They include , among others , Alan Greenfield , a member of the London Diamond Bourse who knows more than  a thing or two about Gold and Diamonds and sees the huge potential for Crypto projects, Also on board is Jay Patrick —the new Kid on the block with an intricate knowledge of the Token World and with that the nuts and bolts of Web3 design etc. With a strong Consultancy Team also behind the PEN tokenisation, purchasers of the PEN token can be confident in their purchase because there is a lock in period of 12 months applied. So this is in order to demonstrate PEN’s commitment to  longer term growth and to prevent the Pump and Dump dubious activities that have become all too common and not just in the Crypto World but also in the Initial Public offerings of the more traditional Share listings  by Institutions .Nowadays, cryptocurrency is one of the most popular digital assets. According to data from CoinMarketCap there are currently more than 7,800 crypto projects. But not all of them serve the same purpose. Many cryptocurrencies are created for human freedom and financial inclusion such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the other hand, there are dozens of meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.Lets face it, a lot of Crypto tokens/coins will fail simply because they have a very flimsy real world application or they are just  chasing after applications that have been largely fulfilled by what is already on offer. Some will adapt and diversify to become big successes but many will struggle because of the foregoing reasons. Some have been simply ponzi schemes.So what makes PEN so special? To put it simply, PEN is bridging the wealth gap. If You recall the Pareto Principle that stood the test of time for many years and effectively stated that 80% of the wealth is owned by 20% of the People . Well, not anymore–the situation has worsened. Today , quite alarmingly , less than 2200 Billionaires are estimated to have more wealth than 60% of the World’s population which equates to over 4.5 Billion People . Think about that again 2200 People collectively own more than 4.5 Billion plus citizens of the World. ! This is wrong !! At Property Equity Network , Our goal is to spread wealth and indeed happiness to more and more People by utilising Our decentralised Blockchain solutions that will serve all citizens of the World and do Our bit for People to thrive . So, We at Property Equity Network aim to allow even the smallest of Investors to invest in Property via STOs as well as NFTs for  creations such as music and art and to also bridge between the real estate market and the crypto world.                    Property Equity Network is  building a platform whereby we can also connect metaverse and the real world. People with no amounts of Capital will be able to invest in real estate through the PEN app game and so additionally participate in Virtual reality educational games based upon actual  property/ real estate prices . People will also get benefits by buying and holding properties in the metaverse / virtual World just like they will get in the real world—for example, rents and sales revenue.                                 The core purpose behind the Property Equity Investment technology is to develop a censorship-resistant, decentralized process of transferring  value  which  is  recorded  on  an  immutable, distributed ledger to take back custody of one’s finances, removing the reliance on intermediaries such as depository and  banks (the same institutions who were ultimately responsible for the collapse of the global financial system, the effects of which are still felt around the world today). Over the past 13 years, the Cryptoverse has grown exponentially. Mass adoption of Blockchain technology seems continually more inevitable with the aggressive pace of innovation, mammoth increase in a real-world application, increased accessibility, and over a decade of battle-testing as well as the advent of Banks themselves getting involved .Today, BLOCKCHAIN and STOs and NFTs provide the solution to what the Internet of Things has suffered since its inception. The internet has indeed brought tremendous benefits but has sufferedfrom protecting People’s property, whether it be Property, art or music, etc. Property Equity Networks NFTs and STOs will provide the solution to this problem —a Decentralised, Trustless    Blockchain-based    Digital    Certification    of Ownership.Property Equity Network (PEN) is a crypto project based on the above idea of including even modest Investors with small Capital to be able to participate in real estate investment. The mission and vision of this project is to allow everyone to buy properties and enter into the real estate world.PEN will also evolve to allow People release equity in their property in exchange for STOs that can be traded on an exchange. This will of course be determined on a case-by-case basis and with the further adoption of AI will become more and more mainstream in the future.  Subject to Due diligence and other ethical advice and appropriate protections this will mean that Asset rich but “cash poor” property owners of any age will be able to use embedded value in their property to release some of that equity as well as allowing the STO crowdfund participants to avail of asset backed Investments. Additionally, with Our Educational game Platform App e, Our properties will not solely be random AI-generated properties that do not exist in real life but instead they can  be based on reality reflecting Properties that do actually exist but played out on a virtual reality metaverse game. \"Metaverse\" Investors participate in NFT property yields to make “virtual” (not real ) passive money by renting and appreciating property value. In addition to that, they will be able to sell any property they own and profit from it in a virtual way within the Metaverse.Utilising Blockchain, Property Equity Network is the first-ever technology   to interact/bridge Metaverse Virtual  Reality Real-World applications in the Real Estate Property markets!Property Equity Investment   is   creating   a   Dapp    (decentralized application) that provides the tools needed for individuals and businesses to issue their own Security Tokens and avail of Non-Fungible Token Digital Assets (NFTs ) anywhere in the World using state-of-the-art blockchain technology. Property Equity Network's dual-platform will provide a user interface that is a best-in-class experience and easy to use whilst being the firstin the  World  to  link  Metaverse  Game  (  Virtual  World  ) technology   and   Real   World   Crowdfunding   investment strategies.The dual-platform additionally will open opportunities to individuals and businesses looking for alternative methods of raising funding through  tokenization  as well as  a Property  Game  technology that will further allow for Property   Investment   within   the   Metaverse   based   on ( reflecting ) Real-World ACTUAL properties prices/values —AND—participants in the Game App will also receive a modest amount of Tokens which are derived from the PEN operations REAL profits . ( The bulk of profits will still pertain to the PEN Token holders who invested in those tokens that derive income from issuance of STOs and NFTs etc )Smart contracts and NFTs, in effect, solve the problem of cryptography!Property Equity Network  sets  out  to  develop  a  self-governed, self-funded, and self-sustaining ecosystem focused on NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)  and STOs (Secure Token Offerings) that will allow Individuals and Businesses to Tokenize/NFT  assets anywhere in the World.PEN  is the first of its kind that will not just be a Crowdfunding/STO platform but will also bridge between Real World Property Investment and the Metaverse virtual Property   portal   also   based   upon   real-world   values . (as opposed to fictional creations).Property Equity Network project will have two different sections. Namely:1. The Crowdfunding.2. The Game.Both sections are explained below.                       The Crowdfunding Platform.Asset tokenization is the process by which any real-world asset, tangible or intangible, is digitized and then divided into smaller pieces that take the form of tokens. Each token represents a proportional part of the digitized asset, offering the owner of the token the corresponding economic rights.One of the main factors driving the rise of the tokenization industry is the growing need to grant access to a growing audience of both small and large investors with new forms of investment. True democracy and decentralization can only be achieved with the use of blockchain technology.Property Equity Network  \"Crowdfunding\" Platform is a decentralized, digitalized real estate investment ecosystem. Through this platform, users of Property Equity Network ( with PENs continuous blockchain enhancement , AI adoption, Market growth and penetration  etc )  be able to :* invest in exclusive real estate projects and diversify their investment portfolios, * Invest in and participate in appropriate Property Development projects as crowdfund financiers .Such projects will be ring fenced and secured by the assets and will entail the full agreement of the Investors .* Release Equity in exchange for STOs .* Trade their STOs and NFTs on exchanges*Protect their original Creations such as in Art and Music by issuing NFTs ---the answer to \"protecting Intellectual Property in the Internet of things\"!This will be a separate arm of PEN intended to assist the creative arts Industries  to flourish.People will be able to invest and buy properties in STO and or NFT form as appropriate. The buyer of the STO / NFT asset will also acquire either outright or shared ownership rights of the physical property with the amount of investment reflecting their percentage of ownership.Property Equity Network  intends to provide the solution that allows individuals and businesses to facilitate STOs and NFTs whilst being   able   to   comply   with   local   laws   and   regulatory requirements based upon where the assets are domiciled including KYC ( Know Your Customer ) requirements.As a safety mechanism, it is vital that everyone understands that if the soft cap of an STO for crowdfunded Property development participation is not met by the pre-established deadline, the  capital already  deposited into  the escrow account will be reimbursed to investors. The Game.Property Equity Network is designed to allow users to buy and trade metaverse properties based on real locations with game credits. People will be able to purchase Properties via the Metaverse at a rate that reflects Real World Property / Real Estate prices building a  a realistic metaverse property portfolio.The aim is to create an authentic market environment using accurate data and with subsequent location hosted on a platform such as Sandbox Metaverse as needs determine. Real estate investors can take on and live the virtual life of a wealthy property magnate.Upon joining the game, every member will receive a joining bonus of 1 million credits to start trading on properties. Members can also buy credits to supercharge their portfolio.. In addition, members will be able to request to add properties their choice  choice through  through \"Acquisition Agent\".  All of this   to be developed and rolled out Worldwide utilising appropriate Property search engines/platforms.Thanks for Reading Guys and if you made it this Far Check out our BEP20 TOKEN PEN$ 0x8f6B4ECa8ae328aC79556D63dC13925705925578",
