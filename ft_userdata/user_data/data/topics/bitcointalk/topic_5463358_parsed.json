Fast forward to round of 16 and I was hitting it right with little efforts. Now the finals draw nearer and it gets trickier, I just need one correct score to hit the jackpot, you wanna help guys? What’s your take on the England vs Australia game?",

What’s your take on the England vs Australia game? The 2023 Women's World Cup has maintained a highly competitive and exciting tournament thus far, showcasing the growing strength and depth of women's football around the world. I expect England to summount the challenges and to go home with the cup. What jackpot do you mean?",
