  "content": "I've already graduated from university 10 years ago. However while I am working, there are several important postgraduation courses that give a boost to our paygrade. I'm currently in one of the toughest ones. Only a small minority of my colleagues across the country register for it, because it is tough to combine with a job.There are 2 weeks with tests throughout the year. The first one in january, the other in june. January is all online, multiple choice questions. June is a set of oral exams. I've learned that many students cheat during the online exam in january. Because the tests are very tough, the pressure is high and our time to study is limited. Nobody gets away in june because it is an oral exam.The school is a private institution. We all have a student number and our own password to log in to the school's website. The school also has its own wifi. But I do not think it is mandatory to log in on their wifi. I could connect my laptop to my cell phone's hotspot for more browsing privacy. But this drains the battery and as soon as the phone goes into sleeping mode I can disconnect from the internet. Which is something you really do not want while you have to remain logged in for multiple choice questions.Imagine that I log in via the school's wifi, and make the test in a chrome browser. But meanwhile I open a second browser like Opera (built in VPN for privacy) to look for some answers.. Can the school catch me? I don't think they have IT guys checking our browsing history. They want as many students as possible, because it makes them money.I know that others have browsed online during tests, and nobody got in trouble. If they do decide to check the browsing history, that only relates to their network. Right? If I look for answers with Opera, I don't think they can find out. This is not my style. But it's tempting because of the pressure.I can just take more time to study and take the test next year. But that means I have to pay tuition again.",

      "body": "Well I do not think it is worth it for you to cheat. Cheating on an online examination is tempting as everything is in the palm of your hands. Information is easily given to one by a single search online and the internet holds so much to show that one can easily cheat. I cannot cheat online as I know that I will have a guilt sitting inside of me, also knowing that there is a web monitoring online cheating just clarifies the fact that I will not cheat. Having to cheat can show the poor skills that you possess, and it can also be indicative of who you are in real life. Cheating is morally and ethically wrong, especially in exams.",

      "body": "You probably should go through the school rules and see if they allow students to cheat even in that manner. The problem with cheating your way to the top is that it will prevent others who deserve the job you are cheating to secure from getting the job, and be sure that you are being watched and you will probably know this if you consider the bigger picture. There is alway someone/something or few people/things who the world system is centered around. The bad ones would allow you to do whatever you want hoping that you will be blackmailed in future and used for more evil.... And of course, you could be jailed, shamed, , etc if you refuse to serve them.Don't work for money. If you do what you are passionate about and talented in properly and use that for the good of others it will be hard for you to lack.",
