  "content": "Bloomberg just reported that Genesis is preparing to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy so it seems like yet another crypto company might bite the dust. I don't think that anyone is surprised about this developement after everything that has happened lately and are probably not the last one that will go down in the near future. The only question is who will be the next.Quote from: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week?leadSource=uverify%20wallGenesis Global Capital is laying the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing as soon as this week, according to people with knowledge of the situation.The cryptocurrency lending unit of Digital Currency Group has been in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups amid a liquidity crunch. It has warned that it may need to file for bankruptcy if it fails to raise cash, Bloomberg previously reported.Representatives at Genesis Global Capital didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for DCG declined to comment. Talks are ongoing and plans could change, the people added.",

The platform was said to have $175 million stuck in FTX. But even before the FTX bankruptcy, which forced Genesis suspending withdrawals, it has already suffered a lot from the 3AC fiasco. Accordingly, 3AC owed Genesis at least $500 million. As a matter of fact, Genesis filed a $1.2 billion-claim against 3AC. So, in conclusion, this filing of bankruptcy is somehow long overdue for the platform. Problems, big problems, are simply adding up quite fast. The crypto winter, the series of bankruptcies to which they are exposed, and recently the SEC's filing of case against it, among others are simply too much for the company to contain.  Anyway, this is just a part of the overall domino effect. And now, Gemini is also alleging that Genesis owes them almost a billion, a huge amount that will certainly affect the former's business operations as well.",

The FDIC insurance was for the time you have $ in that exchange, the be your own bank is when you grab the coins as soon as possible and you stuff them in your wallet, but that won't help you if you're having only $ on that CEX waiting to buy the dip or whatever when it goes down.So, extended version, FDIC for fiat, cold wallet for coins!",

Then there are those that don't want any responsibility when to comes to storing crypto and will rather chose someone else to do it for them. I mentioned before that I know a guy (friend of a friend) who is an old school stock trader so naturally he wanted to profit from bitcoin too but instead buying it by himself and storing it in his wallet he rather invested via Grayscale. I naturally asked him why he doesn't want to own his own Bitcoin, he said that he just doesn't want that responsibility.If bitcointalk is the only place where you communicate with people that are into crypto you may get impression that's how it is in the rest of crypto community while in reality vast majority don't really care about being your own bank and the rest of the things that Bitcoin is all about, therefore such situations like the one with FTX.  Quote from: selezneve on January 20, 2023, 08:09:15 AMThe news article came after this.

Look at Genesis, they didn't take responsibility of going bankrupt, they have pointed out lots of businesses like; Three arrow capital, FTX and their dispute with gemini, as contributors to their downfall. The issue with these centralized firms is, they don't stay independent. They're all linked to one another such that when one fails a lot more of firms would have a dispute or two. Hence, considering people's trust on Binance exchange, that may not happen, if Binance should file for bankrupcy today, they won't take responsibility for their faults, you'll discover new brands associated to their failure. In a nutshell, these people are like minded both their clients, they want to blame others for losing money in the cryptocurrency market. So, no need to worry about them it's the lane they want to follow.",

We've just had more than a dozen exchanges or other centralized platforms collapse, and the price is pretty much at a six month high. If Binance collapses then sure, there will be short term price fluctuations, but bitcoin will come out the other side just fine, just as it always does.Quote from: DaveF on January 20, 2023, 09:28:39 PMI guess in the end people will keep doing what they have been doing.

And of course, that doesn't even scratch the surface, since you can easily add on dozens of other exchanges to that diagram and there will be hundreds of deals and arrangements going on that we have no idea about. And of course with fiat or any bitcoin you don't keep in your own wallet, then any money you \"own\" is somewhere in all that mess, handed over to who knows who for who knows what.Perhaps we could make a similar diagram for self custody. It would be very simple. It would look like this:-- - - - - - - -----My wallet----- - - - - - - --",
