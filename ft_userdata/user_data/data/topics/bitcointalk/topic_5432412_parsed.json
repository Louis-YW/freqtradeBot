      "body": "I haven't used trust wallet for ethereum but I assume it works the same as metamask in just using one address.You use the same seed for everything in both. Trust wallet likely cycles through addresses you can use for most coins but everything depends on the one seed.You can also add accounts/addresses to metamask and switch between them (either using the same seeds or different).Ultimately this is a choice of coin though. Ethereum doesn't have built in and easy privacy functions like bitcoin and other networks do/enforce. Trust wallet has more coins than metamask and a greater compatibility with other networks but isn't open source so will always have a reliability concern.",

A recovery seed and a private key are not the same thing. It is possible that this was just a typo, but it is important to clarify the distinction between these two terms.A recovery seed, also known as a seed phrase or mnemonic phrase, is a series of words that are used to restore access to a cryptocurrency wallet. It is essentially a backup of your wallet and can be used to regain access to your funds if you lose your password or you accidentally delete your wallet.On the other hand, a private key is a unique, secret code that is used to authorize transactions on the blockchain. And, as far as I know, each ETH address has its own unique private key.It is important to keep both of these pieces of information secure and private, as anyone who has access to them could potentially gain access to your funds. But, it is also important to note that if you lose one private key, it will not compromise all other addresses of your wallet. Therefore, your statement above is incorrect.",

If you really really want to give out all that, make a special wallet only for that purpose and keep very small amount of funds on it. And yeah, pretty much count it as compromised.Maybe also helps keeping the bulk of the coins on hardware wallet. It may make you think twice before you go looking for your seed backup because whatever software was asking for it.Also, as already said, you should try to read about more and understand the words/terms you're using. Now you make a confusion and get corrected, no big deal. Tomorrow you make a confusion that leads to a mistake and you lose money, not good.",

Cause you are adding up addresses. But you can always make new wallet on metamask instead of adding a different address on your recovery key.Trust wallet is the same in my opinion and Ive used both wallets. For me its much safe on metamask since trustwallet isnt fully open source. The UI of trust is much user friendly than metamask but in terms of security I think I could vouch for metamask than trustwallet.",
