  "content": "So is OMG dead? CMC lists two websites for OMG. One is dead and the other one redirects to Enya, whose token is BOBA. It also seems that the Twitter account for OMG was rebranded to BOBA. So has all support for OMG been dropped and now it's continuing as BOBA? Also curious that a lot of exchanges have BOBA listed, but not Binance yet. Has Binance made any statements about *not* listing BOBA, or are they just slow?",

      "body": "Omisego is now a foundation while Boba Network is supposed to be the original Omisgo Network. I think they just restructure the company for a bigger scope. Maybe they are planning to build different project under Omisego Foundation instead on focusing to L2 network project. OMG is not dead but rather they just change there vision and expand there roadmap to tackle much bigger industry in crypto. OMG is one of the big company that pioneers L2 on Ethereum but since the merge of ETH that result to change of concensus, the L2 business on Ethereum is slightly hurt because they will become less demand when Ethereum PoS is effective on dealing scalability issue.",

Boba network is a new token that working for boba second layer solution by omisego. that's why there are two tokens available on CMC. 1 is real omisegoo and second is a new token released for omisegoo second layer solution called boba.

In my opinion, this is the same as developing Polygon, BSC, and other projects. It's not dead, but it's growing. But are they still using OMG tokens, or will they be removed from circulation and replaced with new ones.",
