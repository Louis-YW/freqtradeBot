But if not then it just usually trash that has it on some disposable boxers or plastics from salon.Anyway, small acts of kindness and help we do to our nature will be back to us in a better form just as you did to the bird.",

      "body": "It's amazing how a small act like removing a hair can make such a big difference for a bird. You probably saved it from a lot of trouble.Such small gestures can significantly impact the well-being of wildlife. Usually when things like human hair gets entangled in a bird's toes It can lead to a condition called \"stringfoot,\" where circulation is cut off, potentially leading to amputation of the toes.",

The human space and handwork is just too chaotic and harmful to them. Civilized people ought to take animals into consideration while doing their things. Afterall, we own and share the space together.Anyway, it's good not to ignore when we find them. It's actually part of human role to take good care of them when they are in need. Those that can't be handled by you should be handled by qualified hands. And it's important to note that it's not by accident that they are found by people... they are shown by the ONE who made them. If you end up helping them, HE is pleased, and could bring more and reward you.",
