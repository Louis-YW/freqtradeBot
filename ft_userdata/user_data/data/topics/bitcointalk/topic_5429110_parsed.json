Whether by normal landfill processes, or exposure to the elements.But then I remember reading news stories about data being recovered from HDDs inside the World Trade Centers during 9/11 attacks and HDDs inside the space shuttle columbia which unfortunately exploded (R.I.P.).If data can be recovered from an HDD located inside a building with 110 floors that was utterly destroyed. Maybe he has a chance of finding his long lost HDD inside of a landfill, after all? HDDs could be tougher and easier to recover data from than we realize.But if we're being serious, anyone with the resources or capital to scour landfills in search of HDDs with lost crypto don't need him as a middle man. They could already be conducting operations of their own inside landfills, as we speak, without him.",

There's so mamy reasons the data on the hard drive may be destroyed though (especially if electrical or magnetic contamination are likely).",

Btc is so much cheap before but thats change when the value skyrocketed. Even though he is requesting for a dig up, surely this would not be easy and risky, cause it might cause environmetal impact and ending up still loss.

The guy could've made most of his lost earnings if he'd just worked and bought bitcoins again but I guess that's just me being cynical, just like what others have pointed here, hope is not lost as some of the HDDs in the most horrific of events in the history of humanity still works and was recovered. Then again, it would best work for him if he'd just let it be and moved on, the HDD could've been shredded and gone by now especially since it's been almost a decade now since he lost his bitcoins. This is a prime example of the sunk cost fallacy, he keeps on believing that there's no point in stopping now since he has put in so much effort into finding it, not realizing he's better off moving on.",
