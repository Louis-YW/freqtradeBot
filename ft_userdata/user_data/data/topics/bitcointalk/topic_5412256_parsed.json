  "content": "Start of New Meta: Sleep to EarnYear 2022 will be written in history books as a start of new Meta â€” Sleep to Earn and WeSleep aims to be a pioneer of such approach. In order to achieve our goals we are not only building a Web3 app with inbuilt Game-Fi elements which awards users for their sleep time, instead we are building a worldwide brand by positioning ourselves as an app-assistant for users to look after their sleep quality as well as build a healthier and more active lifestyle.Sweet RewardsAt its core WeSleep app will allow users to monetise their sleep time by rewarding them with $ZZZ tokens. However, in order to be eligible for rewards users will need to hold at least one Sleepie, which has a specific set of attributes such as drowsiness, fatigue, luck or devotion.In addition, WeSleep is aiming to provide a tool for its users which would not only enable them to monetise their sleep time, but at the same time would encourage them to build a healthier, more active lifestyle. In order to achieve such goal, users will be getting Daily Tasks to complete on a daily basis, which would then generate their rewards in Moons.Daily task examples:- Walk at least 3 000 steps;- Run 1 mile;- Go for a 45 minutes walk;- Have a swim;- Have a gym session;- Burn at least 1 200 calories;- Etc.Every time a daily task is completed, a specific amount of Moons are credited to the Profile, which then are to be used to level up the Profile itself and earn additional rewards.Join us and become part of New Meta:- Twitter: https://twitter.com/WeSleepOfficial- Website: https://wesleep.io/- Medium: https://medium.com/@WeSleep- Whitepaper: https://motpovilas.gitbook.io/wesleep-whitepaper-v1",

How do you intend to generate value for Tokens?It would be interesting if we could use them to buy wellness products, and pay for the gym, for example, do you plan something like that for the future?",
