If the student union resist they will tell them to go get a loan as it is easy to access. They have succeeded in forcing the students to have alternative choice of paying their fees if they complain of that.The second is an indirect attack on asuu. Since the federal government universities are majorly the assuu member, they are indirectly telling them go make your way for yourself we can not afford to put up with your bill anymore.ASUU is gradually losing the battle against federal government with this new policy if we are to go by it.",

How can a president of a country come out and tell the well educated citizens say im no go fund varsities, im time dem no fund am. If no fund am then na who go fund am. The students? Nai make im dey give the students loan? Dis president is missing something here in the country. He should calm down and plan well to carry out action. Education control all the other parts of the country so anything that happen to education affect other institutions. Me di way I dey see am Tinubu is trying to make things harder than the previous president. Free education has been on ground since the creation of the country even before the independent. The Eastern Region, Western Region And Northern Region all were having Free education. It was only the Northern Region that against free education but later they also support the motion. So I don't know why a Western Region man who love education to the core is against free education at this point which Nigerian youth need free education at top. Awolowo was the initiator of the free education from the Western  world as a comparative education at that time. Then Azic also loved the idea and used it. Tinubu is planning to suffer the poor parents in Nigeria. Toruorua University and Medical University are all in Bayelsa were issuing scholarships to students and the scholarship end only two years. After the two years most of the students could not pay the school fees again do they have to dropped out. And this is going to happen in the whole country. He should think well and reverse that policy because it will affect 95% of the students in Nation Wide.",

This is a very bad news ever and for decays and centuries as a country. Not every policy we hear of is actually bad it depends on other policies around it. The first question one need to ask is what has all the fees by student been used for and how much are we currently paying for an education that is isn’t top quality again. See I will tell you this even the west or Middle East Nigerians rush to get quality education or to evade strikers are under autonomy and students pay tuition fees there. So once this government decides not to be fully responsible for every tertiary institution again then there will be addition of tuition fees. The only thing the government will do is to find other alternatives of helping students. The first is to make the after school life easier that can be achieved with employment opportunities for graduates. Also the government can as well set aside scholarships for extraordinary students for full payment and this will actually create an healthy competition and give students with poor backgrounds a stepping block to be par with others. If each university is granted their autonomy then it will mean that some staffs will be relieved off their jobs most of these people are either visiting lecturers or those with queries. And if you look at the issue of visiting lecturers it sometimes manipulated by some of them even though it is legal they only come to classes just once. The only problem now is what will the government made use of the money meant for universities for. One they could increase the amount of funds giving to tetfunds and this will only increase the number of infrastructures and equipments provided to schools. Also this money could be use for employment creation, and also to be added to the budget on the plan increase of minimum wage.",

But if Tinubu used another means to support nthe students very well that they will not feel the impact of the heavy load that will giving to them to carry. Then it is ok. But I still doubt it.

With this fuel and other issues that have been worrying Nigerians, federal government could have waited for a while before bringing this news because it will actually trigger anger of Nigerian students and parents, because the little money they were paying before some parents can’t afford talk less of increasing the payment; this means that school is no more for the poor masses.Maybe federal government intends not to support universities anymore since they feel they have given room for students to take loan which I don’t know where they will actually see money to pay back.",
