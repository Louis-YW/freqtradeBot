First of all, I want to know how to create a non custodian wallet (I want to own one) and does it require payment to create or maintain? All this while, I have been using, storing and transacting with exchanges like Binance, kucoin and others.Secondly, what is the purpose of sign message that I use to hear and see? How do I sign a message? Is the sign use to approve transaction? I don't know how to sign a message and the exchanges have never require me to sign a message before.Don't be surprised seeing this coming from me. I think it's high time I desist from trusting my coins with exchanges. I don't like what I'm hearing in the news this days about exchanges change users deposit address or delisting. I don't want to regret in the end. One who asks can never lost, please enlighten me.",

Just like the names, the could wallet are those that are not online example is the hardware wallets, while the hot ones are online example is wallets like electrum and blue wallets. The hardware wallets are a little bit expensive for small holders(price of one is like $50)  but they actually provide the best security. The only electrum wallet or blue wallet are free. All you need is to download the app and verify it. If you’re using a desktop to set it up the electrum wallet is the best. The blue wallet is mostly used by mobile users since it has many features on mobile than electrum. Here is a thread on  how to verify an electrum walletQuote from: knowngunman on July 17, 2023, 09:21:11 AMSecondly, what is the purpose of sign message that I use to hear and see?

How do I sign a message? Is the sign use to approve transaction? I don't know how to sign a message and the exchanges have never require me to sign a message before.Signing a message from an address allows you to prove ownership of that address. Some exchanges are starting to require signed messages so they know you are only withdrawing coins to your own addresses and not sending them somewhere else. This is just yet another way they want to control you and monitor everything you do.Signing a transaction uses almost the exact same process as signing an arbitrary message. Both Electrum and Sparrow as I've suggested above allow you to sign messages.",

Is the sign use to approve transaction? I don't know how to sign a message and the exchanges have never require me to sign a message before.The purpose of signing a message is so that you can prove that a certain address belongs to you (or at least that you have access to its private keys). This is useful for e.g. proving that you hold a specific amount of coins (e.g. when promising payment or run a business where you store customers' coins) or to verify that you are the same person (e.g. when updating a payout address or when you forget your password). How to sign a message depends on the wallet you are using. With Electrum for example you can find the option to sign a message either under \"Tools\" or when right clicking on an address in your list of addresses (you might have to enable this tab under \"View\" first).Quote from: Zaguru12 on July 17, 2023, 09:25:25 AMThe hardware wallets are a little bit expensive for small holders(price of one is like $50)  but they actually provide the best security.Generally yes, but it's worth mentioning that Ledger is to be considered compromised at this point:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452900.0",

I still prefer Electrum mobile version but you can not use it to sign a message too, unlike the desktop version. If you need a wallet for mobile where you can have small amount of bitcoin, you can go for Bluewallet. With Bluewallet, you can sign message with your bitcoin address, you can as well verify message on Bluewallet. It also have other features like replace-by-fee and coin control.For a hardware wallets I will recommend Passport which o_e_l_e_o posted above, but it only support bitcoin, no altcoin support. For bitcoin hardware wallet that also support altcoins, Trezor supposed to be the best, until the wallet support coinjoin with the help of Wasabi that works with chain analytic company to sensor transactions. Passport is only bitcoin wallet and it is open source and the best bitcoin hardware wallet for now in my opinion.Quote from: knowngunman on July 17, 2023, 09:21:11 AMSecondly, what is the purpose of sign message that I use to hear and see? How do I sign a message? Is the sign use to approve transaction? I don't know how to sign a message and the exchanges have never require me to sign a message before.In addition, you prove the ownership of your bitcoin address with your wallet's private key. Without you having the private key, you can not prove you are the owner because you can not sign a message with the address. Assuming you stake an address on this forum, do not lost the wallet seed phrase or master private key or the private key of the address.Quote from: Zaguru12 on July 17, 2023, 09:25:25 AMSelf custodian wallet is actually of two which are cold wallet and also the hot wallets.

I don't know where they are coming from. They are your receiving addresses. Since it is advisable to use different addresses to receive your funds for security reasons and since you haven’t received any bitcoin on them then they should be zero. QuoteSecondly, I can't find the private keys. It only issue mnemonic words which I copied and save already. No need to be scared the 12 mnemonic seed can be use to recover your wallet anytime. Just keep them save Quote finally, I attempt to create the wallet without having internet connection but it shows error message until I allow access to internet. I hope there won't be any problem later from cyber hack.This is a hot wallet and it definitely needs an internet connection to create an account (even a cold wallet does). For security advice know the kind of network you connect too and if you’re using that phone to surf the internet always be careful of phishing sites or connecting your wallets to any site online. Quote from: knowngunman on July 17, 2023, 02:13:22 PMIt shows verification failed when I click on verify button thou. Any further explanation will be appreciated. I hope you did it well with an internet connection. Let me explain a bit. Once you open the wallet you want to sign or verify message on blue wallet, go to the receiving addresses and copy the one you want to sign/verify. Then go to sign and verify button and erase the bitcoin address there (because it is usually the first receiving address that is out there) and paste the copied address. Then proceed to write your message with the signature space empty, click on sign and this will generate the signature codes. Then click on verify again I think that should work, because I just tried it on a new wallet and address",

But it is also inappropriate to suggest to someone looking for their first self custody wallet that they need to run their own node, then set up their own server, then connect Electrum to that server. Doing so simply risks overloading them with information, making them throw their hands up in defeat, and leave their coins in the hands of Binance.For new users it needs to be kept simple.

What it does mean is that you can't bootstrap new nodes and you can't scan for old transactions. Your IP will always be revealed regardless of the type of node you run. If you don't want that, then use Tor. If you don't want to broadcast your own transactions from your own node even over Tor, then use something like http://mempoolhqx4isw62xs7abwphsq7ldayuidyx2v2oethdhhj6mlo2r6ad.onion/tx/push.",

Hardware wallets are somewhere in-between cold and hot wallets. I have heard some people refer to them as cold, other as semi-cold (weird term). Maybe the best is to just call them by their name, hardware wallets, and neither put them in the cold or hot group. The only types of hardware wallet we could consider cold are airgapped signing devices that don't connect to the internet. There are only a few of those, like Coldcard or the Passport. A hardware wallet with a secure element that can share your private keys remotely doesn't deserve to have a cold tag next to its name.
