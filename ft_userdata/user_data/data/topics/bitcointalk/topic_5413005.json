I do not see that the Lunc coin is a good investment in the long term, only in the short term. You can invest in it and get your profits out constantly because it is really a coin that is not guaranteed and there are thousands of people who lost their money and lost their trust in the Terra Luna team, so I do not advise you to risk unless you have additional money excess of your needs.",

Platforms will support the new currency and push the price up, deluding people that the currency is valuable in order to sell what you own from the collapsed currency. When I see the number of platforms that still support the Luna currency, it becomes clear to me that the size of the loss from the last collapse was huge and everyone should renew attempts to compensate for the loss.I find it foolish to trust a coin issued by the same failed team.",

The first thing that has pumped was the Lunc and then it's likely that whales have diverted to pump into Luna and that's why you're seeing that gain.It's true that many don't trust it anymore and whatever is happening on it with its gain, it's all just being done for the sake of pump and dump and that's all.Are you satisfied with your gain and free money? Sell. If not, you will feel that there's a need to wait a little bit longer before selling.",

I personally will not invest in a project that has failed before, by making a lot of people lose is a very risky action to me because who knows history will repeat again. It's better to me invest in another altcoin than having to choose it ! Although the initial capital is small, for me small things are more valuable because I am not a person who likes to take a lot of big risks on an investment asset.",

As what we have saying here, you don't need to be greedy, just take the profits if I were you. Anycase, the whole market is pumping, perhaps it is just recovering from the last week leg down, or it is due to the effect of ETH merge news. Trust? it's subjective, but I will say that I won't trust them because of what had happened to the project and the people behind it.",

Better to play short or long if you see opportunity, don’t just hold. That’s true, their update can actually hype the other coin as well and as we are seeing now, LUNC is like pausing from the pump to give way to other coin which I think will also catch up along with USTC and LUNC. The update tax burning will be huge once they succeed on this, I see their long term plan now and it looks feasible. I will buy a small amount for now and will hold for a year, let’s see if the hype is true or just a hype itself. TAYOR!",

I haven't follow the news about Luna since the debacle except wanting to see how the government of South Korea is treating it against Do-Kwon.But if there is an update, then expect that the pump will probably go on another days or weeks, until it crashed again. Good opportunity for others to make their money as what the OP did. But for sure this is not going to be sustainable. So if I'm in the OP shoes, I will take my money out of Luna as it is very risky.",

Please, you must learn from what happened with LUNC. it was also going up massively but this time it's slowly going back down again to the what it was started. Im not feeling doubt if this pump has come. I have bought some new luna before and i got huge profit from the pump. The whales will be pumping old luna first before the new luna. This is a pump and dump mechanism that already created by the whales. If you were not selling your coin and it will be going down again. Take your profit before that will come very soon. It will never increase forever. Learn from what happened with lunc. Pump will never be last forever.",
