      "body": "Liquidity providers do not guarantee price stability, they only help provide a balance so that tokens can still be sold. Project will have more liquidity providers if the rewards for them is worth enough to run. However, it is also a threat to providers if in the end the token they choose does not get enthusiasm from the community and the DEX doesn't have good volume. Some questgion for you,- How many services offer partnerships to reward liquidity providers when staking there? If there is no difference, maybe choosing to choose the liquidity of existing projects in CEX will be prioritized or in other DEX that have good volume so they feel save to provide a liquidity for his supported project.- I see Oscar Swap is a DEX on the Arbitrum network, but from the web they don't include their social media or even I don't see their open source code in github. Is this save to use?- Are you part of Oscar Swap team?",

The institutional investors are always using the retail investors as exit liquidity. The liq providers have been contributing a lot by giving liquidity for others to exit. The volume was coming from the liq provider. As long as the new token get liq providers and others will trust it as a trusted tokens that can be traded.",

Without them, trading volume would be limited, and cryptocurrency prices would experience extreme volatility.Quote from: @sriyan on April 28, 2023, 02:47:19 PMI think the institutional investors control the market.  Most of the DEX is supported mentioned features. The main points are the volume of the market and the news. Institutional investors do have a significant impact on the market due to their large capital, market expertise and influence. However, the decentralized nature of DEXs allows for more accessible and transparent trading, which attracts individual investors. Market volume and news can also greatly influence market movements, leading to price fluctuations. Therefore I think it is also important to follow market trends and news updates to make the right investment decision.",

It's like selling brand a brand new cryptocurrency with gimmicks like it has an immutable blockchain and it's secure and decentralized. Name does not make sense unless i am missing some meme here and selling having a dex on arbitrum layer seems also pretty weak considering that everyone else including uniswap have offered that for a long time now.",

What else do you want crypto freaks??This will all end in some pumped projects, because liquidity providers may cash out on the real investor, so this will not give small cryptocurrency investors any opportunities to make profits and the percentage of both losses and gains is high. The small investors have a high chance of losing their investment in this class of market scheme.Of what use is a token to the crypto ecosystems is it does not provide a use case that solves real-time problems, those have been the major challenges of the new token developers and why there is now high demand for liquidity providers who are big bag holders and can manipulate the market",

I think there's really nothing new to what you've said and the new ones on this space might be too optimistic with those features you've mentioned.It's not that every swap that has such good features as these becomes successful. Those that are quite early were the ones to gain the traction and followed by those next to it.And then those that are quite late, they're likely the ones that don't get massive success unlike those that have been the first ones.",
