But also there is a downside which is the volatile price, even though it doesn't make it unreliable but it is something to keep in mind. Which means it is not only \"greed\" and \"power\" that prevents bitcoin's adoption. There are other reasons too like the volatility.QuoteBeing decentralized is a part why the government should embrace Bitcoin in the world today, it's the only digital currency that can bring peace if allowed as a means of payment around the country.If Bitcoin take that place instead it will be a smooth breeze, the government will have peace themselves, there will be no betrayer of sort because no one have power or control over Bitcoin.First the economy has to change. Right now it is designed to work in a centralized way.Look around the world and see what is going on.For example in United States, ever since a year+ ago when the energy prices started to rise and caused inflation in US, the regime started battling it with increasing interest rates. But over the long run that means recession and at the same time the regime has to pay higher interest to US debt bagholders. They don't have nearly enough money to pay it (almost a trillion dollar), so the US economy either has to fail then and there or they have to print that much (remember the debt ceiling battle). Obviously the printed that much and dumped it on the market.If they were using bitcoin, this would have been impossible.What I mean by \"economy has to change\" is that you first have to give an alternative to what would the government do in the same situation where they can't control the energy price and it is causing inflation in the country that uses bitcoin. Or what would they do in a case like COVID19 pandemic when the economy is shut down and they have to print money to artificially revive it?They can't print bitcoin out of thin air to artificially keep their economy alive, so what is your suggestion for that?",

I believe these people understands better. The problem is not been in control, the problem is unable to print more Bitcoin for themselves like how they do with money. That's the definition of their own control.",

So the value you see in BTC is that no one is able to control it, unlike the others?I'm kinda of seeing less sense in this because there's a consensus with other coins that probably makes the coin somewhat decentralized in terms of decisions etc. Shouldn't it be the same?",

The opposite is true, Chainlink and XRP are looking for banks to give investors a false sense that their money is safe.The investors themselves are looking for profit, even if it is from the banks themselves, and if the banks give them an APY of 50%, no one will invest in altcoins.Quote from: Z390 on September 03, 2023, 04:27:27 AMTo me Bitcoin just fits in the gap more than any others, oh but the heart of men anyway. Bitcoin is an option that enables you to bypass the need to trust a third party to transfer your money and enables you to send money to anyone in the world with very low fees and in much less time than traditional bank transfers.",

Decentralization also meant that you're going to relinquish control because it's up to the people that's in the ecosystem to decide how the system will thrive.Quote from: Z390 on September 03, 2023, 04:27:27 AMIf Bitcoin take that place instead it will be a smooth breeze, the government will have peace themselves, there will be no betrayer of sort because no one have power or control over Bitcoin.

In this context I am not blaming the government even though I am not a politician who has advantages in the economic sector and am not saying that what you are saying is wrong.Getting out of a difficult phase is not an easy job. Because the volatility of the high Bitcoin price cannot be used as a solution to accelerate towards a stable economic phase.Bitcoin also cannot be multiplied if they want to make Bitcoin a solution, but a recognized legitimate currency can pass rules and new agreements with a clear intention as an alternative.",

The decentralised element of Bitcoin is not an issue for these investors but from banks and governments there outlook is lessfavourable because of that decentralised aspect.",

But it seems to me that there's much more to it. Bitcoin is volatile, and it seems to go through phases of shorter bull markets and longer bear markets. It's very typical for Bitcoin to be worth less than 50% of its ATH value over long periods of time. Fiat can and sometimes does fail, but overall, there are ways to keep it pretty steady, ensuring that people have a good understanding of wages, prices, and other similar things because of the currency's stability. If a country's budget were fully in Bitcoin and then Bitcoin lost 50% of value, that would be a catastrophe for funding all the necessary operations. So at this rate, I think there are good reasons to not fully embrace Bitcoin, especially if we're talking about replacing fiat with it. Not to mention that the scalability of Bitcoin isn't great, and a big surge in transactions is likely to spike the fees very high.",
