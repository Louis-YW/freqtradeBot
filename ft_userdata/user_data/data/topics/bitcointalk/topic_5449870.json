  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk community member and Bitcoin art collector We all remember my Bitcoin pizza artwork 2022, I tried to imagine the feeling of our guy Laszlo who bought the pizza for 10,000 Bitcoin and hour for hour after my therapies I drew this artwork \"Bitcoin Pizza Day 2022\"The artwork for \"Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023!\" is ready to go! I believe this piece of art speaks for itself.The purchase of the first Bitcoin pizza changed a lot, and despite any regrets, one thing won't change: it marked the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin.Additionally, there's a surprise included with this artwork: one comic page with five panels about Bitcoin Pizza Day.#24 hand signed artworks in size 39,4x45cm==15,5x17,7 Inch(size together with frame)if the price ticker is not loading then update the link  + (US approx. 75$ Shipping ) + (EU 30$ Shipping)^^^^^^^^^^^^Payment address: bc1ql2gjq7uxpu943fez9wdgrvpmylvf67x5e66x321.
