  "content": "According to Maimi Herald 30,000 attendees and exhibitors were present at the Maimi beach to witness the 2022 conference which happened to be the largest single Bitcoin event in all times. The conference been hosted by Bitcoin Magazine and sponsored by Cash App sprung interest from all over the world. Bringing together developers, economic strategist, capitalist, Bitcoin builders, policy makers and policy makers. Bitcoin's role as edge over inflation was one of the numerous things discussed and and according to QuoteMorgan Creek Capital founder Mark Yusko, the problem isn’t inflation per se — it’s currency devaluation. Pointing out it is scenerio of currency devaluation as 1BTC will always equal 1BTC using the policy of the federal reserve as reference. Stating the value of Bitcoin in dollar might become relevant over time as monetary policy continues to erode consumers’ and investors’ purchasing power.This brought me to my worries if is is right to attribute the slight growth in price as a result of the 2022 conference and what to expect after that of 2023.",

One of the biggest stories to come out of that was also the number of speakers who had quit it (many were speculating they were separating their reputation from Bitcoin after it had fallen).It was a very impressive story at the time and still remains one for the community as 30 000 people is a huge number to be watching or even interested in crypto (especially as the price collapsed - most of the audience still showed iirc there was no news of an unexpected number of them not attending).",

After the conference it is assumed price fell even further. I wonder why the said speakers had to quit, separating their reputation from Bitcoin after the price fell. In reality it made no difference because price had to exhaust it dip to start a new trend.Hooke's law of elasticity which states that the strain of the material is proportional to the applied stress within the elastic limit of that material. Price had to move in the bear direction to be proportional to the hype factor from the conference and when it limit got exceeded it got a primary support that pushed price up in early 2023.I don't think we need to see immediate result after big events in the crypto space but every single event especially major ones point to introducing new moves in future times.",

Frankly, I do not remember that the conference that took place in 2022 had any impact despite the huge number of followers.  Most of what was expected at the time was that there would be more adoption movements for Bitcoin, but this did not actually happen.  And I expect that the same thing will be repeated in this year's conference if politicians and decision-makers are absent from it.  As for the effect on the price movement, this is also not expected to be a noticeable effect, since the price fluctuates circumstantially according to the criterion of supply and demand.",

Not sure how we could point to that.Also funnily enough, the cryptocurrency space has this thing with conferences where prices drop right after the events lol.The god old saying buy the rumor, sell the news. People buy before every event and sell when it's happening and that includes conferences. To be honest, there's no relation between any conference and price because the biggest contributors are people who don't care about bitcoin improvements and people who aren't building anything.For instance, devs are not the biggest traders, on the contrary, devs are rarely trading anything. It's the same with people who run nodes, they are rarely traders.Miners also won't buy bitcoin because of some conference or network upgrade. They have so much money invested that they're steadily selling all the time to pay electricity bills and buy new hardware. They are the biggest contributors to network stability, but they don't speculate on exchanges.  The spot price that we're seeing is just a fraction of the real value of bitcoin because traders are just a fraction of the bitcoin community. I hold a lot of BTC and I hardly ever use centralized exchanges.",

Cointelegraph spoke to Greg Beard, chief executive officer of Stronghold Digital Miningone year later, Stronghold is returning placed orders to avoid bankruptcy.  Not really the guy you want to take advice from, right?",
