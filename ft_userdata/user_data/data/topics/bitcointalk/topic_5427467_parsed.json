  "content": "I have almost been in crypto 1 year now and looking for a new project to get into at these low prices we are currently seeing. Until a few weeks ago I had not looked at Cardano but with its price now at £0.25 which is its yearly low I am tempted. I have heard a lot of bad things about it over the last year, how its taking a while to see any price action etc but at this low price I am now thinking I might start accumulating. I have seen videos of how it may flip Ethererum one day, not sure if that will happen but for that just to be a debate sounds like a good thing to me. With its all time high coming last year at £2.25 , how high can it realistically go next bull run? I am thinking somewhere around £4 is possible which would give it a rough market cap of £140billion and mean a 16x from current price. Be interesting to hear thoughts on this and see how many are invested or not?",
