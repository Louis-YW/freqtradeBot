Usually, after a good profit, I lose a little, because I invest in weak projects. I bought different coins, because now it’s more profitable to invest not in mining, but in buying coins. But I left the budget for the purchase of video cards, and I will probably buy a cheaper 3000 series, because I do not like the price of the new nvidia 4000 series.Quote from: batsonxl on May 27, 2023, 05:53:49 AMQuote from: FP91G on May 25, 2023, 07:43:39 PMQuote from: Dowper_ on May 25, 2023, 06:53:07 PMQuote from: batsonxl on May 25, 2023, 05:13:45 PM3 bullruns! 2013-2017-2021  So next one will be in 2025, and the profit will start in 2024.Do you think there will be a new coin or the Chinese ethereum-CONFLUX will take over the mining market?Now there is an opportunity to mine a lot of coins, the price of which can grow by 50 times or more, and there are not very many candidates from current coins.

If the video cards are not old, then the miners have turned off mining and are waiting for new coins to appear at the end of this year or next in order to quickly start mining. Other miners try to mine something if electricity is cheap. I disabled half of the video cards.",

What is funny is not, so many people will realize the about the next most profitable coin mined by GPU until it's too later, or we are already underway in a bull market. The trick is to try and mine coins with potential right now when they seem less profitable and the graphics cards are still very cheap. I am very sure there will a new profitable coin in the next cycle.",
