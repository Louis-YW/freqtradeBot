According to investopedia.com Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or spend twice. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology — distributed ledgers enforced by a network of disparate computers.While Crypto is a general term for a broader scope and includes all Cryptocurrency models that have been born. In general, it is almost the same, but this is just a nickname and basically when people mention crypto, they will definitely remember Cryptocurrency. And I don't think it's a problem as long as you can understand it very well, even if you don't sort it out in an understanding way.",

      "body": "Let me show you a translation from Russian that explains the meaning of \"crypto\". I think the word would have the same meaning in English.Quote from: http://www.bolshoyvopros.ru/questions/2535330-chto-oznachaet-pristavka-kripto-.htmlCrypto... (Gr. kryptos secret, hidden) is not a prefix, but rather the first compound part of the compound words, which corresponds in meaning to the base \"secret, hidden\" in such words as cryptography, cryptogram, cryptophytes, cryptomeria, cryptograms, cryptodepression, cryptocurrency (bitcoins), etc.This part of the word refers to some hidden state of what is designated in the second part of the word. For example: cryptogram (Greek from kryptos secret and gramma record) - secret writing, which can be an inscription or a document, a letter, a note, written by conventional signs or letters(cipher), known only to the initiated. Cryptogams (kryptos secret and gamos marriage) are secretly married plants that have no flowers, i.e. ferns, horsetails, mosses, lichens, fungi, algae, etc. The word \"cryptodepression\" is interesting, where \"crypto...\" refers to one of the meanings of the word \"depression\" (geol.) - a (hidden) depression on the earth, the bottom of which is below sea level, filled with water whose level is above sea level (for example, lakes Baikal, Onega, Ladoga, etc.).In conclusion, it should be noted that \"crypto\" is always spelled together with the next part of the word and is not stressed.That is, based on this explanation, the word \"crypto\" cannot be used to mean \"cryptocurrency,\" as it has a much larger meaning and can be applied with many words. No, of course it can be used by some people, but it would be a misuse of that part of the word.",

My stress is on why are some cryptocurrency called token and others coin? Alright let me try to explain this the way I can, a coin has its own blockchain for example you have ethereum, Ethereum is a coin because it was built on it's own blockchain but when a project decides to build its own using another blockchain you can think of it like a borrowed blockchain, what that project produces is what we refer to as a token. Another thing you should note is that a coin uses from its own balance as gas fee but token uses from whatever chain it was built on. For example if you're transacting with ethereum your gas fee will be take from the Ethereum in your wallet, but let's say you want to send usdt that was built on Ethereum block chain your gas fee won't be usdt(a token) but Ethereum(a coin) since that's the chain the usdt was built on.",

Well in that context, there's obviously no difference between those words. But if we will be more technical and look for the ACTUAL meaning of these 2 words, we will find out that they are different but they're related. Crypto is a shorter term for \"Cryptography\" which pertains to a way of using codes to encrypt information. On the other hand,  cryptocurrency  is a currency that was made entirely of codes. To put it together, cryptocurrency is one product of crypto/cryptography. Lol. It was not an in-depth explanation but I hope it makes sense & I hope that I am not giving wrong information.",

To differentiate them, first let's check Definition of tokensMy explanationsA coin is when it has its own blockchain. Like Ethereum $ETH is a coin because it has its own chain namely ERC-20 chain. All Ethereum transactions are on Ethereum ERC-20 blockchain. Transaction fee will be paid on that coin too.A token does not have its own blockchain. It is like a parasite on an available blockchain. Example: A token runs by smart contract on Ethereum ERC-20 chain. Therefore, if you want to make a transaction with that token, you can not pay transaction fee with that token and you must have a native currency on that chain for transaction fee, this case it is $ETH.",

I've also seen people argue about this a few times, and they give different proofs, but I still think both are the same. Even some bitcoin maximalists just consider bitcoin as crypto, the rest are not crypto, and they consider all altcoins as trash.

The word Crypto is mostly used Data security and Encryption field, in which we use different data security techniques to secure our data whether it's video, audio, image or whatsoever. So i think crypto and cryptocurrency do have different meanings. How? Crypto is used to secure every data but \"Cryptocurrency is used to secure transactional data related to money or to validate the transactions of digital money. That's why we use the word Cryptocurrency and sometimes we use Crypto as the abbreviation of Cryptocurrency.Sir, decodx, has mentioned many synonyms of Crypto but each of those words has a different meaning according to the field in which they are being used. Quote from: decodx on March 29, 2023, 06:29:44 PMCryptography Cryptogram Cryptology CryptovirologyCryptosphere Cryptography --> is used to make secure communication between two or multiple parties by establishing an encrypted channel. Cryptogram-->It's the word used to encrypt messages using puzzle of codes and cipher text to encrypt it, so that when someone (third person) get access to it then he/she could not decrypt it as it will be protected with codes.Cryptology--> this has the same function as Cryptogram but it goes a little deep into the design and origin of rules and principles for deep encryption of data. overall the purpose is the same: to encrypt Data. It is similar to Cryptography. Cryptovirology-->It's used to make malware and malicious software using encryption methods so that they can easily be put into the victim's computer or any digital device to get control of it. Overall, data encryption and security techniques are used in this field too.Cryptosphere--> is the study in which data encryption and techniques are used to encrypt transactional data of money (digital). It's the same as Cryptology, cryptography, and cryptocurrency but to some extent. Like crypto sphere is the field of study like getting access to journals, research papers, and books. Overall, if we see among these different words, one thing we will see as common is \"encryption of important Data so that no one can tamper with it\" same is happening in Cryptocurrency and crypto. So, Crypto is a word used to broadly cover all the fields of data encryption and security but Cryptocurrency is mainly used for encryption and security of Transactional data of Digital money.",
