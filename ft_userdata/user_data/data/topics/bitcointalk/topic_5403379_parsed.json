Will he be a part of the design team or you are looking for web developer, administrative support, marketing support or something else. A person could be an advisor too. You may need more clarification for the position you advertised. Telegram is a heaven of scammers. Please be careful.You have some interesting designs on the announcement topic. Good work.",

Without knowing your actual goals hard to find someone for partnership. There should be a win-win situation for both. So please mention your goal and project.",

Confusing, isn't it?So it means, you are just looking for a company for a partnership or that some called it a collaboration that will avail the services your offering and use your designs instead of continuing using their current one?",
