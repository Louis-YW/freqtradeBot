Some people are trying to hide behind the cotton, stating that they are gambling for the fun of it, I will like to ask them this question if I can get them to answer.Is there any spirit of good will when you intentionally give your money away in order to just have a good time gambling? No single person is gambling just for the fun, it is always for the money. Those who have this view are just trying to generate some good feelings that will water down the pain of losing. It is a psychological thing and I understand them perfectly well. Those who want to catch fun play computer games and not gamble. The real fun of gamble comes from winning good amount of money and nothing else. Like you said before, there is no fun in giving your money away.Quote from: Z390 on October 07, 2023, 07:07:24 AMBecause taking money away from gambling simply makes the game not worth playing. When money is removed from gambling, many people will see it as a waste of time. In my locality,Â  gambling have created many jobs and have remained a source of hope for many people who are not doing well financially. Even though I don't support gambling without a steady source of income, at least it provide hope for some thereby reducing crime.",

Because taking money away from gambling simply makes the game not worth playing.  Yea some people could be hiding behind the curtain but there still gamblers that gamble mainly for fun while the money aspect is secondary to them.Talking about the spirit of good will I'll say it's same as going to the fun fair park if you wanna get a horse ride to catch fun you'll have to pay for it. Paying for a horse ride doesn't make you gain profit but to get fun out of it. Same with gambling for those that are gambling for fun, to them the money aspect of getting a win is just a bonus if it comes.QuoteWill you still participate if money is not involved?

Money is still the real reasons why we gamble, been addicted or not, mutual greed or not, all gambling is done to make more money or get some form of reward in the end. For those gambling mainly for fun like I earlier said definitely they will continue in their gambling even without the money. Only those that weren't playing because of fun that will have to quit and search for other means to make money.A greater number gamble for the money but don't generalize it.",

I don't think you can call it \"free money\" when there is a risk of you losing the initial capital you started with .

Why do they have to include money in playing the game instead of buying a drink on some good meal and watch football match with friends without betting on it, that is how to have fun without trying to win over some body money. People will not go to casino if it is free of money games. They will stay in their house to watch the games or play games with play station. It is about the money reward if you win from the game and not for fun like some people say and the people saying for fun are not gamblers because gamblers know they never gamble for fun. Fun is when you play with friends, relax yourself, eat good meal.",

Gamblers use money to gamble and that makes it not free as they also sacrifice their time for it. But gambling should ntit be taken as a way of making money.Quote from: Z390 on October 07, 2023, 07:07:24 AMSome people are trying to hide behind the cotton, stating that they are gambling for the fun of it, I will like to ask them this question if I can get them to answer.Just know that people are different. Like me I am gambling for fun. If you do not spend more than your gambling budget and which is not more than 5% of your weekly income, is that not fun enough?Quote from: Z390 on October 07, 2023, 07:07:24 AMWill you still participate if money is not involved?

If I am using just $0.5 for every bet, is that not fun enough? Although there are times I use martingale but still not beyond my gambling budget.For addiction and people that gamble in a way they can not control their emotion, that is not fun. Using high amount of money to gamble caused that.",

And if we want to have fun by gambling, that's what we do using the money we can afford. And I don't need a reason to gamble because I gamble when I want to gamble. And when I don't want to gamble, I don't gamble. It's that easy. There is no need to think too complicatedly when you want to gamble because it will confuse you about what you want to get from gambling.I remember there was a thread where there was a game playing site that didn't use money but they could get money if they managed to win.

There is still an underlying hope of winning.Yes, I am willingly spending my money for the sake of enjoyment in gambling as long as I am aware of the risks and potential outcomes. But if you're not focused on the money, you won't become addicted.You have a healthy mindset in looking at gambling, it is very rare for people to think and be able to accept the actual fact that gambling will absolutely not provide them with income, even if it can be that maybe only one or two wins and obviously that is not income but only a prize because there is no consistent element in getting it. And it's also better that way than you continue to defend your selfish feelings that always assume that you can earn there but the facts that happen always lose at the end of the match. Therefore, it is better to make peace with ourselves between the wrong mindset along with high expectations and the logic of the truth and facts that occur. True, it is not at all easy to get a win there because it is clear that the percentage of wins is much lower than losses, which means that losses will continue to dominate you. Casinos have arranged everything there, and they will make all the chances of losing bigger for all gamblers, so this is really an activity for fun, on the other hand yes I understand that fun there is also very involving money, meaning that the money factor has an important role to make people happy, but that is only for when winning. Absolutely agree, if we don't focus on winning money there then surely they won't be tempted.",
