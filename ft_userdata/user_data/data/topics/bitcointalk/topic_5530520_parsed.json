If the government facilitates this properly, it could be a game changer for financial independence in retirement. Of course, btc's volatility is a concern, but over 20-35 yrs it has the potential to outperform traditional pension systems. I'd love to see more discussions on how this could be implemented in a way that balances both security and accesibility.",

At first, you were paying some percent of your salary every month and it was collected and you'd get it once you retired but since the inflation is very high in my country, they changed the strategy and now offer 3 types of pension savings. One type is the risky type, which means that your pension funds will be invested in risky investments like stocks and etc. The second is stable investment like gold and the third is no investment, i.e. you get exactly what the government collected from your salary.In my country, there was a talk about Bitcoin investment. I think that the government plans to include Bitcoin with stocks for those who choose risky investment options but it hasn't been confirmed yet. So I believe this option will become available in many countries.",

      "body": "As a strictly optional measure, at a first glance one could think that this could work, at least if the long term growth of Bitcoin continues. Basically, it would be like \"the government should ensure I really DCA and don't panic in adverse situations\". And it could be combined with the same benefits like a stock retirement plan like in Scandinavian countries.Perhaps it has a \"systemic\" effect which could be negative in the medium to long term: Bitcoin has not the same effect than other assets pension funds invest into. This could lead to problems if it becomes too popular.In particular, if the government invests in assets containing stocks, like ETFs, then it eases the access to liquidity to the companies which have emitted those stocks. This effect isn't present if it instead invests in Bitcoin.On the other hand, it could also have a positive effect, as during stock market bubbles, it could drive away too much investment into stocks.So as long as this \"pension DCA\" doesn't become a bubble itself, it could be feasible.However, I can't repeat too often that there is no guarantee that Bitcoin continues to grow in the long term. Thus you never should organize your entire retirement plan on this model.",

The risk is too high. Another risk would be that Bitcoin might not anymore be a thing decades from now. There is no guarantee that such retirement plan would have a mind-blowing potential in the end.

Although the US is working nicely to incorporate bitcoin, most other countries out there are still waiting and playing it from the grey area. They will follow US lines of action.So for now, fiat is your best option while planning for a retirement. Dont forget that inflation still can catch up and make that entire plan useless, so if you dont like your job change it while you still have time, working on what you fell passionate about only allows you to accumulate more while you can.While collecting bitcoin for the future will never be a bad idea so keep doing that and see how our half-brained politicians work things out.",

Let's put into consideration what the potential growth of Bitcoin will be for the next 20 - 30 years then imagine the profitability of this. Again, the investment will be in DCA which means if things go wrong at a point, the individuals involved can decide to switch their plan.  Although the potential of Dollar rising in the future is there and unless there's an emancipation of another global currency that could outshine Dollar in the future, dollar will continue to lead the world's transactions. Who knows if it would be bitcoin that will take over the space or the efforts of the BRICS will ever come into reality. As for the Nigerian Naira, we've only seen it depreciated over the years, so it is already risky leaving your retirement funds in Naira. When you talk about volatility, I admit that there will be short-term effects and fluctuations like currently experienced, however, bitcoin is already an industry leader in the digital assets and financial technology, what will beat bitcoin is not yet in existence, maybe in the near future but for now, it will continue to lead and appreciate in itself over the long period of time. Mind you, no one would be forced to invest their pension funds into bitcoin but that could be an option or alternative as stated by OP, so if I was given an option to choose, I will definitely go for bitcoin. I know such monumental progress in a country's financial institution will require  new set of policy implementation and public enlightenment to enhance the knowledge of the audience and beneficiaries to that effect.",
