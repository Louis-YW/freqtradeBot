  "content": "I guess you knew about Pi coin which is not a cryptocurrency at all. It lacks of so many specifications to be considered as a cryptocurrency, not yet considering about centralized or decentralized network.Recent days, it has been listed on exchanges but let's see what exchanges listed this superb shit coin.Pi Network (Coinmarketcap)Huobi: https://www.huobi.com/en-us/exchange/pi_usdtBiconomy: https://www.biconomy.com/exchange?coin=PI_USDTXT: https://www.xt.com/trade/pi_usdtWith these pumps and dumps for this superb shit coin especially on Biconomy and Huobi exchanges, my message (also warning !) for you areDo neither invest in nor trade Pi NetworkConsider to stop using these exchanges.Why?They have wash trades and you will lose money if you can not control your greed.Their exchanges can collapse anytime by wash trades and manipulations. FTX exchange is a case study which is still hot for you to learn.Exchanges like Huobi already has many investigations about their operations. Do your own research, you will find more investigation about themMany exchanges continue to engage in wash tradingBitWise Asset ManagementExchanges are very scam. Please remember it and be very careful when you want to use any exchange.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsReminder for crypto newbies, traders. Be cautious with new exchangesBeware of \"Pay original fine\" - a scam method",

      "body": "Exchange is using the popularity of this scam coin to scam there user legally by providing IOU tokens to hype the current Pi token that is not tradeable. I’m sure thise user that buying this IOU tokens are those users that holding the real Pi and just hype to buy more on exchange along with the wash trading given by XT and Huobi that obviously coordinates this pump and dump scheme. It's only funny that even the Pi network team doesn't have any idea on what’s really happening. Huobi is just using a scam token to milk on the money from those greedy traders that believes on his scam project.",

After this terrible scam and the pump, dump, wash trade on Huobi, I find no other reason to use this one.For you, for others, you guys make your conclusions but please do it as soon as possible. Don't make decision too late and get rekted like millions of people got on FTX exchange.FTX exchange is an exchange with wash trading too. Again, do your own research about FTX wash trades.Quote from: AbuBhakar on December 30, 2022, 03:52:56 PMIt's only funny that even the Pi network team doesn't have any idea on what’s really happening.Does Pi network actually have a blockchain network?",

      "body": "A good aim which is to notify or bring awareness to mewbies about such scheme to scam people by using a product that newbies might say that it is a Crypto as you have said. Well, we can't blame them as scammers are everywhere in my point of view and newbies are the ones who are easy enough or within their reach to make them fall for it. Honestly, I haven't seen or noticed post or a thread warning people about such schemes and I am glad for this even though I am being cautious but still appreciate you doing this especially for newbies. I think they have their own blockchain but still I would consider it as a non-crypto since it is a pump and dump scheme in the first place. Good luck and good job.",

What about the fate of the Pi token community that mines from their phones? While the application has been downloaded more than 50 million and how many tokens have been generated over the past few years?It is clear that in my opinion the mainnet will not be the same later as the coins that have been traded and for those communities who mine from mobile phones maybe it will only be used by Pi developers who are even more popular.I have no interest in Pi tokens at all, and always remind those close to me who believe too much in Pi to be aware of this token scam.",

Why would a reason user or reputable member of this forum trade on huobi and XT, and this Biconomy seems new to me i have not heard about them before.Below is the warning message from cmcQuoteThere have been reports questioning the legitimacy of Pi Network. Please note that mainnet has not launched yet and the price displayed below for certain exchanges reflect the value of the IOUs and it may not be transferable across exchanges.

After this terrible scam and the pump, dump, wash trade on Huobi, I find no other reason to use this one.I think everyone is shock since Huobi is considered as one of the top exchange due to its volume but offering an IOU for this questionable token without owner permission is really shady. The price doesn’t stop pumping despite all warnings for this token being not the real Pi network. Huobi and other exchange that coordinated this listing is injecting too much funds to pump the price and later on dump once retail Fomo buy. I believe there’s still few retail buyers purchasing this token which is why the price keeps surging as part of there wash trading.I bet the price dump to 0.000000x$ will happened for a quick time once this exchange take profit.Quote from: tranthidung on December 30, 2022, 03:58:58 PMDoes Pi network actually have a blockchain network?  They are claiming that they are close mainnet to cover their fancy blockchain. This project exist for many years yet they don’t have any clear achievement aside from wasting energy from the mobile cpu mining scheme.",
