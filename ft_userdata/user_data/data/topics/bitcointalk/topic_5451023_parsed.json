  "content": "I am following the guide https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3274219.0 I am exporting key list --> address string, pricate key (plain base58), include unused (address pool) and I am omitting spaces in key data.and when I get the information I get 1000 unused/Address pools and 1000 keys.Does this sound right?  I am doing this without syncing the chain and in fact have an offline machine with just armory.  I have just one wallet that I am restoring from a paper backup.  Something feels very off with this.  I am trying to get my coins back without having to sync the entire chain.Please let me know if you have any ideas...anything would be appreciated.If this is normal what wallets accept a list that big?  It looks like electrum accepts multiple keys at once but exodus does not?",

      "body": "If you restored the wallet paper backup, it will look up 1000 addresses ahead in the key chain. This is because in order to find all the coins on a wallet, you have to guess how deep in the address chain to check. Armory overshoots to 1k addresses on wallet restore to be a safe the side.As an example, imagine you had a wallet with 100 unused addresses (you gave these addresses to people to pay you but never got anything). On the 101st address, there are coins. If the software only checked the first 10 or 20 addresses, it wouldn't be aware of these coins. You as the user would see the wallet seemingly has no funds and you would may get rid of it.",
