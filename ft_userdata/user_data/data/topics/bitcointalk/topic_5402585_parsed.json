Many countries have tagged crypto currency's illegal and therefore prohibit their banks and other financial institutions from transacting or dealing on Crypto. A government can restrict banks from mediating in cryptocurrency transactions, but this does not mean crypto is illegal there; Those are two different concepts. About the number, of the top of my head, I'll estimate that Bitcoin is legal in far more nations than where it is illegal. This does not of course mean that countries are generally welcoming to cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin in particular, we still see baseless attacks against the network and governments creating more stringent regulations for exchanges and other platforms used to interact with digital currencies.About the proposal in Russia to ban payments with crypto, this is a case of the country trying to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies so as to maintain control over the flow of finances.",

      "body": "Cryptocurrency is a bad payment method. The kind of fees we have to pay for every transaction and the time it takes to get at least 3 confirmations, makes it a bad choice for transactions unless LN is used. So if a country or multiple countries ban cryptocurrency as a payment method, won't make much impact on the crypto itself. Because cryptos are mostly used as an investment almost everywhere in the world. However, if the government decides to ban crypto completely and gives an upper hand to the banks to curb its usage, then we may see a severe impact as the circulation and buying demand will be stalled. That will put an extra pressure on the cryptos. But if the crypto is just barred from being a payment method but if citizens are allowed to hold it as an investment, it should be fine!",

      "body": "To be fair, even if crypto payments were to be banned nothing would exactly change since payments done in crypto is very minimal, only a small percent of crypto owners have probably tried it. Not to mention that said scenarios are probably online payments where time isn't really an issue since, well, it's online. Compare that to scenarios such as paying in restaurants, grocery stores, or small stores. I won't even deny them of doing this, crypto as a payment seems impossible due to volatility and the time issue right now. But hey, time will tell if it would be able to become one later on (and by later I mean really later).",

Prohibiting only gives wings to Bitcoin, what really stifles it is to allow it by regulating it extremely, forcing AML/KYC protocols to the maximum and measures like blacklisting, because in the end you help an industry to flourish in a very different way from the original idea of P2P and you end up directing it to centralized systems and censorship which is what suits you. The many bans on Bitcoin since its inception have not prevented its exponential growth, but the latest legislation and the reduction of privacy mean that the enemy is at home.",

The many bans on Bitcoin since its inception have not prevented its exponential growth, but the latest legislation and the reduction of privacy mean that the enemy is at home. Regulations are really where the governments have a chance to distort what this market is about, a ban of any kind will not change the way people approach bitcoin and a great deal of holders will simply ignore the ban and keep dealing with bitcoin as usual.But with regulations they can change the overall attitude people have towards bitcoin, and what better example than exchanges, now people are submitting all their personal information to buy bitcoin as this is more convenient, according to them obviously, rather than to do a peer to peer transaction, so by allowing centralized exchanges to prosper now they know how much fiat you had, how much bitcoin you have, when you bought it and what you are doing with it, something they would have never gotten with a ban.",
