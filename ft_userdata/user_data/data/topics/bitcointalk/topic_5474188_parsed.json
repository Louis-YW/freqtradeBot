Usually it works fine, pulling power like it should, until after about 20 minutes I get an error of 505x or 901 depending on how high I have my power consumption settings. Anyone here have any experience dealing with these errors? I don't know where to start troubleshooting, but I have a feeling it has to do with the finer points of tuning the firmware's frequency and other power related specs.",
