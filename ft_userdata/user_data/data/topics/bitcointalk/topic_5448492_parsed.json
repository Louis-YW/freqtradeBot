Use your transaction hx and contact their support team. Check through your wallet, the money have already left your deposited address into their account which is a normal process by centralized exchanges.

Supposing you sent it to your noncustodial wallet, it is your seed phrase or priivate key, you would have seen the coin, or would have been told to import the seed phrase or private key to a wallet that support the network that you sent it to and you would have seen your coin easily and be able to spend. The seed phrase or the private key belongs to Kucoin, Kucoin has your USDT with them.Quote from: light_warrior on April 12, 2023, 07:30:57 AMYou transferred USDT from one blockchain (BEP20) to another blockchain ERC20. ERC20 is an Ethereum blockchain. It is not possible to transfer directly, only by exchanging through a bridge or some exchanger. You can forget about your USDT.On Kucoin, BSC is suspended, if not that it is suspended, it wouldn't have been like this. You can check this which I take from Kucoin USDT network withdraw list. The network supported:I saw BNB to be suspended, probably if no more suspended, he should see his coin. But the best he can now is to contact Kucoin customer care, they may help.",
