  "content": "The past few years after COVID-19 have been the absolute worst; everything keeps rising—petrol, daily groceries, electricity, housing—to the point where you're barely making ends meet. Just to imagine, I've been looking for an apartment for over 6 months and haven't found anything yet. Not only is there a very limited supply, but those available are either too expensive, poor, too small, or everything combined. Thus, this is creating a huge feeling of uncertainty, as time is running out and I need to get settled down. Renting outside of town in the nearby villages isn't ideal either, because petrol is way too expensive.I'm not sure if anyone else feels the same, but this uncertainty with the increasing living costs and the ongoing rat race is causing me excessive stress. On top of that, moving out of the country doesn't seem ideal either, because most European cities are also suffering similar conditions, along with an extensive immigrant crisis (see France, Italy, Germany, and the UK). I'd be interested in remote working, but the economics field I've studied at university isn't in high demand for remote working, which often recruits IT workers and generally fields that require hands-on experience. As soon as I'm settled down, I'm considering taking up a data analysis course and finishing my master's degree in order to look for more opportunities abroad.I don't know, but each year seems progressively worse. It wasn't that bad before COVID-19; now it's the ultimate worst I've seen, and it's about to deteriorate even further. Thankfully, this forum has been a blessing and probably the only thing giving me hope, as it has resulted in me making a decent sum of money in the process. I'm yet to start looking for a job, but salaries are relatively low, despite the increased cost of living. To make matters worse, excessive weather conditions due to climate change are happening way more often now, causing floods and wildfires and destroying everything in their path. See Libya, Greece, Italy, Spain, and many more examples.Maybe I'm stressing out too much because I'm yet to find proper housing to establish myself again after being away for over a year in the military. I'm generally an anxious person myself, but does anyone else feel the same, and how do you deal with it? How do you stay optimistic?",

      "body": "Before Covid19 came, my economy was actually quite good. But I am a person who always approaches everything in life in a relaxed manner. But after Covid19 came and the Pandemic started. So I began to realize the importance of building our financial strength as strongly as possible. Making preparations before unexpected things happen is a necessary step. Previously I didn't think about it but now I started thinking about it and started doing it too. That is, currently I am trying to get out of my relaxing zone into the zone of working hard to make more money and learn more things that I have been ignoring.But if we talk about the economic situation after the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, I also feel that the world economy is getting worse day by day. Because as you said, currently the prices of all things are increasing due to inflation caused by war and the increase in fuel prices.But what I'm thinking right now is that no matter what, I won't be able to avoid the current situation. So I have to face it, adapt and be the best that anyone else can be.The cost of living will always increase. So like it or not, we have to adapt and think about how we can also increase our income. If we already have a business, we must continue to work hard to make our business more advanced and not lose out to competitors. Because I think currently natural law is returning to ancient times. If previously the strong were in power, now the rich are in power. So improving the standard of living seems to be an obligation in the current era.I hope that you too, OP, can adapt and keep fighting and never give up. Stress is a common thing that many people experience. and I hope you quickly find a place to live that suits what you want.",

      "body": "The impact on the economy since the world outbreak of this disease was declared a pandemic, almost everyone feels how difficult the economy is. I think almost everyone in all countries feels the hardest impact on the economy. How could it not be, everyone is required to stay at home as long as their status has not changed. In many countries, to earn daily income you have to sell in traditional markets.With the implementation of having to stay at home, the income to meet your daily needs will not be sufficient. Maybe for one week you will still be able to survive with the savings you had saved before the pandemic. If you continue to have to stay at home for more than one month, there is no other way but to sell existing assets.A little convenience for those whose monthly salary goes into their account because they work as government employees. I think the impact is also the same as for those who do not work as government employees because many government employees have their monthly salaries cut by banks because of the credit they take out.For the moment I don't know what to say so that we remain optimistic in facing such an economic situation.",

      "body": "I do feel the same, especially after Covid-19. I feel anxious sometimes and it's normal. Tho I don't stay optimistic, I don't do that. I think of the worst thing possible and try not to be on it. To start, I think what you can try is to learn to let go of the things you can't control, like the war, natural calamities, and inflation. Try to put your energy towards the things you can control. Start with small steps, like if you have debt, prioritize paying it down, starting with those that have high-interests. Reducing your debt can reduce financial stress, you'll feel a relief. Slowly, educate yourself on how you can earn money and wisely spend it. If you find it hard to land a job, it's entirely normal. Keep refining your approach, do something that you haven't done yet. What's important is you breakdown your big problems into smaller ones and solve it step by step. Take a breath and give yourself permission to have doubts and anxiety, then have time to work on it. Maybe ask for help. You are not  alone in this. There are people like you and there are people who cares for you I believe.",

How do you stay optimistic?The effect of COVID-19 across the globe has really done damage to a lot of countries.A lot of person's are still yet to recover financially, while some countries have gone into acute borrowing for the last three years, just so that they could at least keep their economy afloat.Ordinarily for you to survive this situation is that, you have to double your hustle, by sourcing for other means to generate more income for yourself and also diversify your income. Doing so will make you a bit stable, hence you can have  enough money to beat the inflation and have some reserve for any financial emergency.OP, one thing you should understand is that, you're not the only one caught up in this situation, but the unique thing is, you're ability to surmount these economic hurdles and come successfully at the end.",

It was also lack of access to needs due to how hassle access to the needs are due to restrictions to certain areas. I was like preparing myself mentally that I won't be able to afford such needs due to how limited suppliers also arrived here in my area. What I did was trying to freelance so that I wouldn't have to work so much outside other than my usual 9-5 job and it went just fine in my end. How did I stay optimistic? By not being too positive minded since it will disappoint me in the end for sure. I know I am gonna screw up anytime and whatever happens, happens. It is somehow pointless in controlling things that you cannot control. For example, there's no point for me stressing out the cost of goods these days.

And indeed, the issue isn't that they're taking someone else's jobs, even if that statement was true, it's not my issue since I'd supposedly look for something that requires a degree, due to my education. The main concern is that whole parts of cities have become ghettos and are suffering tremendously. Sweden used to be one of the safest countries, well, not anymore. Poland on the other hand, which I visited in 2021, doesn't have a immigrant-friendly policy, is one of the safest.Quote from: Lucius on September 24, 2023, 01:35:53 PMQuote from: Ultegra134 on September 24, 2023, 11:20:39 AMMaybe I'm stressing out too much because I'm yet to find proper housing to establish myself again after being away for over a year in the military.

Military enlisting is mandatory for up to 9 to 12 months in Greece (unpaid), which is the reason I'm out of the job market now. I've considered it but I generally don't like the whole concept of the army. On top of that, entering isn't as good as it might look. Salaries aren't anything special nor do they provide housing etc. It only secures that you'll have a job, which for the first few years will only pay an above average wage.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on September 24, 2023, 01:54:51 PMThe solution is as simple as spending less than you earn, which is sometimes difficult, but you can always spend more than you think you can.

COVID-19 made things complicated and the war in Ukraine is now making things worse.  This has led to an increase in the price of fuel, electricity and some basic grains. I was considering moving to Europe but the stories I am hearing from my countrymen over there have made me reconsider. It is better to suffer only economic hardship than to combine it with racism and xenophobia. Many online jobs have been replaced with Artificial intelligence making the few available jobs very competitive.  Some of us are not technically inclined so we have to still fight for less technical jobs.

Just to imagine, I've been looking for an apartment for over 6 months and haven't found anything yet. Not only is there a very limited supply, but those available are either too expensive, poor, too small, or everything combined. Thus, this is creating a huge feeling of uncertainty, as time is running out and I need to get settled down. Renting outside of town in the nearby villages isn't ideal either, because petrol is way too expensive.I'm not sure if anyone else feels the same, but this uncertainty with the increasing living costs and the ongoing rat race is causing me excessive stress. On top of that, moving out of the country doesn't seem ideal either, because most European cities are also suffering similar conditions, along with an extensive immigrant crisis (see France, Italy, Germany, and the UK). I'd be interested in remote working, but the economics field I've studied at university isn't in high demand for remote working, which often recruits IT workers and generally fields that require hands-on experience. As soon as I'm settled down, I'm considering taking up a data analysis course and finishing my master's degree in order to look for more opportunities abroad.I don't know, but each year seems progressively worse. It wasn't that bad before COVID-19; now it's the ultimate worst I've seen, and it's about to deteriorate even further. Thankfully, this forum has been a blessing and probably the only thing giving me hope, as it has resulted in me making a decent sum of money in the process. I'm yet to start looking for a job, but salaries are relatively low, despite the increased cost of living. To make matters worse, excessive weather conditions due to climate change are happening way more often now, causing floods and wildfires and destroying everything in their path.

I'm generally an anxious person myself, but does anyone else feel the same, and how do you deal with it? How do you stay optimistic?Housing has become a really big problem. It is now very difficult to find a place to stay and everything is very expensive. Many landlords are opportunistic. The state has tried to intervene in the renting out of houses at very high prices, but without success. Landlords set the price at which they want to rent their houses.I am glad the forum has helped you, but you still need to find a job. Even if your income is low, you still need it. It is really hard to be a student in such an economy. But don't stress yourself. Many people are in this situation and you seem determined to do something about your goals.",

I'm generally an anxious person myself, but does anyone else feel the same, and how do you deal with it? How do you stay optimistic?I used to be like that in my \"youth\" and it was a good thing to be stressing about these things, at least for me. It made me learn the value of money and most importantly to plan ahead financially speaking. You've already the first step correctly by thinking about these things but of course you have to try not to get overly anxious. Don't worry about making mistakes, after all you're at the beginning of your journey in life and even mistakes are a valuable experience.I can't tell you what to do because the situation is different in different countries and different times. But I can tell you what I did.I basically went on a very \"strict financial mode\" where I wrote down all my little expenses and little incomes. I worked hard and earned as much money as I could then made wise investments while controlling my expenses. That helped me maximize the amount of money I saved up (income, interest, passive income, profit).I have to emphasize that writing down stuff helped a lot, as it is not enough to just be \"careful about expenses\". It helps a lot to be able to visualize and analyze your expenses (and incomes). For example at the end of the month you can look back and see for example you wasted money somewhere that could be avoided or better spent. I even have a little excel file that dates back 20 years Not to mention that it helps you to stay organized a lot better and if you set targets for yourself, it also helps you reach those targets and feel \"optimistic\" about your future as you would be going through life according to your plan or at least closes to your plan as possible.Speaking of planning ahead and setting targets one of the things I did was to figure out what would be the biggest expense I would have in my life and in my country it is rent. For example today as an engineer if I had to rent an apartment specially in the capital, that would eat at least 50% of my salary.Knowing that, my goal became to eliminate that cost. The solution was to buy a house so that became the plan. I eventually saved up enough money to be able to buy my first apartment. It didn't have to be a fancy one or a big one but it helped me eliminate a large expense. That's extra money in my pocket which I were able to save or invest to improve.Quote from: Ultegra134 on September 24, 2023, 02:07:48 PMI'm already careful when it comes to expenses, the issue is that having a comfortable life is way too complicated anymore. I'm not talking about being wealthy, but being able to afford going out to dinner and going on a vacation, without money being an issue.That's not new though. \"Economic hardship\" has been part and parcel of our world, even though from time to time we see a longer period of stability (eg. after 2008 disaster up until 2019-ish) which makes people forget what's happened before and what's coming (or rather repeating).You also shouldn't expect to become wealthy in short time, as I said nothing has changed. It just takes hard work and wise decisions.",

I am always seeking ways to earn more in order to cope up with vast increase of daily needs. Well yes, government of countries should be doing their part to resolve the problem but that would take huge amount of time so I am just creating adjustments. As you’ve mentioned not only our countries are struggling but the majority. It is valid to stress with such concern ‘coz it is something being tackled on a daily basis. There are many ways to earn from this industry such as providing services or joining reward contests. We should also help ourselves with this issue ‘coz majority are highly affected by it. Choosing to stay with the problem and to blame people why such thing happened,won’t do good to us. Since such issue has been present for years, the only thing we should does to cope ip little by little”",

I'm very inspired.Well, I think it's normal if your condition is like that. A place to live is the main thing that will provide a sense of privacy, especially in completing your study assignments and resting your body when you are tired. My advice is to try looking for one that is a little further away from urban areas. I'm sure there will be a difference in price and definitely look for an environment that is friendly and suits your lifestyle.",

When you are stressed, that just means that you are focusing too much on the things you cannot control. So if you want to get back in the right track again out of your adversities, you just simply need to feel that you are in control of you own finances and your own whole life. So take a pause in your life. Remind yourself that you are the only person responsible.There's two things you can do. Minimize your expenses or maximize your income. Along with that you have to payoff your debts and start saving so that you have something to invest later in your career and life. Anything outside of your control are just distractions.",

      "body": "I'm sorry you're struggling with housing, I know it's a big problem in some countries. In my country, it's very simple to find accommodation because I think there's more of it than people around, so at least that's not a major stress factor, although a lot of other things that you've mentioned plus some additional ones are. Economically speaking, my country has certainly been deteriorating for almost a decade, but I've been going against the flow, feeling kind of stable although not great financially.Since you're asking how I'm staying optimistic, I guess I should mention my circumstances, which is living in the capital of Ukraine during, you know, the war. I'm trying to balance out the big problems with small pleasures like appreciating time with loved ones, enjoying the weather when it's nice, allowing a bit of unnecessary spending on eating something fancy, etc. I've stopped making long-term plans, and I'm trying to overall do what I like to do, as long as it's enough to pay the bills, without putting pressure onto myself to earn more, work more etc. Maybe lowering your own expectations of what your life should be like and focusing on the upsides can help you as well.",
