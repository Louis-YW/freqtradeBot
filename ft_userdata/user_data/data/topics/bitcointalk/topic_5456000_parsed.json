Which problems are you spotting?My opinion is that it is a socialist thought experiment trying to control the world rather than trying to understand what it is like and act accordingly. Why do you have to penalize higher earners with an inflationary currency? I mean a surgeon you penalize him with a lower purchasing power of his currency and a janitor you reward him? And why only two currencies with two types of inflation? Why not 20? As if it were not bad enough to have one fiat currency in a country to have two currencies with two inflation rates.",

It sounds pretty socialist to me but the important thing is not the adjective, and I don't think everything about socialism is bad either, the important thing is whether it would have any effect in the real world. Quote from: Bialke on June 11, 2023, 03:44:23 AMIsn't it more opportunity for the Currency A owner to trade more with a higher volume? But is it also protecting the low income people for decaying of their money?I don't think so because what high income earners do is keep just enough money for expenses and invest the rest in assets that beat inflation.What he is going to do is spend the cash necessary for the month and invest the rest.Quote from: Bialke on June 11, 2023, 03:44:23 AMTo have a higher inflation is not a penality. And to have a lower inflation is not to reward somebody.Well, the way you put it, that seems to be the intention. Quote from: Bialke on June 11, 2023, 03:44:23 AMThe Janitor just doing the same work, over and over again ist not losing buying value of his money so much. What do you mean? The inflation you raise is higher even than what we have had in the decade from 2010 to 2020 which was between 2 and 3%, some years even lower, although that would be official figures. If we count money supply expansion it would be higher. In other words, you are proposing a scenario approximately like the one that usually happens. Besides, the problem with these mental experiments is that they rarely capture all the complexity. If inflation for the janitor is 5%, will his salary be raised after a year? How much? I would rather be a janitor with an inflation rate of 10% and get a 15% raise than with an inflation rate of 5% and get a 4% raise.Quote from: Bialke on June 11, 2023, 03:44:23 AMAnd the Doctor with all his investments and his big income, can hustle more to make bigger profits.So I don't know why have two currencies with two inflations, then. The problem with inflation is that it erodes the poor most of all. Raising inflation more for the rich will only make them put more money into assets and faster.",

Inflation is supposedly healthy because it motivates people to spend money rather than hold it. Some fiat currencies are pretty stable and have a very low inflation rate without needing any additional currencies, so I'm not sure any experiments are needed here.

What you say can't be released in real life because having of two currency makes it very impractical for people to exchange money between each-other, makes it very impractical to spend money in shop, also directly underlines the social status of particular person and just what if currency A group pays some extra money to currency B group to buy B currencies and hold them?

By discriminating the uses of money, some people with lower incomes can only use coins with lower growth in the money supply. This helps to ensure that they are not strongly affected by the effects of inflation.However, there are some issues that need to be considered such,  rule management and enforcement can be difficult, especially when there is chaos in the value of coins. The rules for dividing the use of money can be seen as unfair to people with high incomes and high value of goods. Banning the exchange of two currencies could cause further social segregation that could lead to segregation and limit the rights of some people.

A free market advocate looks at what happens and acts accordingly. The law of supply and demand is not something some evil capitalist made up, it is something you can see with your eyes. Instead from a socialist perspective instead of trying to understand that law and act accordingly, they understand that the law is unjust and try to prohibit it, regulate it or modify it. Then come edicts on maximum prices, which are a disaster since Diocletian, but do not stop repeating themselves throughout history and other similar measures that have similar results.In this case and in this forum, the best mental experiment would be to have proposed that the Bitcoin be the only currency, period, but the Bitcoin has a libertarian origin that does not fit very well with socialist ideas, however moderate they may be. Bitcoin escapes the state, it can't manipulate it, it can't print more to spend more, and socialism doesn't like that.

Would this mitigate negative effects of inflation for most vulnerable in our society? Would this work in your eyes? Which problems are you spotting?The idea is cool. And... it's already been implemented in a sense... And you see, the effect is nil! And now more details ! Have you been as a tourist in Cuba? I highly recommend that you go once to see how the scheme you suggested works.Cuba has even 3 currencies! Yes yes, I didn't misspell.That:- The Cuban peso. With which you can buy something, but the choice is very limited. - The Cuban convertible peso (Peso cubano convertible), or in common parlance, the kuk (CUC)- U.S. dollar.And their circulation is limited by rules close to yours, in fact.Bottom line is :- The useless PESO - for the local masses.- The more interesting CUC.  This is essentially Cuba's second, parallel currency, which served as a replacement for dollars and was originally intended for foreign tourists and diplomats. That is, a kind of \"elite currency\" with which you could eventually buy a lot more goods! Yes yes, for the peso, you are given many orders of magnitude less goods than for the CUC. - And the most desirable thing for Cubans, but actually forbidden to them, under threat of criminal prosecution, is the U.S. dollar. This is for the \"upper caste\" - the tourists, the elites, who need to be shown how happy and good it is to live in Cuba! For dollars in Cuba you can practically do anything! But the \"real paradise\" is not for the local population....",
