Though he is exposed and inclined with technological development but to some extent and I can attest that he is good, sound and knowledgeable to assimilate teachings and new ideas.   I got to know him through a friend based on recommendation for a work for which he did very well to maximum satisfaction. As a bitcoin enthusiast, I felt it was the right time and thing to do putting him through and bringing him onboard the bitcoin system for which promotion and adoption is the goal.As a member of this platform and a pro bitcoin enthusiast, I find it necessary promoting the acceptance and adoption of bitcoin in my locality for which I have been on the course and it has been a successful one. I had to lecture him on bitcoin, When and why Bitcoin was founded, Founder of Bitcoin, Importance and benefits of holding bitcoin also challenges and disadvantages, How to trade bitcoin ( listed some  notable exchange where he can trade bitcoin), What is blockchain and how it works. I also explained and showed him what a public and private key looks like, showing him a transaction hash too was another thing I did for him to get a clearer picture of how it works.We had a one on one conversation as it was more of an interactive class we had. I was also practical because i would want him to know how to handle things on his own after the day and when he is with others. I taught him how to set up a bitcoin wallet so he could easily understand and do it himself, copy and send his wallet address to his customers for payment. As private keys are important, I also told and showed him the difference between private keys, public keys  and transaction hash so he could get acquainted to them all. All through was a practical session so he could get acquainted to the whole process. I also emphasized on him running another private wallet from  what we have done as it may please him for his own safety. I was very precise of the market volatility and letting him know how it works so he does not make any wrong move.It was a very deep interactive session as he inquired to know how he could purchase bitcoin for which I gave him options of centralize exchange to choose.  I made it clear to him \"not your keys not your coin\" so he could be aware of the happenings and take caution so as not to fall victim of any circumstances or unforeseen event with centralized exchange.He was very happy for my kind gesture and time spent lecturing him about bitcoin and blockchain. He also told me he was going to put his friends and siblings through so they could get to know about bitcoin and how it works. I believe he would do better and as well getting more people more especially his customers to know about bitcoin and for those of his customers already into bitcoin, i am sure they would definitely want to pay him in bitcoin too as it would be very easier and convenient for them to pay him without much stress.

If you had a penny for every person you introduced to bitcoin you will be a very rich man. I appreciate your efforts spreading bitcoin to your friends but I’m afraid if you keep making topics about each one it will be too much.

It's great that you were able to teach him about the basics of bitcoin, including its history, the importance of private keys, and how to set up a wallet. It's also important to note the potential risks and challenges of using bitcoin, as well as the importance of market volatility. It's great that he was receptive to your teachings and that he plans to share this knowledge with his friends and siblings.It's wonderful that you are working to promote the adoption of bitcoin in your community. As more people become familiar with bitcoin and its benefits, it will help to build a stronger network and increase its overall use and value. Keep up the good work, and happy birthday once again!",

Some see Bitcoin as an opportunity to invest for the future, while some see it as a get rich-quick-scheme. In order to build a financial hedge against inflation, they also convert their local fiat to Bitcoin and due to restrictions on financial transactions as well as high transaction fees they use Bitcoin to invade these restrictions and enjoy cheap transaction fees. It is also a known fact that some financial institution's offer very poor services that it can take days to carryout a simple transaction, hence, people a switching to Bitcoin to overcome them. Recently Africans have began to understand the importance of privacy and they are moving to networks that offer such service.    Quote from: CryptSafe on December 18, 2022, 06:15:35 AMTo wrap it up comrades, today is MY BIRTHDAYA HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!!!!You are doing a good job CryptSafe by your constant drive to create awareness and promote Bitcoin adoption in your area. Keep up the good work. Although, I don't place much importance to birthday celebration because it is causing more harm than good in my area, but your deserve to be celebrated because you saw it as an avenue to promote a worthy course.

As a result, more new people will definitely come into contact with Bitcoin. I hope Bitcoin is legal in your country and that you can freely adapt to it.

So hearing about internet money and opportunity bitcoin brings everyone gets interested. I've watched youtubers interview college students in America on bitcoin, they rarely know what bitcoin is about and how it works. Not interested. They've got other businesses or industries to worry about. Not like that in Africa, people tend to do what made some else rich or financially stable. However, bitcoin adoption, coming from African is an Idea, but I think the continent needs to diversify on other things as well.",

A couple of weeks ago the first bitcoin conference was held in Ghana and also the creation of the first lightning bitcoin payment across some countries in Africa. Perhaps this is why we are seeing more trends of Bitcoin adoption at the grassroot-level in Africa. I remember watching a  documentary where the person was interviewing some French women and men if they know about bitcoin and about a fair number of them didn't know about the Bitcoin or the knew about bitcoin but did not have any Bitcoin. Maybe the reason is that it is easier to talk about bitcoin and adopting it at the grassroot-level in Africa when compared to the European countries. I think it's something I should look into.",

Every time you see a post, that involves the adoption of bitcoin it is 99% in an African town where you would not expect the people to even have credit card payment. In contrast in big cities in the western world, the adoption is getting smaller and smaller. Maybe it has to do with the distrust of the African people in their local currencies.",
