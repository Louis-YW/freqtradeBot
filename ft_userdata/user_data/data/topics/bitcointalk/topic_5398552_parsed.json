Usually based on history, host will be the champion because they could decided which sport included in event and which is not. so they may only take sport that could be their medal barn",

We know in an event like this, it should have a related post in our feeds.My country is PH and I'm sure others have the same experience as me. Maybe because of those hot topics here recently that's why not much exposure in the event where our country is one of the best here.

So most probably they will win the most medals. So it will just be a battle of 2nd-4th places.",

Chinese Athletes are very much incentivized by China so they really are up to compete.  You will noticed that in every Olympics Chinese athletes are always going to be making lots of gold. Actually, also Russia.Vietnam athletes trained in  the grounds where the actual competition is like a homecourt, they'd got the high probability of winning.",

I love cycling. I am particularly interested in the track and field competition and also swimming. As at the time of writing this, Vietnam has 25 gold, 13 silver and 23 bronze medals. Malaysia has 11 gold, 5 silver and 13 bronze medals while Indonesia has 7 gold, 9 silver and 2 bronze medals. And the Philippines 6 gold, 12 silver and 12 bronze medals. So far, Vietnam has won the most medals, followed by Malaysia and then Indonesia.  In 2019, the Philippines had the most gold medal. Are we going to see a repeat of that in this year's games?",

I think they're still early on it and one day they'll surely be part of those countries that are bagging every medal that is available. That will be a game changing for them if they allocate a little bit higher budget for their athletes to have better trainings and program to achieve medals. Because it's also their economy that will benefit from it if they bag medals home.",

I think for locals, it's more of just a way to let say get a scholarship in school if you are really good in sports and maybe you can represent your country in this kind of events which I think it big in Southeast Asia. And who knows, they can eventually conquer the Olympics. So I wouldn't say that it is declining for young people, but this could be a way for them to get out of poverty.Some countries in SEA doesn't have Olympic medals yet, so it they win in SEA games and then by chance won the first gold medal in Olympics it will be a huge honor for them and the government will shower them with money. Just like what the recent Olympic champion Diaz brought to the Philippines, winning it's first Gold medal, returning to the country as hero and then given huge sums of money by the Philippine government.",
