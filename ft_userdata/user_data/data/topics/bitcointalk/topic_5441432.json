      "body": "Let's put it this way, I hope you learned an important lesson that you only paid $11 for - a lot of other members lost a lot more, so you can count yourself lucky in a way.As for scams on the forum, you are not far from the truth, because scams on the forum are not moderated and do not expect them to be. Trading with beginners without any reputation is completely frivolous and risky, and if you're already doing it, then don't do it without escrow - even though for such small amounts it doesn't really make sense.What I can do is warn others about this case and tag that user, but he will continue with his scams, and it is probably not his only BTT account.",

When you involve newbie without good reputation in terms of trading, then you are only very close to trying to scam. Involve escrow, or ask the seller to send item first if you are trusted user.Forum does not moderate scams, so try to be careful when you trade. It's also not really good to say bitcointalk is haven for scammer's when you don't have full awareness of the risks of trading with people you don't know especially online and they are newbie.",

Op, next time You're about to transact with anyone online it might not even be here try as much as possible to check their feedbacks from previously concluded transactions and if there's none then try to do business with those that have a good trust score.",

I would like to request to the Moderators, Please Get a Review copy from the seller to check the Quality and see, if he has these items or not. It's not. Really.The only problem is that some people learn from others' experience, some learn from theirs. You chose the hard path, to learn from yours.What I mean is that trust feedback is extremely important in a trade. Look for users' trust feedback, whether it's \"trusted feedback\" or not and decide for yourself if it worth going forward. This user already had negative feedback. Now he will get more.Another important part is rank. If one is newbie, there's always a chance it's an thief that wasn't caught yet. The higher the rank, the chances for uncaught scammers somewhat decreases (but don't go to zero).And last, but not the least important thing is to use escrow when you can. A trusted escrow from the forum can easily help you avoid getting scammed.Oh, almost forgot, one more: unless you get more experience, avoid making deals in mixed bitcointalk + telegram (or similar), since impersonation can trick you badly.This being said, I agree, it was a rather inexpensive lesson. I'll help with tagging the scammer, hoping that the next potential customer would open his eyes better.",

As a Newbie, what do you suggest as a beginner to start here with any kind of business?it's a small amount, maybe I wouldn't check in detail because of that, but haven't you seen the previous negative tags that this user has? if you are in doubt, you can always find a reliable senior member who can serve as an escrow (for example GazetaBitcoin Escrow Service). That way you would be protected.the forum is good and offers many possibilities, you just need to know all aspects and how to use it.",

So sorry about your loss mate but you should be happy it is just some peanut although I do not know what the exact amount might be in your local currency but atleast this should be an eye opener for you here onboard this platform.  Come to talk of it, the account you had a deal with is a new bie account and I expected you to have opted for an escrow account when dealing so as not to be a victim of scam. I checked the moneso account and I discovered the account been flagged and tagged already so how come you did not request for a reputable escrow to handle the transaction process for you. You claimed you had a Skype interview with the scammer why did you not tell him you were in for an escrow account. Anyways this deal should teach you a lesson to deal with caution on this platform as there are lots of scammers here looking for who to prey on. You had a Skype call with the scammer did you record it?",

Do you know what you're asking there are thousands of members and hundreds of new posts here in Bitcointalk and you are asking moderators to do this, this is an additional burden, they are already loaded and they are not getting anything from buyers and sellers, instead why not educate yourself on how to properly transact here, you did not even check the seller's reputation.",
