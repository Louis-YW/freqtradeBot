I have it on a rig on HiveOS and everytime I set anything other than 1050 core and 890 memory it crashes. Can someone give me some decent idea how to overclock this thing?  I am getting 25MH and it makes me mad I can't maximize my cards lol.",

The Micron 5500XT are less performing out of the other RX5500XT, I guess no one told you that before buying, the higher I have seen is 27MH sorry pal 1150 core 950 memory = 27MH on ETH If yours cant get over 890 then its your luck....",
