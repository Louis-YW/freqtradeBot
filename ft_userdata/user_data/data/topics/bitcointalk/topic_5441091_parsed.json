      "body": "Even if an angel becomes the president of Nigeria today, one thing you should know is that everything will not just become great at once the rebuilding of the nation is a gradual process, so if a worse leader steps in today all I can do is to try as much as possible to survive till the next opportunity comes for me to select a new leader and if in the process of my survival I was opportune to leave the country to a greener pastures then I'll seize the opportunity and leave. But, if eventually a leader that has vision because president and I see that he's truly working to better the country then the only thing for me to do is to behave myself as a citizen. But we shouldn't forget that we're dealing with human mind here; everyone can change if you take Satan for example, he was once an angel.",

Would it fail us as it has done in time past? Well time is going to tell. For now we keep hope alive.My plans is to figure out a way to earn income that will be able to cater for my needs as well as that of my family. And this income would not come from the government or from working for anyone but for working for myself. These income would not be dependent on the economy of the Nation or the appreciation order valuation of the naira. This is my plan.",

My answer is that I will keep staying in Nigeria despite the hardship, because I believe that someday, it will get better in the hand of a good leader, and not the likes of APC cabals who have successfully crippled our economy due to selfish interest. So all we need to do is keep praying and vote for a God fearing leader this forthcoming governorship election coming March 11th",

Despite the hardship and suffering we’re encountering now, I believe there’re still better days ahead and my fatherland will be great again. For those that lost hope in their countries and wants to leave (japa), I wouldn’t blame them but it is better we come together and fight what is ours and make it great instead of bettering other countries.",

Buhari no been get any plans before him become the president of Nigeria. Asiwaju get plans, we never know if dem bad or good but him get plans and him get coordination. Asiwaju no enter seat say him wan chop money or recover his funds spend on campaigning or rigging the election. Dat man get money wey Nigeria no fit get self. So na power make am enter seat. Now wey him dun get the power him fit use am wrongly or well, we never know so make we no judge yet but just dey watch.As election dun finish, na for us to continue our hustle on hope of getting a better future for ourselves. Trusting politicians is never the well to go. Politics is a game all over the world, after the game is won na the policy wey follow dey determine if the country dey go forward or not. Obama was the choice of the people but dey experience a worst government under him than Trump which everybody despise. This wan mean say things no dey always go as we plan am. Buhari was also the choice of the people but we see how things played out. Allow politicians politic but no stop your hustle as you never know what the other party policy might do to the nation.",
