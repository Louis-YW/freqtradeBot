      "body": "Well I agree everyone in life deserves to be happy because it is good for your mental health. And being happy is also good for you because your attitude and approach to things in life will have positive results. If you start your day being sad, mad, or angry that can be very stressful. It will not allow you to clearly think or do something right. Take for example something so simple as driving to work. If you do not have a good meal this will cause you to have hunger. Now if you are already running late for work and traffic is bad. You will not be going to work with a happy approach or attitude. But by waking up early, having a proper meal can help you to have a happy attitude and start your day with positivity. Another good example is being happy in a good relationship. This is so important because if you are not in a healthy relationship, it can cost you your mental health and happiness. Having the right partner in a relationship matters a lot because both of you want to be happy. Toxic relationships are bad for anyone because you may be giving your time and love to someone who does not appreciate you or even your money.",
