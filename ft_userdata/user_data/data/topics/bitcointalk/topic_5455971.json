They did not banned altcoin to sue Binance but they sued Binance for trading of those altcoin which are declared as securities and those securities (alt or specific token) were not registered with SEC. That's why, SEC sued Binance and halted the trading of those coins, but also many other coins too. (Which were in pair of BUSD and BNB).For your second query, No, future of cryptocurrency can be changed by the impact of USA only because Binance is just one of the many exchanges, which provide exchanging, trading and staking etc. Feature which any other exchanges could do by replacing it maybe it could be registered with SEC. So, be positive and remain patient, because AFAIK, they just want to develop such cobditions in which they could buy more BTC in lesser money. (I hope you got my point).",

While this is going on, SEC and other whales may be waiting to buy cheap.In this case Binance.US is certainly affected and for Binance.com is not affected by the SEC because it is not the SEC's working area. But even so, the impact of the regulations made by the SEC has shaken the crypto ecosystem. After all, Binance is the largest exchange at the moment and this will certainly have an effect. Just look at how the price of Bitcon freely fell from the price of $27k down to touch the price area of $25k. and some altcoins that were banned by the SEC in the US were severely affected. US people began to withdraw their asset holdings so that the crypto market crashed.Those waiting for this moment will certainly party and be able to buy bitcoin and altcoins at a cheaper price.",

It's normal but still, it's evolved to conquer the challenges of the times. I would say, we shouldn't be fooled by there focus on altcoins as that's just gor a start. There success in this round would determine what they joke yo archive when they turn there focus towards bitcoin.Fortunately, there bans has always come down to nothing but, it might minimise the number of individuals that falls victims to crypto scams in the form of scam tokens and altcoins. Let's be guided by this mischievous plan and not be fooled in our investment choices and the part we play in all these FUD.",

Like ada, matic and sol on robinhood exchange. US is really not aligned on crypto but we will see. We all knew that US is a strong country and not having crypto on this area might be their loss actually. Its not the only country, maybe users from the area could rely on dex more if some exchanges really prohibit them to trade crypto. The SEC chair is really aiming to eradicate crypto on US territory but not gonna happened.",

US not banned all altcoin. US Security Exchange Commission charged for trading a few shitcoins. Not all altcoin. So i think it not big problem. And after this SEC problem Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency pumping Again. Bitcoi ATH is near about $67500 From here some days ago Bitcoins price huge fall some days ago bitcoin price was $16k. It is normal things for cryptocurrency. Btu from bottom bitcoin price including gradually day by day. And i think that bitcoin price will hit new ATH within Q-1 of 2024. I believe within 2024 bitcoin price will hot $100k.",
