Are there more compelling cases for Rune as an innovative btc standard?Both Ordinals and Runes are from altcoin developers who saw great chances to deploy their useless NFTs on Bitcoin blockchain by exploiting holes in Taproot. I don't consider they are Bitcoin developers and those projects like Ordinals, Runes are not projects that built for Bitcoin communities.People who don't have experience, are greed enough, will be scammed by Ordinals and Runes, lose their bitcoins to purchase those useless NFTs and their native tokens as well as waste their bitcoins to mint those inscriptions.After creating many shit forks like BCH, BSV and more, most are dead now, these scam developers found other ways to steal bitcoin from greed people. They want to get rich and the easy way to get rich is holding their bitcoins but they unfortunately choose to do a harder way, invest in Ordinals, Runes and will lose their bitcoins.How many Bitcoin forks are there?",

Maybe you're missing something here; here is an image of comparison which I obviously didn't see any reasonable evidence for creating the so called Runes if not for exploitation of people who are interested in the get rich quick scheme..  Certainly I can't decide for you what to love or think of the project. You can go ahead with what you think of it, it's not any of my business right!",

An experiment that failed will be pivoted and it could turn out to be an advancement in bitcoin network.It is not even part of the bitcoin protocol to be able to turn into anything, now or in the future.It is arbitrary data that is being pushed to the bitcoin blockchain. If we ignored the decentralized nature of the bitcoin blockchain, it is exactly like posting the same data on bitcointalk and calling your post a \"token\"!A token is created using a smart contract and a smart contract has to be executed by the protocol and enforced by its consensus rules in the platform that it is being created on. This is exactly what happens in token creation platforms like ethereum. It is not what is happening in bitcoin. Because for starters bitcoin smart contracts do not have that capability to create tokens and also it is literally raw data they're pushing in the transactions!P.S. Unless you consider finding an exploit in a protocol \"innovative\" you can't use that word to describe the Ordinals Attack and by extension all the alternative names they use for that attack like Rune.",

So I think you should research them yourself instead of asking people about them. Top altcoins like ETH are hardly welcome here, let alone these trash tokens. So I don't think you will find your answer, and if you are thinking of investing in them then you should be careful and I just want to advise you not to let that garbage take all your bitcoins before you realize that.",

Altcoin developers would prefer to say their coins are killers like Bitcoin killers, Ethereum killers but their coins don't kill Bitcoin or Ethereum but die with time.How many cryptocurrencies have died? The number of dead coins are bigger than 14,039.QuoteOver 50% of all cryptocurrencies have died. Of the over 24,000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinGecko since 2014, 14,039 have died.Flippening?I recall that Ethereum never flipped Bitcoin in marketcap but there are some weeks media expected for that flippening and that's all. Months later, it's turn of Ripple to flip Ethereum but none of them can flip Bitcoin in marketcap and in price of a single coin.It is around late of June 2017 when Bitcoin dominance is about 40% and Ethereum dominance is about 30%. 10% is not too small to make a flippening for Ethereum.https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/",
