That is OK I was just going to ask if you played the modded one as well, but surely modded is not for the tournament for sure, but for me, this is just my take on the Gundam modded Starcraft it is awesome but surely if you are a starcraft avid fan you would like your game to not be modded at all, this is just my take on the Modded game version, For sure many have tried the move set and strategy of pro gamers on their own game, and sometimes you are probably proud that you have made the unthinkable and accomplished 1 of that gameplay, Thank you for that link, but even though I want an updated version, it will surely do I think I will study those teams and the gameplay of those available players, this is still a great watch and review for sure,",
