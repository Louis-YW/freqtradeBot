People will never believe them again.It's not really the goal why people are pressing charges and taking necessary legal actions against them. They just want their money back and make it a done deal and not get stressed about the drama of the past. I'm pretty sure no one would ever trust Gox or any of its upper-level associates and employees ever again due to the fault of its mastermind. Once the claims are done, people would just leave shit behind and expend their energy into something else, that's for sure.",

I actually dont believe the news of the release of coin cause more coins had been sold in this market without such news. The idea is usually to pick an average price of sale and sell gradually on exchanges, probably hiding from anyone. I suspect a plan for a bottom buy from the FUD",
