  "content": "There has been a lot of echo to the official RF version of Urkaine being \"Nazis\". Let's now recap and see who actually drove the Nazis out of Ukraine and Russia:QuoteUkraine's Contribution to Victory in World War II Is UnsurpassedUkraine paid the biggest price for victory in the Second World War. As a vital contributor to the Red Army and a key provider of industrial resources in the USSR, Ukraine incurred the largest number of casualties during WWII. Russia has claimed the victory for itself and has officially denied the Ukrainian role in the fight against the Nazis.The real number of victims during WWII is still not fully known. Some relevant data is still held in Russian archives and is not available for non-Russian researchers. However, of the 41.7 million people living in Ukrainian Soviet Republic before the war, only 27.4 million were alive in Ukraine in 1945. Official data says that at least 8 million Ukrainians lost their lives: 5.5 - 6 million civilians, and more than 2.5 million natives of Ukraine were killed at the front. The data varies between 8 to 14 million killed, however, only 6 million have been identified.Remarkably, in December 2010, the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin mentioned in an interview that the Soviet Union could have won the Second World War without Ukrainian forces. “We would definitely have won without Ukraine as a member of USSR, because we are the “winner state.” The war was won because of Russian industrial resources” he claimed.The contribution of Ukrainians to victory in World War II was not just limited to the 7 million Ukrainian soldiers in the Red Army. Hundreds of Ukrainians also served as generals and commanders. The flag of victory over the Reichstag was first raised by a Ukrainian from Sumy, Alex Berest. In addition, about 2.5 million Ukrainians received commendations and were awarded with medals by the Soviet Union.Ukraine was also the largest contributor to the industrial resources of the USSR. Before the war, the Ukrainian SSR was a leading center for metals and mining, chemical production, tractors, and agricultural machinery. In 1940, Ukrainian mechanical engineers built 671 line-haul locomotives (73.4 percent of all-Union production) and 16 thousand tons of mining and metallurgical equipment (67.5 percent).I think that Putin has little to teach Ukraine about how to fight, how to win and how to get the Nazis, the real ones, out of the country and into their sewers. It is about time that Ukraine gets the recognition they deserve and that will not come from the Kremlin.",

But for Putin to justify the invasion of Ukraine with the claim that he want to \"denazify \" the country is hiding the truth and promoting falsehood. Ukrainians fought with Russians to defeat Germany and I am sure that without thier support victory would have been more difficult. Infact it was estimated that a total of 4.5million Ukrainians joined the Russians to fight the Nazis, while a mere 250,000 collaborated with Germany. My question now is are the thousands of civilians that have been killed by the Russians during this invasion Nazis?",

It is always the red army of the Soviet Union that gets most of the credit. Also, it is remarkable how the Nazi talking point has been a thing since the beginning of this conflict, I have no doubt that there must be some people in Ukraine who sympathize with the national socialist ideology, but there is also people like that in many countries of Europe and even in the United States.  The only reason of this war seems to be to annex territory to the Russian Federation.",

While nobody knew of the deal, Stalin had to come up with an excuse....so he claimed he was invading Poland to protect ethnic Ukrainians that were being killed in a genocide....

Most common people from Ukraine and Russia did not hold much of a grudge IMHO. Creating such hate and issues where there were not is all Moscow's doing. Two army corps fighting an illegal war in the Donbas for years goes a long way into creating a false narrative of hate. You may be right, the Kremlin is scared of having what many Russian see as the poor brother being successful in an alliance with Europe. That cannot be uh?",

And Russia should never justify its invasion of Ukraine by the above claims because there are many more reasons why it invaded. But I know both parties are regretting the war. Russia thought the war will be easy and short, while Ukraine thought it could get any weapon from NATO including war jets and a no-fly-zone. How can people you claim to be protecting are dying in thousand? Russia has killed more than they claim they are protecting. This senseless war should end, innocent people are dying while Putin and Zelensky and their cronies are living in pleasure and abundance.

Blinken, in terms of actual power, is nothing but a messenger boy for the Straussian neocons and neoliberals who actually run US foreign policy.The secretary of state was instructed to relay the new directive – a sort of message to the Kremlin – via mainstream print media, which was promptly published by the Washington Post.In the elite US mainstream media division of labor, the New York Times is very close to the State Department. and the Washington Post to the CIA. In this case though the directive was too important, and needed to be relayed by the paper of record in the imperial capital. It was published as an Op-Ed (behind paywall)....",
