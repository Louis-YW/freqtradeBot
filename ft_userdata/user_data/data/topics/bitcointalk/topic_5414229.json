  "content": "Yesterday, I visited bitcointalk from my smartphone and oh shit, I still see the desktop version of the website. Guess what I did? Had some free time, watched html/css and CSS flexbox crash courses and tried to build it from scratch. (Okay, I was already familiar with HTML but CSS is my weak point).Here in this low-quality video you see the difference between the original and my version. I'm sorry, I used an old laptop for recording. Decrease the volume to not hear mouse clicks  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRnsHfZCLigP.S. I used flexbox, so I found it hard to implement the child board section, I guess I should have used a grid from the beginning.If you would love to challenge yourself, build a responsive version of bitcointalk with modern html/css techniques.Check the responsive version yourself on the device of your wishLive Check on GitHub static page",

Let's say you were to release this as some kind of mobile app. Very few people would feel comfortable to use it and enter their login data in the app. Even if the version was better than browsing Bitcointalk from a phone, you have not addressed things like quoting, multi-quoting, and replying to multiple people. Taking a long post, editing it to remove certain parts and only quoting and replying to certain parts of it. That still remains a pain in the ass no matter how you look at it. Working with tables, lists, multiple colors, images...",

      "body": "OP, that's a nice initiative. Unfortunately, something like that cannot be applied to the current version of the forum because it would require changing all the SMF template files from the backend. Your modifications could be implemented locally in the user's browser using Tampermonkey or similar userscript manager extensions if you could add JS functions that would replace the current HTML code with the new one.You can host your code for free on GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com/",
