Hence the question: do you know anyone who is successful trading in crypto? or are you doing well by trading crypto?You don't need to know which traders are successful in making profits in the market either in the short term or in the long term. Every trader has a different strategy from other traders [it can also be the same], logically if they don't make anything with their strategy then how do they live and keep trading with it?Profits can be generated as long as the trader is able to master the strategy of doing it right. The simplest trading conditions are to have funds, buy low and sell higher. Then you also have to understand that analysis is the one that is most needed to determine when you have to make an entry.",

Yes am into it am being successful, I don't stress myself with altcoins but i only invest with bitcoin which i believe almost everyone on bitcointalk also do by choosing bitcoin as priority over any other, i think you need to learn first before assuming judgement on anything and if you must learn then you should start with bitcoin.",

They are the ones making money.Exactly, I mean of course I don't have a reliable data to confirm however it is my feeling that a lot of people usually loose money on trading. Then I also see a lot of traders trying to sell their courses... there is one I've been watching (now I stopped watching his channel) who says he did millions on trading... and I think why then he needs to sell courses on trading?Another example from Twitter. A guy says in three years he did 10 million starting from 50k. And I see a lot of people following him... some very well known people in the crypto are also following him. So I am again asking myself, is this true story or this is just bulshit. Hence these questions. Anyway please share what do you think on trading.",

Because the more you stay on the market, the more lessons you learned and that's why capital is very important, capital preservation is a must.Because there is a lot of opportunities in the future, there is a lot more trade opportunity as long as you have the capital, so for me, the longer, the better.",

Because you're not making money from trading does not mean people are not making too. The truth is that trading is very risky and Mentally you have to be strong to even think of starting to trade. Invest what you can afford to loose and do not attach emotions to trading. Set daily loose or profit & follow it strictly. You can see my yesterday and today's experience in the image below.",

Note, that stat has been accurate for all types of investing long before BTC existed. YES you can make great money trading, you simply need to make better decisions than the people you are competing against. Helpful tip: Think \"Buy Low, Sell High\" and actually do it, you need to go against the crowd, calm down, save plenty of money for the next trades, and never \"come to the conclusion\" you will fall short of winning.",

I can say that I'm not really doing well in my trading job but at least I was still in the profit and this is because I don't lose hope and easily give up when having mistakes, instead I use this as my weapon to grow up and be careful in the next round. This can happen to you OP but it becomes impossible if you keep on rushing and always chasing a profit every day. You are just new to trading but you already saw the negative thing that will happen to you which is bad and it will influence your mind and that is how you draw conclusions about a thing that you've never given your best.",

Trading is the most profitable especially in the long run since your skills/knowledge will improve as time pass by. If you just wanna know successful traders, just go to youtube or TikTok, etc. You'll find tons of them as well as tips and tutorials. You'll gain knowledge from them as long as you are not too lazy to learn coz trading is not as simple as 1, 2, 3. It really takes time.",

Pro traders know this already due to the experience they have. Your friend is single. That's great but maybe you can advice him to diversify so that he won't lose that much. It's always better to have more money in hand. He may not be needing it now but he will regret it one day or by the time he already have his own family because he didn't save up and play carefully with his trades.@OP it's fine if you think that way. Maybe it's time for you to stop trading and find other alternatives which will perfectly fit better for you. Trading isn't just for all.",

Look at wall street and you will know what I mean, those people do not end up investing into things for just a day, and if they do daily trades which some of them do, they do not do it based on small mistakes that could become huge and bankrupt them, even the biggest ever 2008 didn't crash them, all of the continue.So that means the best thing we could ever do would be having a big capital to be a great trader, if that is not available to us then we shouldn't really have hopes about such things at all.",

There are limited people that can do the trade while making it as a living.

One thing he said to the others was, don't try it because it might not work for you since it took him almost two years to become a good trader.I can't imagine how much money and energy he needs just to go like full time traders like that but it's amazing although the risk was there you just need to work it out on how to play with those risk and the market.",
