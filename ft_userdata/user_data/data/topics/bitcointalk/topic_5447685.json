My telegram profile is mentioned on my bitcointalk profile.I don't think he was serious about his offer or that he succeeded in finding the profiles he was looking for. I sent him a private message on the same date the show was published, basically including the link to the telegram to continue the discussion about the details and he was active in the days following until 04-11 but he gave no sign of life. Perhaps he insists on communicating via the website's email, but there is no justification for this insistence if he is in urgent need of employees.I visited the forum and it does not seem very active and needs more attention. I edited many ideas regarding that forum and ways to develop it. I was going to put it up for discussion with him, but it seems that I was wasting my time.",

For the OP, if you no longer need the moderators and you read this, please lock the thread.",

It is not the first time that he has published an offer to request moderators for the forum that he launched. You can review his posting history and you will notice how many times he has done this in the same way.There are two possible reasons. The first is that he actually found moderators and forgot to close the topic, and this is what I doubt happened. The second reason that is more plausible is that he does not have enough budget for support and is in fact looking for potential partners in the form of looking for smoderators. There is no other reason for it to break off like this. I registered in his forum, but I can't know which member he is exactly so that I can message him there.",
