  "content": "Over time, a user's wallet may become cluttered with numerous UTXOs originating from various sources. At this point, the necessity arises to consolidate these UTXOs. I want to highlight a technique implemented in the Sparrow wallet that facilitates this process and, at the same time,  also preserving, and sometimes enhancing, user privacy. This technique is known as \"fake conjoin.\"Fake conjoin involves constructing a transaction within Sparrow wallet that imitates a typical batch transaction involving two parties. When consolidating funds in Sparrow, users should select a specific address to send funds, the value of which is slightly less than half the total sum of UTXOs held in the wallet. Then, by clicking the \"Privacy\" button located at the bottom-right corner of the Send window, Sparrow does the job.Sparrow automates the creation of a \"fake conjoin\" transaction by grouping UTXOs into two sets, mimicking two independent parties. This transaction consists of five outputs: two with identical amounts (999,974 sats in example on below picture), individually directed to the user's chosen address and a decoy address. Additionally, two outputs simulate the change for each party involved in the transaction, while the fifth output represents the transaction fee. Quote from: satscraperThe beauty of the \"fake conjoin\" UTXOs-consolidation-approach  with the use of Sparrow lies in its versatility; it can be applied to virtually any wallet. Personally, I have successfully utilized this technique to consolidate my holdings stored in Passport 2 hardware wallet, paired with Sparrow. Sparrow's intuitive interface guided me through the process effortlessly.P.S. For above instance the testcoins were used.Readings:1. Spending Privately2.StonewallUPD. People should never keep  questionable UTXOs with those ones that are not problematic in one wallet.",

When you create three of such outputs and send them one by one to separate addresses, it still looks like regular transfers from different people and can be considered relatively private transactions. But once these anonymous outputs appear in a single transaction, an observer concludes all those previous transactions were made by a single person, a person who used one or more mixers to anonymize his coins. Consolidation of coins almost always damages one's privacy and lowers the overall anonymity set, but this situation may change if we come up with a technology that will make multiparty transactions look like regular consolidations.",
