Short term or long term?If you're short term, you better cut your losses and save it from more possible losses because it's really possible that we may see it drop more.Otherwise, hold it and remove that worry of yours because the market always recover after all of these dumps.",

What happened at the Merge event was famous \"Buy the news, sell the rumors\". We saw Ethereum already running weeks before the big event and during and after the event, we saw a huge drop. This kind of action on the market is already aged especially there is a big positive news or event for some cryptocurrency and after the event, we always see a huge drop.",

But because this POS made ETH a target by SEC, it's going to take a lot of attack from SEC just like XRP which will make investors panic more and the price goes deeper. Since all crypto prices are also linked to BTC price, all crypto is dependent and waiting for halving which there are 2 more years before it.",

You don't deserve to invest in ETH. For me I will wait for eth to drop more than I will buy, the lower I will be glad I missed the chance to buy eth for 900$ because I expected a lower price.Indeed when the price is low it is a good opportunity to buy and the case you are experiencing is also felt by some people,investing in Ethereum is always promising and good for long term investment,the current market conditions are still bearish and this makes the price of the coin still go down",

But if you can still hold on, you can hold it longer while waiting for the price to increase again. The current decline is not only happening on ethereum but experienced by almost all coins. This is only temporary because there will be another bull run moment in the future. But I think a lot of people are still holding onto ethereum because they are still hoping to see ethereum rise higher again.",

It was not really expected until the end of the year that what kind of opportunity would arise. At this low price, you don't get to take advantage of an opportunity like this very often.Quote from: Lida93 on September 23, 2022, 09:47:15 PMAs am getting the feeling of withdrawing my asset before it gets worst or am I been too haste.Don't take risks you can't afford to lose. At worst, I believe that Q3 2023 will be the bottom. Though I expect worse, I will keep buying until the money runs out. As the final decision will be yours, you will be responsible for all outcomes. Cash is king for now, so keep that in mind.",

Because almost all coin prices are dropping. Perhaps what you can do is to trade short term thereby increasing your coin count while monitoring market movements. Maybe the price of ethereum will drop beyond the current price, because the bear market is still going on. If you sell it now, of course you will lose a little of your money from the previous purchase price.",

This should be the thinking of many, I don‚Äôt know why many are expecting that much where it fact, we cannot see the result of the merge days after that, it usually take time. With the current situation of market we cannot expect ETH to rise, let‚Äôs just see this price level as an opportunity to accumulate because ETH is still a good coin and it will pump once the market enters the bull market, for now let‚Äôs wait for that patiently.",

Even the merge didnt happen we should not have high hopes if we invest. Eth is an established coin and good to hold for long period. But if you cant stand seeing the price decreasing and you're too worried then it's up to you if you want to sell already to cut loss. But keep in mind that you'll never get back what you have lost if you already give up. Anyway it's not surprising if eth is turning downward since we're still in bearish season, Bitcoin and other major alts are not performing well too so dont think it's just eth.",
