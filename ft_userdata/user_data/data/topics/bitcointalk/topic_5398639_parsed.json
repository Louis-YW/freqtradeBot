  "content": "When you sign a multisig transaction currently, there is no indicator that appears which says how many signatures it has and how many are left. You only see that the Broadcast button is disabled (for lack of sufficient signatures). It is not obvious that the user has to export the transaction to the wallets of the co-signers to sign and broadcast it.It should be fairly easy to implement a text in the window that reads \"x/3 signed\" or similar (assume it's an n-of-3 multisig for this example, but its immaterial).Actually there is no reason for any wallet that supports multisig to not display something like this, given that the information is encoded in the Bitcoin transaction, but since this is the Electrum subforum and it has a woeful display of it, that's going to be the topic of this thread. Other wallets are off-topic here.",
