His friend Mike sometimes buys pizza from him for free as a friendly gesture. But delivery is not free. And Mike offered John to compensate pizza delivery cost by making him a donation in Bitcoin. John liked this idea. But how can they do this?John opens a crypto wallet, finds his Bitcoin address and sends it to Mike. Then John googles for something like \"10 dollars in Bitcoin\" and also sends the result to Mike. Mike does his part and gets amazing pizza paid in Bitcoin.It seems like a good idea, doesn't it?Of course does not. There are a lot of problems that might be not obvious at first glance.For example:- John does not have a crypto wallet and thinks it will take too much time to download it and understanding how it works- John might have a virus which replaces his Bitcoin address with hacker's address- John might not know how to convert fiat to crypto or get incorrect informationEtc.----------------------------------------------------The solutionIf we want cryptocurrency to replace banks, it must be convenient for people. Fortunately, DonateAnyCrypto has a solution. DonateAnyCrypto is a service that allows you to get donations in crypto easily. All you need to do is set your crypto addresses once in your Dashboard. Then, when someone wants to send you a donation, you just send them a link to your donation page, which you can grab from your dashboard. The person inputs an amount in fiat currency and is redirected to a payment page where the address for transfer and the amount in the selected crypto is displayed. After the payment is made, you can see the donation in your Dashboard.So, instead of following the steps above, John could just send Mike a link to his donation page and that's it.DonateAnyCrypto helps people to get donations in crypto as easily as pie. You can share your donation link anywhere and start getting donations in crypto from people all over the world.----------------------------------------------------Use CaseJohn is an ordinary college student who doesn't have any extra money. He fell in love with his classmate Kristine, but he never tried to tell her about his feelings because he was unsure of himself. He didn't believe that Kris liked him.One day, John heard Kristine talking about her dream of visiting California's Disneyland. She wanted to take a break from skyscrapers and experience something different.On one hand, John realized that this was his chance. Kristine was familiar with him; they worked together on college projects and spent time in a group of friends. If he suggested making her dream come true, she might agree. On the other hand, there was a money problem. How could he earn enough money for this?Fortunately, John had one skill that could potentially help him earn some money. He loved playing the guitar and was really good at it. But what was the plan?It was now or never. John decided to earn some money by playing his guitar in the subway. He saw two ways of getting donations: cash that people could drop in his guitar case and crypto. However, there was a problem with the second one. He could print out his Bitcoin address on a sheet and place it near him, but would anyone really want to spend a lot of time typing it on their phone? Especially when people were at work and couldn't linger. Well, John just grabbed a QR code to his Bitcoin address from his wallet and printed it out.This story has a long continuation. John was persistent and, after many days of playing in the subway, he was able to collect enough money to make something important happen in his life. However, all the money he earned was in cash. John saw that many people were interested in sending him crypto, but for some reason, they didn't do it.The huge potential idea of receiving donations in crypto for playing the guitar in the subway was unsuccessful. People found it too hard and time-consuming to send crypto directly by an address.If John had known about DonateAnyCrypto, he could have executed his plan much much faster. All he needed to do was sign up, set up his crypto addresses in the Dashboard, and grab a link to his own donation page. People could follow that link, enter the desired amount of fiat money they want to donate, and make a transfer within a few clicks or taps.The moral of the story is that having a good idea and working hard to achieve it may not be enough if you don't have the right tools to make it happen. In this case, John had a great idea of earning money by playing guitar in the subway and accepting crypto donations, but he didn't have an easy way for people to send him crypto. As a result, his potential idea was unsuccessful. The importance of having the right tools and resources to make an idea a reality cannot be overstated.People don't like difficulties. You type google.com instead of 64.233.177.138. Your bank card pin is only 4 numbers. You can place an order on Amazon in 2 clicks. Only simple-to-use technologies become popular.----------------------------------------------------PrivacyOne of the best features of DonateAnyCrypto is the privacy of users' crypto addresses. All the addresses added to the Dashboard are kept private.When someone wants to send a donation, they are given a new address, rather than the one you set in your Dashboard. After the transfer, the cryptocurrency is moved to a distribution address and sent to all of our users in a single transaction. Automatically. This makes it nearly impossible to identify who the address belongs to.----------------------------------------------------Available cryptocurrenciesAt this moment we support Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Zcash and Monero.----------------------------------------------------KYCWe are not a payment provider. We do not hold your crypto. That's why we don't need to ask you to do KYC.----------------------------------------------------PayoutsWhen someone sends you a donation, it goes to a new address. After six confirmations, the donation is sent to your wallet. Moreover, it is almost impossible to know the crypto address you set in the Dashboard because all transfers first go to a distribution address and then to their owners. This helps increase the payout transaction network fee and keep your crypto address private.----------------------------------------------------Widget for StreamsLet's talk about our uniqe feature for streamers. Imagine you're a streamer. Of course, there are many ways to monetize your content, but there is nothing specific for crypto. We have a solution!You can use our donation alerts widget on your streams.https://i.imgur.com/m5ltYoJ.pngThis widget integration time is just a minute. Here is a guide: https://teletype.in/@donateanycrypto/widget_integration. You just need to grab a special link from your dashboard, insert it into OBS or another streaming program, and then place your donation link in the description of your stream or another place. Now you're ready to get donations in crypto, which will be shown on your stream in real-time.----------------------------------------------------Be creativeOf course, you don't need to be a streamer to use DonateAnyCrypto. You can share your donation link with anyone else and get donations. There are many ways to use this service. Everything is at your disposal!----------------------------------------------------PricingDonateAnyCrypto is completely free. There is only a small commission for incoming donations, which you can see on our main page. There is no payout commission, only a network fee.----------------------------------------------------ConclusionDonateAnyCrypto is the first service for getting donations in crypto that has a huge potential. Join us now so you can proudly say that you knew those guys from the very beginning.----------------------------------------------------At the endThank you, and feel free to ask any questions here or contact us on DonateAnyCrypto.Always yours,The DonateAnyCrypto TeamP.S. You can also send a donation to our service  - https://donateanycrypto.com/donate/donateanycrypto.",

      "body": "I always like to see new ideas when the traffic is a cryptocurrency, but let me see if I understand correctly what you are doing here.You are here offering to facilitate a certain type of (donation) transaction. so user A with address A wants to transfer XX amount to user B with address B, but in order to simplify the provision of the receiving address and possible errors (caused by malware, for example) when sharing it, you included your service as an intermediary.So, there is no more risky and complicated \"address A\" -> \"address B\", now is much simplest and safest \"address A\" -> your portal (-2% fee) -> \"address B\".If someone still needs to share a link to the donation page, can't he do that in the same way that he will share his address directly? For example, the street musician can point out the QR code of his address which will be enough for potential donors to scan and send the amount they want while spending the same time as if they sent through your service.",

      "body": "Hi, @examplens.Yes, you're right about the purpose of our service.Let's discuss the situation regarding street musicians.What is the difference between directly placing your wallet address and using our service?Lack of privacy: When you place your address, everyone can see your activity. While you may argue that you are not doing anything illegal, it is not that simple. Firstly, everyone values privacy. We do not live in the open air; we live in houses with roofs, walls, and doors. You do not tell anyone where you live or your personal information.For example, suppose you transfer Bitcoin to an OnlyFans creator. Is it illegal or strange? No. However, you may not want to share this information with anyone else. Similarly, imagine a random person scanned your address three weeks ago, not to make a donation for you but because they work for a government organization that deals with taxes. After knowing this fact, you will probably never want to place your direct address again.Not every part of your private life needs to be public. Everyone needs privacy, which DonateAnyCrypto provides but cannot be provided by placing your address directly.Lack of convenience: If you want to get donations in ten cryptocurrencies, you need to post ten sheets. This may look funny. By using DonateAnyCrypto, you only need to place one.Currency conversion: If a stranger wants to send you $5, they need to convert it to your cryptocurrency. They need to Google it, ask someone, or take other actions that take time. It is unlikely that someone will want to spend too much time just to send a donation. While you may argue that popular wallets display the approximately converted amount from cryptocurrency to fiat, you still need to type any crypto amount first. For example, if you type 0.0001, this is $2.76. You want to send $5, so you either get the smallest amount because the person will not want to spend more time for calculation or get nothing because most people will not want to spend time for you. People want simplicity. By using DonateAnyCrypto, donors do not need to convert fiat money to cryptocurrency. We take care of it for you.In addition, donors can send you a personal message. Sometimes, unexpected things happen, and you may get a donation from, for example, the boss of a sound recording studio with a good special offer for you. Moreover, we have a donation alerts widget, which is super cool for streamers.These are the first thoughts that came to my mind.",

We appreciate your feedback about it.2) I'm not sure it's correct to compare DonateAnyCrypto and Thegivingblock just because the latter is only for nonprofit organizations.And also what came to my mind first:DonateAnyCrypto is for everyone, not just nonprofits.DonateAnyCrypto has a lower commission than Thegivingblock (Thegivingblock charges ~ 5% as Google said).DonateAnyCrypto doesn't require KYC.DonateAnyCrypto has cool features, such as a widget for streamers.DonateAnyCrypto has automatic payouts.3) We're a new and actively developing service. First of all, we decided to focus on functionality. Visuals are also important, but they are our secondary priority. If you don't believe it, you can find our first post on Bitcointalk. When we launched 116 days ago from the date I'm writing this, we had a different concept. We didn't have auto payouts, and we had higher fees. After that, we fixed our mistakes, and now DonateAnyCrypto is better than ever. We're growing, and everything is ahead",

I think you won't care for this small amount of spending.Hi, @shasan. Thank you very much for your interest in our service. We really appreciate it.Well, discussing the commission percentage is a good topic. However, the problem lies in the expensive nature of tracking transaction nodes. Therefore, maintaining a Bitcoin node, for example, requires at least 435 GB (phemex.com/blogs/bitcoin-blockchain-size), making it costly.Actually, we weren't even aware that the Bitcointalk forum had a paid membership. Now that we've found this information, we will consider it.Thank you very much!",
