The authenticity of a project was once placed on the reputation of the developers but this days Alticoin developers are just like social media influencers, some are actually used just to lure people into investing in the pump and dump projects. QuoteA good practice I will recommend for all expecially beginners is that they should invest mostly in Bitcoin as this is highly save for the future.I would say your 80% choice of bitcoin is actually a great one, although it is a personal decision I would even advice having a higher number than that or more or less treat the other 20% of the funds a gamble. Because even the top Alticoins are risky and even follow the same bitcoin trend. They increase in all most similar percentage as bitcoin, except on few occasions where the hype is high. But other than that the same gain most at times is the same. Many will say Alticoins have higher rate to increase but they should also consider that it comes down in same effect. So for cryptocurrency investment, bitcoin is the 100% save haven.",

Bitcoin has generally hovered around 40% of the global cryptocurrency market since May of 2021.Market cap is just a product of the total circulating supply multiplied by the price. I don't see why people are using market cap as a basis per se.I mean lower altcoin just means fewer people are buying the token, and vice versa. Bitcoin on the other hand has many buyers compare to all of the altcoins, so it's pretty obvious that it has a larger market cap.Quote from: odunybiz on July 10, 2023, 12:55:58 PMðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Difficult to determine use cases: It is not always easy to distinguish between different altcoins and their respective use cases, making investment decisions even more complicated and confusing.This is the problem with some altcoins out there.Even those top altcoins have the same use case like in the case of Ethereum, Cosmos, Cardano, Polygon, Binance where they have a smart contract feature where developers can create their own application thru the blockchain of these projects. On the other hand, there are some altcoins out there that has no use case at all, or if there is, it wasn't beneficial to the investors, and to the people.

This is also the reason why I'm focusing more on the top altcoins currently.

I know that there are some altcoins that became scam projects, but to say that altcoins aren't welcome here in the forum just because it's Bitcointalk? It's just an absurd thing to say TBH.",

      "body": "The most important subject to discuss between Bitcoin and Altcoins that Bitcoin is fully Decentralized and most of the altcoins are Centralized. Here some of my words about altcoins why it's risky: 1. Hard to choose altcoins for long term as it might scam you or may have no value in long term. I saw many altcoins which had created too much hype at the beginning and when time goes on they just started disappearing and not they have no value and delisted from every exchanges.2. Altcoins have different usecases like Defi, NFT . So need deep research to predict about it's potential growth.3. Altcoins aren't widely accepted like Bitcoin and many people aren't much conscious about Altcoins. So for the safest investment for long term I will suggest the only coin which is Bitcoin. Anyway some altcoins are doing good and have a bright future but we don't know is there something going to happen like Luna?
