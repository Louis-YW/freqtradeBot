But on exchange we are not charge such commission when we move fund around wallet within the exchange since it is and internal transaction so I don't know why brokers charge such a commission any ways.",

I reckon the profit margin they have per customer is rather minimal though, but they adapted to that by having more customers instead. I mean brokers were possible because they have their own methods, maybe even internal groups that let them have these kinds of methods.If they were shouldering risks, I doubt the existence of brokers would've even been possible. Well, they might have some other forms of risks that gambling itself may not have, not one so I can't really say but hey, I reckon there should be some sort, just not directly related to the gambling part itself. And as I've said, I reckon their profits are rather small as well so I guess that could be one risk.",

Worst scenario is that their clients would only complain and go and there is nothing one can do about it.Brokers do a whole lot to making sure their clients trade so in that case can go to any length to get their commission, fees and lots more based on the agreed terms for which both parties have reached. Unlike the brokers, Casinos are quite different and can not be compared to brokers but the both are business done for profit making. Casinos are set up for gamblers who play under probability of wining or losing their games however the case may be, it is either a win win thing or otherwise which gives the casino the opportunity to to make their gains from fees, loss from gamblers etc.",

You’ve hit the nail on the head regarding how both casinos and brokers operate in ways that inherently favor their own profitability. The house always aims to win, whether it’s in a casino setting or the brokerage industry. I agree with your points on commission fees, trading fees, and other means that contribute to their earnings.You bring up an excellent observation about the perception of casinos versus brokers. Many people indeed view casinos as outright money-draining establishments while viewing brokers under a more positive light. However, as you pointed out, brokers encourage frequent trading, which accumulates more fees for them, rather than promoting strategies like buy-and-hold that may be more beneficial for the investors in the long run. The transparency of these mechanisms certainly deserves more attention to ensure that all participants in the financial markets are on an equal playing field. Your thoughts add a significant depth to this conversation, and I appreciate your contribution.",

In fact, Only casino and other form of gambling is literal fighting with players using their bankroll.Thank you for sharing your perspective on this matter. Your point about the minimal commission rate charged by brokers for maintaining their operations and providing services to customers is valid, and I respect that insight. It’s essential to acknowledge the operational costs involved in running a brokerage, and indeed, they are not the same as casinos in terms of their business model and revenue structure.To clarify my stance, I'm not objecting to the legitimate and traditional operations of brokers who facilitate investments and offer a platform for trading. My concern is specifically with the growing trend of brokers adopting strategies that resemble gambling platforms, such as promoting high-frequency trading, tournaments, and other gamification strategies which encourage individuals to trade more than they might have intended to, often without a solid understanding of the risks involved. When brokers push for such practices, it blurs the line between investment and gambling, potentially leading to detrimental financial decisions for the average investor. My intention is not to undermine the role of brokers in the financial ecosystem, but to highlight and discuss these emerging trends and their implications for investors. Your thoughts contribute meaningfully to this dialogue, and I appreciate the balance they bring to the conversation.",

Because he has your money, it appears that he can lend it and earn a high interest rate—for example, 30%—but will only offer you 5%.As a gambler, you have your money and control it, whereas the casino controls the game on which you stake money. That is why gamblers frequently lose, and just a few people always win here.",

The more the brokers involved lesser is the actual odds you get.But sometimes in some cases, it's impossible to boycott the broker. You may not realize it but a large number of online gambling sites are entirely a broker who hosts every bets on other sites. Similarly most slots offered in all popular and otherwise site are from the same provider just being hosted on for commission.IRL, a broker might add services that may enable gamblers with perks like anonymity, hassle free gambling, easier access and assistance settling disputes.",

They don't care about the financial situation of any client, on the contrary, they even put out more and more promotions for people to continue day trading and as a result they spend the whole day losing money and paying those high fees and making the Broker very rich.
