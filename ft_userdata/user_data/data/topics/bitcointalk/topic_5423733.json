First as a new casino that just announced their presence here in the forum, their should have been more active in responding to feedback and questions from the thread already. And from what safari88 said there is already a bad attempt by the team to present a fake license and the team need to respond to that if their truly have anything to prove but to a great extent from the response gotten so far I think we should stay away from this casino for the time being to avoid being a victim of scam casino.",

You can check the website by clicking the license status button on the license html page that they are provided above. I provided the image below as proof that they are really listed as licensees on this license provide.The only question I have in my find is who the heck is Fair Gaming License provider? They only started last year and there’s no much info about the people behind it that do the audit for all the casino that they have an approval and seal of trust. Using a license like this will just make more doubt arise from user that doesn’t familiar on this rather than the typical Curacao and UK license.",
