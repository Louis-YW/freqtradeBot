Then certain players would not have a chance on the basis of the World Cup because their team is not good enough for that. Examples are Salah and Mane just to name a few. Since Messi became World Champion with Argentina, the prize will probably go to him again at the next election. But Messi was certainly not the best player at the World Cup. I personally thought Mbappe was much better, as witnessed by all his goals in the final and he has also become the top scorer.",

I think everyone here agrees that Messi should be the one receiving this award due to his win, and it's hard to contest this because he's been renowned as one of the most talented players to ever play in the field and he finally got his world cup win.",

I will vote for Mbappe,he did better than Messi in the world cup,he was the highest goal scorer and he is a determined player who has so much quality at his young age. Though,the ballon d'or is given to a player based on his achievement on that year and it happens that Argentina won the world cup with the help of Messi,meaning Messi deserves to win the ballon d'or.Messi is FIFA favourite player and FIFA, will be very happy to declare him the winner of this year.Messi has scored more goals than Mbappe,973 goals in his appearance on 1003 matches. He is also the highest ballon d'or winner. I guess Messi has come to his last state of winning,Mbappe will be the player we will be looking up to.",

But I don't know how you put the name Ronaldo?, I still confusing his name is still dominating after the controversy he made.

Out of the 7 matches Argentina played in Messi was the MOTM in 5 of them. In that final too Messi was a better payer than Mbappe. Mbappe was awful, like every other French player till they got the penalty. From the very first match of that tournament Messi was the difference maker for Argentina. He would play the midfield and help control the game, he would create chances, give assist to his players and also score. Mbappe score two penalties and a screamer in the final and all of a sudden he was better than Messi? Aside the world cup triumph where Messi was unarguably the best player in the tournament, hes also in a pretty good form for PSG with 27 G/A so far. PSG even struggle without him these days. Its always funny when you guys equate the highest goal scorer to the best player. Same way most people never rated Mane at Liverpool because Salah was the highest goal scorer so y'all thought he was the best player.",

Receiving an award is not just an individual performance but the team, country, club the player is associated with. Everything ranks up their public PR. Do you hear much name of Luka modrić or Robert Lewandowski? Because not many people from around the world is watching Croatian and Serbian leagues. As a county they are not as strong as Brazil, Argentina or France. Ronaldo made it exceptional for Portugal though.",
