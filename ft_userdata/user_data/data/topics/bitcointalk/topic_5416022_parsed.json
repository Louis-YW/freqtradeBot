This is common in Africa most especially because they have bad leaders. Did you know that a buried talented person in Africa have high chances to make use of his talent in countries like US, but rather the talent was buried in poverty nations. This could be because of not being educated or lack of exposure to the modern world.",

      "body": "So much of this is exploitative nonsense in a weak attempt by companies to justify paying slave wages. Â Not everyone can have a dream job no matter how much effort they put in or how qualified or skilled they become. Â Job markets are finite. Â Just because you learn something new, doesn't guarantee a position will magically open up for you to apply for. Â Or that you won't be competing with dozens of other applicants when such an opportunity does arise. And it's still no guarantee that you'll be rewarded for your efforts. Â Many people working in the health service as nurses or midwives spend years to become qualified to help save lives. Â No one would dream of calling those \"easy\" jobs, yet the government in my country still had the audacity to offer them a paltry 1% \"payrise\" (hint: Â if it's less than inflation, it's not a payrise). And the vast majority of jobs available are considered relatively \"unskilled\". Â But that doesn't mean they're easy jobs where you can simply coast. Â And all of the people making good money in highly paid jobs are always the first to complain if people in the service industry, notorious for sub-par wages, don't provide the service they are expecting. Â Ultimately, you get what you pay for. Â And too many companies are not paying their staff a living wage. Â There should be no such thing as \"in-work-poverty\". By all means, give yourself the best chances you can by being skilled and proactive, but it will not guarantee success in this current economic climate, where capitalism has been utterly bastardised and perverted by the ruling classes.",

To be updated with recent changes in how things are done. Right now, it's getting way difficult to find a job because there's a lack of manpower needed thanks to the internet and new applications that could do it all.

Although they contribute largely to the masses poverty but we also need to work on ourself to make a difference out of the bad economy.That is one of the major problem in our country. Citizens especially the poor always put the blame on the government. No government is perfect and there are always issues of corruption in all of its branches but we can't blame them for our personal status. We will remain poor if we'll not look for opportunities to earn and to change the path that we're taking. If we are poor now, we should find ways to improve our situation without relying on the government. The government can only provide us with temporary aid but they can't actually solve poverty completely. The change will start if we'll acquire skills and grab the opportunities that can take us away from the yolk of poverty. But if we will rely on our fate at the hands of the government, we will only remain poor forever. The government isn't always reliable, to be honest.",

For instance, the government, admit it or not plays a very crucial role in determining their country's poverty index. Less opportunities for education for instance, as well as the basic commodities like food, job, healthcare, and affordable cost of living which could be allocated, if not wholly provided by the government could cause much of its population to fall under poverty. Unequal opportunities brought about by such happenstances also causes poverty, you wouldn't blame a 6-year-old boy completely quitting schooling to sell recyclable trash only to cover up for his family's expenses, would you?",

I can reconcile their situation to lack of discipline. Money is intoxicating especially when you have lots of it, it is discipline that keeps you on your toes to ensure you make adequate use of money when you get them, to create cash flow for yourself (more avenues to making profits).",

The government has all to make the masses not to be in poverty but they put people into poverty yearly , they go into war and displacing of people and you lose your business and love ones and contacts so how do you survive or make yourself come out of poverty if you have manage to build some space of success already because they go into war. Look in Ukraine displace people don't have homes to stay, they find it hard to survive because of war in the area. It is the government having the responsibility to secure good environment for business for the masses and without this masses will be hard to leave poverty line.

Yes for me that is the main foundation that one should have. Besides that, there is such a thing as being consistent, that's also what I personally find difficult to do.

For many people even mortgages are a mystery until they come to use them and pensions might be the entire extent of their investment knowledge. However once you start getting a real interest in holding company stocks for the long term success, instead of trying to make short term easy wins, then you get a much better understanding of how the financial world works. It takes a lot of real research and absorbing so much new information but it can really set you up for long term success in many aspects of life.",
