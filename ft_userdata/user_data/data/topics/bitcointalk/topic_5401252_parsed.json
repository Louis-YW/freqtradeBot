  "content": "Warning for everyone to avoid wasting money on SATOSCARD SCAM!They are deleting my comments on their self-moderated topic, so I created one for free conversation.This is just rinse and repeat scam that was previously called CriptoDebit and they offered scam debit cards with same model.Quote from: SATOSCARD on June 03, 2022, 02:37:35 PMHi Bitcoin Talkers, We are SATOS a Virtual Debit Mastercard that can be used anywhere where Mastercard is accepted.

We offer debit cards that you can buy with cryptocurrency also you can register your card with any name you want. Of course, like the blockchain every transaction is recorded.

They revived the domain and hung this explanation there   Quote from: https://cryptodebit.comUPDATE: 01-06-2022Hello everyone, We are extremely sorry for the down-time.We have our domain back and we are restoring all files to continue our service and refund you where needed.If you have any questions please email us via: info@cryptodebit.comBackstory: We were sued by the copyright owner of the word \"crypto\" and they got a court order to seize our domain. Lucky we were able to come to an agreement and buy the name \"crypto\".Now we are waiting for our hosting company to release our engrypted servers and restore our service.Archive: https://archive.ph/rRMmVWho is all this nonsense intended for?It is obvious from such a statement that CryptoDebit was a scam and SATOSCARD is likely the same, since they have confirmed that they are related. There are over 2000 matches for the word \"crypto\" in the Companies House @ GOV.UK database. So to say that someone sued them for copyright infringement on the word \"crypto\" is wholly absurd.",

Normal, if they presented themselves as scammers nobody would fall into their trap.The only thing I feel bad about is that many times someone naive and innocent falls into their trap, because all of us who have responded here know that it is a scam and we will not fall for it.",
