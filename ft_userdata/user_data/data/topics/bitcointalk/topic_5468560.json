Your last thread should have already given you the answer to your question.Since the creation of your last thread, the number of negative trusts increased instead of what you expected (which was to decrease the number or possible remove it). I'm sure that if you continue to spam the reputation board by repeating the same question that has already been answered then more neg-tags will follow.tl;dr at the current stage, you're in, you can't get those that tagged you to remove them.",

The only people that can remove your trust are the people that tagged you. You need to appeal to them.

The account who sent the negative trust is the only one who can change it. It was rather recent (August 2023), I dont think you are going to get anything fruitful right now. Obviously, defrauding a campaign by enrolling alt accounts is a grave mistake because you are stealing from the campaign stakes that would be meant for someone else.Dont take the easy way out of creating a new account but instead be active on the forum and avoid any campaigns for now. After maybe 6months, appeal for a review of the tag.Tough luck though, I doubt they would remove it. But you deserve it for what you did.Also close your old thread. Dont keep multiple threads open in this section for the same agenda.",

OP I wish it is possible that the whole community could remove your tag but its not the reality. The only people that can do that are the people that gave you the tag and that was done as a result of an act you have displayed here which is very questionable and stands to be a potential threat to members who know nothing about it here. Your apologies here is okay but you will possibly have to appeal to those who gave you the tag if they could reconsider and remove the tag from you but you will have to grow up mate.",

So I would say that all the negative trust you got are deserved and in order to change that it would take much time to prove you have changed and understand following BTT rules is the better option for you.If you really want to upgrade and start a new page, try to be a good member in this forum by helping others and posting good content, after some time if those members who gave you the negative trust saw the change and felt you are really doing you best to change they will surely change their mind and give you another trust.I wish you good luck fixing you previous mistakes nothing is impossible.",

I think you need to prove your sincerity if you want to make things better. I saw one member who had a negative tag but was accepted into the signature campaign because even though he had a negative tag, he was still actively discussing for a long time on this forum even though no one paid him. If you can do that, maybe you have a second chance. But I'm not sure you can do it. I'm also a little surprised why @nutildah still gives you a neutral tag, because he is an expert in looking for farm accounts. There are lots of great people here, so if you intend to cheat then you have to be smarter than them, if you can't then it's better to be an ordinary member, no need to be greedy by creating lots of accounts because that will end badly.Think positively mate, and prove that you can improve this situation. It will definitely be good for you in the future",

Are you really sure that these tags are left in inappropriate way that you wish to delete them?I'm sure that these tags are correct and that's why one of these tags is left by me.

Trust me. There's no chance for your red trust to be removed, and I believe that instances like this will happen in the future again. I expect more DT members to give a neutral trust first to those who are using AI, and if they still continue to use it, they'll be given a negative trust.The question that comes to my mind is: This is the first time that we've seen a DT member giving out a red trust to somebody because of using AI. Are we saying that these plagiarism detecting websites are accurate enough to tell which are AI made post, and which are not?
