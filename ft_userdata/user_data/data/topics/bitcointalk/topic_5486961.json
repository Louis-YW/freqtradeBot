Plus they don't have to rely on exchanges, and have to take full responsibility of their funds, means now they have some insurance of there funds as they are keeping there funds on platform approved by governments.This will change the mindset of traditional people thus the traditional fiat system will also be impacted by it, people will tend to invest there money in BTC ETFs now, while before approval they don't consider it as a good investment even if they are aware of the good benefits of it.",

As the value of their Bitcoin reserves increases, the dollar value of their proof of reserves also rises.The rise in the price of Bitcoin is a good thing for everyone or institution that is hodling Bitcoin. No doubt some exchanges are transparent in the manner they run the business. But it is also important to state that some exchanges might not hold the amount they claim they have. Some of them publish incomplete or even doctored financial statements just because they want to prove to customers that they are healthy. It will be better to keep your funds in a non-custodial wallet than on centralized platforms.

More banks have begun to offer crypto-related services such as custodian, exchange, and other offers. In the future, we might see more banks invest more in Bitcoin and as well as offer wider services. Some banks might start accepting Bitcoin as collateral for loans because of the currency's influence in the global financial system. Very soon bank customers might be given options to receive payment in fiat or cryptocurrencies.",

Of course, if you want to potentially maximize exposure you can do things like long perps with leverage, but then risk/reward gets bad because of potential liquidations due to extreme volatility.As for impact, stretch the timeframe long enough then it's likely that gold will get less market share in terms of SoV.",

This means any effect it could have had on price, has already happened 2 months ago (February is already over too!).QuoteThe launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs provides an easier way for mainstream investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. I disagree with this too.Because unlike other stuff that have an ETF, it is not hard at all to buy, trade and own bitcoin. Take gold for example. It is difficult to purchase large amounts of gold (it is physical) it is extremely difficult to trade it (physically) and store it safely. This is not true about bitcoin. All you need is a digital wallet (or even a hardware wallet).So ETF is NOT an \"easier way\" to gain exposure to Bitcoin, it is a terrible way that can only be useful for those who don't want to leave the centralized world and instead of buying bitcoin they want to buy a garbage that is promised to be linked to bitcoin!",

That means one can liquidiate with Futures ETF but not with Spot.. This means there is still more to come for Bitcoin.Do you trade futures?",

I've not been able to enjoy OKX to my taste and I still mention them too. So people who wanna ignore are free to do so. Moreover, I never try to force anyone here to signup on the exchange.

Not all bitcoins and cryptocurrencies in their treasuries are from their own money but majority of these assets are from their customers. They only play as custodians for their users and have to secure their vaults to avoid hacks. They also must handle those assets carefully and don't use those assets wrongly like Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX exchange.They can improve their reports and audits to customers but like Tether company, there are always doubt about those companies and their actual reserves.",

BTC was trading around $40k or so when the approval was made and in less than 3 months of approval, we can all see what is happening with BTC now above $60k and halving is still around the corner. Lots of institutional adoption is also taking place not forgetting individual adoption. As regards the trust about CEX, I think they still plays a great role in the industry an we have seen a couple of them adhering to government regulations to ensure users have absolute trust in them.",
