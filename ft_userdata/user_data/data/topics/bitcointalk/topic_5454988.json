  "content": "I have not experienced what I experienced today in Electrum Wallet. When I woke up in this morning June 3rd, 2023, I decided to check my wallet, when I login I saw 0.05+BTC instead of  0.066+BTC and transactions were going on which I saw it with my naked eyes. Immediately fear grabbed me, so I called a friend immediately to come over. And before my friend came, I clicked on the transactions which was written \"Local\" meaning the transaction is still within the locality and it has not been broadcasted so I should broadcast it. When I saw the two options to handle the issue, which was bump fee and Remove. I immediately I clicked remove in all the transactions and the wallet balance increase to 0.060+. My mind was not yet okay. So has my friend came we were all wondering who was trying to hack the wallet. We think all ways, and my friend suggested to update the wallet and see what would happen. So I went to google play store and typed Electrum and it pop up with, \"cancel and update\" and I clicked update and as the update finished, I checked back the wallet and the total amount of bitcoin came back to 0.066+BTC. Then my mind calm down. So I am also advising users of Electrum Wallet to update their wallets time to time to avoid cyber attack.",

      "body": "I doubt your wallet had been hacked. If your wallet was hacked, the hacker would steal all the fund and broadcast the transaction. Why should the hacker make a transaction sending only 0.016 BTC while you have 0.066 BTC? Why didn't the hacker broadcast that transaction himself?

      "body": "I'm sorry, but it seems that your wallet wasn't simply updated with the latest transactions. Did you log in a long time ago? If yes, that's probably your issue. If you hadn't logged in after those missing transactions were conducted, there's a decent chance that the wallet wasn't simply showing them yet. It's only a visual issue; your money never left your wallet; it just wasn't in sync. Perhaps your wallet wasn't connected to the right server or node either. That's what I at least understood from what you wrote.Personally, I never had any issues with the Electrum wallet; I hadn't logged in since March and logged in just for the sake of this post, of course, and more than 20 transactions were missing because it wasn't synchronized. After a few minutes of synchronization, everything returned to normal.",

I have an outdated electrum wallet and never experienced this kind of issue. There’s no way that a hacker will do this because how dumb he is for not transferring all your balance and didn’t use the highest fee to make this transaction quickly.I’m confused on how the transaction has a feature of bump fee and remove since you can’t remove it once there’s a bump fee option because it was already unconfirmed on blockchain. I assume you just make an old transaction which you forgot to enter your password when you are gonna pay.",

What I'm trying to say here is the unconfirmed status on a blockchain explorer. Nice to have additional knowledge that mempool is still not part of the blockchain. I'm always confused about the role of the mempool with blockchain and always assume that they are both functioning as one which is the storage of all the transactions unconfirmed and confirmed.

A hacker wouldn't just send themselves 0.016 bitcoin when they could have taken the entire 0.06. It's more likely that this is an old transaction that you were about to make but didn't complete so it's simply saved and showing up now that you've opened your Electrum wallet again.However, if you still have the feeling that you device isn't secure enough, it would be a good idea to do a full reset of the OS and reinstall Electrum. This will help ensure better security. For an ideal idea, you could consider using an air-gapped device and operate your bitcoin from there:)",
