But if you're optimistic on them and you're seeing that there's a chance and possibility. I wish you good luck on that, I've seen how this token became popular before because of their mobile mining.Then, it has come to an end and lie low and now they're trying to revive it with that ETN20. I don't know that they've come up to that but then, it's your thought that counts on that project and your money.",

I will advise you to sell it and hold Bitcoin but if you're a potential cheap coin you can check Combo since it's listed on Binance.",

However, this does not only stop when they released their roadmaps concerning their plans because consistent updates and development are needed as well so that the project will be fully recognized by the mass. Therefore, if you know what you are doing concerning investment in this project, just don't forget to give yourself time to review it and not gonna hype yourself to invest more than you can afford to lose.",

I guess there is always a resurrection and I am hoping that the people behind it will make sure they know what they are doing and that they can achieve their goals especially to people they promised to. Anyway, there are now far better projects available on the market with more exciting future so if I were you I would be focusing my eyes on them...just my humble suggestion.",

Never touched it nor using it as a utility. I just simply hold them not because I am bullish in their project until now. It’s just that the value is way down than what I have initially bought from 2017. Unless they are going to do something that keeps up with the trend, probably they would be making one more noise especially for ETN token holders.",

The market is full of layer 1 and 2 projects that it will be hard to get such recognition as before, they had the opportunity to be big but they blew it, and now they will have to fight real hard to be relevant again.",

As for a marketing man i don't think I would post here thinking it would make the coin fly!!! I was told about the site to look at as I am into crypto. I just read on there facebook about the new blockchain and I think this could be a good investment  so am asking people thoughts to find out more info. Seems to be pretty negative on past performance but this new plan they have sounds like they are really trying hard so I still think it could be good looking forward rather than back.",

I decided to hold their tokens, and as a result, out of the initial $10,000, I had about $300 left. At the beginning of 2023, I sold all ETN tokens. I believe this is not the best project to invest in due to the lack of team activity and lack of project promotion. This is not a financial recommendation, just my opinion!",

Bitcoin at the time was worth 4500 dollars it then peaked at 60000 a coin now at 30000 so unless they cashed it all which I highly doubt they have a HUGE  budget.....I tell you something is going to happen here I just feel it....",

I just took a look at the the price and volume graphs of Electroneum and it really was a active project back then with 10 M $ daily trading volume.Now it is pretty dead though in my opinion with a daily volume of only 33k$. I mean being mineable on a smartphone is not really that big of a bonus right? It just means that everyone that has a phone can install the electroneum app and gets coins then. This creates a lot of selling pressure.I personally would invest in an other project.",

Done both the virtual and real mining. It's all a good concept and solid coin with a large community. They failed to keep up the hype after their initial listing. And they were not as attractive to mine during the GPU price hike as other cryptonight coins. Although not much oscillation in the price, I still believe it's a good coin to accumulate for the next bull run.",
