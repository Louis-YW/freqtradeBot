I think if you have some guidance there you would be much more likely to get people contacting you to try and arrange a sale. Hope that helps. Good luck finding your coins!",

Most of the scams happen when the deal is really good and the victim rushes to complete the deal without performing the necessary checks. Good luck with the purchase! I’m happy to make a deal for a Casascius that is not really good and can take as long as needed if OP wants to make sure they’re getting a legit Casascius coin. Seriously though, I still have no idea what the offer for a 1 BTC brass Casascius coin is but I do have one that I’d be willing to sell for the right price. Feel free to reach out to me with offers OP. I have all the different years and 2 types of the 2011 coins.",
