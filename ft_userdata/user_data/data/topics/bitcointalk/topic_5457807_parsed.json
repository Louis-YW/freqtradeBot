      "body": "Is this another memecoin? Lol, a token launched by bitboy must be a joke. After so many people got scammed by Celsius lead to the platform by this social influencer, he should have slowed down, but it seems he didn't get embarrassed in anyways and launched another strike of greediness on crypto enthusiasts thinking on personal gains and throwing all his followers on the fire in order to achieve his financial goals, just like it happened when referring people to Celsius.I hope in 2023 investors are more careful and aware about the risks of following digital influencers who build their portfolios luring naive investors to shady platforms and tokens.",
