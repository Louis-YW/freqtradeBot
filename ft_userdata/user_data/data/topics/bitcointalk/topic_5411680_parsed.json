Those pages (again, not mine and I'm not affiliated either) tell actual experience with some trading bots and may be of help to get an idea.The page is https://tradingbot.info and on top-right area you'll see a drop-down with ResultsHowever, make sure you take all precautions when working with trading bots and keep in mind that it depends on their programming, the settings you add and the market conditions whether they'll make you profit or make you lose money.",

      "body": "I assume you are talking about grid trading in crypto, so yeah i am still testing it and to be frank i actually have most of my focus on it nowadays. At start it looked easy but once I get into it damn it just goes deep and deep. The strategies in it are very different which make sense(i mean it is different). But it can also backfire but what i feel is, the risk involved in it much less than doing like future trading like normally. It do involves skills too not like those videos u might have seen where it will seems like magic and profts all the time, like it has its own strategies and most importantly there are so many options which can be very confusing.Although one warning i will give is some services give u late stats like bot being profitable for 24 hours or something like that, most of them give the stats after bot runs for more than 24 hours which can be useless as most of the time, by the time you create your bot looking at that you are already pretty late.Now i am involved in mostly future trading bot, i don't bother with spot trading bot, i mean i don't involve with spot trading in general anyway.So in future there are mostly three type of bots long, short and neutral. Now long short are obvious they create grid in the single direction while neutral which create grid in both directions like buy orders on one side and sell on other. My recommendation is to stick to neutral grid and just test with little money. The most important thing in it is volatility as when price fluctuate it works best, the ideal situation will be sideways market. But like with everything in crypto it will seems easy at first but to make consistent good profits you have to test yourself.",

It is quite nice but there is some part I don't understand.Was that by any chance Kucoin grid bot?Personally I used a few trading bots but none of them ended up being profitable in the long-term, I had some very short-term gains here and there but it usually lasted a few days max and once volatility became too much bot would start making less and less % and eventually position would get into some loss.My guess is that these bots could work out better in a less volatile pairs/markets so maybe cryptocurrency is not the best option for those automated bots and Forex pairs like AUD/CAD, AUD/USD and some other pairs that don't move up and down that much in a short period of time are a better option, but for trading bots to be profitable in such pairs you got to find a platform with lowest fees since movements are small so are the gains.",

But after I pos this thread, I terminate those bots, for now, I want to research more to know how they really work and analyze too.",

That is, you tell that if the price goes down by so much, then I will put buy orders and sell as soon as I make a profit.Grid Bot trading is actually a systematic trading which called Grid Bot trading.Grid Bot Trading facilitates you to set within a particular price range, Within this price range your buy orders will also be placed and your sell orders will also be placed automatically.everything will be automatic.",
