More like pouring salt on injury. I stand to be corrected, but stopping Ukraine from joining the alliance was Putin's aim of invading them, right? Where then does this action leave him? Probably take further drastic actions or will he be forced to back off?According to NATOs article 5 defense clause, it states that all allies are to come to the aid of another in a case of threat to it's territory, but since Ukraine's move was abrupt, will this count? When the NATO was created in 1949, it's purpose was to ensure prevention of expansion of the Soviet union, but with the Soviet union collapsing in 1991, Putin claims that the then President of Russia, Gorbachev was promised by the US that NATO will not head East. Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe and has access to the Black Sea which has borders connected to the East and Putin believes that should Ukraine succeed at their intentions, Russia becomes easy to access. I'm wondering if this act by Zelensky was done out of desperation or if by it, Putin might be forced to retreat.https://www.euronews.com/2022/09/30/ukraine-announces-bid-to-join-nato-after-russia-annexes-four-ukrainian-regions",

Putin is a delusional megalomaniac and he drives this war. It's easy to blame it all on NATO expansion, forgetting that there was a pact between Ukraine and Russian that Ukraine would hand over its nuclear weapons to Russia and in return Russia would treat it as a separate country and resign from all claims towards its territories. Putin broke this agreement because he wants this war. He may say all he wants about NATO expansion but it's in fact his expansionism and his lies that are responsible for more than 100k dead people.",

They rushed without ''liberating'' full territory of these regions because Ukraine started counteroffensive operation.Ukraine application to join NATO unfortunately won't change anything. It won't happen in day or two. And I don't even believe that Ukraine will be accepted, especially when it has to be done with all members consent..Ok, let's say there was agreement that NATO wint expand to the East. But Russia become security threat for Eastern European countries and it changessituation. BTW, I just thing called Budapest memorandum when Russia, together withUK and USA agreed to give security assurance when Ukraine agreed to destroy their nuclear weapons. Did Russia followed agreement?",

      "body": "One of the main reasons for the outbreak of this war is to reduce the influence of NATO, which is now carrying out military maneuvers with Ukraine on Ukrainian lands near the border with Russia. America and NATO are attracting Ukraine after they noticed that Russia is regaining its strength after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and they could have annexed Ukraine since the nineties, but they did not imagine that Russia's strength would be increased so quickly.",

      "body": "Wasn't Ukraine's wish to join NATO the cause of this war in the first place? Ukraine has been trying for years to join NATO, since 1992 to be exact, and Putin has warned against having NATO at his borders. Surely, he's a mad man, but his concerns are understandable on the one hand. On the other hand, I see Putin being a whole lot more aggressive towards the West when it comes to being bordered by a NATO country than NATO itself. Regarding Russia's viewpoint, there are two versions. The more common and well-known perspective in the West is that Russia is and has always been an expansionist state, and that Vladimir Putin is the personification of that fundamental Russian ambition: to establish a new Russian empire and revive the former Soviet Union.On the other hand, the opposite viewpoint contends that Russian security worries are legitimate and that Russians perceive NATO's eastward expansion as hostile to their nation. Putin has made it obvious for many years that if the expansion were to continue, the Russians would probably put up a strong fight, possibly even using force.Even if Ukraine supposedly joined NATO now, they still can't interfere militarily for a long time frame, if I remember correctly. On top of that, as others have already suggested, Ukraine is unable to join NATO during a state of war. I fully comprehend that they wanted to distance themselves from Russia and Putin's threats, but in the end, was it worth it?",

I beg to differ on that opinion of yours. If you had understood what I was trying to pass is that I'm wondering what Putin has to say on Zelensky action. Naturally, as a mentally ill dictator as you put it, he would try every possible means to win the war but it seems Ukraine keeps outsmarting him.  Besides, I'm quite aware his OCD problem is making him see NATO as the threat",

They would have taken the whole country if not for the resilience and doggedness of the Ukrainian people. The loser here is Putin as he obviously didn’t envisage his invasion would be met with such great resistance. The prolonged war has weakened the morale of his soldiers and the recent mobilization of citizens into the army has him losing the support of the populace. The goal was to rebuild the Soviet Union and keep NATO and the west as far away from its borders but the recent application put forward by Ukraine is yet another brave act of defiance.",

Because they are smart enough (finally) to look at their own history, and that of the so-called free world.Force doesn't work. Free trade does.The reason why the US is trying to conquer Russia is the two kinds of money systems involved. The US money system doesn't have anything backing it. But the Russian system (at least now) is backed by gold.The US trades debt. Russia trades real value.If the US doesn't conquer Russia, its (the US's) debt-backed money system will be destroyed, and the US will become a has-been. Why? Because people don't realize that using US money is trading in debt, and that the debt is a fake debt... meaning there isn't any value in the US money system. If they realized it, they would naturally get out of using it.Getting the Ukraine to join Nato is only another method the US is using to attempt to destroy Russia.",
