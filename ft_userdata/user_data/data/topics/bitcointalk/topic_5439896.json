Find AI written posts on this campaign and report to me either in public or in forum PM, please be sure you have enough reference to support the claim. For successful report the reporter will receive the weekly payment instead of the accused campaigner. The campaigner will be removed immediately.So if you a teacher or bounty manager, how to detect the deception?.1. https://gptzero.meThis tool was made by Edward Tian, a student at Princeton, AS, to analyze text to determine generated by AI or not.2. https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifierThis tool is made by openai self, Requires a minimum of 1,000 characters, which is approximately 150 - 250 words.Those 2 tools is just example, you can find more toll itself on google.",

Sometimes, those AI bots can give us lying answers that are not good for using if we do not mind to do our own research to check their answer accuracy.In Bitcointalk, I don't think ChatGPT can help shitposters so much and I believe they can only provide very generic answers, not to the point of discussions. In spam discussion topics that are generic in idea, they can help shit posters but in good discussion topics, I believe those bots can not help.Those bots can generate long posts that are not useful at all and we can report those posts if we see they are spam or have no value.https://originality.ai/https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/",

But I was worried that very soon humans will fail to work hard to achieve success. The result was clear because most of them couldn't defend the work during the presentation.I think we need these tools to check these cheats that want to earn without putting any effort. These tools might not comprehensively dictate these abnormalities, but they could at least find some of them.",

      "body": "Sometimes 100% Plagiarism is not detected by AI Generated Written contest detector. Sometimes it gives wrong results. Today I did not get 100% result while checking AI content and Human Written content with a content written by me. But it is not that which will give wrong result all the time.Quote from: NicNacCoin on February 15, 2023, 03:09:58 AMWhy are we all so interested in bitcoin, the answer to this question will be different for each person but for me the answer to this question will be my own. I got into Bitcoin around 2017. At that time I didn't know much about Bitcoin and I couldn't find anyone to help me at that time. But now I have learned a lot with the change of era.One of the main reasons behind investing in bitcoins is the potential for profit, if you invest in bitcoins in a bear market and if you hold your invested bitcoins for a certain period of time, then you are sure to have a chance of getting profits from your invested bitcoins.Another thing in my case is that I'm a small gambler, I use bitcoins for daily betting. Moreover, Bitcoin is a privacy coin for casinos and betting sites. The privacy you need for all these tasks is only possible with Bitcoin. So many people including me choose Bitcoin for gambling sites.Moreover, an important advantage is that if you want to trade in Bitcoin, you won't find more advantages than trading in Bitcoin.I check the above text with plagiarism checker on two websites. Two types of results show on two websites.I am unsure which one to take.https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/ this website provide me below result...https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier this website provide me below result.First website provide me I am 86% Human Written content...but second website provide me my content AI Generated.",

      "body": "I don't think those links you provide are going to give a 100% result. Because from what I can tell they are going to base their result on how correct the English is and also how punctuation marks were used in the text. So if a user that really knows how to write in correct English explicitly you will see that those AI detectors will classify them as bit also.  Here's an example of what I'm trying to say;I took a post made by Hilariousandco, his posts were among those I studied when I newly came to the forum. Here's the postQuote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436662I need someone in the USA to do me a quick favour. It involves renting/streaming a feature film online on the Sundance website and taking a few screenshots of the end credits ie cast/and crew. A video would also do if you prefer that. You need to be a US resident as they're blocking proxies (unless you know how to bypass that. If you can figure out a way I can do it online I'll just give you the $10). You don't need to watch the film just skip to the end credits and take a few screenshots. The film costs $20 and I'll give you an extra $10 for the help so $30 in total. It takes a few minutes to sign up and then probably a few mins to take a few screenshots. If you're interested just send me a PM. Thanks.And this is the result from one of them.Source: https://app.gptzero.meSo you see now that it's still going to proof difficult to spot AI written text even with those detectors provided in Op.",

      "body": "Yes, there are some tools out there that you can use to check if ChatGPT i used to generate text. But, here's the thing - from what I've seen, no AI detector is anywhere near perfect. Sometimes,Â  these tools can say something is copied when it's actually original, or miss some copied parts. So, if you really want to make sure that the text is legit, it's not a good idea to rely solely on these tools.To be on the safe side, if you want to make sure that the content is unique and not copied from elsewhere, it's a good idea to use multiple methods for verifying its originality. In addition to using plagiarism checkers, you could try searching for similar content using search engines, or manually comparing your text to other sources.",
