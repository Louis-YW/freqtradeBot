  "content": "Let's say one has multisig wallet which requires n valid signatures to sign transactions. What is the probability to loose coins the wallet holds in the case of loosing  at least one private key required for signature   when each key has its own probability  to be lost?My solution Let's Pi is the probability of loosing key with the  index of i , i= 1.....nThen the probability of not loosing it is 1-PiAllowing independent events for key loosing we get the following expression for the probability that i keys all together  will be never   lost: ∏i=1..n(1-Pi) Then target value is P= 1 - ∏i=1..n(1-Pi) where ∏ - multiplication operatorIs my calculation correct?",

If the wallet is a N=M wallet, the wallet will be lost with only one missing key though but I think it's also important to have an idea of the probability of losing at least one key even if it doesn't lock the wallet, in order to take better decisions when we use SLIP39 for example. When we share keys in several locations, the probability of losing them is not identical in each location.@satscraper It would have been more clear with one example with real numbers but for me you're right, your formula is good.But do you know one to calculate the probability of losing at least N keys out of M ?For example if I have 3keys of a 2 of 3 wallet, what will be the probability of losing at least 2keys?PL2K = P1P2 + P2P3 + P1P3 + P1P2P3But it's not a general formula unfortunately.",
