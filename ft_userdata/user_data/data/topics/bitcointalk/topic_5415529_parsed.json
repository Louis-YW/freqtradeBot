      "body": "If you're a regular user and use one of the many established wallets (e.g. Bitcoin Core, Electrum or hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger) without trying anything weird like handcrafting a Bitcoin transaction you don't need to worry about lattice attacks. The last time such attacks have happened to regular users was (afaik) in 2013 when one of the Android wallets didn't use a proper RNG leading to a predictable k which in turn made the private key derivable. All other cases seem to be mostly companies and developers either rolling their own crypto or working with signature generation in an unsecure manner that a regular user usually does not get in touch with.For reference:https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn20-66-lattice-attacks-on-ethereum-bitcoin-and-https",

If you don't want your Bitcoin stolen, it's suggested to use popular open source software/hardware which likely already audited by security/cryptography expert.Quote from: krashfire on September 30, 2022, 07:04:31 PMDearest Experts...
