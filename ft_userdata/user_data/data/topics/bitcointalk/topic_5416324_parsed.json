      "body": "It's definitely a scam and certainly not from Coinbase. There are many scams targeting cryptocurrency traders and investors, unfortunately. The phishing scam is one of the most common types, because it uses a fake email address that looks legitimate. It's easy for scammers to get you to click on a link and enter your login credentials into their website, which they can then use to steal your crypto. The email will tell you to click on a link, but don't do it! The link will likely take you to a fake website that looks just like Coinbase but is actually an imposter site designed to steal your login credentials. Another type of scam will take you to a fake website, tricking you into thinking that you are signing up for a legitimate exchange. They'll show you a large balance in your account, but you won't be able to withdraw it. The scammers will then ask you to send them some of your crypto (to cover \"transfer costs\" or \"taxes\") in exchange for a larger amount of money. Once they receive your coins, they'll tell you there was an error and will ask for even more money. Until one moment you no longer hear from them.",

Good, you are quick to respond about malspam emails, you act fast and think fast to solve it.I often read and see Coinbase users who receive phishing emails, so Coinbase made a warning.Do not trust malspam emails disguised as messages from Coinbase.QuoteIn most cases, phishing emails are sent by scammers who attempt to trick recipients into providing sensitive, personal information such as credit card details, login credentials (e.g., username, email address, password), social security numbers and other details. Most are disguised as official, important messages from legitimate companies, but these bogus emails should never be trusted.As well as Coinbase, providing a way for its users to overcome and protect themselves from Phishing email attacks.Warning:Thousands of Coinbase Users Hit by Phishing Attack -- Here's How to Protect YourselfFor that in the future, both you, me and other users, be careful of incoming emails, especially emails that we don't know or are suspicious of whether it's on behalf of an exchange or the like, hopefully things don't happen that are not wanted.",

I think you should be careful and check whether someone is selling your data or not (even if that's going to be difficult. E-mail is pretty easy to find but a phone number is a different story IMO. Btw, most e-mail providers will filter out spam like that so if it was sent to your main inbox, maybe you should check your spam filter.",

It's weird if you don't share your email publicly unless you signup for some scam sites like cloud mining.Most of websites right now have privacy policies so if you signup or subscribe to well-known websites you shouldn't receive a phishing email. It would be better if you put it to spam and block or mute the email so that you won't receive another email from them.",

That's how they easily make us fool since the email seems original, but it's spoofed. When you reply it will go through other channels. Just ignore. I have received a lot of similar mail even from Binance mail. I don't bother even checking it. Just mark them spam and ignore them.",
