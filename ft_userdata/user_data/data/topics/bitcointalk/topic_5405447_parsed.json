  "content": "About a week ago another war economy sets of measures have been imposed on RF citizens and business:https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-donetsk-governor-urges-evacuations-amid-russian-offensiveQuote businesses will be required by law to supply goods and services necessary for conducting the “special military operation” to the armed forces.QuoteDuma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said further discussion would be held behind closed doors due to national security.Quotegovernment to require employees of certain enterprises producing goods and services needed by the Russian military to work overtime.I wonder what this discussion is about, given that not only parts and repairs are needed... also fresh cannon fodder (AKA young untrained RF soldiers).What is clear is that what started as \"oh... we will take the whole of Ukraine without a fight in a week and be home by lunch\" has become a nationwide struggle to pay for a war that is ongoing. At the pace the RF army advances, this may last a long time while the RF citizens decide to flee the draft or stay and risk unemployment and scarcity.",

      "body": "The companies in the Russian war industrial complex will have to work extra hours in order to supply the Russian army with more weapons, gun shells, missiles and other sorts of ammunition. This is normal for a war. The Russian army will have replenish it's ammunition reserves and also spend a lot of gun shells in Ukraine. This requires more work and bigger production by the war industrial complex.The Russian blitzkrieg failed, but the plan B of having a slow and steady advance by capturing one city at a time works.Also there are rumors about an ongoing hidden mobilization of Russian conscripts. I don't know if this is true or a propaganda lie.Anyway, I don't think that this topic is really related to economics. This is more like political discussion.",

RF was supposed to be a superpower, overwhelmingly superior in weapons, technology and human resources to Ukraine, yet here we are. It is important that the RF citizens realise that they have been lied to and that there is going to be a strong effect on their livelihood during the next few years. I recently read an article about the amount of munitions used in the war. The strategy of massive shelling is sucking up resources at a pace not seen in recent decades.

T...You forgot to add that the Queen of England should go on pilgrimage to Moscow travelling on her knees to ask forgiveness for His Majesty the Tzar Adolf Putin.Adolf Putin and his philosophy of death is not Russian culture, is just a psychopath.Quote from: Gyfts on July 07, 2022, 09:24:37 PMWartime efforts require a lot of resources.

It'd be counterintuitive to ship untrained draftees out into war. ..It is not at all, Adolf Putin is paying new soldiers three time the RF average salary and has raised the age limit of conscripts to 65 years old. Young people are not willing to go to a war that is hellish and, to all point, unnecessary. They are aware of the massive losses, the corruption, the culture of harassment and the poor leadership.The RF has lost thousands of well trained and seasoned troops and has quite a bit of a hard time finding replacements (who can blame the young - their country is not at risk).

Putin said today: \"In Ukraine, we have not even started seriously yet.\"Once again I will say - I love your humor, especially such a subtle banter over a backward, wild, embittered country like Russia!  Yeah, and about the EU is very funny too! And this is \"Russia will wait for autumn\" - in the fall, her corpse will twitch the first death cramps, and she will wait   Wait, silently, periodically poking with a stick, there will be everyone around this corpse!And about the nonsense of a miserable tyrant - it's like the squeals of an impotent, at whom everyone laughs, and he's like \"I haven't even got up yet, now he'll get up, and you will understand who they were laughing at.\" But everyone laughs even louder, knowing that he has been hanging from birth, but all his life he tells stories about himself as a hero-lover",
