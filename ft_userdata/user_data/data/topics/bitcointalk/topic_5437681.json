  "content": "I'm throwing out an idea.I definitely believe the dollar is going to lose its dominance and we will soon see the Dedollarisation. It was something that might have seemed absurd 20 years ago, but in the last 5 or 10 years it has become a serious idea and even concrete since the process has already started.Here is what has already been done in the last few years to replace the dollarhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedollarisation#Regional_developmentsThat's a lot of things right? It's just for the last decade.If we look at nowadays- Russia and Iran want to create an altcoin based on gold to trade with each other.- Brazil and Argentina want to create a common currency- El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as an alternative currency- Iran is using crypto to avoid the US embargo- Countries like China and Europe have developed CBDCs- Russia has been buying gold on a large scale for the last 10-15 years, as have China and the other BRICS countries. At the same time, they have been dumping their US treasury bonds and reducing their dollar reserves.- According to the World Gold Council, central bank gold purchases are at their highest level since 1967Why? It's pretty well explained here by an economist, and it talks about digital currencies. Basically, they have no choice. Central banks turn to gold as losses mountHis conclusion seems correct to meQuoteThe only reason central banks are buying gold is to protect their balance sheets from their own money destruction programsQuoteThe Financial Times claims that central banks are already suffering significant losses as a result of the falling value of the bonds they hold on their balance sheets. By the end of the second quarter of 2022, the Federal Reserve had lost $720 billion while the Bank of England had lost £200 billion. The European Central Bank is currently having its finances reviewed, and it is predicted that it will also incur significant losses. The European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, and the Australian central bank all “now face possible losses of more than $1 trillion altogether, as once-profitable bonds morph into liabilities,” according to Reuters.QuoteWhy do central banks increase their gold purchases just as losses appear on their balance sheets? To increase their reserve level, lessen losses, and foresee how newly created digital currencies may affect inflation. Since buying European or North American sovereign bonds doesn’t lower the risk of losing money if inflation stays high, it is very likely that the only real option if to buy more gold.QuoteIf central banks start issuing digital currencies, the level of purchasing power destruction of currencies seen in the past fifty years will be exceedingly small compared with what can occur with unbridled central bank control.In such an environment, gold’s status as a reserve of value would be unequalled.Gold, bitcoin, a CBDC or whatever, or a mix of everything, for sure the Dollar will be no more the leading currency and a lot of things will be different.Now if we think about the USA, what will they do? Because don't think they will watch the story without trying to do something to stop it. That's a serious question I wonder. Wars or something else, not sure, but at the same time I'm thiking about the war in Ukraine and The USA 'too curious', China and Taiwan with the USA 'too curious' and so on...As POTUS, no idea what I could do.Quotea new paradigm in policy will unavoidably emerge as a result of the disastrous economic and monetary effects of years of excessive easing, and neither our real earnings nor our deposit savings benefit from that. When given the choice between “sound money” and “financial repression,” governments have forced central banks to choose “financial repression.”",

Why do some countries in the EU want their currency back? Because they want back the ability to devalue the currency, of printing money, of doing the same things that, well, they wouldn't be able to do with Bitcoin either for example.If I want to sell one of my products I look at the price It cost me to manufacture add the profit margin, arrive at 100 units of it, change that to $, and ask you the amount in $, what would change if I were to directly ask you 97 pesos? All this dedollarisation is a witchhunt started by the counties who see their economies in shamble because they can't prop their currency anymore, why do some still trade in $ when they are neighbors and they have their own depends on currencies and so on? Because they don't trust the other, that's why.And who is going to trust:- a common currency with one of the players being Inlfagentina or Defaultina?- a common currency of two countries where you're not allowed to trade in other currencies, where your $ is automatically converted to ruble and the other is one experiencing a 50% inflation and a devaluation of its own currency of nearly 10x in five years?Would you do business in this?I find it really amusing, here we are on bitcointalk, and we are discussing on how some countries are planning to overthrow the $ by, creating their own shitcoins they can manipulate with ease!  Out of pure curiosity, how would those plans go along with the rest of the world adopting Bitcoin as Salvador did?",

Still, in order to achieve this effectively, OPEC countries must come forward and announce that they will take their own coins/currencies in order to sell their oil and natural gas to the rest of the world. Unless such things happen, de-dollarisation will remain on paper but never be implemented. What it seems now is that a couple of countries are forming their own trading group where they can use their own currencies by avoiding USD. Its impact won't be seen unless they form an alliance and stand their ground on the decision of not taking USD for any of their international trades. Otherwise, it is just not going to help achieve the end objective.",

Especially in hard times when local currencies face a risk of hyperinflation. I mean that USD is a peace of toilet paper, but there is no better alternative. Its the currency of the biggest economy of \"west civilization\". Civilization characterized by respect for private property and the individual human. So no one will go use china CBDC as china does not respect basic human rights (latest 0-Covid policy, 1-child policy just to serve as example). Also china is a potential US competition and in the event of a potential conflict, assets will be frozen. So the only people that will use China CBDC are china citizens and citizens of countries that are allies to china.So far its a long way to go with a high probability of failure. So far \"dollars are involved in nearly 90% of all transactions.\".",

There are many demographics and forms of influence in the world, who wish the cards to fall in their favor. 300 spartans were certainly impressive when they held off the persian army at thermopylae. They were great soldiers and warriors. How did sparta eventually fall? The same with the roman empire and other great nations. How did they eventually meet their end? It seems that many have forgotten some very basic lessons of the past. That is around the time that history usually repeats itself.",

Therefore, exchanging goods between countries without dollars will avoid those sanctions that were generally linked to the dollar.So far, there has not been an alliance to do this, but Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa, and here are attempts to include Saudi Arabia in that alliance, as an alternative to G7.",

Couple this with aggressive sanctions and asset seizures, doesn't make sense for a country to use USD if the currency becomes useless over time or if the U.S. government decides they want to seize the currency for their own political ambitions. Not too long ago the U.S. froze 7B in Afghanistan's assets and redistributed it to their own U.S. citizens. 7B is nothing to a large country but the idea of having cash assets seized on a whim would be concerning if your country's government becomes adversaries with the U.S.",

Or do you think he saw the flaws in the existing payment systems and fiat currencies and decided to create an alternative that addresses those flaws?What does Satoshi explain in the first part of the whitepaper? Is it not the flaws in the existing systems and how Bitcoin fixes them?That's the same when it come to dedollarisation or dumping US dollar.There is a big flaw in using dollar which is why no country in the world including US want to use dollar, so they all seek a replacement. The flaw is pretty simple to understand too, US keeps printing dollar without any kind of limit, at any time they want. Then they use all the dollars that were printed out of thin air to other countries to purchase actual goods, energy, services, etc.(Imagine that next time you want to go to the grocery store instead of using your hard earned cash you use your printer to print some money and then use that to buy groceries!)What this cases is inflation in any country that uses dollar (including US) because they use dollar and this is exactly why everyone would love to dump it.In short this is how United States exports its inflation.The only reasons why they haven't done it completely yet are the fear of US (see Iraq, Libya, Syria, and a dozen other countries that were destroyed when they \"thought\" about dumping dollar) and also because they couldn't come to agreement about the replacement.... until now...",

Diversification isn't necessarily resulting to these countries relinquishing support from the dollar, save for I guess, Russia, China, and Iran, which is what dedollarisation is in essence. Sure, they can hog as many of their resources as they can, but when it comes to international commerce, dollar remains supreme.
