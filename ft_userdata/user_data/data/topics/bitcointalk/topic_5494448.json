  "content": "According to CoinGecko, there are over 2.5 million cryptocurrencies (read more here: https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-are-there).Whilst these are classified as cryptocurrencies, the reality is that the majority of these are actually just tokens, primarily on the Ethereum or Solana Blockchains. Almost all (99.9%+ based on my opinion) of these are coins or tokens that have no purpose, and provide no value. They are centralised, have often unlimited supply or have been pre-mined with distributions allocated to the owners. The only intention of these projects is to make the creators richer, and take value away from everyone else. The 1000th cryptocurrency by market capitalisation is GYEN with a market capitalisation of $13.38M according to CoinMarketCap (read more here: https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/). Therefore, these 2.499m remaining coins clearly have any negligible valuation in the market, and should just be considered trash.Whilst it can be easy to see that a significant portions of these coins are either scams, pump and dumps, or have had their daily volume manipulated to appear like speculative investments, there are still a lot of other coins, even in the top 1000 that you should be cautious of. Some of the highest market capitalisation alt coins, still do not provide the real world value that their white papers have intended. Whilst yes there may be a few examples of real world use cases using the technology, how many holders of the coin actually use it for its desired functional purpose, rather than just sitting on it and hoping the price increases so they can sell? These are speculators and traders, and not investors. You do not want to hold something which others are primarily speculating on.Let's also take BNB as an example. A market capitalisation of $86.74 Billion and ranked as the #4 coin overall. It is developed and owned by a private company, Binance. Their objective primarily is profit for their company. Yes the owners have alterior and philosophical plans, but ultimately they need to keep their company profitable. They have offered some technologies, like Binance Smart Chain, and they have their own exchange, but we cannot forget that they MUST turn a profit on their projects as an organisation, and releasing a coin like BNB is to benefit THEIR interests primarily. They can and will change things as they please, you do not want to hold something where the rules can change at any moment.The same applies to many other top coins even with $100m+ market caps. You must ask yourself when you are investing your money, is the intention of the project to actually make a meaningful difference or change to society, and is it following through in the current day on that objective? Currently the only option to invest in and hold over the long term is Bitcoin. It is the only truely decentralised cryptocurrency, with a finite supply and being used for its original intention on a regular basis - a storage of wealth that is not impacted by inflation, and the ease of making borderless transactions. What I am ultimately getting at here in the theme of my post is that there is no other coin besides Bitcoin, which you can trust can be held over the long term. What are your thoughts?",

What are your thoughts?Itâ€™s true that so far no coin was able to do whatever bitcoin has done in our world. Bitcoin is the pinnacle of crypto and for a long time it will be. However I believe that it still depends on the person whether they want to invest in bitcoin only or want to invest in other coins as well. Yes bitcoin is the best but some people are looking for other features that bitcoin really does not have. Some would also argue that bitcoin is too expensive now. I think as long as one is making the right choice then they can do anything or invest in anywhere they want.",

I have no objection to someone investing only in bitcoin because it is the safest currency on the market. But let me ask, if we only talk about profits, what about altcoins like ETH, Link, Near, Solana...? If I remember correctly, ETH was created in 2013 and it is still growing bigger every day until now, the initial investors in it are making huge profits. Similarly, solana was expected to die when FTX collapsed but look at what it has done over the past year from $13 and it is trading above $140.",

Whilst there are metrics out there for dead coins (no market cap or no liquidity for trading), a coin may still be alive and traded regularly, but still I don't think any alt coins should be in someone's portfolio. Alt coins are created to make the owners wealthy primarily, or become highly centralised and governed by organisations with selfish intent. The only one free of this is Bitcoin..",

Everyone does what they want with their money, and a lot of bitcoiners also buy and store altcoins, but i guess it usually makes up the lesser percentage of their crypto portfolio.Quote from: SickDayIn on April 27, 2024, 12:21:02 PMWhat I am ultimately getting at here in the theme of my post is that there is no other coin besides Bitcoin, which you can trust can be held over the long term.

Whatever is written on their whitepaper are only there for a show, to make it appear that their project is valid, that it has a reason to succeed. But they aren't for hodling.

I hope you got my point.

ETH has always been side-by-side with Bitcoin in all market conditions, I know the project had its ups and downs, but at the end of the day, it has never deceived its investors even in the long run.So to be honest, I wouldn't mind making some investment in cryptocurrencies such as ETH that I know have been around for many years already and have had no problems at all, I know it can be risky because it's an alternative coin at the end of the day, but what's the fun if you are just playing around with a single cryptocurrency and that is Bitcoin?

There are pro-bitcoin people out there that are also riding altcoin markets in order to increase their bitcoin stash, and I see nothing wrong with it. If it's something that people think can make them increase their hold in the bitcoin game, then that's respectable and understandable. If you are holding only bitcoins, then the goal for you is to put in some more money in it and watch your holdings grow in value over time.

This is not so necessary cause altcoins can be unpredictable so fear of missing out and fear of the unknown is basically not heathy for investors mostly newly investors besides we are dealing with money so we should not risk our investment carelessly. Altcoins project mostly newly projects are known for scam, pump and dumb but not all project so the big question here is how can an investor differentiate between a scam project and a genuine project, all this can actually discourage the investment process. I believe why everyone will go for bitcoin is bitcoin don't act like other coins secondly bitcoin has proven so many times as a trusted investment. The least negative information you can hear an investor mention concerning bitcoin is just about scam and being a victim compared to altcoin project cause sometimes the community are aware they're creating a false project but they do this for gain but let's note bitcoin investment is for the long run",

Whenever Bitcoin fees went high, the number of transactions in Doge and Litecoin increase too, while Lightning Network is relatively stable.But of course Bitcoin is only one coin that need to be hold for long term, at least if cryptocurrencies is failed, Bitcoin will be the last coin that stand after all other coins become worthless.",

I also agree with you, I will not deny that bitcoin was originally created to be a peer-to-peer currency that would make us independent of 3rd parties. But look at what's going on, we all just use bitcoin to make profit so saying that altcoin projects are created just for profit is bad, this is too biased towards bitcoin. Regarding choosing to invest in bitcoin or altcoin, I think our investment purpose is to make profits, so if there is a better opportunity than bitcoin, there is no reason to ignore it. But I also need to remind you not to put too much faith in what altcoins advertise. We are still in the early stages of the cryptocurrency revolution and everything is experimental, it is hard to say that top projects will not fail. We should still be careful when investing whether it is bitcoin or altcoin. So far, other than being mainly used for investment and speculation, I haven't really seen any practical applications of cryptocurrencies.",
