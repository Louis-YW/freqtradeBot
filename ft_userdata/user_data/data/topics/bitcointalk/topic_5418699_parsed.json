  "content": "Hi Everyone,I want to use my extra solar power generation for Mining. I live in Australia and electricity power is expensive and the network buys my feed-in too cheap! My extra production is variable between 0 to 5KW and I want to use only that extra portion. I have an Antiminer s19 pro which uses 3kwh (no ssh access). Its firmware version is \"Thu Jun 9 13:06:22 CST 2022\" and Log shows \"Linux version 4.9.113 (jenkins@nomd-nomd-fwc-bj)\" and \"type: Antminer S19 Pro\". It has 3 boards,Question is, can I change the frequency or enable and disable Hash boards to somehow control the amount of power consumption quickly (I don't care about the hash rate or efficiency)?ThanksATK",
