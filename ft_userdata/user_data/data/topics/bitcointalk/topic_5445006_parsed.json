Alright, this is it...Am one folk from a polygamous family. My Dad (now late) married three wives of which things seemed to have been going smoothly among the wives and we the children from different mothers while Dad was alive, but an unfortunate events sets in disrupting the peace immediately after Dad's death. More than a year now we all of different mothers have not being in talking terms owing to inheritance issues that sets in.

What do you guys propose I do or how to go about it!. Or should I just look the other way!",

They wouldn’t pay you no mind because y’all aren’t in the best of terms. Family can be difficult, especially a polygamous one. Everyone suspects the other person means them harm, even if that wasn’t the case I still wouldn’t recommend you mix business and family. It won’t end well in my opinion. I have read threads about people asking similar questions or already doing what you have in mind.

Or should I just look the other way!I feel that the problem you are experiencing seems more complicated than what you describe, because in the past, a close friend of mine also experienced the same thing as you regarding polygamy and inheritance problems with one father's brother but a different mother.OP you have good intentions to help your siblings in your way but it will be meaningless if you always think about the doubts you have and don't immediately try to start communicating with them. In my opinion, if your intention is unanimous to help your brother, you must have the courage to take steps and be ready to accept the risks involved.Eliminate all your doubts and have good communication before you finally try to introduce crypto or other financial advice to your brother. If later it turns out that you experience rejection from them, it will again depend on you, whether you want to keep trying or stop everything you are trying to do.You will receive lots of suggestions from all the members here and it might add to your confusion. All of that is for you to decide because you yourself know better about the current situation than everyone. I hope you can solve your problem soon.",

But introducing them into bitcointalk can open their eyes because here they will read useful things which may not found in the other platforms so they know importantance of money and how people are making it around the world and also signature campaign can do some financial help just something is better than nothing but keep in mind their goal should be getting information not just make money from signature campaign.",

It seems that your siblings have been affected by your father's death but it doesn't justify to have a proper job to pay their expenses. I lost my grandma due to pandemic and my mother and I had no choice after she got buried the next week we have to work and pay for the funeral expenses. I think from your siblings they are dependent to your father when he was still alive because a year of not engaging on any paying related jobs or any services is just a bad decision especially to a grown up. It might be hard to find a well paying jobs but as we know there's a lot of opportunity there outside if we try seeking it.

It's up to them if they will listen and learn how bitcoin works since there's no guarantee that you'll profit, if you don't have any idea how volatile the situation of the bitcoin. You also said they don't have any payable jobs so how can they invest in bitcoin? It will be bad if they put their life savings there in bitcoin always put the money that you afford to lose. But introducing bitcoin forum just like this it could help them to have ideas in how can they engage to a good paying job. At least you tried to help them to make a move in this situation even in bad terms with the family, they might thank you for giving them suggestion and ideas for them.",

The first thing you need to do is absolve yourself from any liability by being extremely clear about the risk involved. Be clear that a long-term strategy is a strategy that is more likely to win than any other one as well. From then onward, things are hard to explain in simple words. The best thing to do is to put on a video that does the hard work of explaining for you. It is a hard thing to explain, so use the tools that have had many hours put into their creation that are designed to help explain! The classic What is bitcoin (v2) video is a great place to start to spark some interest and initial understanding. I'm sure that you can compile plenty of videos or material that helped you when you started as well!",

When you feel you're close enough then you can safely introduce the concept of Bitcoin to them teaching them how it works and how they can go about their investment please make sure they know how risky it is to invest in bitcoin so they won't start claiming you when everything goes haywire.It's great to have a sibling that thinks good of you and wants to help and see you succeed.",

I think it won’t be too hard since you were good before so work for it, and once you regain their trust again, then you can start introducing bitcoin to them because because by that time, they will surely lend an ear to you and appreciate what you may be doing for them.

Maybe you could spare a little time fixing your relationship with your siblings first, if it works, then good, but if it’s not, then wait for some time until you can see that your siblings are already giving their attention to you. If that happens, maybe that will signal to proceed to your real intention and share about them about bitcoin and bitcointalk forum.
