So, we might face some trouble but the internet is not going to go down as a whole. In simple words, the whole internet does not work solely on the satellites, there are wires as well.I also found this fact a long time ago but forgot to mention it in the other forum, well, I guess asking the same question again do have benefits. I actually heard similar kind of question a way back and was not in the position to accept such thing, but I guess this world's big influencers who have great powers need a cause to make a change. So I guess that's what is happening now.",

Not only for Bitcoin per se as, a lot of other uses have been accorded the internet and that includes communications too, electronic money transfer and having to send/retrieve data. These are all vital aspects to life.NASA haven’t given any warning yet and they seem like the body that would be in the best place to tell the rest of the word what actually is been observed from there different expeditions to space. If they’ve not been alarmed about what is going on out of space, then we should be eased to some extent.As for Bitcoin, I think it would be halt but, would resume there after when we’ve have a stable network should any of such breakdown occur. We would pass it and maybe, people would have the opportunity to buy from weak hands.",

      "body": "Of course, all of the things on the internet will stop or freeze, but one thing is for sure: the bitcoin value may be gone. Why? simply because when the apocalypse on the internet happens, all of the connections will be affected, although bitcoin holders can't access their assets and sell them. Bitcoin or blockchain depends on the internet, where transactions happen, where nodes are being run, and where mining is happening. If the internet and connections are gone entirely in the whole world, then the technology will also freeze, including blockchain, and at some point it will collapse. Even when the internet is restored, I'm sure many investors will panic and sell their assets, which can lead to the downfall of bitcoin or other crypto currencies.We never know until it happens, but one thing is for sure: if it happens, then not just crypto currency will be affected; many other things that rely on the internet and connections will be in total chaos.",

The professionals have been anticipating something like this to happen and it will totally halt the operations of the network if this happens because it's a global impact that shall take place. For now, there is nothing we can do but just to stick to whatever plan that we have and we don't have an idea if it happens since it's probably going to be the first time in the history that will include and involve Bitcoin. I have no idea if this has happened already before. But I am guessing that most of the large companies that do really solely to internet connection have a plan on how to mitigate the impact of it, well doesn't now? Because majority of the companies nowadays are relying heavily on it.",

I mean if it is only going to affect a part of the world where the internet is gonna disappear that just means that the internet is still running in some areas and Bitcoin is still going to operate, Probably depending on how long the effect of it as well, if we are going to see it for probably just weeks what will happen is were just gonna get a pause or freeze on the internet after that we could easily get back and running again when the Internet is restored.I mean Bitcoin is not guaranteed that is going to exist since there are always risk holding it, after 5 years we dont really know if Bitcoin is still a thing, but also difficult to say that Bitcoin is going to disappear, I mean even though the Internet was gonna for a year, When the Internet is restored Bitcoin is still there existing Unless something happened where they able to erase the whole Bitcoin itself. Then the real discussion is what would happen to the market price if the apocalypse happened since Bitcoin is going to drop its market price to zero which has a very low chance of happening, I mean its already good as dead right. But still I dont even think that it is going to drop its price to zero even though there are some unexpected things happening like this solar storm, since there are already a lot of Bitcoin believers they would for sure see it as a big opportunity to invest every time the market price drops just a little percentage.",

In simple words, the whole internet does not work solely on the satellites, there are wires as well.Yeah I agree with this one internet itself basically a decentralized thing so when there is a country who not directly effect from the solar storm or at least they had less impact when the Internet down maybe the bitcoin will survive and have time, since we all use internet not just for crypto the price may plummet but not very much not going to zero or anything like that and all anything who connected to internet will go down a chaos will happen. beside that according to sources in google Solar storms are unpredictable, but scientists can make educated guesses and forecasts. Solar flares and storms peak every 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle. The frequency of solar flares varies throughout the cycle, ranging from several per day to less than one per week. More powerful flares are less frequent than weaker ones. we might survive",

A complete internet blackout would certainly cause major disruptions across society.  Without access to online communication and financial transactions, people would struggle to connect, share information, or conduct business.  We'd likely see a resurgence in older technologies as folks scramble for alternative ways to interact.  Using landline phones and radios, even sending letters through the postal service are communication channels that could regain prominence, at least temporarily.  For financial transactions, physical currency would probably become necessary again since online banking credit cards and payment apps wouldn't function. But beyond the inconveniences to individuals, an internet outage poses risks that could have catastrophic ripple effects. and  Emergency response systems often rely on internet connectivity, so medical, fire and police assistance could be dangerously delayed or unavailable.  Transportation networks like air travel depend on online coordination potentially stranding people away from home.  Supply chains that deliver food, medicine and other life-sustaining goods also lean heavily on internet-enabled logistics, threatening shortages. So, yeah! It's kind of a freaky thought when you actually stop and realize how screwed we'd be if we lost internet access.  I mean, sure we got along fine without the internet for thousands of years.  But good grief, can you even picture modern society trying to function without it? It would be total chaos.",

The peak is expected in 2025, so it's a challenge for the near future. Some events that can happen due to solar activity are radio blackouts, disruptions of navigation via the satellite system, electric grid disruptions. Repairs after an extreme storm are estimated to take weeks, perhaps months, and we're not talking about a total blackout all over our planet.So it can be a major challenge, kind of like the pandemic was. But the issues will be temporary, and the main problems will be with more serious things like navigation, financial transactions, access to information and to healthcare, etc. Bitcoin will still be out there, I suppose it's likely to experience a major price drop (due to global economic instability, cause by the disruptions and uncertainty in digital technology), but to also recover once the repairs are done and things get back to normal.",
