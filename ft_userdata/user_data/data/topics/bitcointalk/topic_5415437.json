  "content": "With inflation hitting the UK and causing financial unrest, some experts look to Bitcoin as they feel it could make a positive impact on their some what unstable economy..  According to data shared by James Butterfill, head of digital assets at Coinshares, shows that trade volume with Bitcoin as against the British pound climbed to a high of $881m as of Monday, 26th Sept.!Meanwhile, the average trade volume between BTC/GBP on a daily is about $70m, invariably meaning an increase compared to the standard of 1,160%. With the rate at which the GBP tends to experience volatility, it would only be wise to look at other means. Like becoming a Bitcoin hub for instance, since adopting it will seem a bit of a stretch, Gabor Gubarcs tweet summarized. Furthermore, this decline in finance in the UK seemed to have become noticed since the introduction of Prime Minister, Liz Truss' fiscal policies, an analysis proved. Liz Truss' tweet   It looks like she's gotten sidelined from her first view on crypto currencies now. Is there a plan to resuscitate the pound or will be Bitcoin be later considered?https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/09/29070563/btcgbp-volumes-skyrocket-over-1-100-as-the-pound-continues-its-freefall",

I predicted such behavior more than 6 months ago. When inflation hits your economy, a lot of people look to invest their tanking fiat into something they can trust as a hedge against inflation.Now you might ask why price hasn't gone up. My explanation is that most of the world is not struggling with inflation alone, they are struggling with inflation + recession like in United States. In that situation, people don't have any money to invest because they are already struggling to pay the rent, buy groceries, pay the bills, etc. (on top of that we have a lot of state sponsored market manipulation but that's another topic).Recession is starting to reach UK too but it is not yet as severe as the inflation.Quote from: pooya87 on March 11, 2022, 12:48:09 PMIn my experience when fiat is dumping people will look for a way to keep their purchase power or at least part of it. That is achieved by investment. I believe bitcoin has become a viable investment for many because of its deflationary nature and the fact that it has been performing excellently all these years.",

Bitcoin, even at those numbers that are just for a record day still seems like it's still not yet there, still needs a bit more time or a more serious push or something else. I think that most will go for government bonds or index funds, it's human nature when faced with dilemmas to try and chose the easy way out, one that doesn't involve much thinking, and with these, it's pretty easy, they order their bank to buy it and then they just watch graph and do nothing.Going by that simple mind approach I would invest in energy stocks. If they are going up at least I get some returns for the high electricity/gas costs, if the stocks go down at least it means prices for the mentioned are also cooling so, in a simple man's perspective it's a nice hedge.",

And I know you guys aren't used to high having inflation rates so it is understandable for majority of people to have no experience in similar situations (they had never planned for it either).Not sure if you're just referring to Gold investors here, but I've never understood anyone that didn't think a recession has been coming. I've been saying it for quite a few months now, and I've predicted it to be on par or worse than the great depression. Considering the pound is at its lowest level, the housing market is pretty much heading for a substantial collapse, I think that prediction might come true. Plus, I just mentioned this in another related post, but this is two rather substantial recessions in just over ten years, which basically means the same people who went through 2008/2009 are now experiencing again, another recession which will likely claim some banks existence, and will require investment to keep them alive, i.e the exact same as 2008/2009. So, consumer confidence is at a all time low right now, which is only going to be compounded by a decline in the housing market. I know it's technically only the pound right now that's massively suffering, but every single market is showing signs of struggle e.g gold. So, within a couple of months I believe we'll be on a global level of decline, which will only be emphasised by the recent pandemic, and war investment with Russia, and Ukraine. This is literally only the start of the recession, we aren't even knee deep in it yet, and the pound has dropped a crazy amount. I remember when you could nearly get two dollars for a pound, how times change right?",

I believe it comes more from the fact that it's a very developed country with a strong economy, so people here just aren't that used to financial drawbacks rather than that what's going on is truly a huge deal objectively (I mean the pound, not the trading volume with Bitcoin).

Then, the realisation kicked in that both have gone down quite some bit. I'd say it's only a matter of time before the rest of the currencies follow. No doubt, each government will be putting preventive measures in to stabilise it at the moment, but ultimately whatever measures they implement we'll be paying for it down the line. Then we'll get a housing crash, and basically we'll start seeing people defaulting on their mortgages, and potentially banks ceasing trading or getting bailed out once again. Bitcoin to me should see positive growth during this time, and it might actually help us get out of this rut. Although, it's hard to predict since we'll also be feeling the effects of lesser buying power, I guess it's a question of what's more powerful. Decreased buying power as a result of the recession or people losing faith in banks, and fiat in general.",

Now, to kick us up a gear we needed a compounding recession to get people thinking about alternatives, especially since it wasn't all that long ago. Who knows, maybe this was part of the plan, knowing we'd have recession after recession, and therefore people would get sick of it eventually, and look for alternatives. Now, Bitcoin is looking pretty lucrative, because the mentality of people will be no matter how hard they work, recession after recession hits, and therefore they don't gain in the long run.
