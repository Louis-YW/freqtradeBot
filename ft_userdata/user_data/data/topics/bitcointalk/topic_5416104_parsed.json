Also try it on other wallets that support Lunc if not successfully done on Exodus.On Aromic wallet, you can still be able to see your seed phrase, check it directly on Atomic wallet to make sure that you export the correct seed phrase.If that does not work, try another wallet, but it supposed to work.",

I have contacted Atomic support this is what they said.If you can access your seed, try to import it to another wallet like the terra station wallet extension. I don't know exactly the link but I find the article how is work. First, you must be careful about phishing and scam, I'm worried the email you received is maybe from the scammer who tries steal your balance.Quote from: _act_ on October 05, 2022, 10:50:49 PMThat should not be possible if they are both BIP39 wallet and they are.

Whats the network that supported on atomic wallet maybe, its native terra classic, you need to check it to see which wallet fits. Then look for the wallet supported it and import your private keys. Im sure there are others not only atomic. If still doesnt work then there must be problem within the keys you arr importing or yet within the project.",

If you import the seed phrase to the wallet, it will work, just make sure you change the network into \"classic\". But if you don't want to import the whole seed phrase, I suggest you use the Move Funds feature. It sweeps the private key from Atomic Wallet into the Exodus.For more references see https://support.exodus.com/article/87-can-i-import-a-private-key#.",

      "body": "Here is the list of wallets that support LUNC tokens: https://digitalcoinprice.com/coins/terra-luna/walletsAs far as I know, at least three of them (Trust Wallet, Lenger Nano S, and Trezor) follow the BIP39 standard for creating accounts for different blockchains. What you need to do is take a recovery seed of your existing Atomic Wallet and import it into some of these wallets. Once you restore your wallet, your LUNC should appear in your balance. No need to import an individual private key or sweep them into another wallet: just restore your wallet with the seed into a more reliable alternative.Here are some guides that may be helpful:https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual:Recoveryhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382560913-Restore-your-Ledger-accounts-with-your-recovery-phrasehttps://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-restore-a-multi-coin-wallet/43",

A few of the characteristic is the 12 or 24 sequence of words.The seed phrase is the essential thing you should know and protect since it is the entry point of your security.

You can do this by logging in with your private key. But beware of phishing practices, do not lose your money to fraudsters while trying to save your money. Good luck.In this case, he doesn't have the private key, he has 12-word backup phrase which means he has to sign to the wallet where to have to know what address he saves the balance and then gets a private key to a specific address. but, I don't recommend it if he is a newcomer to crypto, because this is a bit technical, no many wallets to support getting a private key, especially a new blockchain like LUNC.",
