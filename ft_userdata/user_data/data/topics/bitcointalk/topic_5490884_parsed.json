      "body": "Even now that the price of bitcoin is still below $70,000, there are people who are still unable to afford a whole bitcoin, which is never a problem and shouldn't be a problem.  Even if Blackrock and other financial institutions want to buy more bitcoin, the thing will still remain the same. You can only reduce the amount you will buy if the price goes all up, just as those who didn't buy when the price was below $30,000 have cut down their budget.  One thing you need to know is that the bitcoin price will always move up above where it is right now, with or without this blackrock purchase. They are just helping the process speed up a little bit, but the bitcoin price is going to remain stagnant, so if you have money to buy, use the opportunity of seeing it at a low price to accumulate what you can.",

The more new money enters the market, the more bitcoin will increase in purchasing power.Black Rock's customers are generally people who would like to buy bitcoins but don't know how to do self-custody or are afraid to use the network, it will open many doors in the market, it will be good for everyone. The bad side is that governments will try to make people only buy ETFs and not bitcoin on chain",

What if some day they started something along the lines of \"fractional banking\". Like starting to sell bitcoin IOUs to people and sell more than they have. For example if they actually owned 1 million bitcoin but sold 10 million IOUs. What would that do to bitcoin, its price and its future? That is the scary part...Today they're selling ETF IOUs to people that is supposedly 1:1 but who's to say it's going to remain this way...",

It’s a good thing that Bitcoin is now officially a part of the US financial system. We wanted mainstream adoption for years, now we are on the way to having it. The price going up is a good thing, Bitcoin still works as intended though, 1 BTC = 1 BTC.",

No matter how you feel about it, you can't influence the outcome or change it.You voiced the positive side - this is an increase in the price of bitcoin. The negative point is that too much bitcoins is concentrated in “one hand”, which is clearly not very good. It would be better if bitcoin was more distributed among smaller BTC-holders. If Blackrock (and other big holders) continue to accumulate bitcoin and not sell it, then this will further exacerbate the imbalance in the evenness of bitcoin distribution. Although the uniform distribution of bitcoin between holders looks like a utopia and is no longer possible to bring this to life. Due to the bitcoin concentration among big holders and the high cost of it, a cycle occurs, that is, the more expensive bitcoin, the less bitcoin small holders can afford and the more institutional investors buy bitcoin. It turns out to be a vicious circle in which big players become the dominant holders.",

It's .. a fact of life, both good and bad.It will bring more and more laws related to crypto - which is good (end of wild west of crypto, more protection) and also bad (blatant intrusion against privacy).It will increase heavily its scarcity and bring wealth to early investors.It should bring more money into development (which should also fuel inventions for the better).It should bring acceptance as payment method on a daily basis, but possibly also the wide spreading of IOUs instead of actual bitcoins.It will bring more strict taxation.But imho none of these are unexpected.",

As a part of a free market, big players can also invest if they feel like it. But, thankfully, at this point Bitcoin is so huge that I don't think there's a single company that can accumulate such a truly significant amount that would allow them to monopolize the market and can significant control over it.Big funds investing in Bitcoin can both boost its price and reputation. And there's still plenty of BTC left to buy and store in non-custodial wallets. Yes, when the price goes up, it means people can afford smaller amounts of BTC than before. But that's just natural.",

It can either befalls to favour your purchasing where you can actually buy more or goes against your wills where you'd have no choice than to buy at any amount that the market is currently trending which by any means, you can meet the market when the value is depreciating or appreciating.But I can tell you that the current market trends is not too high for who's coming in newly to the bicoin industry to buy theirs and hodl in as much we haven't reached to the bull run yet.While on the DCA method, you can also decide to hold on to your accumulations until halving but you it could be dramatic that while you're waiting for the halving, who just bought at the moment could be lucky to catch up with the further increments they market may offer before the halving.",

Am certainly not surprised about BlackRock doing same because as the halving is fast approaching this is how whales will get to acquire and control the market in months to come. The purchase by BlackRock will sure increase the value of BTC making its price rise despite it taking a dip recently and we might see other large investors like big companies and corporations  acquire the spot exchange traded funds more in coming days too.BlackRock acquisition is a good thing because it shows BTC still has worth and it doesn't stop those with the plan to DCA from starting our continuing because it is a strategy of investment that favours the small time hodlers or investors who don't have such huge sums like Michael Saylor or BlackRock do.",
