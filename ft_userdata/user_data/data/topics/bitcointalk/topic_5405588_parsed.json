      "body": "Remember, cheap isn't always the best. Better look on Fiverr and hire a developer who will create a presale pool for you. If you don't want to spend anything then just sell your token through the old fundraising system. Add an address to send funds and you can send back tokens to the address. So you need to spend just the gas fee. Also, you can Airdrop investors token at once. But I am curious who will buy your token. If you can't spend 1 BNB for a fee then how will you manage marketing? Remember people wouldn't trust any platform to invest in they aren't familiar with. So looking for the cheap costly lesson at the end of the day.",
