  "content": "I'm uncertain if this post is allowed here, and if it's not I apologize mods and feel free to remove it.My business partner recently disappeared on me, hence currently looking for a new mutual partner who's good at marketing.  I'm a highly skilled and experienced back-end developer and have been involved within crypto since 2010 just a little after bitcoin came out.  I'm also creator of Apex at https://apexpl.io/ which allows me to rapidly develop and deploy quality online operations.At my peak was tech lead for a previous main client, and was responsible for developing and maintaining around 40 different bitcoin related operations.  Everything from web wallets, exchanges, mixers, escrow, debit cards, auction site, P2P exchange, HYIP, and much more.  He became filthy rich in the process.  I'm looking to replicate the same with someone.Although I'm an excellent back-end developer, I'm a horrible marketer.  That's where I need a partner -- someone to take care of the front-end marketing while I concentrate on development, deployment server management, and overall maintenance.  The other struggle I have is I went blind several years ago, hence can no longer do front-end design work and is why the examples below need design work.One very large project is about 50% complete, and have a few others that are complete and ready to go except for design work which I can't do due to the blindness.  Here's a couple examples:--------------------Bitcoin MixerHomepage: https://mixer.envrin.com/Example Mixer Status:  https://mixer.envrin.com/status/mjovfd8qWzqMjiufnfg3tpu9mYbhoFCS1y Admin Panel:  https://mixer.envrin.com/admin/Typical coin mixer with some nice additional features.  No user registration required, you just submit your payment address you'd like mixed funds sent to and are redirected to a mixer status page as linked above.  Users can continue sending funds to their mixing address anytime they'd like, or have a new mixing address generated.Also supports premium mixing at a higher fee allowing user to specify multiple payment addresses instead of just one.  The system will randomize the output amounts and send one transaction to each.  Also has a REST API allowing website owners to modify their software system and have incoming funds automatically mixed.Obviously, needs to get skinned with decent theme.  Functionality is 100% though.--------------------Localbitcoins CloneHomepage: https://peertrade.net/Having issues generating a Google Maps API key so unable to post a demo trade right now, but even though the home page obviously needs some design work the trade page is identical to Localbitcoins both in design and functionality. I know the admin panel isn't the greatest UI as it's very old system.  If this site starts gaining traction I'll port everything over to Apex v2 with the same admin panel as the coin mixer.Considering LBC recently closed, this could potentially be a good earner as millions of people were left stranded--------------------If desired, you may also view my resume to get a better idea of me at:    https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdfIf anyone here is good at marketing, has good experience and is interested, drop me a note and let me know a little bit about yourself.  Contact me anytime via e-mail at matt@apexpl.io.",

There are a lot of forum members here who also have your same skill and have threads on this forum as well. Clients and partners will contact you when they go through your portfolio and like your service and how you charge. And if you also want to accept altcoins as payment for your service, then you should also create a thread under . service announcement under Altcoin",

      "body": "I've been reading similar stories in the Project Development board over the years, everyone has ideas and is looking for partners, and then in the end it turns out that the partners get rich, and the developer is looking for a new partner, and that has no logic, right?Quote from: EnvrinGroup on May 14, 2023, 07:59:02 AMI'm uncertain if this post is allowed here, and if it's not I apologize mods and feel free to remove it.It definitely does not belong in the Bitcoin discussion, and I would personally move it to Project Development or maybe Marketplace -> Services. You can do that yourself by searching for the \"move button\" and moving the topic to a new board.Quote from: EnvrinGroup on May 14, 2023, 07:59:02 AMThe other struggle I have is I went blind several years ago, hence can no longer do front-end design work and is why the examples below need design work.I know that blind people can use computers, but it's hard for me to imagine that you can do this kind of work considering your condition. Good luck with finding a new partner, and I hope you find someone who won't disappear with the money like the previous one.",
