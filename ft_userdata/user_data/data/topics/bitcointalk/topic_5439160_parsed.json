They said:\"Please send us unedited, non-cropped, full-screen (desktop, not mobile) screenshots from the sending platforms as proof of the source of funds, and provide documents that confirm the services rendered.\"[Image link: https://ibb.co/rXbL9Tj]Despite telling them hundreds of times that I cannot provide what they are asking for—and that I have already sent everything I do have—they keep insisting. I explained to them:\"All I ask from my clients is a screenshot for translation purposes, after which I provide the services they requested, such as creating websites, databases, or other projects.\"I also told them:\"I did not create contracts or documents because I was not experienced in such matters. There is only one client who agreed to make a contract with me after you requested it. Most clients refuse because they paid with crypto and don’t really know me personally.\"[Image links:https://ibb.co/SwKDnRTChttps://ibb.co/Mx1xsqcy]",

When FreeWallet gets their claws in you, they make demands. There is a first set of demands that you meet. Then, they send a second batch. If you meet those as well, they get angry and send an even more ridiculous set of questions. The idea is to frustrate you to the point of giving up and letting them take your coins. Since you agreed to use them, you now unfortunately have to dance as they pull the strings.I hope it works out for you. I know it didn't for many. In the future, please avoid using such scams and ask questions if in doubt. Quote from: kfares on February 09, 2023, 01:53:06 PMthe problem is most websites blocked syria access Does Electrum restrict access to Syrians? Does the mobile Blue Wallet do it? Even if Google or the App store does, you can get the software from GitHub. And you can use various VPN software to open the sites you want. Quote from: kfares on February 09, 2023, 01:53:06 PMbut freewallet has no restriction on region what's why i use it  Of course not. Why limit the scope of people you can scam when you can scam people from all corners of the globe? FreeWallet doesn't discriminate. They scam everyone equally.",

Obviously, he was using it just to receive payments from his clients as he is from a country where almost all other payment methods are banned.Quote from: kfares on February 09, 2023, 01:53:06 PMthe problem is most websites blocked syria accessYou should avoid using web and custodial wallets at all costs. Use an open source non custodial wallet where you will be the only one who have control over your coins.",

How on earth employers will accept this to provide their IDs/passport to their employees, where you have lots of employers/clients in the past few years of working.After resolving this issue (hopefully) eventually avoid using that kind of wallet, use only community trusted wallets for bitcoin such electrum, hardware wallets such trezor, and multiwallets such as coinomi, trustwallet, metamask, exodus. Wish you goodluck.",
