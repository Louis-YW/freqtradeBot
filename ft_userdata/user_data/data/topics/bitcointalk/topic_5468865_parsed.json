Thats why i'm watching rather than investing heavily. I mined some earlier this year before the asics took over. I do see it as future gem \"IF\" development is maintained",

There are factors like hype, adoption, technology promises and etc. All projects that are launched come up with a lot of promises and most of them do deliver but some fail. If they do what they are expected as per their whitepaper then yes it might pump. I still would say to do your own research before asking such questions. Multiple response from forum members will create a confusion. My rule is to first read the tokenomics, then go through the whitepaper, then look into the roadmap. In the end I would end up following their GitHub before deciding whether to invest or not.",

If not then what is realistic for next bull run as I am debating if I should start investing into it or not. Good for those who had been able to buy on last year and it did really make out some noise recently. Kaspa was called to be that BTC 2.0 having that features which do solve out those known problems.Here's some article from CMC itself which it is really that interesting to read.Why Kaspa (KAS) Is Far Better Than Bitcoin and Ethereumhttps://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/654f4abf9dc53f07c7695521/There are rumors or even have those speculations that it would be hitting up $3-7 on the upcoming bull run for this cycle. Of course it would be always that speculative.For me i do already bag hold some of KAS. Its still cheap as of this moment and since we are still that year and half for this upcoming bull runthen it wont really be that bad idea that you would really be buying for long term holds.Everything cant really be assured though but basing up into its features and the dev behind then you could really say that it is really something worthwhich you could really be able to say that it does really have that potential.",

Either move on and find a silent project that arent hype like this and focus there. Nothing to gain in a high trend token and you are on the last? Dont fomo, wait for the whales to dump and enter.

With very big amounts of supply but kaspa is still managing to reach more than 10 cents. That's amazing to see how it was being pumped without some major exchange sites like upbit. I can imagine once this token hit upbit but the current price is making me feel scared. It has lots of supply but the price is too high to buy that. I would not even try to take the risk by taking a coin which have almost 30 billions supply. That's crazy to imagine this one will worth $1 in the future. It sounds to good to be true for me. This one is already over priced. Im not expecting kaspa to give another hundreds time of increase. It's likely it will be going down again with the goes of time.",

What ever thing you do might varies from what others might do. But what matters is results. sometimes people need to see the results of the journey you want to enback on before they believe in your dreams. otherwise what ever promise you've made without accomplishment is a fantasy.Note: when you make a mistake, you are a fool but when you get it wright you are a wise man. My advice is for you to gamble with what you can afford to loose.",

In coinmarkecap #Kaspa is ranked no 28 which is good. Tokens price surges 190% in last 30 days which show that this coins has potential and investors are accumulating for long term. I have compared Kaspa with Matic and ADA. I think Its not better to compare at current time because Kaspa is quite new project as compare to matic and lot of development required to compete coins already in top 10. I think investment in #kaspa is good idea but we should be aware of altcoins investment risks and invest according to it.",

We cannot say if what you're seeing is just intended to create hype for the coin or not, ours is to join in adoption and make use of the Investment opportunity in them at our own risk, if everything turns out in our favour, we are lucky then, but if otherwise, we are to accept our fate, once it's all about altcoins, we cannot be too sure in every decision we make, that's one of the risk in altcoins Investment, they are reliable or guaranteed.",

It's founder has some kind of relation with eth team as it's network has a concept that has similarities with one of eth upgrade.It claims it's network is as secure as Bitcoin but they are also using eths pos technology and scalability. It's a hybrid of Bitcoin and ETH network combine. Technology wise it is not something new that the dev is trying to do as most of the Bitcoin and ETH hardfork was created to build a better version of them which was a failure. Kaspa is also trying to do the same. I am not so sure about the price as it doesn't have much popular dapps in it still manage to touch ath and still raising. The team or someone intentionally raising the price up. The project can be good but it is not the best time to take entry into that project",
