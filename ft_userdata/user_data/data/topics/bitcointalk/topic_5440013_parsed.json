So you are basically trusting the wallet's manufacturer that he doesn't have access to the private keys associated with the ballet wallet.Here's a review from other members: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5292310.0",

I really like the ballet the best. Just looking for feedbackBallet wallet is not a hardware wallet, it falls under the paper wallet category. It is made of stainless steel. The wallet private key is said to be printed in China, while its passphrase is said to be printed in Las Vegas. While holding bitcoin, you do not have to trust anyone, there are many available options you can go for rather than to trust a company or someone to generate for you what can be used to steal all your coins pertaining to the wallet. The best would be to just generate your keys (and passphrase) your self.",

And 304 Stainless Steel is not magnetic (see this), but other variations such as 409 and 430 are indeed magnetic - as you probably know already - but are more susceptible to corrosion and hence damage. No wonder why Ballet opted out of using them.One of the virtues that working with CAD products has thought me over the last few months.",

Almost every collectible I've ever bought has been given away, hopefully to spread the virus This one I kept though, but might give it away some day. I bought it partly because of the culture of where I come from. It has some significance in the serial # (I know how important it is to people) and I'm pretty sure at some point down the line, I would be able to recoup the BTC once Bitcoin (and these kinds of wallets) become more prominent.

They don't have to get involved in multiple small ones. Remember the yogg situation whenever you want someone else to generate your keys for you.Still, this is a great way of physically gifting bitcoin to someone. It can be their first experience with crypto or as a gift to someone who appreciates crypto collectibles. What I don't understand is when OP said they are using Ballet in connection with Ledger. How and why? The Ballet wallet has a standalone app, where does Ledger come into the picture? Maybe he is running a multi-sig setup for some reason or funding the Ballet wallet from crypto he is holding on a Ledger.",
