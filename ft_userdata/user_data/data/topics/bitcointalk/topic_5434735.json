      "body": "Hey guys, bumping this post because I still need to list this one in my art thread. I also wanted to mention some changes, such as loading, as there will be a Satodime attached. I'm not sure about the amount, I think there will not be any amount mentioned on this artwork. If there have already been sales, then they could be lucky because it makes it more unique. For this type of artwork, like the Panthera https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5469006.0 artwork I created, you can add things to make each edition unique, and there is no turning back.As we know, I have launched a couple of auctions lately, and there is a sale for my 1 of 1 original pieces of my journey. The first one, SOLD https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5478722.0 An auction of my second original and the first one this year is happening right now - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5481670.0 What I want to share is that the third artwork of this kind will be a sketch I am finalizing. This will also be framed like those two 1 of 1 artworks  Have fun, guys! It's crazy how much of a labyrinth I have gone through with these posts, sales, auctions, lotteries, and art threads in this forum. It's growing and growing, nice to be here. I can't believe that I found this space. Can't wait for one day to organize something like the mx12.art conference.Sneak peek!",
