  "content": "According to this article, https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/radioactive-wild-boar-roam-central-europe, radioactive wild boars in Central Europe, contaminated by cesium-137 from nuclear tests and Chernobyl, are now a threat to human consumption. A study by Vienna University of Technology found cesium-137 and cesium-135 in these boars, unlike other animals where cesium-137 decreased over time.Researchers collected meat samples, and 88% exceeded German cesium limits. Nuclear weapons tests contributed to 10-68% of the contamination. Soil pollution from nuclear tests, affecting underground mushrooms that boars eat, keeps their radioactivity high. This issue shows the lasting impact of nuclear testing on future generations, raising concerns about food safety and environmental contamination. It's alarming how nuclear testing legacy affects our food chain!",
