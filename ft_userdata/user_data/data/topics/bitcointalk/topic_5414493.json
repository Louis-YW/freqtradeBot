      "body": "Bro, you don't need even to buy any books to learn Bitcoin. There are a lot of YouTube blogs regarding Bitcoin from which you can learn. You should start from the beginning since you aren't still a pro user. The best option is to be active in this forum and read as much as you can. So a lot of things you may learn from here. If anything related you don't find then you are free to create a new thread like this. But before that use the forum search button. Google search also helps to learn Bitcoin. Don't invest in greedy advertising lol. Regarding recovering funds from a scammer don't believe in someone that promises and will take fees from you. Just take legal action if you can. Crypto is irreversible, so only legal authorities could help.",

Crypto is irreversible, so only legal authorities could help. My bad, my message wasn't clear enough. I don't want to learn more about Bitcoin (in fact yes I want, everyday since years, but this topic wasn't about learning Bitcoin in general), I want to learn more about Bitcoin investigation.I don't want someone to help me retrace funds, I'd like to help people to retrace their funds. I obviously cannot recover them but help to find what exchange the scammer use and then allow them to take legal action. But thank you for your comment !!",

I don't think finding traces as to where trnxs were wrongly made or finding the exchange would change anything neither is it a problem. Anyone could run that; the whole stuff is decentralized and mostly without KYCs so I don't think any legal action can be taken.Â Even if it could, don't you think this will have you to earn a bunch of trust before anyone would hand cases like that to you? How's anyone even sure that you can do as much as you said? You see, ehhh, that's the point. Another thing is: are you rendering these as a service to get paid,duely or by percentage? If yes, then this isn't the right place for an advert. Check out the  service boardCheers,SandraðŸ‘©",
