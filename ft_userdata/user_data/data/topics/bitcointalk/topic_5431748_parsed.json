Some spammers who start to care about the quality of their posts will eventually manage to remove those neutral tag from whoever provided them.

Searching for spam, reporting the unnecessary posts, writing the reason for reporting -- all these require time and dedication (if you do all the work manually). It takes hours and hours and then some more hours... I also know it may seem frustrating at some points seeing that such hard and noble work is only pure volunteering, but I also know that users' appreciation (including mods') represent a lot. At least, they mean a lot for me. Besides, seeing your name in the yearly update which theymos posts is a great incentive!Other than that, I have to agree with The Sceptical Chymist:Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on December 27, 2022, 12:58:46 PMOnce you start actively looking for reportable posts, sometimes it does get addicting because they're everywhere (though a lot of the crappiest of crap tends to be concentrated in only a few sections).I, myself, don't report on a daily basis. But when I start reporting I make a campaign which may last a few months, and all this time all I'm doing is mostly reporting spam. I even barely make a few posts per week. My last reporting campaign took course between last winter and this spring and I even had days when I reported more than 1000 posts in a single day. I just stayed in front of the monitor, for 8 hours per day or so, and report each spam I encountered. It was difficult to stop and take a break However, together we keep this forum clean!
