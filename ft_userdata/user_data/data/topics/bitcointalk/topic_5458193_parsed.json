      "body": "If you want to use Wasabi because of their CoinJoin feature and for your privacy, it is important that you know there is zero privacy when you use Wasabi's CoinJoin feature, they work with a blockchain surveillance company to spy on your UTXO before either allowing you or not to use their CoinJoin. So if your purpose is privacy, use other options like Joinmarket or use Whirlpool through Sparrow wallet.Coinbase like every other centralized exchange are pro-censorship, so they can always flag your coins as tainted because it came from CoinJoin a transaction and they can confiscate your funds, for that not to happen you have to use a decentralized exchange like Bisq to trade your coins without a third party spying on you and your UTXO. But if you decide to use Coinbase, do not send UTXO that are from CoinJoin transactions to avoid losing your money.",

      "body": "It is risky to transfer your coins after using a Coin Join transaction or a Mixing service. Gambling sites, exchanges always do have techniques to detect tainted coins from such process. Strictly said, likely most of bitcoin are tainted after many used UTXOs in the past so far if we don't use criteria how many past UTXOs will be considered for a definition of tainted coin.Fortunately exchanges, gambling sites don't trace to far into the past to find tainted coins. Bitcoin Q&A: Blacklists, Taint, and Wallet FingerprintingCareful if you want to send your 'tainted' coin (after CoinJoin, Mixing) to a centralized platform. Don't send all your coins to them in one transaction but if your first transaction does not bring issue (account freeze etc.), it does not mean later transactions will be good.",

Check very well it is not version 2 or if it is, check very well CoinJoin is OFF.The main problem with Wasabi Wallet 2.0 is that users retain control over the coins themselves, but lose the ability to decide which actions to perform with them or what information to share with third parties. Auto-CoinJoin, the absence of proper coin control, and information leakage through connecting to external blockchain analysis API make it impossible for a user to avoid troubles with centralized exchanges since those illegal coins filtering mechanisms greatly harm fungibility and make Bitcoin less suitable for everyday transactions. If you have a seed phrase for your wallet stored somewhere, it is better to export it to another wallet like Sparrow or Electrum, recreate all address labels, and carefully send coins to Coinbase. You need to label the addresses you control to be able to distinguish between those connected to your real identity and those that aren't. If you only have an encrypted backup of Wasabi Wallet, then the only option is to send coins to another wallet via Bitcoin Network: in this case, it is better to send all UTXOs one by one to separate addresses so that an external observer can't apply common input ownership heuristic.",

Aside from the fact that he's buying the taint nonsense, he completely misses the point of tainting happening arbitrarily. For example, in 3:27 he tells coinjoin users to do K+1 transactions to themselves, because the exchange will look at the K most recent. First of all, that implies you're okay with the company treating the currency as non-fungible (which you shouldn't be), and second, no exchange will ever tell you what's K because that would allow everyone to \"clean\" their coins, which can't happen as the purpose of taint is to grant the exchange the power to determine the identity of each coin.",

They have a non-custodial version of Coinbase Commerce so the minimum withdrawal on this service would be whatever is the minimum amount you can send on the Bitcoin network which is usually a few cents. As far as their exchange goes I no longer have an account there but the minimum withdrawal is certainly more than $1. I believe it used to be 0.005 BTC a few years ago.",
