Eth Classic and Ravencoin may not be profitable to mine right now, but I guess it is a good bet as they will certainly rise in value in the next cycle. Guess, I'll keep it to Raven half month and the other half I'll mine Eth classic",

If you ever can sustain and hold it while paying your electricity expenses with other source of income, the better. It's just the same as accumulating with the use of your money but this time, you're mining it.As you have decided to mine those two, I wish you luck and hopefully we all bounce back when the market is better and up again. Because it's likely that chosen altcoins will be up again for the next bull cycle.",

He chasing a new coin2 it's not being listed or listed on small exchange for hoping getting a giant chunck money.Some of the coin is give a good result, he got a nice money comparing mining major coin. IMO, if you have small hashrate (Mining major coin only wasting time and money electricity).Better gambling with a new coin or coin with small exchange.",

I haven't done mining because electricty in my country is expensive and I'm a bit worried that things won't work as planned. But my friend tried mining Bitcoin, he's quite earning decent but hesitated to tell me exactly how much is the net profit from doing so. But given that it worked for him. Also GPU had an increase in its market price the time I planned to start which again, forced me to postpone my plan. So I'm suggesting Bitcoin still. In the first place it has the highest chance to get a price increase once the bullish trend start. Major coins would be the best picks in my own opinion. But as other users have mention raven coin is indeed  good coin to mine, will be vouching for it as well.",

So I guess that it would be better to have a Bitcoin Node simply by the stake of supporting the network than mining Bitcoin with GPUs. Thing is you would have to have an insane amount of GPU rigs to make some bitcoin out of it",

Its possible that the coin can reach 0.01$ some day and now it's in between 0.005$ to 0.006$.Mining coins right now is not profitable, if you are paying for your grid power it's a bad idea but if you have free power you can make a lot mining now and holding till bull season gets here.",

But I'm still thinking I could go with Eth classic.With GPUs, you should choose Ethereum Classic because it has been tested many years in crypto market. It is not like new fork that has unknown future. ETC is a good altcoin that survives in some bear markets and blackswan events.Its bull run in 2020 is very good evidence to consider holding it for 2024 and 2025 bull run.QuoteConsidering that there is no more ethereum to mine what are you guys now mining, or what do you guys think it would be the best to hoard and then wait for a good price upon the next bull market?Don't choose new forks because if no developer or very few developers join and build them up, they will be like dead forks. See at hundred of Bitcoin forks that are nearly dead.See many privacy coins that are nearly dead too.",

Because you are not only risking your time, but you also pay more electricity bills this time and risking your computer components if you go for full time mining. And also you are not gonna be 100% sure if the coins you choose will be one of the next big things in the future.",
