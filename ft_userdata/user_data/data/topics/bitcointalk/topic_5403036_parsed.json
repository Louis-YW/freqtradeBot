  "content": "Today I read in the news that the Dutch Gambling Authority, has prohibited the use of role models in gambling ads. This law will take effect from June 30. The gambling industry is very regulated. Now casinos will have to get super creative and think outside the box to create captivating adverts. Also, investigations are ongoing regarding the failure of some gambling operators to check and prevent players who registered on the Cruks self-exclusion scheme from gaining access control in slot machine arcades. And they risk getting punished if they are found guilty.Again, this begs the question. Does self-exclusion actually work? And in this case, will the gamblers be punished also for failing to take responsibility for their recovery from addiction despite registering in the self-exclusion scheme?

It is used to maintain a list of users which have decided to exclude themselves from gambling and is used to stop them from registering and playing with licensed gambling operators.Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 17, 2022, 10:56:12 PM...Again, this begs the question. Does self-exclusion actually work? This is the second thread about self-exclusion in an hour hehe. These laws and policies doesn't completely work just like how other laws doesn't totally prevent people from committing other crimes.QuoteAnd in this case, will the gamblers be punished also for failing to take responsibility for their recovery from addiction despite registering in the self-exclusion scheme?The rule seems more focus on the gambling operators than the gamblers........Banning role models from participating in gambling related ads looks like a good move. Kids who look up to these people may be saved from gambling addiction because of that. Maybe Dutch Gambling Authority should completely ban all adverts.",

Maybe Dutch Gambling Authority should completely ban all adverts.I will say so too, it would be a good move, it has come to the time that gambling ads are advertised on the many channels that kids are watching. In my country, even the biggest show is sponsored many times by the biggest betting platform in my country, many people are exposed to this including kids and teens that are lesser than 18 years of age. Not only that, it goes beyond, YouTube videos partaining to my country are full of gambling ads, and many more like that. I will still prefer gambling to be advertised on a forum like this rather than online places that kids and teens are visiting often.",

      "body": "The regulation may limit advertisements that are considered intrusive or may attract minors to gamble freely. But if it's to limit minors, I think it also depends on how parents look after their children because no matter how strict the rules, if parents can't do their job as parents, it won't work out well.In addition, self-exclusion can also work if gamblers are aware that they can take care of themselves in playing gambling and have a responsibility not to become addicted. If they could have that, I think self-exclusion would work as it should.",

I don't think there will be repercussions on the side of the gambler when they failed to follow their own self-exclusion terms. But it would be better if fines were to be imposed, because in that case the problematic gambler would really think before trying to break their isolation from gambling platforms. If ever this goes full steam, this will give a chance to problematic gamblers to curb their addiction before it sets them to do stupid things even further and to possibly lose everything they have. The ban on gambling adverts and self-exclusion is a start, and a very much welcome strategy especially if full implementation becomes realized.",

Also, they need to give people consideration like free checkups and some other things to give them choices or to not play anymore because they cannot handle themselves anymore because of their addiction.

Self-exclusion can work for some people but I do not think it is nowhere near as effective as some people may believe it is, after all even if all the casinos in a single country participated into creating the best self-exclusion system they can as long as those people are willing to gamble they can still open an account at an online casino outside the country and gamble as much money as they want without facing any issue, so unless the addicted gamblers have already decided to give up gambling for good then the effectiveness of self-exclusion will be on the low side.",

This is a good,  the status of these celebrities that many idolise should not be exploited by these casino's to promote their businesses. The money offered to some of the role models by these casino's is difficult to turn down, because even your role models need money. Some of these celebrities and role models may not even actually themselves be involved in gambling, but because of their status, people who look up to them may be enticed to use the services of a casino because it was endorsed by their role model. In my country, a popular legendary footballer was made to dance for an advert for a gambling site, it was a very hilarious advertisement considering the status of this role model, but you can imagine the amount of money he was offered to do such. This is exactly what i mean by casino's and gambling platforms exploiting the popularity of a celebrity/role model.Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 17, 2022, 10:56:12 PMDoes self-exclusion actually work? It can actually work if after signing up for self exclusion, join a help group for people who signed up for exclusion as well. Together with others in a group, you can do better than trying to stay disciplined on your own.",

I mean influencers are something that could impact it, but why go towards influencers into casino instead of casino into influencer method? Instead of people who are famous appearing on a casinos ad, it should be an influencer promoting the casino on their page instead, that would be a lot better and profitable for them.Look at drake and stake for example, we get to see drake gambling there plenty plenty of times and that is how it should be. In any case, dutch are a bit weird about gambling, they do not even allow pack opening in games like 2k and fifa.",
