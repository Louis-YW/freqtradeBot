  "content": "Bitcoin is a digital currency that is decentralized for peer-to-peer transactions. I see Bitcoin has a normal currency just like fiat that is used for daily transactions of goods and services. I am a lover of Bitcoin and I am very passionate about it even though it is volatile but also a good investment for long term holders. There is great opportunity for holders to benefit as the market fluctuate from one price to another. As the new elected manager of my gas station, I have successfully initiate the use of Bitcoin as an alternative payment to help advocate and promote the use of great digital currency called  BTC. I am a Bitcoin lover and I intend to encourage the use in my local region so customers can pay and get to know about it. I see Bitcoin as both investment and a currency and the company can make more if we hold it in respective of the market conditions.I know how challenging it can be to introduce an option for payment in Bitcoin, but with time customers may prefer it to fiat in respective of the network fee. It was never easy for me to convince the board about having an option for payment in Bitcoin, and I am happy for the enormous knowledge I was able to gather here and those that advised me on making this a success.",

Since they might be getting some decent amount of BTC from their customers without decreasing their usual income because people will pay with BTC are not many compared to those who pay with fiat.",

Because they are not used to it, maybe many will choose fiat and compare it, but if many local residents know and use Bitcoin, then BTC payments at your refueling point will start to go mainstream.Keep fighting!",

Even now it isn't legal and the usage is in an unregulated state. During the early days of ban users associated with cryptocurrency transaction were fined heavily. Amidst the ban, usage of cryptocurrencies around Nigeria grew high with time. The government is much focused on developing eNaira to restrict people from using cryptocurrencies. Among survey taken with 154 countries, Nigeria takes the 6th position in terms of P2P volume.When taken on the positive note, this is really good for a community that has got good number of cryptocurrency users. By the time the business person should also consider the government order, which might bring legal issues.",

If this is right, then this gas station is probably violating something. Perhaps a kind of voucher could somehow skirt the policy? Let's probably hear it from the people of Nigeria themselves.

It's either nobody is really interested to pay gas with Bitcoin or that even if they want to pay in Bitcoin, they know of the implication and would therefore prefer to pay in fiat. Unless the customer is intentionally choosing this particular gas station so as to try buying gas with Bitcoin.",

Perhaps more people would embrace BTC, after the Bitcoin price drops even further down. Usually,  the mass BTC adoption among small businesses gets postponed in times of high price volatility. I really hope that the upcoming crypto winter will bring more price stability for Bitcoin(which will be temporary, of course), which might lead more businesses and individuals into adopting BTC and using it as normal currency.The fact, that countries in Latin America and Africa are more open towards to Bitcoin/crypto compared to the countries in Europe, Asia and North America is kinda disturbing.

Last I heard, Nigeria issued a ban on crypto transactions. Central Bank of Nigeria banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but this does not stop some businesses from accepting bitcoin. But I can say the ban is affecting and some businesses would rather not accept bitcoin payment because of the ban. But it is not a total ban, it is just an implicit ban. After the ban, I have read news of a school that accepted bitcoin and also a hotel that even wanted to have some of his reserve in bitcoin and accept bitcoin paymen. I do not know if they finally did accepted or still accepting bitcoin, but so far the bank do not know about your p2p, then you are good, while there is nothing they can do because you accept bitcoin.Quote from: Darker45 on May 26, 2022, 12:59:07 AMAnyway, is LN also in place here?

Likely most customers (99%) of that gas station will prefer to pay in Naira. As for lightning network, I do not know if it is necessary, if the transaction does not support replace-by-fee and with fee which is enough to get transaction confirmed, then unconfirmed transactions of this type can be accepted. Although, this is just based on my opinion as I can accept on-chain bitcoin transaction in a gas station, as well as lightning payments.",

I am also curious to know whether the owner himself/herself knows what the manager did to the business.Let's see if one of the many Nigerians on the forum can clarify this for us.To keep it brief and simple. The Nigerian government has not issued a total ban on cryptocurrency; the CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) has only restricted banks from engaging in crypto transactions; banks' credit cards have been deactivated on exchanges and other crypto-related websites. We have centralized exchanges and shops that continue to advertise cryptocurrency on local TV and newspapers, we have shops that accept bitcoin payment, and I also run a local business that accepts bitcoin payment.The only way to convert your crypto assets to fiat is through p2p, and we do it smartly. Both the sender and the receiver must be smart in order for the bank not to notice, so while making payment, the sender must include something like \"payment for furniture\" or come up with something. If any crypto-related word is mentioned in the transaction, both the sender and the receiver's bank accounts will be automatically frozen; this is what the crypto restrictions in Nigeria are all about.Edit: Charles-Tim beat me to it!!
