  "content": "Joining other financial institutions to receive permission to operate as a Digital Assets Service Provider (DASP) is one of France's oldest banks, SG Forge, a digital asset division of the Société Générale which have been in existence for 150 years. The institution has been granted the right by L'Autorité Des Marchés Financiers (AMF) to start offering crypto related services.  This step marks a huge positive development for SG as after it was launched in 2018, it quickly emerged to become the leading department to champion digital assets in the financial institution.This approval seems to be the latest to join the other Financial institutions in France as earlier this year, Binance became the first leading crypto company to gain approval and it's acceptance marked the largest crypto currency exchange's approval in Europe.Although, SG Forge have not been given access to operate as a trading platform, it's still a plus for them as they are next after Singapore based crypto platform, Crypto.com to be given DASP recognizance.

I don't know the situation of crypto activities in France but this will probably increase crypto awareness to some extent. a few days ago there was similar news about google and coinbase offering crypto services, I think in time these types of institutions that provide crypto services will be everywhere, this is how crypto will spread fast.",

You read like a racist or at the very least an exclusionary btc maximumizer.At the milfster.I am thinking since it is including all of crypto and it is a service offered.economics is best not altcoins as suggested by the guy I quoted.Nice find on your part. and it will affect btc along with other coins.thanks.",

Sadly, we've read about such exciting stuff that should've jumped Bitcoin and the entire crypto market but which didn't expectedly. I won't be disappointed if this doesn't at the end too. France is a country with influence on the world map and economics too. Let's see how things go from here. However, don't get your hopes high on it so you won't get thrown under the bus, so to speak.",

Yeah, that's the great part of it. There's still balance if we look at it as a whole continent but let's just appreciate it for France as it's the main topic that OP has brought up. Although we know that there are still many EU countries that are not into it but good to see that some of them are starting to recognize and add some service like this that would bring up more people into adoption. When it's come to these news, these are good news and hoping to see more like these.",
