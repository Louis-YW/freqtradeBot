  "content": "Trailer was goosebumps. BGM, Kabir line, and ofc the last Bobby Deol scene. I think this movie is going to be pure entertainment. ¬†Has mature rating, hopefully they don't over do it. Ranvir looks great in suit and beard. Can't believe he's 40+. What do you think about movie?",

      "body": "Went today afternoon show and came back an hour ago. Watched the movie with my partner and it was a crazy ride for me. I never expected a Hindi movie going so deep into the sex, blood and above all action. The storyline is bit crazy but the script keeps everyone engaged and glued to the movie. Ranbir Kapoor was amazing after Barfi. I still feel that Barfi was his best movies as an actor. I somehow still felt he never came out of the Sanju movie character in some scenes. Bobby Deol only arrives in the second half but has an impactful performance without any dialogue. He has matured as an actor without being labelled as a nepo kid. Rashmika Mandanna could have done better to her character as I felt she failed those intense moment as a wife of a psycho killer. Anil Kapoor as usual was at his best. The movie is quite engaging has good action, good dark comedy, too many kissing scenes üòÅ and is truly different from what Bollywood has been producing. Thanks to the director, writer and editors (Sandeep Reddy Vanga) from South India who made something different for us.",
