When the wallet opens, you should be able to see both transactions and overall balance as long as you're properly connected to a server (see if there's is a green icon on the bottom right side).",

If yes then it will create you a new set of addresses so its a different wallet but what you mean by 4 words? Did your recovery seed contain only 4 words? Because, generally it is supposed to be 12/18/24 words.Make sure that you have the right recovery seeds and enter the seeds as it is.",

Here is a link where you can check the correct spelling of worlds https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/lib/old_mnemonic.pyYou can cross check the process you follow from this article on how to recover standard wallet by seed https://bitcoinelectrum.com/restoring-your-standard-wallet-from-seed/Mind you electrum is a word sensitive wallet, if your seed phrase is correct but you type in UPPER CASE instead of lower case it will open either new one or not you have to check the first like to confirm your spelling then write in the correct/type caseThe two link as provided by @Abdussamad",

What do you mean by that? According to the post made by OP in another thread, he/she has 4 words and a single character. how to access from phrases only.Quote from: Churchillvv on December 10, 2023, 07:46:40 AMMind you electrum is a word sensitive wallet, if your seed phrase is correct but you type in UPPER CASE instead of lower case it will open either new one or not you have to check the first like to confirm your spelling then write in the correct/type caseIf a seed phrase has been generated by electrum, it's not case-sensitive.If you have a BIP39 seed phrase and you import it into electrum, you should use lowercase letters. Otherwise, you will see a message saying \"unknown wordlist\" and you will generate a different wallet. To OP:You didn't need to create a new topic for your issue. You had already created a topic about your issue and it's much better to continue there.",

(spoiler: 104th don't use it) It's a valid seed but it's not owned by anyone.Another thing is, Electurm is confirgured to generate its seed phrase using the wordlist in its source code which is the same as BIP39's.So a mnemonic that consist of 4 words and a letter can't be a seed phrase once generated by Electrum by another user.",
