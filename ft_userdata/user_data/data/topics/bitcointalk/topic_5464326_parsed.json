  "content": "While my account was in the red, vave was withdrawing money without any problems. At the moment I had $27,500 deposited on my account and not a single withdrawal. Of course they won't ask me for any documents as long as I bring them my money.After 10-12 days, I started to break away and increase my balance and made a withdrawal of $12,500 without problems (the account was still in the red by $15k). The second withdrawal also went without problems. I ordered another $12,000 for withdrawal a week after the first withdrawal. The account was still negative, which is probably why the withdrawal went quickly and without problems.But 2 days ago, the bets started winning one by one and the account balance became $18,000 (if you count the account balance, it turns out that my balance is in positive territory by $1,500 for 3 weeks of my account life).On the third withdrawal of $10,500, vave was asked for verification. I am a resident of Russia, so I have a Russian Federation passport. But who would have thought that vave are so arrogant and can impose sanctions on sports betting for only one country. And it naturally turned out to be Russia. I registered on August 1st and there was no clause in their terms-and-conditions that players from Russia cannot bet on sports, I am more than sure of this.And the funny thing is that the site supports 19 different languages, respectively, the section \"Terms and Conditions\" is translated into all available 19 languages. And Clause 2.1. in \"Terms and Conditions\", where it says about the ban on players from Russia is only on the English version of the site. No other language has this item.I sent photos within 40 minutes of the verification request and received a response after 80 minutes. That is, verification was fast. As a result, the balance was $18,000, of which $15,000 was confiscated by vave, and $3,000 was given to me (apparently as a gesture of goodwill). This is nothing short of racist and making up rules on the fly. Because banning players from a single country from betting on sports is blatant discrimination.",

There are 11 clauses under the \"(2) General Terms\" in English version, where there are 10 clauses in other language version. Perhaps, they have added the clause 2.1 recently.BTW, do you still have access to your account? You should share some evidence here to make your claim valid. Screenshot of the deposit and withdrawal history, screenshot of the conversations with their support agent.",

It seems like a shady business tbh.  He has for sure read the clauses of the terms and conditions. Otherwise I don't think he would blow up like this, as well as vave.com taking up the mistake and reinstating access on his account and giving back his money with 3000 on top of that. There has been a clear mistake on vave's part here which is the lack of transparency on their end. It would've been easy to put out an announcement or a notification on their platform stating that some things will be changed in their terms and conditions, but they still carried on with it not knowing that some of their players have done their homework and read the service agreements before pressing \"I agree\". I don't think it's particularly racist, although I understand how OP feels since this is a personal attack, but that doesn't mean they could just do it willy-nilly to customers and users.",

I think so too, because I hace witnessed how many services, not only casinos and not only related to cryptocurrencies, give priority to commercial translations, while the legal ones are treated like secondary info, not really necessary for making money fast, which seems to be the most important. If they don't mind to risk and don't want to avoid legal actions against them is up to them, of course, but it is a bit discouraging to see how many services fail in doing important things like this well.",
