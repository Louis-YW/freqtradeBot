I visited first time this website and filled waitlist form but i don't know what is main usecase of this website. I wonder to see that Coinbase, Bloomberg, Coindesk and other big name using this platform. I tried to sign-in but its requires waitlist and no other option to sign up.

      "body": "The project looks very interesting, I also joined the waitlist, does anyone have a clear idea of the ETA before we can test the AI ourselves?Quote from: ItsCrafty on April 19, 2023, 07:57:49 AM* See what top traders/investors are doing in real time & using historical data* Predict future market movements by using on-chain data to track the flow of funds* Track your portfolio and historical performance* Conduct due diligence* Conduct research on & observe illicit fund flows - on-chain sleuthing* Inform your research & reporting using real-time on-chain data & analytics I wonder how this AI will help in relation to Conduct Due Diligence. It could be very useful for many companies.This type of tool could assist online casino managers, owners of different platforms and by simplifying tasks and thus reducing \"human\" work costs, it could encourage people to integrate crypto payments on their platform.In any case, I'm very interested by the functionalities, I hope to be able to test all this soon and that it will keep the promises made!I'm very sceptical about \"Predict future market movements by using on-chain data to track the flow of funds\" but I'm just waiting to see the result with a little hindsight.Thanks for sharing OP!",
