  "content": "Russia wants Ukraine to be abandoned without any help from the West, so they'd continue to strike and maim with impunity. The sad reality though is that USA and European Union has continued to appease the Kremlin much to the disappointment of Ukraine. Their reasons being that they don't want the war to escalate. But the truth is that you can't stop escalation by appeasing a dictator. Rather he would be emboldened to advance with impunity.Having sensed the weakness shown so far by the west, Russia is capitalizing on that to threaten anyone who tries to supply weapons to the Ukrainian Military. This is where America and Europe has to draw the lines and move in with full intent by supplying Kiev with all the weapons they needed to prosecute this war. Not only with their self defense, but to be armed with the ability to launch great offensives against the Russians. Ukraine should not only defend. They should be able to attack and hit Russian territories. That's the only way to balance the equation and possibly tilt the war in favor of Ukraine.Ukraine has held back the supposed super power for 3 months,  limited them to the border towns. The last thing Russia would want is trying to goad a 'Real War Tested Superpower' into a direct confrontation. Russia is not in the same league with the US when it comes to conventional warfare and they know it. You can see from the latest map that Russia has not been able to advance beyond the border towns and the few coastal cities, some of which they have been pushed back from, town after town. You can't win a war by simply defending your territory. You need to launch equal or surpassing devastation against your enemy in order to deter them. THE US SUPPLY TO UKRAINE SO FAR 1. The Javelin anti-tank missiles 2. Switchblade drones3. Artillery and body armor4. Some high-tech equipment like laser-guided rocket systems 5. Surveillance radar6. Mi-17 helicoptersThis was detailed in a recent list circulated by the Department of Defense.Increase in the supply of offensive lethal weapons to Ukraine will help stop Putin and accelerate the end to his madness. This stupid war has to end now.Note: I've never been in support of straining the USA resources to fight foreign wars that does not concern us but this is different. Ukraine will pay for the weapons and a dictator has to be stopped before it's too late.",

You live next to a neighbor who woke up one day and started raining stones and bottles in your house,  breaking your roof and hitting your children and wife and injuring some. He continues without let up, and even coming closer and closer. What would you do in this scenario? Try to defend your compound with trampoline and give your children umbrella for protection? Giving him all the freedom in world to keep kitting your home while his own household goes about in total freedom and safety. Or you hit back at his own house, wrecking equal havoc while protecting your home?Which do you think would be more effective strategy?",

Main character chased him, tried to stop him outside his house, accidentally hit him with a bat to the head and killed him. Got into the jail. The society though he is more dangerous than a robber, because his actions continued aggression. In your case, if he USA supply Ukraine with weapons to attack Russia, what makes Ukraine different from Russia? They are attackers now. Isnt it? Should the world put sanctions against them also? Ban them from getting into EU or NATO? Who needs a neighbour that can turn from victim to an attacker in one second?",

Ukraine is fighting with great wills, and have the guts to challenge the Russia army with average Weaponry. They have killed tens of generals, taken countless of tanks and destroyed many. Repelled the invaders from towns after towns. They did all these with near mediocre weapons. Now, imagine them being equipped with advanced high-tech offensive made in the USA weapons?

And the worst situation is in occupied area. Firstly, russians kills all those who are not loyal or have pro-ukrainian view (i know cases from my the circle of people i know). Secondly, because russian are very bad at planning and infrastructure, they create humanitarian problems on occupied territories. I know relatives in Berdyansk, and they tell that situation in the city are very bad: lack of food, water and medicine. Russians not allow to import this things from ukrainian territory, but for some reasons don't fulfil this goods from their territory. So, your main idea is to left ukrainians without weapons to create more Berdyansks. Brilliant plan.",
