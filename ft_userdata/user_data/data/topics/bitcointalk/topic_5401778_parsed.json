They could be like some nations and come out and straight up ban cryptocurrency, but they haven’t.  Regulation is needed.  If they didn't have some sort of regulation then I think the crypto atmosphere would suffer on a number of levels.",

Just as hugeblack rightly said Bitcoin is a decentralized asset and can not be controlled by the sec decision or any regulations only exchange and other services can be regulated, the SEC have been silent on blockchain technology as that is outside the scope of SEC what they're interested in are the digital currencies that are operated within the blockchain which is just a portion of the blockchain so the SEC has no strong standing law against blockchain industry.",

      "body": "my view of regulators is that they should be more concerned and emphasising the consumer protection side of things, and less concerned with the consumer suspicious behaviour side.EG they want exchanges to monitor the customers. but the regulators dont really monitor the businesses to the same fine detail. and instead wait for customers to complain to regulators about bad exchanges.. . this doesnt seem a fair balancethis is because regulators are very willing and happy to arrest suspicious customers and send people that do petty crimes of $1k-$10k through the court system . yet when exchanges fleece/steal/scam/cause issues to thousands of users where millions of dollars are lost... .. they do flimsy investigations.. and demand small petty fines in comparison to exchanges yearly salesEG if someone is on say minimum wage meaning $20k a year salary, but gets a large fine bigger than their early income.. then businesses that do bad things should be fined more then their yearly sales too... its only fair.but with that rant said. legitimising businesses can help people learn which are the exchanges that would most likely still be operating in a few years and would look after customers funds better. compared to the wild west scenario scenario of 2010-2017* where any website stating to being an exchange could just run off with customers funds and no one could tell the difference.(*think about all the exchanges that ever existed. but no longer operating in recent years)",

Recently, binance is under investigation only God knows what the outcome would look like. I need you honest opinion.Bit of a strange stance to take against the SEC, it has a very hard job to do between regulating potentially manipulative market behaviors, looking after end users who might be susceptible to new schemes (NFT's kinda imploded recently) and trying to create laws that are not too stifling either. In fairness to them they gave cryptocurrency a rather light touch when it came to regulation, many other oppressive countries haven chosen to ban such technology outright. If anything the SEC is usually far behind the curve and could be taking a more proactive stance against risky trends in the market place. I'd say we're getting off lightly based on how it is enforcing it right now.",

SEC has just been too vocal about scams, their campaign is very helpful to the community in spreading awareness but somehow, people have just been ignoring them. I guess they need to be more aggressive in dealing with this scam and Ponzi scheme issues otherwise, many people still become a victim of these evil activities.",

SEC consideration, potential approval, reject, etc. In a few weeks, few months, market can be affected negatively but after a few years, the market grows very bullish.I don't see reasonable why it takes 5 years for SEC to try investigating about Binance. It is likely a fud, not actual news about investigation from SEC.QuoteAs for the blockchain, it is decentralized and therefore it is difficult to impose government control over it, but the more we have strong central platforms and they are investigated, the faster we develop.Decentralization, anonymous transaction are parts of blockchain.

How is that helping us? Like last year, they realized that USDT is not backed properly, and needed to liquidate some amount, which USDT did and thank god for that, but then SEC charged them with 19 million dollars or something if I am not wrong, then let them be.So right now, USDT could be not backed again, nobody would know. This is why I believe that they are basically extorting money from the bad companies to keep on scamming us and nothing more, not helping us at all.",
