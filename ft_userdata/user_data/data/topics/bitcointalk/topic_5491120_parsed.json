I also thought about fairness and financial self-sovereignty in the future when reading the Bitcoin Whitepaper, but to be honest, I think the role of BTC has changed now: BTC is not yet a common currency outside of El Salvador. BTC is seen as an asset for accumulation or investment. The biggest value I still see in BTC is that it helps me self-custody the value of my labor without fear of being affected by inflation or government asset freezes.Some people say that BTC is leading the entire crypto market, but I don't think this is important to me because I don't hold any altcoins I am also quite concerned about the negative impact of spot BTC ETFs on decentralization, self-custody, and the ongoing financial revolution, but perhaps there is nothing I can do to change the inevitable trend of the financial market, where BTC has become an important part.",

Yes, indeed Bitcoin is a beacon of hope for both the present and future of finance due to it's potentiality offering us an asset medium where we can still have full control and access over our funds without third party restrictions, because truly, long before the emergence of Bitcoin, we all know how the financial system works, whereby though there was security of funds, we never had full access and control over the movement of our funds, hence Bitcoin came to break such barrier, and yet still providing value to those who stick to hodling it, rather than keeping money in banks, which are prone to economic inflation.",

Bitcoin spending over a decade and doing greatly well can be a pointer to bitcoin potentials for the future and even the present moment because bitcoin is much more easier for transfer of ownership and long term holding as an asset without any third party involvement thos freedom make bitcoin suitable for all both the bankable and unbanked alike and so much so we have to point to the financial I dependence that comes alongÂ  with bitcoin and holding it within a certain period of time.First of all with bitcoin,Â  the holder have the ð¯ right and control over the asset and can send I to any receiving wallet without any trace unless for non custodial transactions, bitcoin is the best financial tool for a time like this when the traditional economy is in crisis and need alternative to ease individuals pressure in both investmentsÂ  and currency for daily transactions.",

Very true and this is a very important issue and also requires a long time that will never be known for how long, it is true what the OP said, but we also have to think about this issue.And to use Bitcoin it must be supported by circumstances, facilities, intelligence and also the ability to think to develop and financial capabilities. And these are all very important provisions to have, and many poor people experience problems with all of this, including internet access which still has many problems, especially in remote areas.",

I just thought to share it here. Bitcoin holds many opportunities that would be beneficial to individuals, corporate bodies and even nations. Decentralization gives people the freedom to use money the way they want without restrictions placed by the government. It also promotes privacy which enables individuals to hide their financial transactions or worth. Currently, Bitcoin is used more as an investment than a currency. In most countries where it is popular it is hardly used to pay for goods and services but many people use it as a speculative asset. Although the currency could be bought in bits which gives people the opportunity to buy based on their income many people still cannot afford to buy it. In the future, I also think that it will be difficult for low-income earners to have access to it. So I doubt if Bitcoin will promote an equitable and inclusive financial system.Bitcoin promotes decentralization but from the way institutional investors are rushing into the sector, centralisation is now becoming the order of the day. Many people are now attracted to investment packages offered by some ETF providers instead of having the keys to their investment. Maybe things will turn out better in the future.",

True, not all people can understand bitcoin or they could not even utilize and maximize the potential of bitcoin, in short bitcoin is not for everyone, so yeah bitcoin may not be the solution for all people who is facing financial problems or the economy problems, because economy is a bigger problem so we can't expect that bitcoin alone can solve it, and how can bitcoin solve the economy problems if not all people can be able to do bitcoin or earn from it, let's face it, no matter how powerful bitcoin is, if not majority of people can utilize and use it then it doesn't change a thing, right now bitcoin or crypto currency is only know to certain number of people around the world and not all are ready or open to knowing and adopting it. Even with the current price of bitcoin, not all people wanting to invest in it can earn or ride the bull run. Some will, of course, stumble as they don't have proper guidance in navigating bitcoin.",

Religious sects are also giving \"hope for the future\" to their members.Communism also gave a hope for the future to all socialists/communists, in the form of an egalitarian utopian society, where all needs will be met and there will be no poor people and exploitation.That's why I'm always skeptical about any ideology or system that gives the people \"a hope for the future\". Everyone hopes that Bitcoin will hit moon and they will make some easy money, but what happens after Bitcoin hits the moon? Will the price stay on the moon?  it will most likely crash and go down. Maybe it's the ups and downs of the BTC price that are giving hope to the traders.Anyway, I agree with the \"be your own bank\" principle of BTC, but most Bitcoiners are using centralized crypto exchanges so this seems more like hypocrisy to me.",
