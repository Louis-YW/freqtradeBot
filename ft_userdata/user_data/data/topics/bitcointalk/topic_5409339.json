  "content": "Fiat currency is a stagnant currency which is also known as stable currency. It is only dollar controls the rising and falling of the fiat currency. Dollar asks fiat to devalue itself for it (dollar) to go up and refusal of fiat to devalue itself attracts sanction from dollar either by not supporting the fiat developmental plans and disobeying the fiat foreign policies. And that becomes dollar-centric currency. In the other hand, Bitcoin is a progressive currency that came to the world to change the transaction process of assets among people. Change is invitable and any living organism that does not adapt to change is already a dead specie. States are living organisms that developed from stages.In any society there are two groups of people exist. 1.   The Conservativist : The conservativist are those that do not want any developmental changes in their domain.  They don’t want any development project so they are against bitcoin and other crypto currencies. They see bitcoin as bad project or currency. They are contented with the stagnant currency (fiat currency).  Most of our old generational age group or groups of people belong to this group. They even against the development of human nature.  They do not adopt change.2.   The Progressivist:  These are the people who believe in the society.  They adopt new things to develop the society and adapt to the adoption. Bitcoin was created and launched to change the central control of transaction between two or more and that is call p2p and also to make transaction easy for users and other benefits are attached to it yet the conservativeists reject cryptocurrency (bitcoin) probably they might not benefit it like they way they are with the fiat currency.",

You can act all shocking and cool and  strut around with Bitcoin ads all over but that doesn't say anything about your stance as a financial conservative/progressive.I'm probably Conservative just by my DCA-ing alone.",

      "body": "Fiat is never truly stable. Most of the time, it devaluates at a predicted rate that is considered reasonable and not hurtful by those making monetary policies (5% annual inflation rate). Many times, things go wrong and fiat currencies go A LOT above that 5% target (Turkish lira is currently at almost 80%, Argentine peso is at around 90%, Ukrainian hryvnia is at around 30%). Even those fiat currencies which are considered very strong are not doing that well sometimes: the USD is at 9%, EUR is at 9.6%.Bitcoin is sometimes very volatile on a short-term scale, more than even those fiat currencies that are doing badly. But it also often grows in value, which isn't something that normally happens with fiat. In any case, Bitcoin adoption is very far from fiat adoption, so they're not really competing like this. Even pro-Bitcoin people often see it as something other than a payment method.",

Today, see how large the Bitcoin community is. It will expand more day by day once the old leader will be expired. You know centralized governments don't like to lose control over the currency hence they are against Bitcoin. But who knows if they are accumulating for themselves? So some people always will be against Bitcoin, but still, Bitcoin growing well.",

Now look at the countries you mentioned above that have the highest % but is not doing well as the dollar. Do you asked yourself why it is like that? Do you know why dollar is accepted everywhere in the world? Why Ghana Cedis is not accepted currency in world to be used? I dont know if you are from USA but I am saying the truth. There is conservative and progressive mindset and remember USA is a progressive State.",

There is conservative and progressive mindset and remember USA is a progressive State.USA is the global military and economic superpower. That's why the world uses USD for transactions.Ghana is just an underdeveloped country with a weak economy. Who the hell in the world would use the national currency of Ghana outside the borders of Ghana?I guess that by \"stable\" you don't mean having a stable price. It means that the majority of people consider it that way.All this progressive vs. conservative comparison is kinda pointless. Those are political ideologies, not technology concepts.The USA is governed by the US Democrats and they are supposed to be progressive, but they are actually quite conservative when it comes to cryptocurrencies.The collision is more like traditionalist vs. innovative, rather than progressive vs. conservative.",

The all famous Charlie Chaplin movie the dictator had a quote saying if we fight each other then we would forget that we are hungry.Same goes here, if you constantly manage to make right and left fight, progressive vs conservative, liberal vs whatever and constantly keep on making them fight, then they will not realize that no matter what the world is, there are people at the top managing the world to bring them power and money and a great life, whereas you and me could have very different opinions about life and yet we would be crushed under the same power hungry politician, no matter what the ideology of that politician is because it happens in every nation with all kinds of imaginable ideas.",

I like your analysis. Although fiat currency to some extent is not stagnant or stable but fiat is stagnant or stable in the sense that it is control by national authority through bank and the currency notes are already printed without changes for all years. Like 1 dollar note has not been changed  since when I have been given birth but my country naira note has been changed by devalueing itself time without number. Naira never rise or go up in any time but always devalues itself and the goods and services increase rapidly like the dollar itself. That is one of the element made me to say fiat is stagnant or stable.",
