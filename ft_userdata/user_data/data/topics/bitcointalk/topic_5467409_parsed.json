When your seedphrase is in the hands of trusted person, then your bitcoin is safe but if it icn't in the hand of someone that you trust, your bitcoin will be gone for life. If this method works for you fine then go ahead. Everyone will have their different method on how they can transfer their bitcoin to their heir for inheritance, and emost people will come up with different suggestion.",

You can lose the second part and can not recover your wallet with 24 words you have.Write down 24 words as they are and back up, it's enough.",

You cant blame them though but i would really be totally agreeing on this set up on which having a will and make it notarized so that if ever there would really be some problems occur then you could really be having a fight or could really make out complaints and instead on making yourself that hassling and stressing about inheritance problem on how you would really be able to pass your coins into your family on the time that you do pass away then it would be that simple and less hassle i would say. This is what im planning too soon but since im not really that holding much coins which are really worth to be passed on then it would really be better to have those conventional ways like keeping these keys on a USB wallet and tell them about on how to access coins or converting them into cash once i do pass away but of course those flashdrives would really be keep hidden as much as possible. Of course i dont like for them to access it out while im still living but i might be putting it on a willbecause we dont know on what happens tomorrow whether we die or not.",

All you need to do is trust, trust your partner, give them the ideas and information because accidents could be anytime which I hope it would never happen. Because to be honest, if you'd make a more complicated way for them to inherit your wealth, they might ask another person to open it up for them which can scam and take the wealth. Just put a hardware wallet into a safe where you could simply give them the password and the key, just say only open it in case of emergency. For sure they would eventually understand you and follow your instructions.",

There are many paid versions available on multiple wallet platforms but if you still prefer the decentralized way then just go with 2 of 3 multi-sig keys and share one with another and one for you then the remaining one goes into the bank vault or someplace like that.",

The only thing we need to pay attention to here is trust. It may be difficult to find someone you can trust and you may have trust issues, but resorting to other methods may cause you to lose your password. Losing the second part will cause you big trouble.I think instead of looking for different methods for passwords, you should tell your loved ones about your savings and explain the situation.

If you have a trusted person who is a close family member, such as your husband or other relatives, if you don't have a spouse or even a best friend, it is good that you just tell the ones I mentioned if any of them you want to tell the seed phrase.Because I'm honestly speaking right now, I have seed phrases saved on my USB flash drive, and I plan to tell this to my wife because right now I'm the only one who knows everything I do here in the bitcoin or crypto business. In terms of the crypto assets I hold, such as emails and passwords from the exchange, wallets like Electrum or other wallets, and private keys from different network blockchains, I won't even need a third party for that, instead directly I will tell to my wife.",
