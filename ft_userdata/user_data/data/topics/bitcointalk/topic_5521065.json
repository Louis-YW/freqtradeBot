Let's not spread some false narratives just to get people hooked, some people has joined Crypto-currency and left because of what they were told wasn't what they experienced.",

Now the first question is why do individuals and big firms have an advantage when they Hodl bitcoin? To answer this let's talk about the effect of inflation which is dawning on literally every country since it's a world problem but the downside effects of inflation is more intense in some countries than others simply because of economic management and utilisation of resources. Now if you agree that bitcoin can combat inflation then you can also agree that bitcoin can prevent a country from falling into economic crisis. Now for the OP, I've also come across a channel that teaches kids economics and even bitcoin in one episode.",

They have businessses to operate and their core targets are profit for their companies. They can have profit by developing and selling their products, buy bonds of governments, investments their money to something that is where Bitcoin appears as one of their choices.As an investment choice, Bitcoin since 2009 proves that it has best ROI.https://casebitcoin.com/charts#roi_chartQuoteNow if you agree that bitcoin can combat inflation then you can also agree that bitcoin can prevent a country from falling into economic crisis.It's bigger than that, it's national scale, not business company scale, you're missing this important point. Bitcoin can not stop what it did not start, economic crisis, and you can not resolve any crisis by putting something like Bitcoin on top of that.With your thinking, you will soon expand it to \"Bitcoin now is stronger and it will be able to save the world, not only nation(s).\" It's unrealistic too.",

I think it worked for them. They become seriously rich thanks to bitcoin. If some other country tries the same thing (buying lots of btc), I think it will work for them too. Even the US is thinking about building a btc reserve. I don't think that's aÂ coincidence. Bitcoin will make all of its investors rich like it has done before.

You are only misleading people that bitcoin can save a country or even the world although I believe that it can make a country rich but it won't be easy but I do think it's possible just like el salvador. I have seen many movies that mentioned cryptocurrency but it only shows you that it will make you rich and that's all that it says in a movie so I am not interested in watching the whole documentary although I may watch some of it only if I have time to spend watching it. I'd rather watch someone who really post genuine videos or interesting videos about cryptocurrency.",

I have not watched any bitcoin movie before because I am not really into movies though. Documentaries and films like this are not really bad though, Â it will help to create an awareness about the availability of a certain currency which the viewers may not have seen before. However, while praising the abilities of bitcoin, we should also be mindful not to over-glorify it to the point of sending out misleading information to the public.Bitcoin alone cannot singlehandedly save a country from whatever problems it may be facing. It might try to address some economic issues, but the government on their part have a major roles to play in ensuring economic, social and political stability in their country.",

For example, take these 'immigration crisis' or 'gang violence'Â  problems that many countries have. Obviously, Bitcoin is not going to help there at all.",
