  "content": "Most merchants who accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies automatically adjust the price in Bitcoin of their goods or services when the BTC/fiat price changes. A good which was worth 1 BTC one day would thus be priced 1.05 BTC the next day if the BTC/USD price went down 5%.Perhaps sometimes an exception for this rule makes sense when the price dips significantly (say, 2% or more), like today.Merchants often need to empty their deposits from goods which sell worse than expected. So they often reccur to promotions, like 10% discounts or coupons. A Bitcoin price dip gives the opportunity for a special kind of price promotion: Sell the goods to yesterday's Bitcoin price!The idea is to benefit from the sense of urgency of Bitcoiners when they fear the price could go down further. They can't sell their Bitcoins for yesterday's price. And often people stare on the charts seeing the price dip lower and lower, regretting they didn't sell yesterday. But with such a promotion, they can buy things for their BTC - for yesterday's price!This could be a good idea for several reasons:- First, it's an opportunity to increase sales volume (above all for goods which didn't sell that well) with a relatively low discount. Discount coupon codes often have to offer 10% or more to attract people's attention, and a 10% BTC/USD crash a single day has become rare (even if it still occurs).- Second, while you of course can use your usual hedging strategies to protect from further drops, you can also to chose to hodl the coins entering from these promotions. The long-term price evolution of Bitcoin has, until 2024, been positive. And often the dip is over quite fast (although you have to be aware of potential of further drops).- Third, you can market this promotion as a \"backing\" of Bitcoin's price, making Bitcoiners happy!Does this make sense?

      "body": "Yeah the whole concept makes sense and infact many business persons who accept bitcoin do it. I think people that panic on bitcoin dips are less likely to be long term holders because of their FOMO. Sometimes many bitcioners don't buy items with their bitcoins during dip because of the idea that they would be in loss and also bitcoin will likely surpass the dip.As for the discount stuff if the seller should accept the coins he would be in loss if he has to restock his sales items and bitcoin drops by a few percent. I think this concept is nicer and more profitable for people who render services than those who sell goods. This is because it's easier to get paid offering your service then hodl those coins till you eventually are in profit.",

I think this concept is nicer and more profitable for people who render services than those who sell goods.Agree. Services and above all digital items (say videogames, music downloads etc.) are perhaps the most convenient categories of goods for this strategy, however also those you would sell for a discount anyway (those not selling well), as I wrote in the OP Quote from: franky1 on August 04, 2024, 09:40:27 PM'sell for yesterdays price' only works when yesterdays price benefits the customerThat's of course true, but a 2% drop (even a 1.5% may be enough to make this work) occurs every couple of days, so the merchant can benefit from this opportunity quite often. More often in bear markets of course (however then he would have to hedge better.) Of course this \"promotion\" would only work when there is a dip, so the best option would be an automated process in your shop software (you can previously assign the items you like to offer for this \"discount\").My point of offering this kind of \"discount\" is that the opportunity for the customer may look bigger than it is really and the merchant can benefit from that. For example, many people could already panic in a 3-4% drop like today and take the opportunity to buy items offered at a $61k Bitcoin price, but if you offer a 3-4% discount not many would care (5% is the absolute minimum, 10% is better).Quote from: franky1 on August 04, 2024, 09:40:27 PMpeople whom decide they are willing to spend their bitcoin, then look into the goods they want to spend bitcoin on. they then dont need to then have some extra scheme convincerTake the example I gave in the OP: Someone staring at the chart seeing the price dropping from 60k to <58k and fearing it could go to zero or at least to $50k or so. Now an ad pops up offering products taking the BTC for $61k. I think the click rate would not be bad for such an ad Those people like you describe (those carefully considering to spend their BTC) may exist but there are also more \"compulsive\" buyers/sellers.(By the way I think this would even work better with LTC or XMR, or Lightning  [no LN discussion here please] as the user hasn't to care about fees and it would also be possible to offer low-cost items.)Quote from: Amphenomenon on August 04, 2024, 09:42:14 PMI guessed you meant 20% or more?No, I meant 2% intraday. 20% intraday is very rare except in deep crashes (FTX, Terra/Luna for example). I would guess even if there's a continuous slide of 1% every day (e.g. 63000 - 62400 - 61800 etc.) this tactic could work.Quote from: nelson4lov on August 04, 2024, 10:46:37 PMIf buyers spend less than the expected market value, who bores the cost for the \"discount\" being offered to customers?

Items that don't sell well (and you want to empty your deposit), digital goods where volume is more important than margin, services that aren't selling well but convenient for you, et cetera. The e-commerce space is full of discounts. So why not offering one targeted to Bitcoiners?",

      "body": "Depends on the psychology of the buyer actually. After all, they aren't concerned about being able to purchase with Bitcoins at yesterday's price but they're more concerned about how much discount they're getting. By labelling it at yesterday's price, it doesn't really entice them because they aren't sure of the extent of the discounts that they're given. It might be helpful to just use that as a strategy, but specifying the extent of a discount regardless.One factor is also dependent on how many people are Bitcoiners and are actively spending their Bitcoin. Generally, dips in value doesn't actually entice people to spend quickly because there is bound to be a correction for the value to stabilize after a dip. If people are looking to quickly offload their holdings, then it could work. My understanding is that most people don't pay using Bitcoin but they do using fiat.Quote from: d5000 on August 04, 2024, 08:52:36 PMa 10% BTC/USD crash a single day has become rare (even if it still occurs).Good timing",

Any business that adopts this idea will attract more customers due to the discounts it will offer. But my main reservation is that some traders might find this strategy complicated.

Write your opinion I have always been in support of the acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payment by merchants in their businesses. This is just a perfect strategy put in place to ensure that the merchant goes home with profits despite the bitcoin price fluctuations. Aside just serving as a means of payment, the merchants can grow their customer base from all over the world where customers make payments directly in bitcoins without neccessarily going through the traditional process of currency conversion. The effectiveness of this strategy depends also on the customers, their knowledge of bitcoin and how well they get motivated to buy at a given price or discount rate. Since bitcoin is still struggling with general acceptance/adoption, customers should still have the option of paying in fiat just incase.",

Since if they are to take advantage of crypto payments it also entails the idea that they have to also accept that there will be days that even when they are able to sell a lot of stuff, loss of value due to price dumps will be at play and they may end up with even less of the money that they had when they set up shop. One way they could stop this is with actively changing price tags but that is bad for business and I can only imagine the better business bureau not being happy with that. You could also argue that they could use the money they got from selling stuff via crypto to trade but then again what's the point of setting up shop and a business if you'd just use it to trade anyway?

And holding btc as a payment is inconvenient because of many reasons, but just the complexity of the accounting and taxes is a good reason for avoiding that extra work.Even normal accounting is complex enough and all successful businesses are hiring accounting services for that.

But I am not sure if merchants using existing bitcoin payment gateway, can actually implement this! The gateways need to be ready for such promotional activities. Also there's a significant chances of making loss for the merchants, especially those merchants who play within a thin profit margin. Price volatility can seriously affect them. But if it's for a startup who are currently in a \"cash burning\" stage, can make use of such promotions to acquire customers if there's significant price movement.",
