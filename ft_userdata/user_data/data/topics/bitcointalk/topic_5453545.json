I don't think any form of signature campaign can actually affect the forum. This is because the forum is an open area where spam is not moderated. You as an individual have the right to wear whatever you want under your signature space. If by any chance what you advertise under your signature space turns out to be illegal and attracts the government's attention, that's between you and the project. To be on the safe side, all you should do is take off the signature code. Even if an investigation is to be made, it won't come directly to the forum, but it might have an individual attack on you, who was advertising the project in the first place, because those government officials will not agree that you don't know anything about the project. (But I doubt that can even happen.)I believe one of the reasons why the forum stopped showing off ads is because of this kind of risk and to be on the safer side, not to directly advertise any project that might turn out to give the forum a bad name.Quote Secondly do we believe that bitcointalk can Â be obstructed by government if their is a noticeable crime by the management?. I never believed it before, until the CM issue, when I came across a discussion where one of the respected members made mention of such things as \"that we should be prepared and we might actually see a similar welcome news here on the forum one day.\"I would say it's possible, but that will only be if the government has enough reason to do that, although I know these days the SEC doesn't actually need reasons to do something; they just create one.So I believe there are fewer things to worry about; the forum is organic and is not a direct threat to any government.",

In an event that a service that being promoted by forum member turns out to be violating the law, The campaign stop immediately which means we didnâ€™t allow here to promote service that already committed the crime not before the crime is committed.Quote from: Onyeeze on May 21, 2023, 03:12:43 PMSecondly do we believe that bitcointalk can Â be obstructed by government if their is a noticeable crime by the management? From my understanding it seems to me that bitcoin existence is different from the bitcointalk forum and without the existence of bitcointalk forum bitcoin will continue existing, what's your take on this.Yes, Government can seize the forum if the management commit a crime based on what country jurisdiction the forum is under and what kind of crime. Any website online can be seize by the government if they have the warrant for it. But forum moderator is not dumb to do that. Theymos is very professional for a long time on running the forum smoothly.Quote from: Onyeeze on May 21, 2023, 03:12:43 PMThis idea came to me through what happened to the site of bitcointalk few days ago which I couldn't logins my account for sometimes, I wasn't happy when the incident occur.

Theymos create a poll recently about how to fix the broken image in the forum due to imgur issue. The timing of maintenance is in-line with his poll so probably he is just doing some solution on the broken image problem. Thereâ€™s nothing to worry about and make sure to be updated on meta to prevent this kind of worrying.",

To a great extent I do believe the abrupt manner that mixer site was shutdown showed the dimension and seriousness with which government could take things to if it meant it. I'm not a tech person but I do believe shutting down of this forum could also be possible but that could only be if there's incriminating evidence against it. CM fell out with the law and its advertisement ended here immediately.

Criminal activities can occur in any context, including within signature campaigns. If a signature campaign is found to involve criminal behavior that could attract government intervention, it is reasonable to assume that the forum administrators would not allow such a campaign to continue. If the criminal activity is discovered after individuals have already participated in the campaign, they may not be held liable if they were unaware of the illegal actions taking place.But all this is purely hypothetical and based on my assumptions. As far as I know, there have not been any specific cases of signature campaigns involving criminal activities on this forum. Take mixer services as an example. Mixer services, in and of themselves, are not inherently illegal. However, there have been instances where some mixer services have been investigated and accused of engaging in illegal activities, such as the Chipmixer case. And yet, no sanctions or interventions came from the governing agencies because the CM advertised through signature campaigns.",

Also without theymos this forum can function as we have those that can take over management (if I'm not mistaking). If the management commits a crime they can be called for questioning but that doesn't mean the forum will die.

If you don't express yourself well you are not helping your case.

You could all remember there was a signature campaign known as \"ChipMixer\", and months later we got to noticed it has been seized by the U.S government and under investigation. So did the investigation affect the forum? The answer is \"NO\", or did its investigation affect it's forum campaign participants? The answer is also \"NO\".So in summary @ O.P, that answers your question that an investigation of a signature campaign can never affect the activities of the forum.QuoteSecondly do we believe that bitcointalk canÂ  be obstructed by government if their is a noticeable crime by the management? For me, I think that can only be possible only if the forum domain is under the host of a government regulated firm, but if the forum has an independent host, then that is likely not going to be possible.. But I stand to be corrected if I'm wrong on this.QuoteFrom my understanding it seems to me that bitcoin existence is different from the bitcointalk forum and without the existence of bitcointalk forum bitcoin will continue existing, what's your take on this.The forum was the official place for the discussion of the development of Bitcoin, so it has an important role to play in the continue use of Bitcoin QuoteThis idea came to me through what happened to the site of bitcointalk few days ago which I couldn't logins my account for sometimes, I wasn't happy when the incident occurI thought I was the only one who noticed the domain \"error\" display few days ago when trying to login the forum, but never knew it was general, and as such that calls for concern, and I hope Sir Theymos needs to do something about it so that such doesn't occur anymore.
