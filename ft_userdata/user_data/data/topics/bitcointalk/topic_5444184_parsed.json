  "content": "Hello,I have one of these boards, that were used back in the days of the 3060 non-LHR cards.https://i.postimg.cc/MGTQ0h74/1.jpgThe problem with these boards is that they only detect 2 cores of whatever CPU is installed on them. I guess it's to prevent overheating and because there was actually no need for more back then. Now, I want to mine Dynex, but there doesn't seem to be enough CPU power for all the 5 GPU's to reach their maximum speeds. I'm not mining with the CPU. It's just that the algorith is made in such a way that it also uses the CPU.Has anyone found a way to unlock the rest of the cores, through some bios modding or some hidden option inside the 300 other usless options inside the bios?",
