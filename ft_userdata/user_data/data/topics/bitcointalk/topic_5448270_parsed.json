Do not indulge in this casino at all. There are various websites to spend and gamble your money away instead of trying a new platform with no credibility at all.",

I have only played it once when a friend came visiting,after lunch she brought out her phone and to my surprise when I found out what she was busy doing,she was playing tower game. I got interested in it at that moment,which she introduced me to Botking,after trying my luck for some time,I got tired of it and went back to my favourite gambling game.",

Didn't know that this game is an old game. All the time I thought it's just a new addition in the gambling world. This tower game fits better on Bitkong because of their theme and site name. It reminds me of that classic Mario vs Donkey Kong games where the mechanics of the game is also climbing on top. @OP I know stake dot com has it. Luckybird.io has this game as well. This game is starting to get popular lately so maybe other top sites do also have it. Despite of it I never tried this game yet because I'm not really impressed with its graphics and gameplay. The game also looks hard for me. It has the same vibe as mines. I'm really bad at them and I feel nervous on which tile will I pick.",
