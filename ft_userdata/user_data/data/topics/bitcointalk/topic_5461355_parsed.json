      "body": "Hello! I wanted to share a small update regarding my artworks. They will now come with certificates, just like my previous ones. However, instead of using Verisart, I have chosen to create my own certificates on the Liquid Network, which is the first Bitcoin sidechain.Once you receive your artwork, you can list it on a Bitcoin marketplace without any issues. To do this, make sure to scan the QR code on the certificate. If the artwork is not listed, the QR code won't work. If you encounter any issues, it means your artwork isn't listed yet.Alternatively, the second QR code on the certificate will take you to the Bitcointalk art sale thread. This is my way of contributing to the Bitcointalk community and attracting new members. It's a token of appreciation to the entire community.My journey in art is about much more than just creating artwork; it's a reflection of my life. I've faced challenges and fought for my life twice, relearning everything along the way. This is what I want to share with each collector â€“ a piece of my emotional journey. If you're one of my collectors, whether you've won in a raffle or not, know that each upcoming artwork contains a part of you. I'm confident that you'll find our connection embedded in these artworks. Thank you for being a part of this journey.",

      "body": "These twenty-one series are going to grow bigger and bigger. There won't be any more Opendimes, only Satodime. This is the next-level way to go. The fourth artwork is on its way, I think it will be ready by the beginning of May. This time, there will also be favorite illustrations from the magazine cover. In the end, there will probably be three artworks: the cover artwork and two artworks from inside the magazine, all in the same size and as acrylic panels to stay on the same path. This fourth edition, with the extra two artworks, is going to be a little different and feature real cyberpunk stuff. I can't wait to finish all the details, but I am very happy with the result so far.",
