  "content": "The Formula 1 2025 season is officially starting this weekend in Australia.Formula 1's popularity has increased unbelievably much in the recent years. I quite enjoyed the pool of the previous season. I hope that we have a much more entertaining pool this year. We are going to use Superbru again this year. However I'm open for other suggestions as well if there is any.As being the sponsor of the pools on the forum, Sportsbet.io and Steve have always supported the members here. And they didn't leave us alone here this year too and indicated that they were going to sponsor this pool also. The only thing remaining is to see whether we will see the interest we hope in this pool.Fellas the entry fee for the pool is going to be 1 mbtc this year.Payment address(Cro2 team are managing the escrow address)bc1qtavh58r7j2l25cj25lc927cqrv2jqtp9lmwhntaz7gqse30h3gyq3jjtfgPaid ParticipantsBitcointalk name|Superbru name|Favorite team________________|________________|________________LTU_btc |LTU_btc |Red Bull Racinggoodpunt|hsh1|MercedesSlissy|Slissy|Red Bull RacingJinetics1111|Jinetics1111|Neutral, like Switzerlandslaman29|slaman29|Red Bull Racingdarxiaomi|darbit|Mercedesjayce|jayce|Aston Martinnil_krokodil|nil_krokodil|Red Bull Racingcryptofrka|cryptofrka|McLarenTrofo|Trofo|famososMuertos|fmbetbru|Aston Martincrwth|crwth|Mercedescls63|cls63|FerrariSaint-loup|Saint-loup|Neutral, like Switzerlandnotblox1|nblx001|Red Bull Racingbuwaytress|Sojourner|Neutral, like SwitzerlandILuckyGuyI|ILuckyGuyI|FerrariSpack17|Spack|Ferrariswogerino|swogerino|McLarenjeremypwr|jeremypwr|Neutral, like SwitzerlandI'd be happy if the people who make payments send their tx addresses and superbru usernames via PM to me.You can make the payments for the pool until March 23.",

      "body": "Count me in as well,as last season I enjoyed very much the pool and every race I saw with emotion of pool standings beside the original emotion because no matter what I always watch every race in Europe and US,while Australia and Japan,I am not an early person anymore on Sundays,for me is enough going to work during week days to get up early so these races for me who live in Europe are usually missed ones.Is the payment the same as 0.001 or it has changed?I think it should be the same but if for some reason we need it bigger then I would suggest no more than 0.0015 as this is a pool which needs more participants and not less,so the prize entry level can be a deciding factor here.Edit: I saw it is 0.002 I am making a two payments of 0.001 for this and I think it will be OK,as I have done so in all the soccer pool where the prize was 2 mBtc,let me know if this is OK and I will send first payment on 1-2 March and second on 10 March.",

He wanted this pool to be organized. Actually I'm just a helper. This is one of the 2 pools that I enjoy the most. The other one is the FPL pool icopress has organized. I recommend you to look into it as well next season. I guess the reason why is that it gets boring to make score predictions only for the matches after some time.By the way, I have created the league on Superbru. I have sent the pool link to the users who have written that they would like to join.",

Believe me, it's not. Last year I tried it in first part of season and I was completely in the bottom. Only when I started to leave my predictions before qualifying I got up a bit and got few yellow caps. Early Bru Point can be crucial thing. Engine penalties isn't that big factor if we talk about Top3 teams as they usually recover positions throughout the race. Things like crashes or rain is bigger game changer.Quote from: LFC_Bitcoin on February 26, 2023, 07:25:03 PMI’m in & I’m ready to take your money, boys.Welcome! Didn't knew that you're following F1.
