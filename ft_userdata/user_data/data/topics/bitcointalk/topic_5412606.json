  "content": "Cryptocurrency usage in Africa is on the increase daily as more and more Africans are realizing the value and benefits of cryptocurrency and due to the need of a fast, reliable, accessible and serviceable means of money transfer and high inflation of fiat currency. Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa as a continent is very promising because most African countries share a lot of similarities like capital control issues and scarcity of banking infrastructure. https://guardian.ng/technology/tech/evolution-of-cryptocurrency-in-africa/Cryptocurrency has impacted the African economy in a lot of positive ways such as:* Growth of business for entrepreneurs as it is easy to transact with American, European, and Asia countries with a low transaction fee* It has helped in creating employment through mining, blockchain development. * Cryptocurrency has helped mitigate the effect of scarcity of banking structure. Cryptocurrency transactions can be done anywhere as long as there is an internet connection. Some see cryptocurrencies as vital protection from government repression.However, the usability of cryptocurrency in Africa is facing a lot of challenges due to government policies because they can't regulate it. In February 2021, the Nigerian government place a ban on cryptocurrency transactions through licensed banks. In July, it launched a scheme for a new government-controlled digital currency – hoping to rival the already established cryptos. Countries like Ghana and South Africa are coming up with policies to regulate cryptocurrency. All these policies stem from the criticism mostly by government  and  authorities as a means of laundering money and financial crime and also ‬for its instability.Another issue is the volatility of crypto, cryptocurrency is subject to unpredictable changes in the market, For businesses, a 3 percent drop in bitcoin’s value can be big enough to generate a massive loss, and that’s a risk business owners are not willing to take. https://cioafrica.co/the-truth-about-crypto-usability-in-nigeria/",

For example, I will respect the proposal if you give numbers and analyzes that show the increase in trades in some central or decentralized platforms or the emergence of local markets, but just constructive talk that is not supported by numbers.As for Nigeria’s ban, we have not heard of a person being prosecuted for trading, and therefore I do not think that it will be strict or influential, and Nigeria is a model and not all of Africa.",

By the time Exchanges to be registered within the country and letting them to operate won't give hands. Even in Nigeria and other African countries, there is big rise in the usage and number of holders. Most of them look like they're using and accepting into business on their own risk.",

      "body": "I guess it would indeed be more feasible for Bitcoin to serve as a \"means of money transfer\" and as a store of value due to the fast devaluation of many African currencies than be used as an actual currency for day-to-day transactions. And it's probably good enough for now. Aside from ill-informed regulations, there is indeed the fact that Bitcoin is volatile. It may not necessarily mean massive loss to business owners, but there might indeed be a time when business owners will have to freeze a good portion of their capital so as not to incur losses. And it could affect their operation.",

This has become important because most governments are limiting the number of dollars they give to business owners and this has also affected their businesses negatively. One of the greatest challenges currently is that China which is one of the biggest trading partners with Africa is hostile to Bitcoin. But some businesses still have ways of invading the ban and making payments with Bitcoin.  Quote It has helped in creating employment through mining, blockchain development. Africa the most youthful continent has the highest rate of unemployment in the world. Although not on a very large scale, Bitcoin has contributed in the area of employment. Many youths have become self-employed by established exchange firms and other jobs Bitcoin offers. And the beauty of these jobs is that they can be done both part-time and full-time from anywhere. Quote * Cryptocurrency has helped mitigate the effect of scarcity of banking structure. Cryptocurrency transactions can be done anywhere as long as there is an internet connection. Some see cryptocurrencies as vital protection from government repression. The number of unbanked in Africa is massive but Bitcoin has given them the privilege of engaging in financial transactions. This citizens now can caaryout banking transactions without limitation.QuoteHowever, the usability of cryptocurrency in Africa is facing a lot of challenges due to government policies because they can't regulate it.

Nigerian government couldn't stop the use of bItcoin because the literate population had to devise options on how to use Bitcoin for their good. But Africa has one of the highest numbers of adult illiterate and out-of-school children. The infrastructural deficit is another major challenge. Most Africans don't have access to basic amenities such as electricity or an internet connection. Other challenges include poverty, cultural problems, colonial ties and other external influence.",

Its okay if you are planning to use crypto as payment gateway for your business to expand the scope of clients and customers but not like you are depending on it. Bitcoin made to be use as an ease foe transactions which can be used on business but not as a business itself like buy btc on us and youll earn later cause its going up.

The remittance companies like MoneyGram and Western Union are very expensive and they take most of that money in the form of fees. So more and more Africans are turning to Bitcoin for international money transfers, because it is a lot cheaper to send money home to their families.

Most of the news that I hear about Africa involves adoption of bitcoin gives me confusing impression about it. On one side we see Africa where peeps are starving, waste lands rising and there is no quality water drink; how one could even think about the implementation of bitcoin!! It's just crazy fact and its the south which most developed and being ruled by powerful peeps for sure. However, sad reality; many countries do not get to enjoy the liberty of this development. The development of bitcoin can only happen when there is enough money, infrastructure, high liquidity and most importantly Governments capability to handle it.",
