It will be worth it for you to state how much profit you have made so far vs your losses through this self-thought mechanism,  be rest assured that the formula you used is one of the oldest primary trading texnhinuqes,  by just using the buy-low and sell-high mechanisms this is not new to many of us and if I must advise you,  I will say you should maintain that single trading pair. Because the moment you add another trading pair to the Bitcoin you are trading right,  it may make it hard for you to be able to control your emotions.",

You prefer to hold is only what you are saying indirectly. Holding is better, but the correction can come in short time too and you will make profit and won't be considered as holding, but you need to use indicators and technical knowledge of trading to become a good trader. If you have the technical knowledge and you follow this, I think it will pay you as you do not use leverage. If you are not greedy, the best coin to trade is bitcoin. There are many altcoins that are very volatile, I do not know why those exchanges are listing them for derivative trading. But there are still better altcoins too. But preferably, bitcoin is better. Know that if you do not apply the technical knowledge and trading strategies, you are only gambling.",

But I do understand your strategy, and it works more likely when the price of bitcoin is going down and you don't want your capital to get hurt.Quote from: Plaguedeath on May 16, 2023, 08:44:58 AMIs there anyone like me here? For sure, I did this strategy way back, when I was still a beginner here, like 2017-2018. But it's not for me, at least being a steady trader. So I just choose to be a holder and invest when I have the capital or do the old but reliable strategy of Dollar Cost Averaging.",

It doesn't look like trading.It is true that there is no single bitcoin mining cost for all miners, which is why I wrote a price range.

Still good decision to trade what you think good for you since you can practice your trading skills for focusing on your favorite coin to trade. But you shouldn't stay on your comfort zone since there are to many coins are worth to trade which can give you more possible profits if you do the right thing on your trades. Also you better start to learn how to do charting, reading the trend line and other important strategies that can help you since it can help you to earn good profits for long term.",
