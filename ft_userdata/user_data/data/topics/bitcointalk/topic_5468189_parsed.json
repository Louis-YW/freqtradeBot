You already said that the first posts get most merits and imho this makes the rule you've proposed somewhat annihilating itself.",

      "body": "You do have good thinking, and I have also observed that too, but not everything is about merits. Sometimes, I try to make the first post to see how many members agree with my point of view and how many don't. Because when there are 10 or 20 posts that are mostly made on some topic, then I make mine. I don't get to know anyone's thoughts about it. Like, what do they think about my reply?That's why I try to make posts that will remain on the first page.And talking about your suggestion, I don't like it, and I don't want it to be implemented. Because this would become some sort of discrimination. Because not every member tries to copy others' replies, but unintentionally their context ends up the same. And that's not fully true that only the first two posts make good merits, I have seen many threads where people get merits even on the second and third pages.The point is, we are here to add value and to learn from others, but yeah, merits also matter, and we cannot ignore that fact. But our first priority should not be based on merit.",

What is the sample? How many topics have you looked at to come to these conclusions? I'm willing to bet not much.You touched on a very interesting topic and it would be great to conduct a full-fledged study on this topic. For example, by automating the process, because manually, by a person, it will take forever.But nuances arise. How to evaluate the usefulness of posts? Merit is not a 100% objective measure of usefulness. Especially in the hands of merit sources, who sometimes throw away merit in batches left and right, which casts doubt on the usefulness of certain posts.The idea of ranking posts based on merit seems interesting (moving posts with merit to the front pages), but wouldn't that disrupt the natural flow of discussion on the forum and create confusion in the sequence of posts? That is, it will turn out that the answers to the questions will be in front (the first pages) of the questions themselves. In my opinion, this will create chaos with posts.",

      "body": "Well, it won't be justified to to make someone's reply on top page only because that reply received merits. Sometimes there are very good replies to a post that doesn't receive any merits and those replies are mostly on page no 1 or 2, but if whatever you said is implemented on forum then all those replies will be further away from those 2 pages. The merits can't justify that how good someone's reply is because merits are sent by members and everyone has difference in their opinions. Let's say if someone agrees with another user's opinion then that person may send the user a merit for that contributive opinion while if others don't agree with that opinion may send merit to someone else's opinion which is totally different from 1st user's opinion. I believe such kind of system will create much trouble in forum and won't be helpful at all. The ones who make contributive replies will get discouraged if their replies don't appear on the place where they have posted those replies. Such kind of system will be totally a failure if it's implemented on mega-threads as they have thousands of pages and if even a single user receives a merit then his/her post will somehow disappear because it will move to those pages where the replies have received merits.",

Those posts will be considered as shit even posts have valuable knowledge right?in conclusion, I would say it is the best way as it is now.

As you become a known person in this forum, and when others who knew you previously, see you comment something good, they simply give out merits.Even if they arrive late or reply late, that doesn't matter. Those who are really dedicated dig all the way from page 1 to page 10. Even I sometimes read several pages before replying. I think what matters, is the important of a post. If it were useful in any way, you'll see much constructive reply from almost all the top users. On the other hand, if it were a spam post or shitpost, there won't me much activity anyway. And you won't need to read all the pages. The thing you are asking for is good but somehow not necessary (My opinion). It may create a mess in that thread. When it's sorted based on dates, it helps a lot in finding a comment and replying to it. But if you sort it based on merit or in any other ways, reply will get scrambled. Who knows where my comment would be. How would others find my comment in a thread where he/she wanted to reply! Is my comment worthy or useless. Who would determine that!",

Thanks for your seasoned contribution. The natural flow of the discussion will be disrupted and the flow that has been sorted according to when the post was made will look messy if it refers to the system that OP wants to implement. There is also no definite standard as to whether the best post will appear on top or not, as the parameters of a post will be determined by how relevant the comments made are or also by the members involved in the discussion. Just need to follow how the discussion goes and see whose posts or responses are really relevant and deserve to be given merit or something else. OP is good enough to give his ideas, whether they are implemented or not is for the forum developers to decide. We see that the Bitcointalk forum currently has a good system order, as well as the implementation of the merit system, and the latest is the use of the sign (OP) as a marker that the member is an Original Poster, and it has been 1 year since the OP sign (SMF patch) was implemented and initiated by PowerGlove.Identifying the OP at a glance (SMF patch)",

But if you bring those replies up base on merit then you will have a disorder. I have notice that most replies that actually get those merit more are the replies that sometimes correct the mistakes from  other members replies, so if you arrange them base on merit then the replies that were corrected will be bury down. This idea wouldn’t work out because if there is no merit then which of the posts comes first and or will the moderators be given another very hand work to fish out the best replies? The whole concept is good but surely one can’t be implemented. The best thing is if a thread is related what you are interested in then find sometime and go through it.
