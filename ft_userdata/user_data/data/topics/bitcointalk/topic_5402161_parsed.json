  "content": "The XFUEL TokenThe BUSDX native token has a high 18% buy tax and 19% sell tax. These taxes help provide liquidity and also play an integral role in providing pure passive income to holders. These high taxes work extremely well on Decentralized Exchanges, therefore we want to keep the BUSDX token 100% Decentralized.As a result, BUSDX has created a low tax XFUEL token specifically designed as a trader token for Centralized Exchanges. The XFUEL token is also created on the BNB Chain.The revenue that is collected through the Centralized Exchanges will be used to FUEL the BUSDX Ecosystem. BUSDX will use these funds to buy the native BUSDX token to maintain the staking pool supply. This will result in an increase in the price of BUSDX, while also providing extra passive income to holders in BUSD.The XFUEL revenue will also be used to BURN a portion of the existing BUSDX supply. This deflationary process will make the BUSDX token more scarce over time. The XFUEL token will also be used as an alternative payment method for Xpay.

Now it will require real effort that's backed by a competent team to make a project successful. Don't think it's too easy to get success in current market.",

What they are offering at the moment is already launched. They are offering a wide variety of services but the question is, how are they going to attract customers? The competition is getting tough as there are so many networks that are offering similar services. Hence, they need to have some remarkable features that crypto users can identify them. Otherwise, they are facing hard challenges to get their clients on board and utilize their services.",
