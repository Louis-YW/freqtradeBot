The amount equated to over $800 million at the time, which marked the second-largest BTC withdrawal from Coinbase in 2022. The next day, on Nov. 25, another 50,000 BTC withdrawal took place, which equates to over $825 million at the time of writing.Considering that Coinbase is preferred mainly by large U.S. institutions, it can be said that they are taking advantage of the affordable prices and accumulating BTC, as the on-chain data indicates that the bottom of the bear market cycle might be near.Third-largest withdrawal in CoinbaseThe chart below represents Coinbase’s BTC deposits and withdrawals since the exchange was launched in 2014.With the second 50,000 BTC withdrawal, Coinbase reserves lost more than $1.5 billion worth of BTC in two days, which currently marks the third-largest BTC withdrawal in Coinbase’s history.According to the chart, the most significant withdrawal was recorded in late 2017, and the second-largest one took place in mid-2022 after the Terra (Terra) collapse.It’s not just CoinbaseThe data shows that Coinbase is not the only exchange experiencing large BTC withdrawals. The chart below demonstrates the BTC balance on all exchanges since January 2018, and a significant downfall can be seen since January 2022.According to the data, the balance on decentralized exchanges has fallen below 12% for the first time since January 2018.https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-worth-1-5b-withdrawn-from-coinbase-in-48-hours/....It seems that we're witnessing a mass migration of funds being pulled from exchanges in the wake of the FTX incident.Amazingly enough binance and others affiliated with FTX are still plying their wares, in the hope of attracting investor capital.As depositors take larger steps to protect their wealth and secure holdings, will it be enough to stem a tide of the high number of electronic hacks we've witnessed in 2022?It seems that the latest trend of large withdrawals came about in 2017. Perhaps after the bitfinex and tether investigations were launched. It could take time for consumer confidence to be restored in crypto exchanges.",

It's surprising how many people are not perturbed by the risks and disadvantages of keeping funds in the control of a third party.Quote from: Hydrogen on November 28, 2022, 06:22:21 AMAs depositors take larger steps to protect their wealth and secure holdings, will it be enough to stem a tide of the high number of electronic hacks we've witnessed in 2022?Exchanges would continue to operate as there are still lots of users who entrust them with their funds and trade on their platforms, and ifbhey keep running, there would always be hackers trying to get in. How successful they would be would depend on how much security measures exchanges adopt in the wake of the hack waves.Quote from: Hydrogen on November 28, 2022, 06:22:21 AMIt seems that the latest trend of large withdrawals came about in 2017.

We can't have a massive crypto bull wave/increase of demand without the crypto exchanges. On the other hand, centralized crypto exchanges are becoming a pain in the ass, with all those horror stories of people getting scammed and losing their life savings. Is mass regulation the solution? Maybe... Maybe not....A more strict regulation might bring new problems, like reducing the privacy of all users and making the entire crypto industry more dependent of the governments.",

It is quite surprising that the CEXs since inception in 2010 has pulled a great wave in cryptocurrency such that it assumably appear to many as the only panacea to get cryptocurrencies. That makes me wonder how early bitcoiners embraced it to this prominence. The CEXs has over the years acted Like the traditional banks which only required to keep just 10% of customer's deposit, having 90% of it for use, which faults the ideology of Bitcoin, bringing limitations to the proposed breakout of alleged norms. The POR initiative, imo is still not enough to prove their conduct otherwise.I think all efforts now should be geared towards broadcasting the need for personal wallets, improving the methods of P2P and providing more prominence to it, of which this forum has tried so much to do and could do more.",

With the happenings around the world on Crypto exchanges, one would ask if truely blockchain is decentralized? The happenings has really casted doubt in the minds of people about Crypto which has given room for lots of statement about Crypto going as far as people and government justifying their claims as regards Bitcoin. I think this is one too many of the panicked investors worried about their funds in the hands or custody of a third party.  The carelessness and recklessness of most third party exchanges are becoming unbearable and unbelievable to start with. Funds withdrawal is absolutely the best option now as it would not make any sense waking up to hear an unfortunate news in respect to ones investment and funds under the care of a third party exchange gone.",
