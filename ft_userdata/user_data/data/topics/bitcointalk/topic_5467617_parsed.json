      "body": "Yes me too experienced am from my app but you can always change it from Lite to pro, or from Pro to Lite it depends on the one you like to dey use. Usually me dey more familiarized with pro instead of lite because everything just dey congested inside one place than the pro if you wan change am just click on your circled image at the top right hand side then tap am more things go show just look down below \"reward Hub, pay, security, notifications\" the next is Binance pro click on it you would change it to lite or decides to change it back Pro. They Pro dey more friendly and if i dey use p2p i dey easily dey find out how the things be but lite to dey worry me small all less say i no dey in haste to sell my bitcoin.",

      "body": "I just noticed it too because it has been a while I use Binance Exchange.This particular interface you showed is for Binance Lite which you can change to Binance pro in the Binance exchange app.This new interface is good even though I didnâ€™t see so many changes. But it beautifies the exchange home page more than it used to be, but I prefer using Binance pro because of some features which include:DiscoveriesNewsAcademy Live.These features is good for the exchange users as they will be updated about all the current news related to the exchange and the cryptocurrency in general, which makes the exchange more user friendly.",
