But then again many have copied original designs...take Microsoul who literally copied Casascius design for his coins and people still bought.",

However, the resemblance is really strong and I think that a minimum of initial research or \"mention\" wouldn't hurt.let's ignore the fact that I don't think using the brand etc etc has authorization  I have seen some auction on scarce.city and probably one also here on forum. Nowadays is a well known piece... Quote from: krogothmanhattan on September 22, 2023, 09:01:50 AM ...take Microsoul who literally copied Casascius design for his coins and people still bought.perhaps for coins I see this problem less because the space is smaller and it is clear that certain information is always reported with the same type of design... like stamps. If you take early stamp 900' they have always the same \"design\" more or less...",

If I knew it was a direct plagiarism of a portion of someone else's work [like in your example], my answer would be a big fat NO [even if it cited sources], but if it was just influenced by another art while adding its own touch [+ citing the sources], I might reconsider!Quote from: bitbollo on September 22, 2023, 08:44:27 AMHow artist and collectors could avoid to bring in collection  \"questionable\"?This is one of those things that's quite tricky... We can come up with a bunch of steps that could help in identifying them, but these steps will only minimize their chances and on top of that, there's also the issue of unethical artists finding a workaround to these steps.",

At least one of the artists didn’t use the Kellogg’s branding. As far as Mick Bruce’s BTC coin is concerned, he did not put it into the public domain or forget about it. The mint he used to create them lied to him and ripped off his designs without his permission. Although, his design is so famous now, I’m not sure if it ended up being a good or bad thing. He was screwed out of a ton of $, but is now a legend. (My mint tried to do something similar with my BTC Binary rounds, which Mick ironically also designed, but I refused.)",

I don't know if you're familiar with catawiki's auction (it's a french site operating in EU), their shop it's full of these items clearly taken without any authorization by legal owner. https://www.catawiki.com/it/s?q=rolex+art&sort=relevancy_desc&page=1here on example with Rolex brand.It seems they are allowed to sell  since it's from several years that I am tracking these items.Max HF in this case couldn't made any legal attempt, but in any case, I would prefer the first/original work and not the \"imitation\"...",
