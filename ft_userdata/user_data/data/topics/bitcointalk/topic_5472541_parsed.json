If a company can't pay you a thousand bucks, I wonder when you have tens of it. Besides, thanks for telling and warning us here.It's annoying that they do it to gainers, but if you are a loser, you are always welcome. Gambling on sports is one of the easiest ways to make money, some of the casinos frown at it and instead of giving you all your pay and saying goodbyes since you are a threat to them, they would rather pocket the money and start quoting nonsense terms and conditions since there is no one to help.I don't think you can get this money back, but still, try better to mount pressure on them and threaten to paint them badly on social media platforms, maybe they wouldn't want your trouble and pay your remaining balance.",
