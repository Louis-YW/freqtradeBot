So are you going to pick your altcoins Now??  Or During/After BTC Halving while you can buy altcoins with low price?Just think of the scenario what will happens if bitcoin ETF approval news comes out tomorrow and the price of bitcoin starts pumping? Whales who are holding various altcoin all this time will start selling their altcoin to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin will pump but altcoin will bleed heavily. So my prediction is there will be more chances to buy altcoin in the coming month. So if you are tracking some altcoin that you want to buy for the next bull season then be prepared for the upcoming discount price in the altcoin market. If you want to get some short term profit then you can still invest in the altcoin which hasn't pumped much till now because the month of December can also be in the positive side. So there is still chances to grow altcoins before anything bad happens to the market.",

But we can also see that this market have people that are interested over nonsense altcoins and they're pumping. I am not saying people should invest on those because no matter what happens, it's your money and I am just saying that there were pumps that do happen like those, right? It's gonna be a choice of yours on how you'd be selecting them because not all alts are worth to invest but can't also deny that even the most worthless alt can pump due to hype.",

Moreover, in the long term it will come to fruition so now probably look for narrative that will play major role in the coming bull run and look for those laggard/low cap altcoins.",

Well, I'm sure that you also know how to wait but if you are an impatient person, this will never work. We are expecting the bull season will come after halving but yes, the market seems looking good and pumping which I don't think we could ignore the chance while these potential coins are cheap. We should have taken action/decision before it was too late or else, we wait for another market cycle.",

Usually we will see a correction phase before the halving which still has over four months to go but it's better to stay conscious because had it been Bitcoin we can suggest you may enter anything if you are looking for hodl but Altcoin is a different use case where it takes ages but still some major altcoins will not be able to breach previous ATH.

There hasn't been new really decent drop since 2022 i don't think we are dropping to those levels again. Not at least any coin that i am following. Everything seems healthy even though market seems to be unsure. But i do agree that now would be a good time. Even though there might be slight drops coming, we can't time the market so that it would be optimal. Waiting for new ATL is a sure way to miss any rocket.I am very cautious and wishing i would had more in alts now, but i am waiting for paycheck to get more as i didn't cash out at the top.",

Why are you talking about this when the price of bitcoin was almost 40k again? The bull has been coming since bitcoin was getting massive recovery from under 20k. You have been too late in picking some altcoins but it's not yet late waiting for another ATH to come. I have expecting bitcoin to have another new ATH probably after halving. I have prepared all of my altcoins for that time. We are in the way to go to the another ATH again. Prepare your seatbelt my friend, try to buy top 200 CMC.",
