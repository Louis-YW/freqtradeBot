Is this the user you wanted to send message to? If so, take note that he/she was last active in 2014 and even if you could message him/her, it would be very unlikely to get a response.",

The only way that I think that you can remove this restriction you need to become a Jr. member above or I don't think copper membership can remove the restrictionbut buying it will lift some restrictions. Or according to old post here for a brand new account you need to make 1 post and wait for the 4 hours after that you should be able to use the PM.",

This morning, I saw 2 more emails from him.That email address is for removing proxybans, some people seem to think I am Bitcointalk Customer Support (or their personal assistent). I just ignore them. I'll add another post in that topic.Vladimir was last online in 2014. Give it up.",

The topic is about something else while you are making off topic post which is of low quality and discouraged.You said lot about newbies functionality on the forum and how should they grow but you have registered on the forum approximately 487 days or more then 1 year earning not even a single merit so is this how you make progress and know lot about forum? Quote from: roksana.hee on January 18, 2023, 02:57:05 PMAs a newbie, you can't send any @PM to anyone. If you read the following guide & rules then you can learn more about the forum.But with buying copper membership this restrictions can be lifted and you can send messages to anyone on the forum but in his case it's not helpful as the person he needs to contact has been offline from so many years on the forum.Quote from: LoyceMobile on January 18, 2023, 04:21:21 AMMy email address isn't for contacting others (and i can't believe I have to explain this).Yeah members need to know that any other work or communication details they are looking for it should not go through you but only those mails like lifting proxyban should be sent to you.",
