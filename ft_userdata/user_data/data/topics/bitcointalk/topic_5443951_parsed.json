(and I've tried multiple searches)I need a wallet that I can input multiple mnemonic phrases and/or recovery keys and see all balances at once in a single app. Hopefully for all major coins like btc, eth, ltc atom .. etc but I cannot find a single wallet that offers this. All the mainstream wallets like exodus/atomic only allow for one mnemonic import then you can only sweep private keys into your wallet (like exodus) and even metamask only allows one mnemonic per google profile, after that its only private keys. I don't care if its some sort of api based system or a cli in linux I would prefer that actually but at this point (a cli) I'm so lost. If anyone uses the safepal app on android/iphone its honestly the best you can use it for mnemonic imports its not only a cold storage app, and when you load up the app all your balances refresh. The closest thing I found was Coinomi but the only bummer about this app on windows or linux is that you have to click each wallet to view the balances it doesn't show like a dashboard with all balances.Am I the only one with this issue???Has anyone found a wallet that allows multiple mnemonic recovery phrases to be inputted and view all balances at the same time? multiple crypto wallet apps on windows linux",

Although it doesn't allow you to import multiple mnemonic recovery seed phrases, it does allow you to connect multiple assets on Ledger Live at once and view all your assets on the dashboard under the \"Accounts\" tab. Plus, Ledger supports many external wallets[1] that enable you to check and manage your assets using Ledger Live. You just need to follow Ledger's instruction for you to be able to integrate/connect it.[1] https://www.ledger.com/ledger-wallets-and-servicesEdit: Upon checking Exodus is not supported by Ledger.

      "body": "There are some wallets supporting deterministic mnemonics derivation from a root mnemonic, but they always track only one mnemonic. For example, with the ColdCard hardware wallet, you can have up to 10000 mnemonics, each of which can be recreated with a root seed and a special index. All technical information can be found in the corresponding BIP: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0085.mediawikiAs far as I know, there are no wallets supporting exporting multiple mnemonics or master private keys because doing so makes little sense both from a UI design perspective and a security perspective. One seed phrase is capable of creating private keys and addresses for almost any blockchain, coin, and token, which means any wallet can support almost everything out of the box with a single secret. It also doesn't make sense from a security perspective because a compromised wallet would lead to all seed phrases being compromised.There are some tools allowing tracking multiple xpubs at once, and that's enough for most use cases. As an example: https://github.com/jonasschnelli/corewatchpush",

Thanks budSince I consider tracking multiple mnemonics within a single entity a very insecure approach to interacting with cryptocurrencies, I wouldn't recommend anything besides importing several extended public keys into something like above application. You can also try something like https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt because \"it uses bitcoind to keep track of your wallet addresses (derived from your xpub(s)) and builds an index of their history that can be queried using the Electrum RPC protocol or using bwt's custom designed HTTP API.\" Also try https://vezgo.com/ but I don't know how reliable they are since I never used their API. But they claim that \"building crypto wallet trackers has never been easier, thanks to Vezgo. Vezgo is an API provider that gives you just one API for all tracking all crypto wallets, including Trust Wallet, Ledger xPub, Trezor, and so many more.\" Please note that I found all these projects just by asking Google, which means I can't really recommend any of them. The only reason I consider them kinda safe is because they don't ask for private information, just your xpubs.",

Naturally, for this setup to work properly, all these wallets need to belong to a single person since secrets aren't meant to be shared with other people. As for wallets supporting several seed phrases at the same time, it is definitely possible to create such a program. It would require making just a small change in existing codebase, but developers don't strive to change the design of their wallets because users don't actually ask for it: a single seed phrase is enough for most use cases because it can support hundreds of cryptocurrencies.",

As long as they use enough entropy to generate the seed, it should be more than enough for your daily purpose. You can go all the way with generating all randomization sources manually though, like what has been discussed there[1]. Do correct me if I'm wrong though, but I'm pretty sure nobody has ever told me to buy a high-end PC to create my wallet. [1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5317199.0",
