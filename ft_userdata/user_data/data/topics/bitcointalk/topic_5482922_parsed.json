I think that this market just opens up new opportunities, makes Bitcoin attractive to investors who deal with traditional investments like those the op mentioned. Bitcoin will remain appealing to all those who were with it before the ETF approval, and it can start being appealing to new people. Some might shy away from it, but that's not a problem.Decentralization isn't a myth, Bitcoin isn't a meme investment, so the risk of that disenchantment happening seems low to me.",

Let's keep all these debates around decentralized ecosystem and geo-political situations a side. But unfortunately the world's largest asset holder has got the approval to run Bitcoin ETF. They have so much financial power, they can indeed really manipulate the market. Just ask a simple question - why the Bitcoin price didn't increase after ETF approval? Who's behind this?

In fact, bitcoin never was a mainstream investment, which is proven by the amount of people who own it. If you ask around, maybe 1 out of 10 people you know will hold bitcoin, probably even less than that. Is that mainstream?Quote What happens when they find out that the \"decentralized\" thing is just a myth, It's not and the fact that a certain amount, for instance 10% of it will be held by ETFs doesn't make it centralized.

Hence I would like to conclude it doesn't matter of what potential investor thinks because a true Bitcoin enthusiast is more concerned about anonymity rather than investment or returns.I understand very well why it was created, but... that's not how it evolved. Today, almost all Bitcoin transactions have a third party involved because almost no mainstream investors physically hold their own private key. It's certainly possible Bitcoin could be used that way, but it mostly isn't, and the reason for that is that most people don't care about \"centralized\" and \"decentralized\" and don't even know what that means. To most investors today, Bitcoin is nothing more than the word, \"Bitcoin\".And it doesn't matter what potential investors think... unless you are talking about the market price of Bitcoin. I am not trying to say here that Bitcoin is worthless, or that it's price will go to zero, only that the current price depends on a mass appeal which could evaporate because of the attention the ETF is bringing.Also, you understand Bitcoin isn't great for anonymity, right?",

But my scenario here wouldn't portend a small drop like it's seen in the past few days, but rather a huge drop like it saw 18 months ago, or maybe much more. My thesis here is that the current price is based on the perception that Bitcoin has mass appeal, and when the market finds that it doesn't, it would correct to a much, much lower level.",

A lot of \"what if\" scenarios. There is absolutely no point in asking such questions because you could claim anything, even something as ludicrous as for example: the entire internet might collapse in a few years due to some mysterious cosmic burst of radiation from some far-away galaxy. What would happen to the value of Bitcoin in such a scenario? Would the Blockhain be lost? All such questions do is create more FUD. Especially during times when Bitcoin is going down.
