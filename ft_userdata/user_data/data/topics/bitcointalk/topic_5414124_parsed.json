  "content": "On September 15th, 2022, at 06:43 (UTC), Ethereum completed its merge at block height 15537393 and formally adopted the PoS consensus algorithm. Ethereum then said goodbye to the seven-year PoW mining phase.Ethereum has formally hard forked away from Ethereum at the same time, keeping the PoW consensus. Numerous well-known trading platforms have aggressively opened it for deposit and trade as the network token ETHW of the Ethereum split chain.MEXC launched ETHW deposit on September 15th at 15:20, becoming the first cryptocurrency trading platform on the network to do so. Only 49 blocks are required to finish the deposit procedure, which is presently the fastest account deposit speed among trading platforms, according to the computation of the ETHW deposit.The current price of ETHW is 13.01 USDT, and its 24-hour trading volume was $74.05 million, according to CoinGecko data. From the standpoint of trading volume, depth, and price difference, the complete indicators of MEXC, FTX, and ByBit are in the top three when compared to major trading platforms. The absolute amount of the price difference between the bid purchase and ask price on the ETHW trading page on MEXC is just 0.002, which is the smallest, and the trading volume and depth indicators work better.Additionally, MEXC is not only the first platform to announce its support for the ETH 2.0 mainnet merging and the first to advertise Ethereum's prospective forked chain tokens, but it is also the fastest platform to open ETHW deposits within a single day.MEXC announced that as of August 5th it had supported the trading of \"possible forked token ETHW.\" The true Ethereum network token, ETHW, can currently be exchanged for the token. The real Ethereum network token (ETHW), which can be acquired outside of the trading platform, can also be placed on MEXC for trading purposes at the same time.According to what is known, MEXC is a market-leading, user-friendly platform for trading cryptocurrencies that offers one-stop services for trading spot, leveraged ETFs, perpetual futures, NFT Index, etc. MEXC, which has more than 7 million users globally, is the cryptocurrency trading platform with the fastest launch times for well-known projects across the network and the widest range of tradable categories. Aside from that, data from CoinGecko shows that MEXC presently enables trading in more than 1,500 cryptocurrency spots, more than 120 cryptocurrency futures, and more than 300 cryptocurrency leveraged ETFs.",
