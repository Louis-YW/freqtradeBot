Come to think of it, what if the lunching of core is prospond to some other time?Because it has be prospond severally from the month of November, December and now it's this month January I think it will be prospond as well but I don't want it to prospond. Core DAO should just lunch it.",

I remember the one who I can see on facebook regularly shilling this satoshi core on his facebook account. He heavily shills this coins and other non sense coins including pi network to his friend and followers this is why I think he is paid to shill or has a network of affiliates. Imagine how delusional you are just to shill this project. You thinking of making people stop doing their stable job just for this coin. What a non-sense.",

There is only one coin which owned by satoshi and that would only be Bitcoin. Take note, Bitcoin only without any other extra names beside it.The rest will only be created by the faketoshis or sometimes called satoshi nakafomo. Creator of this coin is so creative to combine satoshi and core because we all know that satoshi is the dev of the original bitcoin and core or Bitcoin core is one of the famous softwares use in Bitcoin to connect to the Bitcoin network and run a node. - source",

It doesn't even relate to satoshi. Have you quit your real job and how do you feel? I saw that so many people in my countries were losing their sense caused by this stupid coin. They call that themselves would become millionaire instantly when coredao is traded on an exchange site. I guess so many coredao supporters were going to the asylum.",

Listen very attentively that anyone can impersonate him while trying to gain popularity on their project, as matter of fact nobody knows the way about satoshi and his or her last seen on this forum was around 13th December 2010. Do not invest in a project because it owned by satoshi or being that it will increased in price, take a look at bitcoin is yet to get to $100k so don't just dream CORE would get $500k soon or anytime closer; trade wisely and invest careful.",

So i don't know what you think can push the price up to $500. And don't forget the crypto space keeps evolving and there are other L1 and L2 project coming with very interesting feature and user friendly. So if the demand is less it will end up becoming another forgotten project.",
