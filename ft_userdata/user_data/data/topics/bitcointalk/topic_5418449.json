That happened to me with photobucket a few years back and I don't want a repeat of that, hence my attempt to use ProtonDrive. ProtonDrive may be a good cloud storage provider, but it was never intended as image hosting. Although you can share your files publicly via a link, ProtonDrive will never provide you with a direct URL for the image to be able to post images on the forum. As already mentioned, Imgur and Imgbb are probably the two oldest and most popular services for free image hosting. They have a long history so there is no reason to fear that you might run into problems in the future. Even if you encounter some kind of restrictions during free use, you can simply change your IP address or use a VPN because no registration is required.",

It won't go into public if you didn't click the \"make public\" its hidden only in imgur but if you share the image outside the imgur its viewable without info related to your account. So its safe if you concern about privacy.",

Try it a with a different image hosting website like imgur.com. It should work without any problem. You can also use imgbb.com and postimages.org as alternatives to imgur. I was using imgbb from long time to host images before but in past few months there were problem with images not displaying and same invalid proxy error was showing which forced me to shift to postingimages.org which is really good alternative on my side and have never faced any issue then so advice to use it and can get direct links and many other types of Bbcode and is good site to host images.",
