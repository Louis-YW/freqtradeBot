If you are asking users here to teach you how to trade, then you shouldn't trade and trading may not be for you right now. Like you said; you're a newbie in BTC, and trading isn't for newbies, it is very complicated and you can lose all your money very fast. Now what do you mean by \"i want to do marketing with BTC\", i don't know what that means but what you need now is to learn about BTC as a cesnsorship resistant and permissonless currency, and not as an investment, at least for now.",

Trading requires many methods which are too difficult to understand for beginners who do not have basic knowledge of trading. Learning about bitcoin in general can be helped by searching on the internet browser you use.The most basic thing you need to learn, according to those of you who are still beginners about bitcoin, is how bitcoin works, how to get bitcoin and how to store bitcoin.Later you will find that bitcoin is not a tool to make someone rich faster.Don't force yourself too much to dive into marketing or trading or other fields before you have knowledge about it. The risk is big.Welcome to the bitcointalk forum.",

If you are getting good results I am pretty sure you won't be here today.There are some important things you should know about Bitcoin, it's different from casinos and gambling, there is no fast way to make money with Bitcoin, everything about Bitcoin takes time and your courage to keep learning nonstop. Now ask yourself, what do you want? Passive income? If yes Bitcoin is not for you, because the best advice I can give a newbie is to take things very slow, Bitcoin is good for long term holing, so if you have nothing else you are doing that's fetching you money, do not look at Bitcoin as the solution. Bitcoin investment is long term, so get a job that pays you monthly if you don't have one first.There is another way to get money with Bitcoin, maybe weekly, depending on when the signal comes, that's Bitcoin trading, and it's not easy to be a good trader, sometimes you will lose money and sometimes you will earn, but way better than gambling because trading is all about how good you are with market movement and analysis.Do not rush, and believe me, there is no short cut, everything takes time and practice, and stay away from anyone who says there is a shortcut to making money with Bitcoin, it's either they are trying to scam you or use you one way or the other.",

To be honest, it's not all that simple to make money with Bitcoin. Before one can start earning properly, they need to have the right knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and bitcoin, and even with good trading skills, cryptocurrency does not guarantee continued earnings, especially in trading. However, buying Bitcoin and being willing to hold onto it for a long time is only easy ways for to start and make money in the cryptocurrency sector. However,beginners need to understand how to get a non-custodial wallet and how to secure their funds well even their willing to only invest in Bitcoin. However, never suggest to a newcomer that they begin with trading or any other marketing activities like that.",

It is important to remember that cryptocurrency trading can be highly volatile and comes with its own set of risks and rewards. Before investing your money it is essential to do your own research understand the risks involved and consult with a financial advisor. Relying on just one trade to make an investment decision can also be risky. It is advisable to have a diversified portfolio and regularly monitor and adjust your investments based on market conditions and your financial goals.",

Remember that knowledge is everythingA word of warning: this place is full of scammers and hacker and theives. Learn the basics, like how the blockchain works, what Bitcoin is for, and what role it plays in the world's financial system. Then, learn to protect it.

At this moment, I doubt buying bitcoin and holding it for a few years can change your life financially unless you have a big capital but it might also mean you already have the money and a 400% growth isn't life-changing anymore.Bitcoin is a decentralized online currency and it is necessary since we have full control of it without the government and banks interventions. But we can still live without bitcoin of course. But as humans, we are about innovations for the betterment and bitcoin is one of them.",

Learning to trade, especially for beginners, is very difficult and cannot even be obtained from 1 or 2 weeks so when you want to do it quickly, especially looking for someone you don't know who it is, this will make things a little complicated.I recommend investing rather than trading, indeed the benefits of trading are sometimes greater if you can do it but for beginners who don't even know what bitcoin is I think the risk of losing is very large so it would be better to learn first what bitcoin is and then start investing rather than trying to trade which could make you feel cheated.",

If you want to make money with bitcoin, the easiest way to do that is by investing in bitcoin for a long period of time around 5 years. Buy bitcoin on a weekly or monthly basis in order to accumulate at an average price, rather than a top or bottom and find a side job offline or online so you can accumulate more bitcoin, If you stick with this strategy for 5 years, you can expect to make a profit.",

I'm not an expert nor too good to teach you anything, but I have advice for you. As a newbie, you should avoid trading because it is not as easy as you think and you will lose everything if you stubbornly trade, because you don't even have basic knowledge about bitcoin and the market, you cannot start with trade. If you are truly passionate about cryptocurrency, you should start things slowly and the basics are not so hard to find these days. You can learn everything yourself through some YouTube channels without anyone teaching you.",

But as a newbie I think there's a long way for you to achieve that. I could only suggest is to invest cause among the two it would be hard for starters, so find a well paying job for you to have funds for investment in Bitcoin.
