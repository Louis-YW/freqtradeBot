The build-up of the industry that stole the election for him in 2020, is not going to work to save his bacon in 2024. His popularity will even fall farther as Reps are gearing up impeachment proceedings against him.The people were tricked in 2020. But things are happening like the old saying: \"You can fool all of the people some of the time, and you can fool some of the people all of the time. But you can't fool all of the people all of the time.\" Even as Dems are waking up and turning to the Rep side, even so the Reps are preparing for the greatest onslaught they have made in a long time... against the neocon-Nazis in fascist Dem Congress.And to think that Biden and Congress are giving tons money to the Ukraine, while Americans are forced to live on the streets and in other forms of poverty. It ain't only Biden who will be crashing as this whole scenario is being played out.",

I'd ask for a refund if I were them.The pearl clutching over the way Biden called out MAGA Republicans is funny.Do you guys really think you're going to convince anyone that you genuinely believe it was wrong for Biden to call out MAGA Republicans the way he did?  Because logically, you can't have an issue with how Biden attacked MAGA Repubs without having an even bigger issue with how Trump attacked Democrats.  Mainly because Biden has done it like once?  twice?  And what Biden said would be just a warm up for one of Trumps rants about totalitarian democrats that are trying to overthrow our democracy so they can control everything you do and be racist against whites.  And he does them pretty much any time he can get a crowd in front of him. Quote“Do you consider all Trump supporters to be a threat to this country?” a reporter asked Biden at the end of his only scheduled public remarks of the day.“Come on, look, guys, you keep trying to make that case. I don’t consider any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country,” Biden said.“I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn violence when it is used, refuses to acknowledge when an election has been won, insists upon changing the way in which they can count votes, that is a threat to democracy.”“So I am not talking about anything other than that it is inappropriate and it is not only happening here, but other parts of the world — the failure to recognize and condemn violence whenever it is used for political purposes, failure to condemn any attempt to manipulate election outcomes, failure to acknowledge when an election has been won or lost.”And, in the end, Biden is right about the Republican party refusing to condemn the violence on Jan 6, and refusing to acknowledge the results of the election, and hey, don't forget - MAGA Republicans are fighting to get election deniers elected to local government positions so that they will be in a position to certify or not certify future federal elections.  On what planet is that not a textbook definition of \"threat to democracy\".  You understand, in reality, when it comes to who has stronger Facist/Authoritarian tendencies - Trump wins and it's not even close.  And not just against Biden.  Against any other President back to Washington.",

      "body": "Basically, all or most of the things that Biden was calling out against active MAGA people, are things that he and his administration are and have been doing all along. The speech was simple to put together. All Biden had to do was look at himself and his regime, and apply his stuff to Trump and the MAGA organizations.But the clincher is, since this was an official Presidential speech, Biden was breaking his oath of office by proclaiming violence against those who exercise their freedom of speech, and other freedoms. Biden opposed at least the 1st Amendment in this, and for that should he not only be ousted from office for treason, but imprisoned.Problem is, the Dems aren't going to do this, because they are on Biden's side. And the Reps won't do it, because they are too chicken. I kinda don't blame the Reps, though. Biden would send the FBI after anybody who started a treason action against him.There has to be a start. And the start really should come from Trump. But at least it should come from the MAGA people. And the start of the start is that many MAGA people should start broadcasting that Biden's speech was treason, and how and why.",

This has been happening for decades, now. Since nobody is really doing anything about it, there are do-nothing people in all the political parties.The problem with the 2020 presidential elections is not the election manipulation so much as the greatness of it. When you look at the 2020 rallies, Trump had many times the followers appearing than any other candidate across the board.The question in all this is, what should anybody - Trump or the Republicans - do about it? Nothing like this amount of election fraud has ever happened before.I don't know exactly what I should at least attempt to do about it. And if the shoe was on the other foot, do you know what you would do? Trump didn't know. But many voters and honest people in the States have been correcting the problems as much as possible. You won't find much of this in the standard big news outlets, because they are being controlled to hide it. But you can absolutely find it in the small news outlets... both what happened, and what is being done about it. It seems that government officials that should be correcting the problems, are doing as much as they can to stop those who are.In other words, it wasn't Trump attempting to overthrow. Rather, it was Trump attempting to correct things. And it isn't Biden holding himself up. Rather it is Biden simply going along with the corruption.",

Second, if you really believe what you said, you more or less don't have any reason to be talking things like politics... except if you are steeped in political science.What is political science? PS is simply out-talking your opponent with truth or lies or whatever it takes to achieve your agenda. The facts of the 2020 stolen election are all over the place. They simply aren't held in favor by big media, meaning that searches for it direct the searcher in other directions. But when you look at the evidence produced by boots-on-the-ground investigators, you will find that elections have been crooked for a long time.So it is that many Trump people simply don't know for sure. Unlike you with your self-imposed blinders, they are too busy to go looking for the truth, and the lies that are advertised out in the open make them unsure of their position. That's why they don't do more. And, it's coming back to bite them in the ways the Biden coup is hurting them right now.But it is rather nice to see where your position falls. It's the people who don't come right out and say it who are the problem. So, thanks for being clear about it.",
