Slangs I think, are more useful for beginners than to use actual technical terminologies which they won't understand in an instant; somehow it has something to do with mnemonics. On my end I've learned (not sure if these are slang terms) words such as 'multibets', AG Odds (against odds) and such which my friends and I often use so I am not quite sure if these words are being used by others as well. It just somehow adds enjoyment with my gambling experience.Quote from: Wexnident on January 07, 2023, 01:21:22 PMKind of funny how Martingale is on the list even though it's an incredibly bad strategy to use (imo).

I'd probably never use them (or will probably see them being used), maybe once or twice a year, but glad to see a list. Well it is more of a technical terminology on my end because it is also being used with other things regarding probability.But if it really is, I have no problem with that. Slangs on the other hand are just ways of players to communicate more efficiently with other players and also to promote convenience than to use the actual word.",

Which is a manner of betting done belligerently or without proper thinking over because of frustration and burnout after a huge or detrimental loss. I've seen people nowadays succumb to this gambling pattern but it didn't have a name until now.",
