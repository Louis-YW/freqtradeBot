In addition, if the first try does not result in a win, it is very likely that they will get curious and return to playing in the hope of getting back the money they lost.That's how gambling is, sometimes it makes us happy because we win a lot but sometimes it makes us stressed because we keep losing. There is nothing wrong with gambling, it's just that often we can't manage our finances and playing patterns",

They must definitely think that gambling is easy and this can affect them negatively because they will be carried away with their emotions. This is why whoever is introducing them to gambling needs to advice that new gambler, that gambling is based on luck and should not be seen as a game of profit.Assuming the newbie gambler lost in his first game, at least he will understand that gambling is 50-50 chance of winning, and this might scare him away or make him gamble responsible.",

I don't  think so if that is a trap as we all know that is a startgey of some owner's of the casino and also it is very important to win our first bet cause  we all know that if we are new in casino and lose our first bet then we will get mad and there's a chance that we will leave that casino but if we will win in our first bet then we will feel good and deposited our money to play more. But we must always remember that greediness can make us poor in gambling.",

The next time I gambled I won and I didn't still go back to play, the reason I didn't go back is because I disciplined myself not to play that way by give myself a certain amount for gambling. If i exhaust that amount forget it it's over for the day. Weather win or loss I can go beyond the target.",

I have a suspicion (based only on personal guesses and not proven) that casinos specifically allow new players (accounts) to win for the first time. Perhaps this is how their algorithms (if any) are configured. These are personal assumptions. When I played slots in a casino, according to my observations, at first the winnings happened more often and the longer I played (after a few days, weeks), the less lucky I was. This is not an indicator of the objectivity of my guesses, but this is my experience.If the casino gave you a conditional $100, then in return it will take much more from you. Therefore, you should not let the first wins turn your head and try to win again, considering yourself very lucky.",

They don't discipline their self and use amount they'll be comfortable losing. Those who gamble like this don't last for long gambling as they lose everything they have and get into debts as they'll be addicted to gambling.When gambling we have to understand that one good result doesn't make it possible to get similar results when we gamble again. Gambling isn't something we can depend on that It'll favour us always so when gambling we should always use percentage of our income that won't make us go broke, also we should monitor our addiction so we don't get out of control and become addicts to gambling, new gamblers are easily influenced to gambling.",

When they get a big or small win on their first bet, they will usually leave the game first. especially if they play from advice or direction from friends who have played longer.It's possible that some people are careless by continuing to play even after they've won. but I think it's just curiosity to enjoy the game longer. but the feeling of victory at the start does provide an extraordinary stimulus for us to continue playing.",

The initial wave of good luck brings a lot of excitement and expectations about upcoming bets' outcomes. Personally, when I was a newbie, I imagined myself setting my gambling account on autobet mode 24 hours for passive income. Indeed it was a trap, because once I did, I lost my entire bankroll once I came back to the computer and the autobet didn't even run for a whole day, rather for only few hours... However, I don't bother too much about it, because I think it was a necessary process I had to suffer in order to reach the currently level of awareness and knowledge I have today.",

I thought I could somehow repeat the same winning streak as I did before but when I reached the VIP status, it's been hard to win again. It's true, it was a trap and it might be the strategy to make gambling more attractive and it works. However, I do believe it's also a risk that the gambling sites did because they will be investing money for gamblers to be urged to gamble more by making them win first. Now, if one gambler is wise enough and can discipline himself then he can take advantage of the fact that beginner's luck will be on his side initially. I may have withdrawn some money back then but with all my deposits now I still feel that I lost so their strategy is working on me and I bet it's not just me. More gamblers are hooked because of the idea that they can win and they've actually seen it.",

Fortunately for me, I had some spare cash with me so I sacrificed it and gave it to him and fortunately for us, it was a glorious win, amd that was indeed the trap that lured me into gambling and making me believe it was that easy to win in gambling, o ly for me to fully go into it and meet something else.
