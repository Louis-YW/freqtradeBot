  "content": "Jinan, the capital of eastern China’s Shandong Province, has started encouraging the adoption of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) by introducing digital yuan payments across all its bus routes.In its pilot phase, the city tested the introduction of CBDC payments on two bus lines. Following the trial period, the city has announced that it has implemented the new payment method for its entire bus network.Local media outlet Shunwang-Jinan Daily recently reported that the city of Jinan has updated all its card readers and bus route software to allow passengers to pay using the county’s CBDC.The city is also incentivizing the use of the digital yuan by giving fare discounts to passengers who opt for the CBDC payment method. According to the announcement, each person could get up to two discounted rides per day and a maximum of six discounted rides in a month if they choose to pay with the digital yuan.The move is part of a broader push to promote the adoption of the digital yuan in China. On April 23, the Chinese city of Changshu announced it would begin paying civil servant salaries with the digital yuan. The announcement noted that all levels of personnel in public service, public institutions and state-owned units would be paid in the country’s CBDC from May.Apart from bus rides and civil servant salaries, the country has also implemented its CBDC for its Belt and Road initiative and cross-border trades. On April 24, a plan to promote the CBDC in cross-border trade was issued in the Chinese city of Xuzhou. The city serves as a departure point for trains carrying goods to Europe.Meanwhile, French bank BNP Paribas has also recently partnered with the Bank of China (BOC) to promote the use of the digital yuan. On May 5, local media outlet the South China Morning Post reported that the partnership would allow BNP Paribas’ corporate clients to connect with BOC’s system, enabling the use of the digital yuan for real-time transactions.NEWS SOURCE",

These transactions are more traceable, while giving people the illusion that they're using something similar to cryptocurrencies. Fare discounts are probably a good way to promote a CBDC, but I hope people will be careful with using it. Surveillance is already too much in China even without a CBDC.",

Connecting CBDCs (especially China's version) with cryptocurrencies is quite misleading. It's more like cautionary tale for /Economics or /Politics & SocietyLater they will declare CBDC as mandatory, only way to pay anything, but before that they need to provide education and possibility to use it for all citizens. And that's going to be a massive operation that takes some time.",

      "body": "With China bringing their CBDC to life and making it work, it seems like a great move that other countries might also want to look upon and take such a step in order to make their CBDC work too. Since China is among the five banks that have successfully launched CBDC, It's their discovery; it's their country; and it's also their problem. Implementing a centralized currency and making their own local currency digital is actually a good development for them. The only place where I'm finding an issue with them is trying to impose it on all their civil servants as a means of paying them their salary. That will be a little harsh; they should allow their people to choose what's best for them and what payment option they prefer best. It's something new, and not everyone will have full knowledge of how to use it, how to spend it, and all of that. Since it was just included as a payment option in the transportation industry, they should also do the same with civil servants, allowing them to make their own choices and maybe giving a little convincing bonus in order to lure most people in, just as they did with the discount given to those paying with the CBDC for their ride.",

I would expect more resistance in the US and certain parts of the EU, such as Germany, which is a very cash-intensive country.

We're uncertain about what the future holds when CBDC truly becomes a new trend in the financial world.All eyes will be on Blockchain technology, and it's not unlikely that a small percentage will take an interest in decentralized blockchain technology. Isn't this a positive aspect that Bitcoin maximalists can gain? Although it's highly improbable to adopt a decentralized system at the governmental level of a country.",
