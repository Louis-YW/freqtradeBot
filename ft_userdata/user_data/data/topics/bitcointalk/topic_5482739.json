(Now I finally feel like a real Bitcoiner/Cryptoner)Now when I been in the crypto world for some few years I think the time was right to get my self a cold wallet because my holdings start to increase in value quite a lot actually and many of you already got a cold wallet I am sure of and I gladly take advice's and tips if there are any important thing to have in mind when installing it and using a cold wallet? Yeah I look some YT-videos about it, but I guess it never hurt to get more opinions and voices about something important you gonna do.How ever I am happy I took this next step =)",

Another I like to point out is you could've just used an Electrum wallet, cheaper and much safer or you could've asked in here what's the best one to use to store your bitcoins.If you look at it, the OP was looking for a cold wallet that’s why he opted for a hardware wallet which is not a bad idea but the choice of the hardware he choose to purchase is the problem. The main reason for a cold wallet is to safeguard the keys or the seed phrase and that’s where Ledger got it wrong, their seed recovery is what almost everyone is against coupled with the numerous hacks that they have been faced with which is very bad and not worth to trust but definitely hardware wallets isn’t the problem. The electrum wallet you mentioned is a like an hot wallet except maybe you set it up as a cold storage which personally I think is even better than using a hardware wallets that it’s company might just run into trouble one day or changes policy that doesn’t align with you, but the problem is always the set up, a simple mistake in that set up will just make the wallet still be an hot wallet without you knowing. So for a total newbie I will advise the use of hardware wallets still. But the choice should be an open source one like Passport, Keystore and others, so that the newbie doesn’t go through the process of setting up the wallet himself and making a mistake later",

As for OP, take care of your coins as always and still congratulations for having a hardware wallet. I been using Exodus and never had any problem either, I also got Electrum and TBH I feel it's to nerdy for me.  I am still a newbie and in a learning process and this was perfect I created this post before I open it and got a very good lesson and learned something new.But if we never try, we never learn But you know what guys? No offense taken, opposite, I learned something new and weary important. But I don't think Ledger is that bad.I haven't open the plastic yet, and with all these replies I will return it and get another one thank you guys for the replies it may have helped me a lot to save my money for the future, who knows?  But I also heard many bad things about Trezor.  And I don't want to use Electrum as I mentioned I already got it but got most of my money on Exodus and it works perfect for me and also Solflare for Solana.Then I got an old mobile phone without sim-card in and its kind a offline wallet, but I wanted to take the next step. and trust me, no offense taken opposite I am happy I got this news from you guys.So the big question.. What should I buy instead? My limit is around $200 but could go to $250 I guess. - And I know I will get many different answers, but no wrong in that. Share your ideas and then I weight them in and take a decision.Also maybe the safest thing regarding hot or cold is to be aware of where you have your seed phrases? I don't know. I just don't want to wake up one day and see all the crypto is gone, I read some stories on this forum.If you only know how many mines I been walking on in my life and mistake I did, but always recover and in the end it always end up well!   Thanks guys for being honest.@Poker Player @Apocollapse @aTriz @adaseb @pinggoki @Findingnemo @kro55 @LogitechMouse",

Thanks for your answer.Seems this has come to an end.Thanks for the replies and I think I will be fine and my coins to.  EDIT: I have done more research and will stick to the wallet I bought. It is safe enough for me and Trezor is something I don't would change to, Ledger is better for my use of crypto and the coins I hold.I mean I have read like on fifty different sites and everyone have different opinions about this, and people on this forum have opinions to and I respect them, but I wonder how many of them that actually has hold a hardware wallet in their hands?  Anyway huge thanks for all replies, it made me do more research so now I am 100% sure how I want to store my crypto with the one I bought.And who knows maybe I would get same feedback if it was another wallet I bought from people that dislike that company instead? Nah joking but lets be honest this forum is what it is.I want to say thank you to everyone that replied here it helped me in one way or another, that's how I choose to see it take the good things with me and leave the bad things behind, in the end it's mostly opinions but respect to everyone of you and your opinions.Best regardsBabyBandit",
