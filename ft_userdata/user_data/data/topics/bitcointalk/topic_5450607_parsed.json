Or, if you're feeling brave, you could offer to wash dishes in the kitchen as payment. Just kidding!   But seriously, it's always a good idea to have a backup payment method on hand, like a credit card or some spare cash in your wallet, just in case of emergencies. Suppose your wallet isn't broken, but you have no internet connection as a result of a network outage. How would you pay then? You never know when technology might fail you!",

So they can't broadcast any transaction even if few of them are able to display signed transactions AFAIK. Unfortunately if the device bringing your wallet is out of order there is almost no way for you to pay. If you have some paper wallets, collectibles aka physical bitcoins, things like opendime or tangem notes, or some private keys with funds on them you can hand over them, but that's it.",

I don't think many people will have this kind of experience because I think the average person still has money in their pocket or maybe on their ATM card. Also, it is very unsafe to take hardware wallet with you wherever you go [e.g. traveling], it is risky and it is recommended that you only carry small amounts of money with you.We're still in a world that hasn't fully adopted crypto/ bitcoin everywhere, so carry money everywhere you go for easy payments - unless you plan to pay with crypto and go somewhere that accepts it.",

If your phone is broke, you won't be able to use it, thus you can't pay with your phone.  Honestly this kind of situation only needs a little logical thinking.  If you don't have the means to pay in cryptocurrency then pay with cash.Or if you have laptop in you and you have installed wallet on that laptop or centralized account that holds a crypto balance then you can use your laptop to pay with your meal.",

How do you think I will give someone such advise after knowing is too risky sharing private keys and seed phrase, how could you have reasoned that I will advise op to share his keys. Saving 2 to 3 places I meant was like storing in his first laptop, maybe flash drive and any of his smartphone he don't regularly use.",

Some places will call law enforcement to record your information before you leave; but as long as you reappear with valid payment in a timely manner, you probably won’t be charged with any wrongdoing. Intentionally dining and dashing is a little different—and you could end up in legal trouble, depending on state laws. But if you make an honest mistake, there’s a good chance the restaurant will work with you to remedy it without taking you to courtSo the best thing @OP can do is always bring an alternative means to pay his expenditure, in case his phone accidentally broke.",

The probability of their phone failing is low, since these are quite reliable devices, but still it can happen and then you can find yourself in an awkward position (and also, any device can be lost or stolen). You will need to pay some kind of bill, but you will not be able to (imagine that the era of digital money will come).I assume that OP was referring to the method of payment specifically in cryptocurrency, and we need to abstract from traditional payment methods, such as bank cards, cash, and the like. And here it turns out that you can’t do without devices, electricity (battery) and the Internet.How about having a hard copy (disposable) option, be it a card or something similar QR code or barcode with a wallet containing a small amount of cryptocurrency (10$, 25$, 50$)? The waiter in the restaurant scans this code (well, all phones can’t break at the same time ) and gets access to the contents of the wallet (the qr code contains private key?), transfers them to the restaurant’s wallet, and returns the change to another address that you provide (or doesn't return: leaves as tip). I know it sounds a bit complicated and not very advanced in the digital age, but what other options?",

As much as possible someone must have card or debit to pay for the bill just in case that you dont have cash on hand.
