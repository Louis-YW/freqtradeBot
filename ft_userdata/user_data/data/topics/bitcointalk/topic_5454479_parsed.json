  "content": "Since the beginning of the war between Ukraine and Russia, various restrictions have been imposed by the United States. When Russia' get banned from SWIFT, the country has faced great threat on trade. But they didn't stop. They continue to fight and adopt new strategy. Russia is a big country in gold production they produced about 325 tons of gold annually. If Russia can't sell that produced gold, it will have a big impact on their economy. And considering that, the country decided that they will sell gold at a relatively low price.On the contrary, the United Nations is imposing various restrictions on other countries of the world. But the three countries are keen to buy Russian gold. UAE, China and Turkey are buying Russian gold according to their capacity. Currently Russia's big gold buyer is United Arab Emirates. UAE buy 99.3 percent of Russia's gold exports. Almost everyone knows that UAE focus on gold reserves and their stock is increasing day by day.Last 3 Years UAE Gold ReservesAt a time when most countries are devastated by the war, some countries take advantage of the opportunity to acquire huge wealth. But if the poor countries go to buy something, they are harassed and banned in various restrictions. Don't you think this policy is cruel to poor countries?",

I can't just see any justification for that, and of which many souls have avoidably lost just because tyranny is hungry for power.For countries to be dealing heavily with Russia in this wartime is inhumane as it is tantamount to supporting his senseless war in Ukraine. Dealing with them with precious metal is a way to empower the nation and the war which I believe is bad without mincing words. According to Reuters, Temis Luxury Middle East has imported 15.6 tonnes to UAE in less than a year, the worth is placed at $863 million and the transaction was between February 24, 2022 - March 3, 2023.Very soon, this amount will reach $1B. I see a reason that the world will never unite no matter worth, and I know that Russians would be selling it to the royal state cheaply, and it means more money for them as they are always business-oriented. But unfortunately empowering Russian to kill more people.",

So if America try to restrict them they will reduce their production then the situation will be more difficult. Because inflation is already a big problem the price of energy fuel has already gone up, on the other hand, banning it can make things worse and Saudi wants to use this opportunity. The war will eventually stop but the price of these hoarded resources will continue to rise.
