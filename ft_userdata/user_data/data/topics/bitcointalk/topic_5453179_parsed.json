Do you just have a discussion with friends/ colleagues?Just by creating a thread in the appropriate board here in the forum you get the necessary feedbacks that you want concerning your portfolio and what resultant future interest and vulnerabilities of those assets in your portfolio. No one knows your identity here in the forum, so you are free to mention every detail necessary to aid the discussion and to get accurate feedbacks that will help you make better decisions on your portfolios.Because discussing your portfolio with friends or colleagues could expose you to security risks, since you can't trust anyone, it is better to seek such feedback via a decdecentralizprivacy-orientatedatform such as a forum like bitcointalk.",

Do you just have discussion with friends/ colleagues?I don't know, maybe they will just go ask the community about their portfolio and try to get a honest answers from other members. On the other hand, we don't need to ask for feedback.What I mean is that if you believed in the projects that you are investment then for sure you are just going to be good?Instead of asking others to see what your portfolio is, for me it's better to be quiet and then see how it goes for you and the projects that you invested. They could give contracting advise that might complicate things on your end.",

Do you just have discussion with friends/ colleagues?It’s your portfolio so why do you need someone feedback about it? You should do the inquiry before you purchase not when you have already an existing portfolio since you already do your personal research when you decided to purchase those tokens.I rarely discussed my portfolio to other people because I knew that we have different preferences on our investment. You will receive tons of criticism if you show it to Bitcoin maximalist while the other way around on a shitcoin lover. Most important thing is you do research and believe on the project that you invest. Other people rating is not important since they don’t know the future of your holdings. Even shitcoins can print a tons of profit than a solid project. Even Blackrock invest on shit pepecoin and get huge profit. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1659079335620362241",

But I often discuss with friends about coins that might have good potential. Getting feedback from your friends about your portfolio is okay so your friends can give you suggestions. But still, you should find out more and not take their advice immediately.But be careful if you want to ask your friends for feedback. And do not say you have bitcoins because that will make them curious about how many you have.",

I think the best thing to do in this case is to make sure that we can make some return with time, I understand it is not going to be simple, but just make sure that it's at a level where it can be good, so we can move further along.",

I know this is a cynical world view but how many divorces have ended happily as friends.If you own enough and have paid your taxes and can afford a body guard, go ahead and be even a public crypto celebrity if you want.
