Chat: https://imgur.com/a/poVbRRLavoid Bitscript.org,  they are scammers.Where do you find it, you mean here in Bitcointalk if they have an announcement thread here then post their announcement link here I can't find it using the search bar, the screenshot doesn't prove anything you should upload more proof including your transaction payment follow the right format in creating your accusation, I notice that they are accepting Paypal payment and MasterCard, you should have tried this so you can charge back in case there is an issue.After you create the right format, call them out and make them aware of the existence of this thread so they can address it if they still care for their reputation.",
