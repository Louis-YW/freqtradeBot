      "body": "If newbies learn basics to differentiate custodial and non custodial wallets, they will have less chance to be scammed.Because it does not make sense if a non custodial wallet asks KYC from users. With such wallets, users already have wallet keys and can move their coins any time. KYC does not make sense in this case.So if a user received an email to request KYC for a non custodial wallet, that email is like phishing. Chance to see a good non custodial wallet company to change their products to custodial wallet is nearly zero, so impossible to see KYC request.Don't arbitrarily and carelessly click on any rule. Make sure they double check with announcement on website, Twitter, etc.",

      "body": "Users have always being taught not to click on links anyhow, and if you receive unsolicited messages, either through email or any other means, it is best to avoid it. Once an attacker has access to your seed phrase, your funds are gone, thus they would do everything possible to ensure you type your seed phrase unknowingly in clone sites. I think many people do not know how important their seed phrase is, that is why they easily fall victim to scam, one should only enter their seed phrase if they want to import their funds, that is after they must have double/triple checked that they are in the right place, only after downloading through the official website.Having said that, it is also good to have multiple email addresses, using throw away addresses for untrusted websites, whilst having special addresses for trusted websites, so you know what to expect/how to react when you see a message in a particular address.",

KYC does not make sense in this case.It's not entirely correct, blockchain.com is also non custodial wallet but they're asking for KYC in order to get $5 bonus [1] the best way is just avoid any message including the official website (there's a chance the official website got hacked) because non custodial wallet has no such lifespan, even you're using the first version of the wallet, you can still able to send and receive any coins.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5392859.0",
