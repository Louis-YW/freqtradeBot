We may not like the decision, but theymos chose the path with the least risk, and with the least possible issues for the admins.Plus for theymos to make that decision, the situation probably must be getting more alarming?",

Mixers, which enhance transaction privacy, seem like a natural ally to this cause. Yet, their banning on a platform dedicated to decentralization is contradictory. Does this signify a shift in the community's values, or is it a necessary compromise?The decision to ban mixers is not the creation of the bitcointalk community. It was a result of pressure from external forces that has the potential or power to negatively affect the forum. Mixers are now erroneously seen as a service that promotes criminal activities and associating with it will make those forces see the forum as a place that promotes criminality. So the best thing to do is disassociate with mixing service. The values of this community have not changed, we still believe in privacy and decentralization. QuoteLegal and Ethical Considerations:  The rationale behind banning mixers often revolves around legal compliance and preventing illicit activities. While these are valid concerns, do they justify stepping away from the principles of privacy and decentralization?The main reason why governments are shutting down mixers is not because they are used for criminal activities, they want to centralise Bitcoin so that they can kill privacy. But there is a battle you cannot fight. These Law enforcement agencies can seize any website, including this one. They cannot stop us from talking about decentralization but they have the power to control our platforms. If you don't do what they say, then you might not have the platform to spread your beliefs.QuoteCommunity Response and Impact:How has this decision been received by the broader cryptocurrency community? Does it affect the way we perceive and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?The views of most members of the forum have been expressed in this threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5476162.0QuoteSpeculating on Satoshi Nakamoto’s Perspective:If Satoshi Nakamoto were to witness this, what would their reaction be? Would they advocate for absolute adherence to privacy and decentralization, or acknowledge the need for some regulatory measures?I don't know how he will feel about the current situation but it is glary that things are changing and the community is facing so many attacks. Maybe he might start researching other means to keep Bitcoin decentralized.QuoteThe Future of Decentralization and Privacy in Cryptocurrencies:Looking forward, how do we balance the ideals of privacy and decentralization with the practicalities of regulation and legal compliance? What developments might we anticipate in this domain?There is no way one can balance regulation and decentralization, that's not possible. Legal compliance is just a loss of privacy. But I am afraid that the attack on Bitcoin will keep increasing. These forces will not rest until they centralise the coin. I predict that the community will start devising other ways to escape centralisation.",

But at the same time, I kinda understand the reason why.Thing is, before mixers were a thing bitcoin is safe, secure, and while there are hackers here and there, it’s kind of manageable at a certain degree. When mixers entered the scene more prying eyes appeared out of nowhere, regulation became more pressing, and hackers/scammers found new and creative ways to get away with what we do. Ultimately, despite these I don’t think condemning the methodology’s the way to successfully thwart threats, but since we got so little to work with, we might not really have a choice at this point, which is fucking sad.",

If it doesn't shake us up that a Bitcoin forum allows shitcoins and even scam crypto projects not just to be discussed but even promoted, then why should it surprise us that it also avoids possible legal entanglements?I'm not even sure if this forum is \"a place of decentralized ideologies\". I guess the huge majority of users here have accounts in various centralized Bitcoin-related platforms. How many users here have completely avoided submitting KYC, for example? How many users here have completely avoided custodial services?However, to ban these mixers doesn't necessarily mean not supporting them and whatever it is they're made for. It's just that having them promoted here could mean having this platform shut down or even for the administrators or perhaps moderators to face a lawsuit. Will it be worth it?",

But obviously, banning activity on the forum, in my opinion, will not reduce the fact that people will still choose to use mixers for their purposes.But there is also a real disappointment here, when many service platforms have also contributed a lot to the introduction of bitcoin on the forum. I do not have many prejudices about this issue, but according to my observations, there is also a lot of opposition to banning its use. I also had a private conversation with friends about this issue, and most of them felt that the reason for the ban on the forum could bring better development to the forum.",

I don't remember anyone saying that it is mandatory for Bitcoin to become 100% private.BTC mixers will be banned from Bitcointalk, but that doesn't mean that they are banned from the entire crypto community.

Even after Jan. 1 2024, you could find BTC mixers on the darkweb(or somewhere else) and use them(at your own risk).Just like other forum members have mentioned:1.BTC mixers are centralized, so you are kinda contradicting to yourself, by saying that mixers are crucial for privacy and decentralization.2.Somebody using a BTC mixer clearly has something to hide, which always has been suspicious. If you aren't doing something illegal with Bitcoins, then why would you need a BTC mixer in the first place?",

If you have an idea to express, then it is probably possible to do it here as long as you follow the rules.A lot of people come here primarily looking to make money. The forum administration is very happy that people are able to use the forum in order to better themselves; indeed, one of the reasons for Bitcoin's creation was to break the artificial barriers which prevent so many people around the world from attaining prosperity. However, if your attempts to make money conflict with the forum's primary goal of enabling discussion, then you are swimming upstream, and you will not be sucessful in the end.If you view the forum as some sort of \"job\" where you complete some basic tasks and get paid, then you will almost certainly be disappointed, and the forum administration will not be sympathetic. If you do make money using the forum, then it will be through innovation and entrepreneurship, not any sort of mindless busywork.",
