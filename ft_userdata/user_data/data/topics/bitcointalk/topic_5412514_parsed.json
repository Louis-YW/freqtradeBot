      "body": "Well, I guess you're right. The first is to define the main goal of what's your company doing. The important thing is that if you have a company and your ONLY goal is to make some money, you'll fail. I've seen many people doing this mistake. The second is to have a vision of the steps you must take to reach your goal. And the third important thing is to have another huge goal, so that when you reach the first one your company will still have a motivation to grow. This is of course just a general thing. When you are really starting business nothing is this easyÂ   But I wish it was",
