      "body": "OP, there is already a topic on flood discussion, you should have post this information there.The government should make provision of places where these flood victims will stay and also to make provision of relief materials for the victims and not only announcement. We know how terrible and frustrating such disaster can be to one is a victim because the person will be displaced and have nothing to use for provision of feeding since the most places will be submerged in water. I thought that there will be no flood since I have beinh expecting to hear an update on this information. I really feel for the people that will be affected by the flood couple with the harsh economy in Nigeria. When will we stop seeing flood coming annually, as the country wasn't like this before.",
