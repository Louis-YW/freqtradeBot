He as a President, can not do everything with given power and rights under the USA. Constitution, it's reality.But let me ask you, do you think that is it coincidence that Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Ethereum Spot ETFs were approved recent months in 2024, the President Election Year?It's not coincidence, there are reasons behind it and I don't attribute it all to Trump but the fact is under pressure of US. citizens and politicians of the opposite party, the White House and Biden administration had to change, they have no choice. Attribute it to Trump, to Republic Party, you decide, I am not argue with you on it.",

Talk is cheap, a true Bitcoiner will surely lead by example.There is no ban on using Bitcoin as a political issue. You must know, politics always uses any side to get sympathizers as supporters. Regardless of what Trump looks like, I feel he has made an impact for Bitcoin. It's not a fake or genuine problem, but crypto is currently in the business industry. The ultimate goal of the majority of investors is that money is not a profitable adoption such as a means of exchange or digital money. Most have understood this condition, not many people have purely become a bitcoin adopter without thinking about profits. When a person wants to be bold or have an impact, he must have power and Trump is doing that process through election as a presidential candidate.",

His recent interest in Bitcoin seems more like a strategic move to gain support rather than a genuine endorsement.

But good thing about it if they win is for sure they would let people to use bitcoin and they don't put heavy restriction. For me that's fine since as long as people could use bitcoin in their country then I guess everything still fine.

On the opposite side, Biden or Kamala made almost no statements related to cryptocurrency during their election campaign. That shows that no matter which Democrats are elected, they still do not want to appear as crypto-friendly as the current administration is treating the crypto industry.
