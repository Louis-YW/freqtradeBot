  "content": "For starters, I am a Bitcoin enthusiast with so much adoption in HODLing, Payments and Trading and it has been a blessing to me. Despite that, what I do differently from most Bitcoiners is that I don't deceive myself, I will never be a bigot but face the reality of the situation. Thanks to my grassroots experience in the financial market, unlike those who only started during this crypto-era, the experience is so lacking and popular people can easily trick them. This is partly why Trump could deceive people this much, what a folly! To what end?Trump will do nothing in the crypto world if he succeeds in becoming the US president, he is only using Bitcoin and others to ascend to the throne. Someone who had condemned Bitcoin many times in the past but suddenly started painting himself as its messiah, don't you think this has some undertone? Why are people so gullible? Many bullish speculations are flying all over the internet to his credit, but talk is cheap and the market is not foolish, we can see the true reflection already.I like us to see beyond the deception of those who want to use Bitcoin's popularity for their gains and still later abandon it. The future of Bitcoin only lies in the hands of the true adopters, not fake ones. Don't you guys think the true adopters of Bitcoin will lead by example? How many estates, hotels and businesses of Trump are now accepting Bitcoin for payments? Or how many of his liquid assets has he converted to Bitcoin? Talk is cheap, a true Bitcoiner will surely lead by example.",

He as a President, can not do everything with given power and rights under the USA. Constitution, it's reality.But let me ask you, do you think that is it coincidence that Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Ethereum Spot ETFs were approved recent months in 2024, the President Election Year?It's not coincidence, there are reasons behind it and I don't attribute it all to Trump but the fact is under pressure of US. citizens and politicians of the opposite party, the White House and Biden administration had to change, they have no choice. Attribute it to Trump, to Republic Party, you decide, I am not argue with you on it.",

Talk is cheap, a true Bitcoiner will surely lead by example.There is no ban on using Bitcoin as a political issue. You must know, politics always uses any side to get sympathizers as supporters. Regardless of what Trump looks like, I feel he has made an impact for Bitcoin. It's not a fake or genuine problem, but crypto is currently in the business industry. The ultimate goal of the majority of investors is that money is not a profitable adoption such as a means of exchange or digital money. Most have understood this condition, not many people have purely become a bitcoin adopter without thinking about profits. When a person wants to be bold or have an impact, he must have power and Trump is doing that process through election as a presidential candidate.",

He even likened Bitcoin enthusiasts to historical innovators like Edison and the Wright brothers. However, actions speak louder than words.This is bout facing the reality rather than getting caught up in hype. His recent interest in Bitcoin seems more like a strategic move to gain support rather than a genuine endorsement.

But good thing about it if they win is for sure they would let people to use bitcoin and they don't put heavy restriction. For me that's fine since as long as people could use bitcoin in their country then I guess everything still fine.

IF he actually gave a damn about crypto, he would've done something about it before the election period even began. And then milked people for their support afterwards.

On the opposite side, Biden or Kamala made almost no statements related to cryptocurrency during their election campaign. That shows that no matter which Democrats are elected, they still do not want to appear as crypto-friendly as the current administration is treating the crypto industry.

So if he’ll be given a chance to win in the upcoming election and fulfill his bitcoin goals, then we will greatly benefit from it, compared to Harris who’s clearly seen to be less supportive for crypto, how much more if she’ll win, she’ll even forget about crypto and its community.",
