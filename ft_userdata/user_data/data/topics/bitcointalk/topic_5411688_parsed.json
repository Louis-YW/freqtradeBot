In an Aug. 27 statement, the Mendoza Tax Administration (ATM) described the new crypto payment service as fulfilling \"the strategic objective of modernization and innovation,\" giving \"taxpayers different means to comply with their tax obligations.\"The service officially began operation on Aug 24., but at this stage, it will only accept stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) for tax payments.Citizens can pay through the portal on the ATM website using any crypto wallets like Binance, Bybit, and Ripio.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

The number of people in the crypto community both the Old and new, especially the new ones need some form of reassurance that cryptocurrency is still going to be pumping soon again. If a country like Argentina (the eight largest country in the world) are accepting the benefits and advantages crypto presents for the argentine people against inflation especially as the value of their local currency is on the decline, I think they will have a huge influence on other little countries in the South American region.Quote from: LoyceMobile on August 30, 2022, 09:13:09 AMQuote from: FMCPAY_GLOBAL on August 30, 2022, 08:16:42 AMit will only accept stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) for tax payments.That's disappointing.

It looks like they are shooting themselves in the foot unless they're going to unveil out a new CBDC pretty quickly. They're using someone else's currency to collect taxes (afaik they have their own) is this a way for their government to attempt to invest off shore? I wonder how well secured a system like this is too from inside attacks (or if there's limits on how much tax can be paid with stablecoins).This looks like more of an ego boost for tether than anything else, they're very dependent on that stablecoin maintaining its peg now then or at least being fully reserved/collateralised.",

When I saw the thread title I didn't know if it was a joke or what. Now I understand it. They modernize but with what they can control.  I think that rather than being about modernization they want a partnership that would guarantee a sort of foreign currency flow, an easy way to get a far more stable reserve currency of some sort without having to exchange pesos to USD which would put more pressure on the already strained exchange rate.",

After many years until there's no big problem about using crypto as the payment alternative, I think they could accept Bitcoin when the price already expensive and less volatility due to mass adoption. But maybe I'm wrong, they will never accept Bitcoin because they can't control Bitcoin and trace anyone. I believe they will never accept privacy coins, some centralized exchanges even delist privacy coins.",

So maybe next year or in the following years to come it will also pass a law granting Bitcoin as a legal tender.  There's a lot of good news this year for Bitcoin and crypto. Singapore, Hongkong, Korea, and Turkey showing signs of interest to become major crypto hubs for companies and businesses. And of course, we have the Central African Republic who's officially the second nation to accept Bitcoin as a legal tender. Maybe by 2030, we have half of the world accepting Bitcoin as a legitimate mode of payment.",

But at this point, only Argentina and other countries with a large number of poor countries can consider accepting other cryptocurrencies for tax purposes as the central banks of these countries tend to monitor all transactions involving digital currencies.Argentina has been experimenting strategically with digital money for years now. While there are still many challenges that need to be overcome, the country is undeniably making progress in integrating cryptocurrencies into local life. In my opinion, this new crypto-friendly decision in the province of Mendoza feels like a step in the right direction.",

Undoubtedly, this innovation is done for the sole purpose of collecting more taxes, and not to improve the lives of its citizens. The system is designed in such a way as to pursue its own interests. In this case, tax collection. It seems naive to me to expect positive things in similar events. Many crypto enthusiasts are happy that Argentina began to accept crypto for taxes, but personally I don't see anything positive so far. Especially in the sense that we are talking about USDT.",

It's a bit of a sneaky way for them to improve their tax collection methods while simultaneously helping them to identify citizens who use cryptocurrency and are more likely to have hidden assets worth pursuing afterwards. If I was living in Argentina I would be very weary about using this payment method, when it's possible to convert bitcoin to fiat currency then cash out via a global bank account which is not necessarily going to be covered by Argentine tax reporting laws. It's slightly good for at least the perception of wider bitcoin adoption however.",

El Salvador first set the example and now Argentina is following though cautiously. I like it. I am not perturbed that they have for now chosen a stable coin. I believe they are just testing the waters and sooner than later they will slowly introduce bitcoin. On the other hand, what changed? In May, it was reported that the central bank of Argentina had banned financial institutions from offering any services involving cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.",
