  "content": "QuoteBitcoin Core developers work on the key software underpinning Bitcoin, focusing their efforts on a variety of improvements (privacy, security, user experience, etc.) at the base layer of Bitcoin. They are often volunteers who may sometimes accept funding grants or donations in support of their work.Wright contends that Bitcoin developers can easily change the protocol's code in order to return the keys to those funds to him.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/03/craig-wrights-uk-case-against-16-bitcoin-developers-to-go-to-full-trial-report/Is this guy retarded? Even if developers push in code updates that moves all the Satoshi coins to an address that Craig Wright controls, does he really expect the Bitcoin community to actually run the software? This must be the dumbest thing I've read in 2023.",

The whole point of them pushing 4 GB blocks in BSV and other such nonsense was to make it prohibitively expensive to run a node and prohibitively expensive to mine.
