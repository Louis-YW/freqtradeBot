  "content": "Notice to the moderators:  I am specifically seeking to connect with Bitcoin developers who are not unfriendly to altcoins.  Not with altcoin developers generally.  I am acting in good faith to do something for Bitcoin.  This belongs in Bitcoin Project Development—not entirely unlike how Blockstream Liquid or RSK projects involving both Bitcoin and non-BTC assets would belong here.  I do wish that you would be stricter in kicking out altcoin threads that lack a substantial connection to Bitcoin, such as the ones that I just reported.  If perchance this comes to your attention, please read the following carefully.Cypherpunks write code.  Satoshi changed the world, and he didn’t do it by talking or debating.This is my Nicolas Dorier moment.  I recently saw some people say lies about Bitcoin.  My trust in them is broken.  I want to make them obsolete.I have a brainstorm for this—a grand dream—at this point, a fantastic pipe-dream which will stay that way unless I can connect with other developers.  This project’s scope is way too big for one working alone, even to produce an alpha-quality MVP in a reasonable time.  I know enough about project management to be realistic.  And I do not want to waste my time, then fall flat with nothing but vaporware.The project is:Strategic.  A key component of an even larger idea I have for a multi-pronged strategic defense of Bitcoin.  Because it’s strategic, it would be unwise for me to spill the beans on what I’m thinking.  Therefore, I have hereby almost entirely omitted all useful information about what my idea is.  That’s a feature, not a bug.Primarily motivated by idealism—although I honestly want to make honest money, too.  If you only want to make money, please go the hell away and check back later to see if I have produced something you can use for that.  Right now, I do not want to work with anyone who is only in it for the money!  VCs are categorically unwelcome here.Pro-Bitcoin, conceived as a response to what I perceive as threats to Bitcoin—but it’s also an altcoin project.  If you are knee-jerk reflexively allergic to altcoins, then please politely refrain from posting in this thread.  I am starting here, because this is a pro-Bitcoin project.  I will later reach out to altcoin developers; that is a part of the private roadmap.  But first, I need a hard core of self-identified Bitcoiners who know Bitcoin’s technology, who understand Bitcoin development, and most importantly, who love Bitcoin.Requisite skillset:High competence in the C programming language, in my judgment as a C curmudgeon and project BDFL.Strong technical knowledge of Bitcoin!At least a passing familiarity with Rust.  At least, the ability to read and understand Rust code, and to work with the Rust toolchain.  Or at least, the ability and willingness to get to that point ASAP; it should be easy, if you excel at C.Preferred:  Experience with embedded C development, Linux or Unix kernel hacking, and/or Unix/Linux network daemon development in C.  These types of experience will best translate to familiarity with the type of project I have in mind.  It gives the right mindset.  Programmers who know only JS, Python, C#, or whatever are welcome to talk to me, but cannot help with this project in its early stages.A deep and abiding love of optimizing, optimizing, optimizing.Preferred:  Rigorous knowledge of computer science and/or cryptography.  It would help.Competence using PGP to secure your communications—and to sign all of your commits.  No exceptions!Quote from: death_wish on June 04, 2022, 06:29:47 AMIf you don’t use PGP, then you are a n00b and a poseur as bad as a nocoiner.Besides being good security hygiene, this is a way to weed out people I don’t want.  If you contact me about this without PGP, then you are unqualified and disqualified.  I will tell you to go jump in a lake go learn PGP.Although this is not a requirement, I look most favorably on those who do not wear paid signatures.Ponies.  Reading this list, I know that my requirements are high.  I will therefore follow the longstanding tradition of listing “ponies” as a feature which would be great to have, but which seems a little bit unrealistic.  You may be a PGP-using C RTOS embedded kernel hacker with doctorates in both CS and cryptography, plus a Turing Award—but do you have ponies?  This is optional.  As a last resort, I will grudgingly accept developers who lack ponies.Other stuff not listed, to avoid giving away too much.Quote from: Intelligent regulars who are jaded from having seen 2^256 “oh please, will you partner with me” threads made by patent morons:You are unlikely to find anyone at all, let alone anyone meeting that extraordinary list of criteria.I know.  Sigh.  I am not one of the dullards who posted the various “please partner with me and code my altcoin token scam project for me, so that I can get rich despite having zero skills” threads that I just reported to the moderators.This post is a long shot.  Good developers are rare, and usually busy.  Fortunately, there are some very smart people in this forum’s development areas; and many of them deeply care about Bitcoin.  Can I pique the interest of someone suitably qualified?  Perhaps I may have a chance here!If qualified and interested, please PM me with this temporary key:Code:pub   ed25519/0xBBB6D4C39A24DA54 2022-06-05 [SC] [expires: 2022-07-05]      Key fingerprint = 009C 8650 52D8 C705 EE60  3716 BBB6 D4C3 9A24 DA54uid                   [ultimate] death_wish (Temporary project development contact key.)sub   cv25519/0x44A44EF8B6D3E48C 2022-06-05 [E] [expires: 2022-07-05]sub   ed25519/0x19DE18D01015DEC6 2022-06-05 [S] [expires: 2022-07-05]-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----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/SjT-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Current Public Roadmap:Share ideas, discuss, and then divide up a terrifically huge project scope along logical, modular lines:  Parts for me to write, and parts for you to write, as we review each others’ code.  If I had at least two or three copies of myself working together, I am confident that I could produce a functioning MVP 0.0.0-alpha in a reasonable time.  Scope here is big enough that I could easily parallelize with a few more copies of me, without running into Mythical Man-Month bottlenecks.In private development, build a thing that will shock and dismay certain parties who lie about Bitcoin.Then, spring it on the world.  Publish it as open-source.  Surprise!Pay:  None.  Well, I can’t and won’t offer you any.  I myself am a financial wreck right now:  Low in resources, deep in debt, on the brink of even worse catastrophe.  I should be doing other projects to make myself some money; I will need to balance any work here against that.  Regardless, I am ideologically motivated to work on things I believe in—for free, at the risk that I may never make any money out of it.If my fantastic vaporware pipe-dream succeeds, then those who get involved now will probably get rich off of it.  That would simply be the universe rewarding good deeds.  It would be a foolish motive to work on this now; all of this is just crazy talk!  Please, please get the hell out of here if your primary motive is profit.  (Money will bring you back later, when there are free-market opportunities to profit here.)If I can’t find the right people, then I will pivot my strategy.  But it would be a shame to miss this opening to put anti-Bitcoin forces on the defensive.VCs are categorically unwelcome here.Quote from: Me, in private chat with a non-coder colleague:> (me): *and* ... when Core ships `libbitcoinkernel` , I will link and integrate it so that every node on my network is also a Bitcoin full node, running Core consensus code.> (me): It must be absolutely the Bitcoiniest altcoin ever!> (me): what a big dream... too big for me to pull off alone...Local rules:  This is a workspace, not a debating platform.  Prohibited:  Off-topic posts, posts by people who don’t code (exceptions will be made only at my discretion), and anything that annoys me while I’m working.",
