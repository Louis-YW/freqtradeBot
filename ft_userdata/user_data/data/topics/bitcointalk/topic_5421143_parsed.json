Even more, the forum is privacy oriented, hence the users can easily use it without offering any real information about themselves. So any user information you see may or may not be real.So when somebody disappears, it can be anything, from broken computer and lost password to giving up the forum for whatever reasons or having personal problems (including death).If the user has friends in here, they may announce that, but that's also not a rule.Sorry if this is not the answer you've been looking for or expecting.",

If an account changes hands it may get tagged (red feedback). Getting other's account in most cases ends bad from attempts to scam to people thinking the new user is more knowledgeable than he actually is.It's not that difficult to grow an account and it's the honest way. It also comes with gathering knowledge on both bitcoin and the ways of this forum.",

It is not like LinkedIn where you could use the emails such as \"who viewed your profile\" or \"new jobs for <insert role here>\".",

An account has a lot to do with the person that runs the account. Having the account run by a second person after death, though technically feasible, could seem rather odd and even potentially deceiving, since likely the former owner and the, lets say heir, are likely going to differ in ethics, style, knowledge and interests. An account on Bitcointalk is likely not going to be top of mind amongst the things to deal with in the aftermaths of one passing away though.The exception, perhaps, would be a business account, which one might want to keep on running after the owner passes away, although here we are potentially walking on a tightrope, since the reputation built by the former owner, and associated trust (not strictly speaking of the forum’s Trust here) were earned by the former, and one wouldn’t want for it to be abused or side-tracked by the latter.I'm more in line with the idea that people should create their own account, and not mess around with buying/selling/inheriting for the most. Edit: It would be nice to get an update on this analysis I did years ago, but I lack the data. Amongst other thing, it showed the number of \"abandoned\" accounts per year and/or rank, though obviously not the reasons.",

Yeah, business accounts make sense. However, any other account really doesn't, and as you say it should probably only be continued by a partner that is also part of the business or for example if the business had an employee running the business account on here. Other than that, it's probably not really a business account.",

We learned a lot of bad stories, so it's a pity that these people are gone.But in all other cases, you should not be bothered by the lack of people.
