  "content": "This is not an original post by me. I came across it on twitter and felt it would be great to share so those interested can give it a try. The fire incident on LA showed the importance on how seedphrase are kept. A Tweet was made there that I also liked A seed phrase doesn’t belong in a safe. Putting it in a safe implies it has value to be investigated. SourceI believe it's in alignment with the notion that a Person wearing a mask in a bank would be more suspicious than one dressing normal despite protecting identity. Enough of my Rambling. These below are the test and the source would be placed at the bottom. 1. Tell your next of kin to retrieve your coins as if you had died. They are only allowed to use the info they have now. No new note or instructions allowed- if you died today they wouldn’t have those instructions either. See how the test works.2: Put your phone down and pretend that it, your PC and every single thing in your home / office is destroyed.  Now retrieve your coins. Remember - no use of your phone or anything from your home - no paper, notes, nothing.3. Stop what you are doing & assume 2 or more armed attackers are now at your main premises. Assume they have disabled means for help & assume they will find a safe if you have one. If they threaten violence against you how exactly do you deal with this? What can they get?4. Assume that over a period of 3 weeks you suffer from illness, amnesia, dementia or extreme trauma which causes you to forget everything about your current setup.  How do you or your loved ones / living assistants rebuild and understand your storage system?5. You speak “misinformation”, are a political enemy or are accused of a crime.  The government gets a search warrant for your office, home, bank & safe deposit box. Assume they will find any 12 or 24 word pass phrase or private key on the premises. Can an agent sweep it?6. There is extreme political turmoil in your country and you have 24 hours to pack your bags & move to another country. Assume banks/ safe deposit locations are closed. You won’t be able to return to your country. Can you bring your coins and access them in a new country? Source.Other ideas could be added since I'm well aware the OP isn't all knowing. On a side note I would add some post I came across about securing your seedphrase. Recommendations to store my seed phrase!! By Hatchy ( A question perse but most answers there are worth checking out) Securing Your Seed Phrase with Washers By fillippone updated last year. I took the Test too and realised my coins ain't as secured as I expected. I know some will be nonchalant about it. Not My Key Not My Bitcoin Corrections and improvement are appreciatedThank you.",

A passphrase is something that's highly important and one has to be careful not to forget because once it's gone your bitcoins are gone though you have your recovery phrase. The truth here there's a high responsibility for security one has to take on this, in order to carelessly lost their bitcoins.

      "body": "3 is not a problem. I live in a pretty secure location. There's just a single roar to my hose that the attackers would have to drive, me and all my neighbors have cameras facing that road. My closest neighbor owns a dog that runs along my fence and barks at everyone he doesn't know. The fence itself is 2m high and you can't drive up to my house if the gate is closed. They'd have to leave the car on the road and start cutting a hole in the fence all in the open while me and my neighbors see them and dogs bark at them. Also, people who live nearby don't know that I own bitcoin and the house doesn't look wealthy from the outside. It's actually one of the smallest in the community. 2,  and 5 are a problem.2 because I keep a lot of backups in different form, but all of them are in the house. If everything got destroyed, for instance in a nuclear explosion that would vaporize the whole house, I'd lose everything. But is that really something we should worry about?5 is also a problem because the government owns you. Agents don't have to look for your wallet. If they get you they'll make you give it up, like they made Ross. They'll find ways to threaten you, for instance by putting you in a cell with a gay rapist and after a few days you'll give up everything. So that's also not something I'd lose sleep over.",

Yeah majority of them ain't my current problem Hence why is an hypothetical scenario. About security and quick access I don't really think soYour pocket might be more secure than your house depending on the situation (not talking about seedphrase here). Sometimes making something harder to access makes it less secure because it would be more attractive to prying eyes. Take an hypothetical scenario for example. You hid something from your wife, say her favorite ear rings. It would be harder for her to find it you hid it in her room than in a safe in your room with a password. Note all this are not absolute. Quite sometime Easy access compromises security. Like it's quite safer if the word of a seed phrase is scattered but harder than access.",

Yeah I do get this aspect but in the scenario where one is forced to open their wallet thier device, bluewallet has a feature where you enter a password set by you that's different from your main wallet password, where you can add smaller funds and then  this is used as a disguise wallet. I just gave the scenario you gave earlier was different from mine. Yours spoke of having a wallet of same seed phrase with one having a passphrase and the other without. Just got that now, sorry for the misinterpretation. Though I haven't thought earlier this method was possible may give it a try and understand better.",

This way, it will be secure.example: Code:import hashlibimport osimport typing as timport unicodedatafrom PIL import Imageimport ioPBKDF2_ROUNDS = 2048class ConfigurationError(Exception):    passclass Mnemonic:    def __init__(self):        self.radix = 2048        self.language = \"english\"        d = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"english.txt\")        if os.path.exists(d) and os.path.isfile(d):            with open(d, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:                wordlist = [w.strip() for w in f.readlines()]        else:            raise ConfigurationError(\"Language not detected\")        if len(wordlist) != self.radix:            raise ConfigurationError(f\"Wordlist must contain {self.radix} words.\")        self.wordlist = wordlist        self.delimiter = \" \"    @staticmethod    def normalize_str(txt: t.AnyStr) -> str:        if isinstance(txt, bytes):            utxt = txt.decode(\"utf8\")        elif isinstance(txt, str):            utxt = txt        else:            raise TypeError(\"String value expected\")        return unicodedata.normalize(\"NFKD\", utxt)    def mnemonic(self, data: bytes) -> str:        if len(data) not in [16, 20, 24, 28, 32]:            raise ValueError(                f\"Data length should be one of the following: [16, 20, 24, 28, 32], but it is not {len(data)}.\"            )        h = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()        b = (            bin(int.from_bytes(data, byteorder=\"big\"))[2:].zfill(len(data) * 8)            + bin(int(h, 16))[2:].zfill(256)[: len(data) * 8 // 32]        )        result = []        for i in range(len(b) // 11):            idx = int(b[i * 11 : (i + 1) * 11], 2)            result.append(self.wordlist[idx])        return self.delimiter.join(result)def img_hash(image_path: str) -> str:    with Image.open(image_path) as img:        buffer = io.BytesIO()        img.save(buffer, format=\"PNG\")        img_bytes = buffer.getvalue()        return hashlib.sha256(img_bytes).hexdigest()img_path= \"flow.png\"img_sha256= img_hash(img_path)print(f\"Image hash: {img_sha256}\")passphrase = \"Flow is a beautiful cat, meow\"comb_data = (img_sha256+ passphrase).encode(\"utf-8\")comb_hash = hashlib.sha256(comb_data).hexdigest()mnemonic = Mnemonic().mnemonic(bytes.fromhex(comb_hash))print(f\"Mnemonic phrase: {mnemonic}\")How do you know that pictures PNG formatted are an entropy source good enough for a seed?On top of that it doesn't say anything about what you should do with the passphrase unfortunately. You need to memorize it? But what will happen if you forget it one morning after you wake up?In addition it's dangerous to only keep the picture used for the hash in just one single email box, because if the email provider shutdown or close your account you will lose all your cryptos.",

Read the point 6, you have no way to access safe deposit box.According to what I know, safety deposit boxes are easier to access, and despite all the previous political turmoil, we have some safety deposit box providers that have been in existence since 1896 and are still in operation.Quote from: Plaguedeath on January 16, 2025, 03:00:29 AMQuote from: suzanne5223 on January 15, 2025, 09:25:53 PMBy law, if the agent sweeps the key they have no right to take or move the Bitcoin since it is not something accumulated through illegal means.The agent won't care if your coins accumulated through legal or illegal, if they have the chance, they will take your coins and accuse you for doing illegal means.No one is above the law buddy.Unless if you don't know your rights, you're a tax offender, or somehow into shady business dealings there's no way you won't get back your holding.",

If your passphrase is unique and sufficiently complex to avoid brute-force attacks, it should be sufficient. Sending it via email is one of many examples, and if you're afraid of losing the passphrase, you can engrave it on metal. No one will know it is linked to your Facebook profile picture or a photo from an album stored on a USB drive, for example.",

Okay this never crossed my mind. Getting a licensed gun in my country isn't quite easy. I hadn’t considered physical self-defence as a part of crypto security. Legal hurdles aside it’s a valid point in high-risk areas though not universally practical.Well this really made me think while I'm still learning and exploring different methods these scenarios underline a vital truth, custody of digital assets comes with responsibility and trade-offs. Even if we can't achieve perfect security refining our strategies incrementally ensures we're as prepared as possible for the unexpected.",
