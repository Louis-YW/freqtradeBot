  "content": "The crypto market made massive progress in 2021, but we can see significant swings that have scared many crypto investors in 2022. The price of Bitcoin has dropped below $31,000, and many investors panicked. But don’t run from crypto before you read the article.Bitcoin’s price droppedThe bitcoin's price decreased below $26,000 for the first time in 16 months, amid a sell-off in cryptocurrencies that erased more than $200 billion from the entire market in a single day. Ethereum, the most well-known altcoin, tanked to as low as $1,704. It’s the first time the token has fallen beneath the $2,000 mark since June 2021.TerraUSD (UST) is intended to be pegged to the $1 but it sank as low as 12 cents and collapsed in a run as investors panicked and sold off their tokens. The Terra blockchain has since officially halted.Some crypto investors are fleeing from cryptocurrencies. Many crypto investors think about what they should do to save their money. Potential crypto investors are as scared as experts. What’s behind the latest bitcoin drop? Are crypto market collapsed?Don’t panicFirst, Bitcoin saw its dropping below $31,000 for the first time since July 2021. Such bitcoin’s price was just over a year ago and it means that you don’t need to pay 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Bitcoin is still a valuable digital asset.Second, cryptocurrencies have plunged in tandem with Wall Street, and are almost on par with the tech-centric Nasdaq, as investors fret about the Federal Reserve’s next moves to tame inflation. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat levels of inflation unseen in the U.S. for forty years, it has the effect of lessening demands for more growth companies, like tech stocks and speculative risk assets like Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are a part of the economy.Third, the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them attractive for investment and risky at the same time. If you seek shelter, you should invest in low-risk assets such as US Treasury bonds but the profitability of assets is also low. By investing in Bitcoin, many investors expect that the speculative craze hasn't diminished, and they will be able to sell it again for much more than they paid. But recent history should be that such plans, while tempting, are never easy to achieve. . The thrill of speculatively investing is not the best strategy because bitcoin is a long-term asset.Looking back at every past bitcoin downturn, there is absolutely no need to panic in such a situation. Should you own bitcoin? Should you invest in bitcoin now?It doesn't really matter who you are, a first-time crypto investor or an experienced crypto trader. The most important thing is to be prepared for the bear market. You should hold or even increase your position if you're set up because bitcoin is a long-term asset. The price drop is a good time to buy bitcoins and use a buy-and-hold strategy. Volatility is as old as the hills, and it's not going anywhere. Keep your cryptocurrency investments under 5% of your portfolio. If you've done that, don't stress about the swings because they will keep happening. If you want to invest in altcoins, you should create a balanced portfolio.Anyway, bitcoin down is an opportunity for growth, and you can take this opportunity.",

The Terra blockchain has since officially halted. When discussing the current crypto downturn in price, I think Terra Luna and TerraUSD should be excluded because what happened with this both projects is not like every normal crash but more of an attack on the project, who actually are those who attacked this project(s)?, I don't know but I believe we all know the story circulating around of what actually lead to the downturn of this both project. So personally, I believe what happened with Luna and TerraUSD is something unique on its own, it's an attack and not just a normal crash that the crypto market in general is currently experiencing.",

But the catch is that we can't know at what point the decline will stop and the best time to buy bitcoin will be. Many can still expect more attractive prices than now: when bitcoin will drop to a low in this cycle. Personally, I find this to be like chasing a shadow and almost impossible. It seems to me that it is preferable to buy bitcoin whenever finances allow and hold it. In the future, sooner or later, these investments will return with a profit. Although it looks like a \"lazy technique\", it will save your nerve cells and possibly money.Quote from: Tanya_S on May 24, 2022, 02:43:58 PMIf you want to invest in altcoins, you should create a balanced portfolio.Altcoins have always been more vulnerable to falls, and I'm afraid this is the situation now. You can easily see from the graphs that altcoins have suffered more and the most frustrating thing is that this may continue to continue. We don't know when the crypto market will turn around and therefore I wouldn't risk investing in altcoins now. As time has shown, all the same, bitcoin is more reliable, even if we evaluate it by price charts.",

You will be surprised to Heard that some also were in a doubt to invest in BTC. I think they have mixed Bitcoin and Luna. There's no need to panic when you are going to investing in btc specially about security . Yes there is a some issues with the market volatility but it's a natural think. The market will rise and fall and in the meantime traders will be trading for profit .",

You can also trade and exchange coins which is again very interesting since most of them are crashing and going up again. Immense opportunities!",

Also, UST which is algorithmic stables coin had a great fall. The story is in history how some altcoins could be deadly. And UST is not the first of its kind to have such volatile price while calling it stable coin, but totally a deceit.",

They used trust that people had in Bitcoin to pump their own shitcoin. They not only lied about the amount of money they were planning to buy bitcoin with and really bought much less than they were bragging about, but also lied that this will make their stable coin backed by bitcoin. In the real world their bitcoin was just lying there on a privately owned account and they were hoping that the purchase would not only pump Luna and increase trust in UST, but also pump BTC and make their holdings worth more. They were ready to dump BTC on the market and they did just that, only at a loss because the players got outplayed this time.",
