  "content": "Hello everyone! We're a team of crypto enthusiasts who love creating new cryptocurrency projects.Recently, we discussed an interesting new idea and now we'd like to ask for your opinion on it.We have a proposal for a crypto earning games project.BasisThere are some fun and challenging games that also require some effort to reach the highest level, such as Geometry Dash, Doodle Jump, and Flappy Bird. These games have simple concepts, but achieving the highest level requires dedication.So, why not allow people to play these games and place bets on their performance?IdeaWe propose creating analogs of the aforementioned games and implementing a multiplayer and betting system.1. The player chooses a game, such as Geometry Dash, Doodle Jump, or Flappy Bird, etc.2. The player selects a bet amount, such as $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, etc. The bets are made in cryptocurrency, but for simplicity, the player's cryptocurrency balance is converted to fiat currency.3. The player waits to be matched with other players who have chosen the same game and bet amount.4. Each team consists of 2-3 people, and the game begins.5. The winner of the game receives all the other players' bets, minus a service fee.6. The winnings in cryptocurrency can be quickly withdrawn to the player's address.We would like to ask you, what do you think about it?Don't worry about any technical questions, including cheating prevention. We will take care of those. The main objective is to discuss the concept of the service.Let's discuss!",

Even if technical issues are set aside, it's important to address the feasibility of detecting cheating in order to maintain the integrity of the platform and ensure a fair gaming experience. It's important to recognize that detecting and preventing cheating in games, especially in a decentralized environment, is extremely difficult. Players can use a variety of techniques to gain an unfair advantage, such as using bots, manipulating game files, or using external tools. The sheer complexity and variety of cheating methods poses a significant obstacle when attempting to create cheat detection mechanisms that are completely foolproof. To be honest, this point would prevent me from using such a platform, as a $100 bet is extremely high for short turn-based games like Flappybird.",

There are a lot of things to think about.",
