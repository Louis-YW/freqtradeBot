  "content": "Hello,I got a tip from someone on the forum that this might be the place to write about it.Some time ago my account was banned.I think my only (first post, I think) was when I posted about the new cpuminer fork with improvements to GhostRider algorightm (https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2)It might be that the confusion about potential plagiarism or posting about not my repo was from those points:1. Repo is maintained by Dev 1 (WyvernTKC / Ausminer).2. 1st release was pushed to the git fully by him, so there were no real mentions in the code about me, we started working from that point on, I have some DMs or you could even ask him directly if needed. (point 2 should prove it tho)3. Most of the later changes and releases of the miner were done by me, but the nick of GitHub also does not match my nick here Delgon vs (https://github.com/michal-zurkowski). Some metadata from here on my old account should match the ones on GitHub, I can also prove it some other way if needed.4. Now looking at release/commits, you can see my contribution but it might have been looking like I did not participate in the project then due to no pushes from me (https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2/releases https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2/commits/main)I tried to write a mail before like it was mentioned in the banner when I logged back in but no one ever responded to them.If possible I would appreciate looking into it and hopefully reversing the ban from that time, I think it was unjustified but maybe I broke some rule that I missed that time.My previous user id is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3282724Delgon",

However, you did not contribute to this forum.At that point, no AV or Windows Defender reported anything about them. The releases started getting flagged by AV after the first RTM boom when more users started using it.Ye, Mega links might not have been the best idea looking at it right now but never thought it would lead to the ban :/We discussed it with Ausminer and decided to only put my address in the forum as only his address was set as dev fee in the miner back then.Yes, account was new as I kinda created it for that purpose.

Like I said, even cpuminer from jdd has more flags than the fork we put, and xmrig has many more, and pretty much any miner that is on the forum will get flagged similarly like srbminer, and gpu miners which all are ok in this case even if they are flagged as malicious. If there is any normal mining software that has 0 flags, please let me know.To get it past AV you would need to have the binaries signed which as we can see, is not the case with most (pretty much all) mining software.",

Also, the links to binaries in your post leads to a third-party cloud storage (mega.cz), which is often used by bad actors to spread malware online.",
