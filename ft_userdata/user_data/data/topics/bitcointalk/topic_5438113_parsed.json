  "content": "Its wild to think that so much can happen in one week. Someone that was near and dear to me passed form a fentanyl overdose, which is just so wild to me and i'm still in shock. Someone who I thought had their ish together too. On top of that I unfortunately was laid off from my job on Friday. I have a very unexplainable peace in this time. I feel like most people might not feel the same way that I do about all of this. Of course I am crushed by the loss of my friend, Justin. The best way I can describe my relationship with him is also found in scripture in the bible, \"Iron sharpens Iron\" RIP Justin I know that he is with God in heaven now. He gave me more encouragement and spoke so much positivity into my life, more so than most of the people that i've known, and in such a short amount of time. May God be with his family and loved ones.As far as my job, I knew it was coming so this did give me some time to prepare. As far as the future right now, it is very uncertain. What I will say though is that I do believe that it is a blessing in disguise. I really didn't love my job, I hated it actually. What tied me down was the money, of course. I have a family to provide for. But now I have applied for unemployment which will give me some time to figure out what I am going to do. Maybe start a business, or find a much better job with better pay. Certainly I will be selling some life insurance on the side, since I have my license to do so. I also have things that I can sell, so thats good. Its just a job. There a soooo many jobs out there, so I'm not worried about that. Mostly I just want to do something meaningful, something that I love and care about. I'd love to do it with people that I also care about and can form deeper relationships with. That is what is most important in this life. Its not money, its not the job. Its about being happy and forming amazing relationships with people you care about. Hopefully, if you're lucky you can manage to kill two birds with one stone and find your dream job working alongside your best friends. I know its out there, and i'm searching for it. Lots of emotions have been felt this week. Leaving a career of 7 years, and losing a dear friend all in the same week. It really puts things into perspective for you. Don't let your job define you because it can be replaced, also you're not promised tomorrow! Wild ride. But now is just the beginning of a new chapter, a new journey. And I am excited, I am ready, and I will be looking forward to whatever the future holds. Please wish me luck as I continue in my job search, and morn the loss of my friend. Lets make every day count this year in 2023! Remember anything can change in an instant, and today you could take your last breath. So don't waste it. Thats all I have for now, but thank you in advance to anyone who read this. I welcome all thoughts and comments. Please be respectful. Thank you. Cheers, TREAD",

Still so hard to believe someone can throw their life away in an instant and not even fully comprehend what they‚Äôre doing because they‚Äôre on drugs. I didn‚Äôt really have a choice and in honesty I was fired. Being laid off just sounds so much better doesn‚Äôt it? I wish i was laid off I would have a severance package. I feel like I definitely deserve one with all I have done for that company, but they were fine to let me go even so. It‚Äôs unfortunate but its honestly a blessing too because I really dreaded that job.¬† Despite being an attendee at Presidents club in November and still closing business a lot of business up until my firing it all comes down to the numbers they said. I‚Äôve been there for 7 years, and my tenure had no weigh in this decision. I believe I was fired because a certain Bitcoin ATM company stopped paying their bills and pretty much cost my company 3.5 million dollars. That same company being my franchise partner for a BTM. The last 6 months of my life have been a whirlwind to day the least! I had to pivot and find a new partner for my ATM, which is set to launch next week. Life insurance has been good hitting it hard and setting appointments so that‚Äôs good. I am considering starting a pressure washing business in my neighborhood where the HOA has now made it a requirement to pressure wash the driveway and there are 400 houses in my community. I have confidence that I can take advantage of the opportunity. I have been hard at work so I have not been on here as much as usual. But I can tell you that I am most definitely positive and trying to seize the day every day! There is a light at the end of the tunnel after all, I do believe it. I will keep you guys posted with the progress. Your support means the world.",

We can make plans but we have to be prepared for the worst situation sometimes.We can't say that there will be only happiness in our lives, as happiness is also a part of life and sadness and struggles, up and downs always comes in every person life. There is no one in this world who can say or who can confess that he didn't even sad a single time in life. Because these all things are strictly bound to the human life.

And I am excited, I am ready, and I will be looking forward to whatever the future holds. Please wish me luck as I continue in my job search, and morn the loss of my friend. Lets make every day count this year in 2023! Remember anything can change in an instant, and today you could take your last breath. So don't waste it. Thats all I have for now, but thank you in advance to anyone who read this. I welcome all thoughts and comments. Please be respectful. Thank you. Cheers, TREADI can't imagine how heavy you feel right now, losing your job is really depressing but you have a 7 years of experience, it's easy to get a better job because you already have experience. But when you lose a friend, this is the hard part especially if you are super close and you think of him as a brother. I hope you are okay and can think clearly about what to do next. You will always remember that when something is lost, something better comes",

Many things bother me, I've worked at this place for 5 years, they say it's the maximum time to stay at a company. But I move on, the important thing is to always have a plan B, whether with investments or business ideas, so that when the day comes to leave (this day will come), you don't feel completely lost.Life is always making plans for the next step, don't be too relaxed with what you have, make a plan b just incase what you are having for the moment is not working fine it will be very easy for you to switch to plan B. ¬†If we learn to get prepare for life I don't think we will be taking unaware about things. I know it not that easy to get things easily but their is always a difference when one is prepared, ¬†atleast it won't be as a shock when things go wrong.",
