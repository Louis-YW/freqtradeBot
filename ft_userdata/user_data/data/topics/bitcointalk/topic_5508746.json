  "content": "I want to correct some people on here thinking that the involvement of politics/politicians with Bitcoin makes it mainstream, they are wrong, mainstream is a gradual process and we are not there yet.The first part was when everyone, weak or powerful are doubting if bitcoin will survive, this was the early days of Bitcoin when we can mine using a Pentium 4 CPU to mine BTC.The second part was when many popular figure started talking trash about Bitcoin, atleast they started saying something, until they slowly start to detect how incredible Bitcoin really is, and few changed their mind about Bitcoin.The third part is the struggle with centralisation vs decentralisation, banks and co hating on Bitcoin, mind you this happened only because loads of people started showing more interest in Bitcoin than centralised investments, especially the banks.Now the bigger companies starts investing in Bitcoin, ETF came and the politicians are proving to support Bitcoin, maybe for the greater good or just for power struggle, these aren't the real mainstream yet. We are almost there, the acceptance of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange in this centralized world is the goal, the real mainstream, having Bitcoin as a payment option around the world is the real definition of mainstream, the moment Amazon, eBay, and others online marketplaces start accepting Bitcoin as they do with Fiat is the mainstream.The full-fledged acceptance of Bitcoin everywhere is the true meaning of mainstream.",

When we use the term \"mainstream\" we mean the shifting of a concept from \"Niche\" to \"Mainstream\" - when that concept is everywhere in the world, it is not longer niche or mainstream but a part of our lives. What you have meant to say is this.Anyway this will take time to be reached and maybe most of us here will not be lucky enough to see that day. I already see a co-existence of bitcoin and fiat being built up and that is the progress of bitcoin and its acceptance throughout the word.Maybe something later we will be able to pay every local grocery shop with satoshis.",

This goes beyond Bitcoin. This is about human transformation management. We start doubtful, then interested, then maybe afraid. This dance has been around since the beginning.Bitcoin differs. It goes beyond fads. It changes our view of money and worth. Its powerful because of that. There will be politicians and big money. Only the top of the iceberg. Change is happening at the grassroots level. People use, trust, and believe in Bitcoin. It'll become mainstream with that. It will be more than another investing opportunity. It will be habitual. It will alter reality.",

We know how impossible this is. As of today, there are still people not connected to the internet, no access to electricity and no form of civilization. How do these people know about Bitcoin and how to use it when they do not have electricity and internet? On the other hand, there are people that will always refuse to use Bitcoin even after knowing about it with reasons such as security, being used to their traditional understanding of money and many others. I have a few of them around and you can never convince them to use Bitcoin as they prefer fiat.",

These were people that have condemned Bitcoin in the past and it had no impact on bitcoin but now they have accepted bitcoin they believe it will have an impact on bitcoin. I don't know if it's the fact that I'm always sceptical of politicians and billionaires that have made me not give a shit about what they say, but I just don't think it holds any water. A politician saying he'll do this or that if elected is something I've been hearing all my life, so that kind of talk doesn't move me even when it's related to bitcoin because I know that all he wants is votes. A tech billionaire will build an app and say something like \"We respect your privacy and would never share your personal details with a third party\" and people will believe that. How? Is he expected to say \"We will share your personal details with the government if you use our app\"? Hell say what the potential customers want to hear and that's exactly the same thing politicians do, they say what voters want to hear.",

I hope bitcointalk is not becoming another echo chamber like /r/Bitcoin where Bitcoin is PERFECT and does not need any updates, in their mind there's nothing wrong with it or with the LN  Evolution is stopped when people mark something as \"perfect\" not realizing perfection is never to be achieved but it's still something that we should aim for.They do not realize cryptography is an arm race that needs to evolve, otherwise it gets crashed.Bitcoin is going to war with pants down while waving white flag instead of arming itself to fight the government.And people are cheering it up... we don't want privacy, we have nothing to hide, gov would never allow it, exchanges would delist it, investors would go away... It's pathetic.Bitcoin would never even come to life if everyone was such a P***Y in the first place.As of today the biggest problem of Bitcoin is it's community who forgot what this is all about.",

I see the reason for this in the fact that in the past we had some companies that accepted BTC as a means of payment, but after some time these same companies gave up on the same, not only because of volatility, but primarily because that payment option was used by very few number of clients. The problem (if we can call it that) is actually that a very small percentage of people actually want to spend BTC on something because they invested in it exclusively for profit. In addition, many will find it very complicated to pay with BTC, of ​​course compared to paying with cards or cash.",
