Also, people here discouraged bitcointalk account sales for many reasons including scam and spam although its not agaisnt the rules. Also, escrows are not discourage to accept such deals only those who buy and sell. But despite that very reason you rarely seen escrow that accepts such deals, or maybe just maybe they will accept but for higher price. Who knows, most deals like this are private.",

You basically buy the reputation of somebody else. Whether you have a malicious purpose or not, we don't know, and verifying it is impossible. I'd suggest you just continue posting here and build a reputation on your own. At the end of the day, a rank of an account is a mirror of your contribution to the forum (most of the time at least).",

You really think he cares if you tag his newbie account lol? Buying and selling accounts is not against the rules but it discouraged by the community. Most are buying an account to participate in sig campaigns, the only accounts that would really be considered good to buy for scams would be reputable users. Being a hero or legendary doesn't make you reputable at all, but some seem to think so.",

You can work hard on your account and publish valuable posts, and you will get merits. Then you will get a good rank without the need to buy any account on the forum, or you can pay some fees to purchase a Copper membership to enable and post images and get some of the benefits of being a normal member.You can look for escrow managers with high ranks and positive trust in the forum boards who will help you in buying and selling accounts, and stay away from dealing with Newbies; also be careful of scammers who sell hacked accounts from someone because you may lose access to the account that you purchased one day.To purchase a Cooper membership, go to the following link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote",

I checked the forum rules again and found that account sales are allowed, but it is not recommended to sell accounts. Thank you for correcting what I said. I hope that the OP will find a reliable person who will help him get an account so that he can work on signature campaigns. Newbie rank I think all of the signature campaigns, or maybe most of them, do not allow this rank to participate with them, so many people want to buy forum accounts in order to use them to work and make money.This is the link to the rules of the forum for those who want to review them: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0",

The ranks are not for sale, the reputation of an account earn are not for sale too. It's something you achieve. Still there are people who buy and sell accounts but that's an under-table business. In the deal you are always at risk of getting exposed and once exposed you will find yourself in a very bad shape unless in the mean time you have done something extra ordinary to contribute in the community.
