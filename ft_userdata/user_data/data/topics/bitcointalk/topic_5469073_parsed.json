Gold bridge legend is ridiculous.I agree with your skepticism. Attempting to raise $1 billion through a token presale by a team of unknown individuals does indeed raise significant red flags. The claim of a \"Gold bridge legend\" sounds highly implausible and is often a common tactic used by potential scams to lure unsuspecting investors. It's crucial for anyone considering such investments to exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before getting involved. Remember, in the cryptocurrency world, it's better to be safe than sorry.When dealing with investing in the world of crypto, it is very important to conduct thorough and careful research. Make sure to perform team background checks, analyze project documentation, and keep up with developments in related communities. Security and caution are key when investing in the world of cryptocurrency.Ultimately, the cryptocurrency space can be risky, and there are a lot of scams out there. It is important to do your due diligence and only invest an amount you can afford to lose. If something feels too good to be true or raises suspicions, it's often best to err on the side of caution and avoid the investment altogether.It's a wise approach to wait for the owner's decision and maintain a positive and patient attitude as developers. Clear communication and transparency are essential in cryptocurrency projects. Hopefully, the owner will provide more information and address concerns, ensuring a more secure and trustworthy investment opportunity. In the meantime, continue to focus on your development work and keep a watchful eye on the project's progress.Visit it and prove its truth and its existence in this real world, so that it really comes into your hands to be able to own NursGold.I'm here waiting for search results from everyone who has visited and owned it. Let's share this news about NurGolds. Can this be a positive potential for the scope of crypto currency and in everyday life?Specification :ðŸ“ˆName: NURSðŸ“ˆType: Blockchain IndependentðŸ“ˆSupply: 15,000,000 coinsðŸ“ˆPre-Sale: 1,000,000 coinsðŸ“ˆMethod of Getting Rewards: PoS & ValidatorðŸ“ˆMinimum Validator : 1,000 coinsðŸ“ˆAlgorithm: Proof Of Stake (PoS)Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551605596026Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/nur1_golds/linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/company/pt-nur1tech-indonesiacheck the link: https://nurgolds.com (to register)",

This is just a change from smallnursgolds (snurs) which will later become Nursgolds (nurs). so that it will maintain the price of Nurgolds against GoldBars, which is half. Which will likely be 1:1 in the future. Everyone hopes for that.1 snurs = $5 (units in tokens)1 nurs = $1000 (a unit in crypto) which would refer to half of the world gold price per oz.To be sure, you can check on the existing presale website.This good news makes it easier for anyone who buys and wants to own Nurgolds coins.You can check the truth about rumors about this issue on the existing presale website, and you can also contact the admin directly on the contact us page.what news did you receive or after you received information from the owner of Nurgolds. I hope everyone gets information from the owner of Nurgolds directly to understand all of this.cheers....all good possible",
