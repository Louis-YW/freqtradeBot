  "content": "Its not been quite long i made my first purchase on bitcoin and since then i have been very curious on following up with the market trend #updown. I got many nice advice from senior folks here in the community which was helpful and i successfully moved my bitcoin from the exchange platform i made the purchase (binance) to a non-custodial wallet, which i choose the electrum as i noticed most people here are using it which means it very reliable.     So i have since alot of Forum members sign message here but really to know how its done and forgive if i am actually going off point but even the usage of the word (sign) dont really gets to my full understanding. But i would Love to learn how its been done in the forum here and also in my own wallet.",

Type your message, paste the address you want to sign the message from (it must come from your own wallet), and then click \"Sign\". A signature will then be generated which you can then give (along with the address and message) to other individuals so they can verify it.",

Hope my post is not the one that confused you, OP did not mention anything like phone, I only just think of adding it for him to know that he can not make use of mobile Electrum to sign a message.Quote from: sheenshane on February 19, 2023, 11:29:15 PMhttps://jhoenicke.github.io/brainwallet.github.io/#verifyAnything pertaining to brain wallet are of legacy addresses, it will only work for legacy addresses, not for nested or native segwit.Quote from: sheenshane on February 19, 2023, 11:29:15 PMhttps://www.bitcoin.com/tools/verify-message/This keep displaying 'invalid address' for all bitcoin addresses.",
