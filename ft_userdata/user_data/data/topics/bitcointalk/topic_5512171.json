Since that amount is huge amount, I think a person can live with $44k annually, depending on where you live. The $300,000 is too much for an annual budget; I am not sure how you spend such a large amount unless you live with a family.",

Maybe because in my country, when I convert the numbers you just mentioned, it is huge and more than enough to sustain an entire family but in the US it might be so different since your living expenses are more expensive and will get just even more expensive. You would need to make sure that you can cover all things possible. Daily expenses, medical bills, or any emergency like the house burning down and if you have kids you would also need to make sure that they already have graduated or else you would also need to cover educational bills until they are. Only you can assess how much you are spending in a course of a year and whether what you have is enough to sustain you until your last day.  QuoteHow can it be determined when they should just stop working all together then?  Retire now or until theyre 50/62 years of age to enjoy their $$$? Again you are the only one who knows the extent of your situation. If you can still work and you are not experiencing any health concerns I think a year or two would not hurt. If you are not yet determined to retire then I think that is your answer.",

We know that historically each Bitcoin market cycle lasts for 4 years, that comes together with cycle of Bitcoin block subsidy halving. Satoshi Nakamoto set up the block subsidy halve after every 210,000 Bitcoin blocks that take about 4 years to happen.Times of 100x or 1000x for your investment in Bitcoin long gone and will not come back, so your investment ROI target must be much lower, like 4x, 5x. I believe that with 8 more market cycles, that ROI target will be achievable.Meanwhile, you can withdraw your profit gradually with time too, like the method of JayJuanGee.[ANN] JJG Sustainable Bitcoin Withdrawal Strategyhttps://bitcoindata.science/withdrawal-strategy",

When you are rich enough, have abundant money, you can have many options to do but as a person who became millionaire by investment in Bitcoin, it is possible to reserve part of capital in bitcoin, as investment for future.Cash out and use money for two other main things: retirement capital, and investment capital into a business like a restaurant, a coffee shop, that will help to get sustainable revenue and it's good capital diversification as well as manage risk better. You can be the owner of business, and hire professional staffs to kick-off your business successfully.",

It's a good challenge. But when deciding whether to retire now or wait? Well, there are some things worth considering, although $15 million is certainly enough to retire on. But the decision isn't just about the amount of money. But it also depends on how you want to live your life. What is your goal? And what are you doing? How does he want to maintain your lifestyle over time? If you earn $300,000 in taxes per year, that's stable income. But you are comfortable with the market fluctuations. Particularly if the bulk of your wealth is tied to Bitcoin or not, a multifaceted approach can help manage that risk.Another consideration is how you want to spend your time like do you love your job or do you want more freedom to travel, have hobbies, or pursue other activities? You can decide to stay active until age 50 just to build a larger buffer.A financial planner can therefore calculate how much you will actually need based on your expected lifestyle. However, bottom line, it is very important to balance your financial security and personal goals. Some are content with working a little longer for peace of mind. Some want to retire sooner and calibrate their living styles according to this objective. It is all about what comfort is most provided and what is granted most satisfaction.Quote from: Smack That Ace on October 07, 2024, 02:55:45 AMEven if you live in the United States, that's a huge amount of money and not everyone has that kind of money.

That is not a wise idea as it will make people more skeptical. I recommend you find a financial expert or advisor, they will give you the best advice you want to hear.You have good reason to seek professional advice. Especially if you are managing a large property like this. Financial advisors and lawyers can provide advice based on your individual circumstances. Tax implications and long-term financial goals, of course. However, I think it's also valuable to seek feedback in communities like this and where people can offer alternative perspectives or even share their own experiences.Of course, the expert financial advisor is invaluable, but the forums can offer insights or feedback that might help frame the questions you pose to those experts. In the end Getting professional advice to organize your finances At the same time, understanding that other people who are similarly situated, how do they guide their own decisions? Sometimes, it is a requirement to be open-minded and make decisions with the proper consideration of all the available alternatives before committing to making an important decision in life.",

I agree. Of course, the amount of money is big, but it may become even better in 7 years, or a bit more, people would choose their own retirement age, but 50-55 seems alright, depending on the job.I think that in 7 years, your investment will become even bigger, thus ensuring that you will have more opportunities to use it in other ways or spend it just on yourself.",

For some, it's about the passion they have for thier business and for others, it's not just about how much you've generated either in Bitcoin or USDT but that you created a system that is sustainable and that you're still managing and ensuring that  it remains relevant for the long term.$15M worth of bitcon is not what's obtainable by the average individual and that's even above somany persons fuck you region but even at that, would that mean when you've gotten upto that amount you will just retire even when you're still quite young? Apart from those that have good plans after retirement, retiring too early can make you become vaulnaurable to a lot of vices and if you're not careful enough, you might start engaging in reckless and bad habits that might lead you to becoming an addict to a particular substance.",

You can create an excel sheet and calculate it in two ways.15,000,000 as initial capital, and ROI is 3% annually, the profit will be 450,000 each year. In this case you can withdraw that profit each year and don't reinvest it.The second case is reinvest your profit, and you will need a formula for accumulative investment capital and ROI is 3% annually.After 1 year, you will have a new capital is 15,000,000+450,000 = 15,450,000 for the second year, and 3% of it is 463,500 for a second year.For a third year, you can continue this calculation, for both cumulative capital and profit.I don't know why you asked this question with an input of 3% ROI annually, it's unrealistic because Bitcoin has bullish and bearish years.https://charts.bitbo.io/yearly-candles/https://casebitcoin.com/",
