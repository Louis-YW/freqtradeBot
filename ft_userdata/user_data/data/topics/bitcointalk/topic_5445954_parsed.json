But it didn't as the Asian market could have make the price go afloat, as it going $27,400 and perhaps this week we could go back to $28k'ish again.Long term? not seeing any, again just the initial shock of the rate hike that might bitcoin investors pushing for the sell button.But we are all good now. And who knows, it could be the opposite as more individuals running to bitcoin market.",

Later they turned their minds completely and increased interest rates in many latest months. Now they did not stop but just decrease their pace after some bank collapses.Look at Bitcoin in the past two years. Did it fall and lose $40k, $30k because of FED interest rate policy?They just increased it latest months so how do people explain why in the past three months, with same increasing pace, Bitcoin climbed from $16k to $29k?Because of FED, FOMC and interest rate?",

      "body": "Bitcoin sold sharply after the FOMC meetings of yesterday. The Federal Funds Rate was hiked to 5.00% which represents an additional 25 basis points and also an indication that inflation is seriously battling the economy of the US. That said, I've explained to those that reached out to me after the sharp fall that Bitcoin will not fall for long. The market was only confused in the wake of that news, which coupled with the needed correction of the coin.However, the effect can't see the light of day, the sentiment of Bitcoin is still bullish as most economic considerations disfavour the USD at this present time.",

Of course, it would be best if they stopped doing that, but considering how deep they got into problems, they have no other choice. All in all, the price of BTC is returning to the levels before Kwon&Bankman, and considering that the banks have shown their weaknesses, part of the money must have been invested in Bitcoin.",
