  "content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/197m0yc/almost_no_one_understands_the_51_attack/I came across this thread on Reddit, and thought that community members here would be interested in it since we've discussed this same topic here before. I personally find the subject of the 51% on Bitcoin to be both fascinating and extremely relevant. If there is a systemic risk to the entirety of Bitcoin--even if is a relatively remote one--then this ought to be discussed thoroughly.Here's the first part of it of the post:QuoteTLDR: A 51% attack encompasses more than just double spending. Double-spending would be the most overt and irrational move an attacker could take. There are ways to profit that don't reveal their control.A 51% attack simply means that a coalition can censor miners (or block producers under other consensus) who are outside the coalition. Whether that be a long chain of old blocks or all future blocks starting now - it is still a 51% attack.Most people severely downplay the damage a 51% will cause due to this misunderstanding. A rational 51% attacker does not care about historical blocks - they simply use their majority control to mine 100% of future blocks and, with half the hashpower, earn 100% of the rewards.",

      "body": "The thread title is a biasly wrong induction. Yes controlling 51% and making an attack on the Blockchain is more than double spending and could have way for an attacker to censor other miners by either including or excluding certain transactions in the BlockThis gaining more benefit while other miners suffer the losses But stating it would be 100% subtle is only theoretical Bitcoin is quite transparent and as time goes someone would be on the abnormalities and a proper response would be taken by the community. Same applies with miner centralization, though it poses it's risk and the way it's going we getting there since the top 2 mining pool already have a combined hash power of more than 51%.But if the response of the community is swift the damage could also be mitigated. Yes most of what the author stated was correct but I feel it overrated the ease in making a 51% attack undetected and Underrated The capabilities of the community.",

Note that if the group of honest miners still have remaining 49%, then they can still mine, on average, every second block. If it will be reorged, then people will notice that. First, because of chaintips. Second, because all miners in a given pool will suddenly see, that a pool is getting all of their blocks reorged.So, doing a chain reorganization is not a silent thing. It is visible in logs. It is measured. It will be noticed. And people will take action (for example by leaving the 51% pool, because their reputation will be destroyed).Even less serious reorganizations were noted, for example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447129So, why do you think, that 51% attack will remain unnoticed, if even sigops limit violations were caught? And they are much more silent, because a block, which violates sigops limit, is simply invalid, so you have to receive it directly from a failing node.Quoteand, with half the hashpower, earn 100% of the rewardsThis is not the case. If you have 51% mining power, then you can earn 51% rewards on average. Earning 100% rewards require 100% hashpower (or reorging all blocks, mined by everyone else, but then, it is very far from being \"silent\").Also, there is one important thing: jumping from 51% to 60%, 70%, 80%, and so on, doesn't make much sense. Because then, you are basically raising your own difficulty, for no reason. And then, you can paradoxically get more coins, by going from 90% to 60%, because then, the difficulty can drop, so you will pay less for electricity.",

By what authority?For me, one of the most common misconceptions about Bitcoin is that there are human beings involved in running it, and those humans can take action when they \"see stuff\" they don't like. But this isn't so. Bitcoin is just an algorithm. There are no human beings involved. A node as a vote with it's hashrate, and that's it. You can have whatever personal opinion about a node you want, the only recourse you have is to outvote that node with your own hashrate. Complaining here on Bitcointalk wouldn't do anything. Calling the police won't do anything (they would have no idea who to arrest). I share the frustration that this author seems to have: lots of people--even a lot of people who seem to think they know a lot about blockchain and Bitcoin--don't seem to fully understand the implications of decentralized system. There is no central authority. There is no \"community\". There is no nothing except nodes running hashrate. Why is that so hard for people to understand? That's actually the central innovation of Satoshi's Bitcoin whitepaper, and to this day many people simply don't understand it.",

As a decentralized system with no central Authority, it is run by certain protocols and there are no human hands that can fix it But we can mitigate the human problem Once detected, miners who cares about network security in the supposed malicious pool would pull out which would reduce the hash power and full node operators may be able to fork it.

No they don't have to build a new chain from the Genesis block They can start from the latest block or go further back if they plan on reversing a specific transactionBut the goal is that their private chain have to grow to the extent it becomes longer than the honest chain by continuously mining Blocks faster than other miners.With 51% hash power  Once their chain gets longer than the honest they can then broadcast it and the nodes would take the longest chain as the Valid There by making double spending possible But The cost in starting and maintaining it is astronomical, not to mention difficulty adjustment that's makes sure mining becomes more competitive.

It would cost a fortune and there would be a shareholder revolt.If it's #2 then it does not matter, it would have to be a larger country, with once again enough money to buy the miners and available electricity to run them.

But you bet it would cause enough disruption of mining to allow them to do other things.All it all, a 51% attack from the government / big business is not a big worry for most people.-Dave-Dave",

Guess what: some people tried to fork Bitcoin, and they reached 51% for a short period of time. What happened next? Well, people simply sold their ALTs for BTCs, and moved on. And the same thing can happen again: you get 51%, you reorg some valid blocks, mined by other miners, and then everyone will abandon your chain, so you will be left with a lot of worthless coins.Quotethen the other 49% might as well stop mining because they will never get another block rewardIt is never the case. Miners are long-term investors. They will rather mine an altcoin, than stop mining. Which means, that if some transactions will be censored, then miners will form just another altcoin, and users will join them, because then, they will have at least some confirmations, instead of constantly seeing zero confirmations in the attacker's chain.Currently, there are some altcoins, which have something around 1% of double SHA-256 hashrate. And guess what: they are still maintained, there are still some users, and even though the value of their coins decreased, their altcoin is still actively used. And when they were attacked more heavily, they introduced more rules, like \"max 10 blocks chain reorganization\", and other consensus changes, which allowed them to keep running their chain, no matter how hard they are attacked.So, to sum up: a silent attack has much more chances to succeed. For example: the latest testnet4 soft-fork was silent, and many blocks were produced, before people noticed, what happened, and triggered a huge chain reorg, to fix it. But eventually, everything went back to normal, and timewarp rules were enforced properly. Because Bitcoin is not ruled by miners. And I know, that it is true, because it is not the first time, when I can see, that users can enforce their rules, and force miners to mine the blocks they want. Because miners are like entrepreneurs, making blocks, and selling them to users. And if you have 51%, and you use it for attacking, then nobody will buy your blocks, and they will lose their value immediately.",

After a few hours/days/weeks of this happening, it wouldn't matter if the hacks were discovered since the integrity of the entire chain would be utterly incinerated since nobody could know which transactions were made by the attackers and which were made by normal users. Understand that there is, for instance, no way to simply \"turn off\" Bitcoin while some central authority figures out what went wrong. The network would keep going and going in realtime (and in a situation where the network integrity was in question there would be a massive \"run on the bank\" situation with basically every single holder trying to trade their Bitcoin for USD).And while I will be the first to say that such an attack is \"unlikely\", that is not the same as saying it is \"impossible\". My savings account is probably stored in a not-internet-connected mainframe at a Big Bank, and it's backed up to WORM storage in (probably) multiple geographical locations. It is \"unlikely\" that may savings account at Big Bank will be lost, and this is definitely not something that is very common (in fact I've never heard of this happening to a prominent bank ever). I don't lose sleep worrying that my savings account will be hacked just as I don't worry about every airplane I board crashing--because it's very unlikely.The question is, in terms of systemic risk, which is safer: your Big Bank savings account, or Bitcoin? I would argue the former, based on everything we know right now. This is based on a security assessment that takes into account track record, system complexity (banks use braindead non-internet-connected mainframes that have stood the test of decades of time), and system governance (same deal: banking regulations and industry-standard practices around access, personnel, etc. that have been hardened over the decades for banks, whereas all of this is brand new for Bitcoin).The point is, anybody who tells you it is \"impossible\" that Bitcoin is hacked and the value of your holdings could never go to zero are... wrong. Unlikely maybe, but not impossible.",

(and yes they can because behind every algo filled node is a human at the computer that has a keyboard, commanding the node(bitcoin is not AI))what you find is that the bitcoin economics work great because those that try to cheat it lose out in the end and those that operate honestly end up winning. there are many mitigating factors that are in place and also extra scripts that services have and people operating nodes as extra precautionseven the most simple thing of block rewards cannot be spent for 100 blocks means that a malicious pool has to win constantly for 16 hours before it can even spend its first malicious block reward. thus even at the 15th hour of being malicious the honest part of the network and services that want an honest network can decide to re-org a crap tonne of empty blocks and accept honestly filled blocks or other factors of preferencethus even a malicious actor ends up gong straight to remain relevant.. and thats even when asics can jump to any other pool in under 20 seconds but have hours of time to see the malicious actors failures before the malicious actor can even profit from its maliciousness, so again a malicious actor wont want to be malicious if they are not making profit. and if they cant make profit per block for 16 hours delay per block, then the likely hood of them being malicious at all is negligible due to the risk of losing all of their efforts before the 16th hour delay between creation and spendability",

Hackers would presumably hack the software, not the individual ASICs. 1. asics do not have a full node software in them.. in simple terms an asic receives a basic hash and some blockheader data via a different communication method(its called stratum) than the normal node relay network, and re-hash it trillions of times until it makes a difficult hash and send the difficult hash back (hash in -hash out) via the stratum connection..  asics are not full nodes and have a separate communication path to the pools compared to the bitcoin peer network of nodes2. asic owners have a asic that (simple terms hash in-hash out) and separately have a computer that has a full node to watch the blockchain for other purposes including risks and if they get paid3. asic owners can jump their asics activity over to other pools if the owners notice a pool is doing some funky stuffso if a pools node is infected.. asic owners (remotely) can just change pools. via each asic owner looking at their own separate node for instances of malicious/funky stuffim starting to think that you make posts with some silly assumptions to poke and trigger people to correct you so that you learn by being spoonfed info rather than actually spending the time to learn things properly by actually researching aspects of bitcoin(its starting to become a common occurrence with certain people.. play dump to prompt people to correct you on purpose as a lazy way to learn)its like those preppy kids that hire a tutor to just give them the answers by acting ignorant to the subject rather than actually reading about things and learning via looking for informationtry to learn about all the mitigating factors that actually make a potentially malicious pool not profit and instead want to operate honourably to profit. (hint there are many factors at play)",

In theory, the attacker can start at any block because they will eventually surpass the other miners as long as they maintain a majority. They would not necessarily have to start with the genesis block. It depends on their goal.Quote from: Accardo on September 09, 2024, 07:33:53 AMNevertheless, it's quite unrealistic to possess a hash rate that supersedes that of all other miners combined. It is naive to believe that a miner (or pool) cannot reach 51% as it has already happened once.",
