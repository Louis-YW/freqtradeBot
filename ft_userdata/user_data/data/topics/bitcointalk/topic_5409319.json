If you want something super specific(maybe concerning the entities in the art, or maybe you wanted a certain specific art style), a human artist would still likely get the work done a lot better; though a lot slower.^Or at least for now, until the AI gets a lot smarter.",

      "body": "Frankly, the most concerning thing about this A.I generated digital drawing is that over the years to come, big companies won't hire digital artists anymore to work on their marketing campaigns or any other aspect of character design for gaming companies. And that's very unfortunate for people like me who just got into this niche few years ago where I spent hundreds of hours to improve and master this craft.Other people may seem to view A.I as a tool that will aid artists to do their job more efficiently especially to those who are veteran in the field, which will make them stand out among others, but as a young artist this thing creeps me out, and there's this feeling that anytime soon, when computer became more sentient, artist like me can be easily replaced  And it sucks, especially if this is the only field in which you are sure that you excel. Plus, the art industry itself already suffers from being undervalued, because some people think that a piece of artwork can be easily done without a sweat and that they can find other way to do that themselves -- and this A.I can prove that those lines isn't half ass joke anymore.",

Firstly, these art works are really good. I cannot believe all of them are created by an AI.If it is really created by an AI, just imagine how AI will be in the coming years.But then would NFTs really be worth it ? People can simply use AI to create art works so why bother buying an NFT created by an AI.Secondly, as the technology progresses, jobs are being decreased. As you said, real artists will get discouraged since an AI bot would be able to create such good art.Only the really creative ones will survive.",

The copyright must have been authorized by the artist, because nowadays the digital world includes people who are not responsible for taking it and then selling it on Opensea.How did you feel when you first saw this work? amazed, amazed and happy mixed up because this is the first time we see Bitcoin art that we have never found anywhere else.",
