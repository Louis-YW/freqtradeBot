As you can see in the image above taken by me, they've included Coins PH as one of the payment methods in their restobar. Coins PH is the most popular crypto wallet in the Philippines. I believe that the owner have upgraded its account to Business Level in order to accept crypto transactions of up to 5 million pesos ($100,000) per month.I'm just happy seeing this to be honest. At least this is just the beginning. Hopefully more establishments will be accepting crypto payments here in the city.",

On top of that, it also supports the USDC stablecoin, BTC, ETH, XRP, SLP, etc. We just simply scan the QR code or add their account as a recipient for us to easily send payments on the go.",

It goes thru this 3rd party provider, which, in this case is coins.ph. So you still need to have account in their platform and they require KYC as most legit crypto-related business platform. So you need to have verified account to enjoy their services. But if nothing else, at least it is giving you the opportunity to pay crypto via 3rd party service provider.",

That restobar must have taken another leap to level up, and its just nice to think that if ever you run out of funds in the middle of your jam, you can pay crypto as well. This must be a new thing for those who have never been exposed into crypto before, and will be one way that they can start knowing crypto as its already become mainstream in some countries. Another achievement for crypto indeed.",

Actually i am using it (in addition to few other stable alts) in my online businesses as i am in a country where crypto is not legalized.But , as a merchant, i don't think it's yet suitable to use crypto in my store (i mean real chop not online). This is because it has a volatile price and unstable market.",

I believe you can also pay in a convenience store to purchase foods or products. I am really hoping that a lot of stores will accept this kind of payment method. I have also posted here in the forum about how to live using only bitcoin to purchase things. Most of it is about the coins, ph. Also, I think Paymaya will follow this or Gcash and most of the merchants will accept this.",

I also hold bitcoin but that doesn't mean I will only sell it when it hits the moon, I will sell them when I make a profit or I will sell my bitcoins when I need money to do some important things. Investing in bitcoin is for us to increase income, save depending on each person's purpose but we should not just hold them forever, but use them when needed.",
