Or is it equity based?Looks like a revenue share model.    Financed by a pump and dump token.   Nobody should accept an equity-based compensation financed by random altcoins because there is no guarantee that they will hold value even constantly, and not go into freefall.That is why most marketplaces require that you accept payment in fiat, such as bank transfer or cash, or a major coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Though personally I only do Bitcoin payments.",

      "body": "Personally, I wouldn't do equity-based pay on altcoin projects.I did do equity-based compensation on LN stuff back in the day, But I knew it was gold from the get. I even voluntarily ran a campaign pitch with major players at the time to pitch in on a LN based services campaign, but LN did pretty well and didn't need it.with that being said, at the top layer this project seems to be taken very seriously by the powers that be.  https://cozy-world-metaverse.gitbook.io/cozyworld/inrtoduction/welcome-to-the-cozy-world-metaverseMaybe a metaverse/web3 fanatic will take keenly to the project. Or perhaps good pay on the project will create a metaverse fanatic. Quote from: cryptockn on February 22, 2024, 01:04:23 AMWhat are the requirements (programming languages, etc)?Fullstack usually consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, PHP and other languages.  This appears to be a metaverse project so you'll likely have your hands full and learn some new languages on the fly.",
