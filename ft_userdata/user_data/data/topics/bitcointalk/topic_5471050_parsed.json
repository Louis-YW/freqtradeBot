You can read it from these link: You data is not safe on centralized exchangesThis happened in Hong Kong but it can also happen at anywhere in the world. It is an effective way to steal from someone's bank account.What that is most important is to avoid giving your identity documents to people. Those sites too can misuse your identity documents that you submitted to them.",

I would imagine that someone using the method you mentioned would get caught quickly. I mean, for how long could someone use a bank account account that's not his? Regardless though, you can try to reduce the chances of dealing with such individuals by:1. Dealing with individuals who have a lot of feedback.2. Merchants (because they have to go through advanced verification).3. Refuse to deal with anyone who has a Binance account with a different name than the bank account's name. A lot sellers would ask if you're okay with them sending funds from \"their partners/friends account\".",

If we deal with them for P2P deals, our bank accounts can also get feezed. Have you ever faced this problem on Binance ? How can we reduce the chances of getting affected by this ? I'm not a big fan of Binance when it comes to P2P so I haven't gotten this experience but since the exchange is very popular in my country, I have heard countless stories of it happening to my country men especially on twitter. Binance is very popular so there'll always be scammers looking to take advantage of newbies just registering on the exchange to trade. In addition to what others have said, I'll suggest if you must use Binance centralized P2P you should go through their guideline as they have it on their platforms and follow up what they said to avoid becoming a victim to P2P scams. You can't save yourself from receiving stolen funds but you can reduced the risk of that happening by; Avoiding high rate sellers/buyers and only trade with verified merchants Scammers are known for using high rate to attract victims. Avoid offline transaction, scam marchants are known for trying to take customer off the official exchange platforms then they can trade with you with stolen coins or fiats. Avoid transaction from third party accounts, OmegaStarScream already emphasize on that. Also don't accept payment from multiple account and report any suspicious activity to Binance exchange customer care to have evidence when the authorities comes knocking on your door. Stolen funds will always be sent from a different account from that of the user you're trading with, so report such activities when you encounter them irrespective of the exchange you're using to trade P2P.",

Hacked bank accounts ? How ? If anyone has hacked a bank account, he would rather withdraw the money rather than spending it slowly to pay for the P2P deals. Wouldn't the original owner get notified that a transaction is made from his bank account without his knowledge Anyways. in case this happen in some part of the world, it is better to deal with verified merchants. You may find non-verified merchants rates a bit more attractive, but it is not worth taking the risk. One more thing which i personally follow is that do not make a single big P2P deal. If you want to have a transaction of 1000 dollars (example) better do it in parts so that your capital is less exposed to risk in case any mishap happens.",

One of the guidelines/rules is that you should not release the coins if the bank account details doesn't match with the buyer's details. The buyer's name must be the same as the name of the person who sent you the money.Scammers always come up with new tricks.

If you follow the Binance P2P guidelines correctly, there will be no chance of being scammed. Those who are scammed are usually released immediately without seeing valid proof in the bank account whether the funds have been received or not. Scammers will only send fake proof and urge them to be released immediately. Whatever it is, make sure to choose a merchant with a lot of transactions with 90%-100% accuracy and a lot of positive feedback. Those who are the best merchants will provide a fast response and will make appropriate payments.",

I've used the Binance P2P service and I've not had any challenges but that doesn't mean there are no scammers. A user can get his account frozen by unknowingly trading with a fraudster who's laundering money through the exchange and possibly looking for a way to hide the stolen funds by trading with innocent users. Sadly, one of the setbacks of P2P trades is that you don't know who you're transacting with and the source of the person's funds and I doubt if there's anything can be done to mitigate this risk.I find this topic very interesting, you can read it up and get more information.

Because there were some cases that the other end is gonna try to rush you just for you to send him the payment without even verifying that they've already sent you what you're trading to them. Don't be in a hurry there because you'll never know the new tactics of fraudsters and scammers there but yeah, the platform is legit but it can be misused and abused by these cons.",

I don't think that account can be verified though, that is why it's always advisable to only deal with verified accounts, not like it's 100% secure, but it's better. We just have to be careful of how and where we drop our personal documents because we do not know what they can be used for. Centralized exchanges carry too many risks.",

It's not unlikely that ill gotten funds are utilized to complete these transactions and could potentially get the receiving party's account flagged or even transactions charged back. So I'd say avoid it unless it's one of your last options. Also go by feedback and not best price if you do.",

I would imagine that someone using the method you mentioned would get caught quickly. I mean, for how long could someone use a bank account account that's not his? Yeah, scammer would probably be able to use victim's bank account once or may be few times but deed is done, no? Also, scammers would likely have multiple such accounts lined up. Something similar happened to me few years ago, this was the process: Scammer creates a buy order, they have unsuspecting victim lined up with his bank details who is going to send money to seller or scammer sends it themselves if they got the access, scammer sends the money from victim's bank account, seller confirms that he received the money and p2p platform gives up the custody of coins because seller gave the confirmation that he received the amount, scammer gets the coins. Now, after few days seller gets chargeback from the victim's bank account that he was duped into sending money, seller loses the coins and his money received also gets freezed. This is exacty what happened to me few years ago. It wasn't binance p2p but local p2p exchange. My colleague frequently deals on binance p2p, his tip is, stick to reputed buyers/sellers even tho rates might be less. Scammers lure often by greed.",
