I am a Bangladeshi resident Bitcoin is not valid in my country I have to proceed using Bitcoin secretly as Bitcoin is not valid from my country. I can't buy and sell bitcoins from restaurants, ATM, money counters etc. from my country because bitcoins are not legalized in my country which is why not all things are transacted in my country. Bitcoin can be bought and sold by countering ATM restaurant money from countries whose governments have accepted Bitcoin through legal tender.",

It was Legal tender in that nation on June 9 2021.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_SalvadorIn that nation, people can use Bitcoin on-chain and on Lightning Network too but local citizens in some interviews said that they were not happy to receive bitcoins as payment from customers for their business. Because they will lose extra money for on-chain transactions later to cash out and a bigger risk is losing their business budget in fiat value when Bitcoin drops more and more. It was serious problems for El Salvadorians in last bear market but perhaps now they are more happy if they held their bitcoins through 2 years of bear market and saw a new all time high days ago.You can follow discussions about it thereEl Salvador has become the first country to make #Bitcoin legal tender! üá∏üáª.People in that thread will give you most updates about things happening in El Salvador.",

However, the usage dropped significantly. However, the use has increased because the nation has become a tourist attraction for cryptocurrency users.
