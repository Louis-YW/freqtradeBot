I've seen newbies spamming Bitcointalk with AI-generated articles with their links inside and this one is another method they employed not knowing that they will be easily busted.",

That speaks well for what you're up to OP and that means that you're with dollarpesa and you're not legitimately asking if they're approved or whatnot. But you seem to have a successful attempt to make people curious and look on the topic that you've made but not to the actual link or channel that you've mentioned over your thread. Maybe a few or some of us did but not most of us.",
