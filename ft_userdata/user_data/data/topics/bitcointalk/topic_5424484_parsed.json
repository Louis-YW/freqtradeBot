Is there something that we don’t know that the government is not telling us? Which all are just speculations. Never take scientist findings as a hoax. Scientists are called scientists for a reason; they gather the data with hypotheses.  Which can therefore give humanity a chance to prevent dying, and have the data to continue life. Hopefully, this threat doesn’t come out during my lifetime. I don’t think I can pull off a zombie look.",

If there was to be a pandemic then if this was genuine then it’d definitely be something to panic about rather than the Chinese flu virus.I’ve been training for this my whole life though. I’ve seen pretty much every mainstream zombie movie that exists. I think I’d head far north & live off the land.",
