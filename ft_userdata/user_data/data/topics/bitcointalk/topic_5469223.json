  "content": "As much as we would all like to give the impression that the cryptocurrency market can be predicted with certainty using numerous theories, such as the 4-year cycle theory, which is meant to anticipate both bull and bear markets. While all of this has historically been demonstrated a few times, there is no denying that the landscape of the entire cryptocurrency market has fundamentally shifted as a result of this recent mainstream adoption.And given that most people today have heard of the term \"Crypto,\" it would be ridiculous to apply the same sets of regulations to a Crypto market that was previously only known to those who invested money in it.The growth of new entities (Addresses) entering the cryptocurrency market can be seen in this chart, and it is obvious that each spike corresponds to a bull market. However, one thing stands out, and that is the enormous spike that occurred during the bottom of the $15k bear market last year. This spike even exceeds the bull market's 2021 level.This is tremendously bullish, showing the first signs of true broad adoption and how far cryptocurrency has come that we can even experience such euphoria in the midst of a bad market.We can also see this when we consider the practically constant \"Bitcoin\" trendings on Twitter/X and that even in current bear market, suggesting that the cryptocurrency environment may have actually altered to a point of no-return. Regardless of the short-term pricing, cryptocurrencies have really become a topic of conversation for individuals every day and I think this is something we all agree on.",

Mass adoption? It is really that something inevitable because we are still a decade+ on existence but we could really make out that comparison in between adoption rate and recognition in between those early years upto this present.Talking about its existence would really be that more rampant specially if the market would really be making up some noise specially on bull run season. On the time that they would be hearing out those people who do make money then this is where people do usually jump in. Its not really that something unavoidable because human beings do really get attracted with money making things rather than on utility.  Charts dont lie and we do really see those significant jumps and indicators about huge buys but we cant really point out that those are really that made up by tons of people or simply a whale move.",

This may have a bad impact on their trading or investing career in the long run. Completely my own opinion though.The first time a lot of people heard about crypto it was mostly about an altcoin. This is due to the marketing of these altcoins. They spend a lot in marketing and they know how to recruit people to their cause. Some people do not understand how it works but they have wallets and a particular coin in them just because it was sold to them and made to believe that it would make them rich. Every day I see new coins that are being marketed on my X (twitter) timeline. The popularity of crypto skyrocketed during the last bull run. In that period all people could talk about was crypto and how it could make them rich. The dip happened and a lot of them separated themselves from crypto. This is mainly because they either invested in the wrong coin or didn't have a clear idea of what crypto is.",

If the bitcoin price will pump and be like thousands of dollars today, the government will start viewing it as something they will need to engage themselves in because of these people in political powers that are disagreeing with bitcoin, are very wealthy, and are ignorant of bitcoin. That is why most of them are still discouraging their citizens from adopting bitcoin. That is why I also support the idea that if bitcoin hits some huge amount of money in the market today, they will embrace the currency as they are the ones that discouraging people from accepting. I believe it’s hit the amount you are thinking we are going to mass adoption in the history of bitcoin.",

I agree, we just go back a few years ago and there was like a lot of negative news saying that Bitcoin is going nowhere but to the pit, and then so on. But look when the adoption rate has grown and the media has been reporting about financial institutions adopting Bitcoin and investing in it. The fact that the market has changed and many institutions came in was like the trend on the 2021 bull run and it shall continue with these ETFs once they're all or most of them approved.Quote from: TheUltraElite on October 05, 2023, 03:03:30 PMIf the price of bitcoin organically grows the next few years, governments will be forced to accept crypto into regular trading and then see the boom in price, its already started but has a huge potential.I reckon, true that when Bitcoin has popped again the news and then they're seeing that the price is increasing and seems unstoppable, they've got no choice but to accept and adopt it lightly as it can help each country's economies to have another source of taxation. Maybe the CBDCs are foreshadowing of it.",

I think that the famous four-year cycle has spread so much among the masses that most people believe that it is a done deal and a sure profit.It is obvious that some bet with the conviction of a sure profit and that the accumulation time is still going on, with the fact that the majority will still very likely join only when they are sure that the new big bull run has started, and if there is no super good news before halving, such a bull run should not be expected before Q3/Q4 2024. I kind of hope that in that case the price will rise by 50% or more in the next ten months, which would mean that in the next big bull run, we could start from a position of at least $40 000 for 1 BTC.",

The real use case of bitcoin as a currency is still prohibited in a large number of countries, in fact my country also still prohibits it. It will take a long time for the government to change these regulations, but it is not impossible.Global adoption of crypto, especially bitcoin, may be inevitable if demand is higher. The government certainly has the power to prohibit it, but if they get something promising from adoption cases then I'm also sure the government will change its regulations on adoption.",

Soon, it will be better and it's not just about the price anymore but the value of Bitcoin as both asset and currency. Young people also tend to bump into Bitcoin because it has been the talk ever since the Grayscale won against the SEC with the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval. All we need is patience before the SEC will give up and let it in. There's probably a fear of missing out also happening and this could be one of the reasons why many addresses are suddenly being made and it's given considering how much impact this piece of news could have on every crypto enthusiast.

You can see now that many are speculating about the average Bitcoin price reaching $100k and above and even in the next few years reaching million-dollar prices.
