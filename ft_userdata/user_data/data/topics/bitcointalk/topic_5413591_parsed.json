It's just based all on the hype which made the demand higher. They really were interesting back then but if all of these games will be played based on how profitable they are, they'll lose players eventually just like what's happening right now for most of the popular P2E games. IMO, games should be played to have fun because if they're having that P2E mechanics and it's attached to the volatility of the market, many newbies would fall for it again without understanding the economy and the crypto market.",

As we know, There are so so many low quality games that have been introduced to the market and most of them are brought by hype. Those games surely did acquired amazing marketcap but it didn't last long because of their unsustainable token model. Most of the people who entered to those games are just aiming for the profits and not because of the game. There are so many boring games that have acquired the spotlight like MyDefiPets, CryptoBlades and other that flop. I don't include axie infinity because I think they are successful in the market despite of the hate and the token value they have right now, They are still doing progress and it is the important thing to have in this early gameFi stage.",

In fact, it was a booming sector last year and many people come to this P2E platform which it makes interesting but it slowed down after Bullrun.

To not repeat myself, I have posted some thought about P2E:Quote from: vv181 on September 10, 2022, 03:52:20 PM~ essential part of gaming itself is whether the game is playful or not, if the game is shitty, people will not play it even if they earn some money. On another hand, people who solely seek profit will come into them. Some popular games like CS GO  already have a loyal community, and the game itself is legendary. With that in mind, we know that there is a platform that give the player an earning if they play the game.Quote from: vv181 on September 11, 2022, 07:49:29 PMTo put it simply, if the game sucks, people won't play it and there is no money in them since there isn't any gaming/economic activity. And yep, I missed an long known thing, which is price. People do gladly pay for the game if it is truly interesting. Let's put aside how the regular game pricing/business evolved, but one characteristic that currently major games has is they are not specifically required to integrate cryptocurrency, there is no benefit for them. So, it's either the business model that has roots in cryptocurrency competing with them or make an attempt to innovate cryptocurrencies that product benefit to most gaming companies.With that in mind, cryptocurrencies do have a truly insignificant part of gaming itself. So this factor should solely be additional and most game developers should prioritize the focus to make or create games that satisfy gaming communities or at least playfully unique.",

P2E is fun while it lasted, and I think this concept has been proven to work, but not feasible to do so in the long-term unless someone can come up with a game that is actually fun and does not need repetitive grinding and mechanics in order to earn something.",
