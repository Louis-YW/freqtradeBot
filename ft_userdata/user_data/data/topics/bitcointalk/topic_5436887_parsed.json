  "content": "self-moderated to keep this thread clean from trolls, attention-seekers and signature spammersLenders have contributed immensely to the ecosystem that falls within this wonderful forum of ours. They have allowed others to take loans both with and without collateral and have evolved as lenders when required over a period of time. Would any lenders be able to shed some light on various aspects of their business practices and experiences?:(edited)1) What is the lowest or smallest ever amount you have loaned out2) What is the highest or largest ever amount you have loaned out3) What is the approximate ratio between loans with collateral being unpaid and loans being fully repaid4) What is the approximate ratio between loans without collateral being unpaid and loans being fully repaid5) What is the approximate ratio between loans that are fully repaid on time vs fully repaid but not on time6) What is the biggest profit you made on a loan7) What is the biggest loss you have incurred as a result of non-paymentThis thread is for lenders therefore in part has been self-moderated in order to keep on topic from lenders rather than have non-lenders posting off topic. I hope they will answer the questions as I have been curious about this for some time and maybe others have been too.",

I might have done a gas fee loan at some point but I don't recall a specific instance.Quote2) What is the highest or largest ever amount you have loaned outSomewhere around ~$20000 when loaned out. I'm guessing the value for that loan peaked at around ~$30000.Quote3) What is the approximate ratio between loans with collateral being unpaid and loans being fully repaidNo clue. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 1:10 just because of a single default and a low number of collateralized loans.Quote4) What is the approximate ratio between loans without collateral being unpaid and loans being fully repaid1:160 on the current iteration of my lending service. (or I guess 1:110 if you include a loan I privately gave to yogg)Quote5) What is the approximate ratio between loans that are fully repaid on time vs fully repaid but not on timeI consider all loans as on time since interest is calculated on a daily basis  Quote6) What is the biggest profit you made on a loanThere was a loan where I profited around 0.15BTC. I can't remember if there was anything larger.Quote7) What is the biggest loss you have incurred as a result of non-payment0.23BTC, though this was while the price of Bitcoin was under 10k.",

It seems far too risky for my liking but I have to congratulate all the lenders here because it is a tough business to be in and they are still here years after they started.",
