When series 2 is released,  folks will want a series 1.  That markup may seem small in months to come",

I'd buy a sealed 2-pack box, and treasure it forever.That said, I'm willing to buy one for $40 if someone's interested (assuming that's the lowest price they're going for). I have BTC ready for payment (want to save money on eBay fees and whatnot).",

Way less mintage but yes have been popular and secondary market has been big. I love that all there cards are btc themed. I dont like the quality as much and there set up isnt as good. Cardsmiths draws you in with the refractors, redemption, mr, CS, Holo. But im collecting both but way less btc trading cards. I think this year we might also see some cardsmiths scarce city auctions",

I don't like the idea of saving unopened boxes for 10 years, what if you hit a 1 BTC redemption and BTC is worth $1 mil a coin, could Cardsmiths even afford to pay out if they haven't kept some BTC aside for redemption cards. Who knows if they will even still be in business then.Rip those packs",

If they go out of business that could be bad if you were holding an card still. Although Id say your probably good for now. I think business is booming and its safe to keep your boxes for a year or two. I know of officially 3 BTCs that have been redeemedAlso not sure if you guys saw. The missing MR holofoils will appear in series 2 as gemstone refractors. Check twitter for official post",
