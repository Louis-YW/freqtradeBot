  "content": "What Are Crypto Tokens?Crypto tokens are crypto currencies that operate within the coin blockchain system. We can conclude that crypto tokens cannot run directly on the blockchain itself, but must ride on the blockchain system of a particular crypto coin.What Are the Types of Crypto Tokens?Non Fungible Token (NFT), SoV (Store of Value), Digital Currencies, Stablecoin, Utility Token, Security Token.The Difference between Tokens and CoinsThe most basic difference between tokens and coins is the blockchain system they have. Crypto tokens use the coin blockchain to operate their systems.CONCLUSIONSCrypto tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that operates within the blockchain system of a specific crypto coin. Unlike Coins that can run directly on their own blockchain network, tokens rely on the infrastructure of a host coin's blockchain. Various types of crypto tokens exist, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Store of Value (SoV) tokens, Digital Currencies, Stablecoins, Utility Tokens, and Security Tokens, By understanding the distinction between tokens and coins is crucial in navigating the cryptocurrency landscape, as each has its unique characteristics and use cases.Note: I created this topic because I still see many people calling TOKENS as COINS, even though they are not the same. Hopefully with this short thread, we can understand the difference better.",

We should follow the rules and use only that which is correct term.Your explanation is a good reminder for those who already knew it but it is a hard explanantion for those who are reading or getting familiar it for the first time. I think you should add some examples too. Like for the token you could say any ERC-20 token based on Ethereum Blockchain or any BRC-20 token based on BTC blockchain. And for the coin you could say BTC is a coin because it has its own blockchain while BRC-20 tokens are based on BTC blockchain. Well again, you make a good post keep it up.",

These coins typically have their own independent networks and are built from scratch.Eg: BTC, ETH, LTCTokens :Tokens are created and hosted on an existing blockchain platform, usually as a smart contract. The most common blockchain used for creating tokens is Ethereum, but other platforms like Binance smart chain and solona also support token creation. Tokens can represent various assets or utilities, and their functionality is determined by the smart contract they are built on.Eg : ERC-20 token like chainLink(Link)Non-fungible token(NFT) like CryptoKittiesUtility tokens like BNB or UNI",

How is it beneficial to anyone if keep on correcting people when they are not the ones who don't care. And honestly one word doesn't change anything. While history of the words is important \"coins and tokens\" were made up words in the first place. They were used because there were really no alternatives, even before tokens came people thought we should call them colored coins. I rather speak about L1 and L2 projects, and some aren't that clear so i wait for the new terms to arise. Those are way more describing anyway and you don't have to explain to everyone what are coins vs tokens. I used to care way more, now it doesn't really matter to me.",

What you did there was still helpful for some who are still new in crypto or even to the veterans who didn't know yet the difference between the two but of course, as long as you did your research first and found out that there is no existing thread yet about this one. You guys are right, so many people often mistaken coins with tokens.@o48o already gave a sample in the form of meme coins and shit coins. I think I know the reason on why they got used to it. Might started with DOGE because DOGE was a coin and not a token but it wasn't a big deal as saying that Bitcoin is a token. Many people will surely be offended by that.",

Some people don't really want to know and to distinguish between these two because they thought it was just some small differences but the reality will gonna shock them when they join bounty campaigns since most of the coins are the ones that always have some value and tokens are mostly not real and their developers often leave the project.

Hopefully with this short thread, we can understand the difference better.I don't worry about this anymore. I think I got used to other members who confuse them and sometimes I do too, not being a hypocrite. Someone already posted about this topic in the past explaining the same things but it's hard to dig them out again. That was when many ICOs are being created under the ERC20 of the Ethereum which are what we call tokens. As of today, new investors don't really care about this anymore but I think it's a good thing to refresh them about the difference between these two things. That way, they will know that the other one is like a rental project while the other one is the owner of it. But, I don't think it's not much important anymore for them as the number of tokens keeps on growing and the demand versus supply rule is being neglected due to hype.",

Hopefully with this short thread, we can understand the difference better.For many people, it is no longer fundamentally different whether they are looking at a token or a coin. In many discussions, I often see that people call everything tokens, simply because it is convenient for them. In technical terms, of course, there is a difference, but from the point of view of a user, investor, speculator, etc., there is no special difference in calling ETH. Call it a token or a coin. I assume that the word token has become a kind of household name, which is how any cryptocurrency is now called in ordinary discussions.",
