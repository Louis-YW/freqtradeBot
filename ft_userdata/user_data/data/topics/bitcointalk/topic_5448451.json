Even if the person do not know about some scam, it would still be avoidable unless he just want to remain greedy like the newbies. If you have experience, scammers will find it difficult to scam you, they only prefer newbies or those that do not know about how to avoid scam.As for newbies, some among them may find it difficult to avoid scam.",

Scam Crypto Gambling casino: Because this is one way through which most crypto newbies fall into scam, whereby a user launches a scam gambling casino, promote it on social media and then promise to offer free huge bonuses, and when a gambler deposit fund, they ban his account for violating one rule or the other. e.g 1xbit 2. Scam investment platform: And this is another avenue where most greedy crypto users who want to get rich over night always fall victim after been promised huge return of investment, then a user deposit and never sees his fund again.",

      "body": "A typical investment scam is obvious, the stories always too good to be true, low risk high reward. I don’t believe the reason people become scam victims is because of lack of information. Sure ignorance has a role to play but greed is the main reason people ignore all the red flags and choose not to do their research before sending their money to sketchy websites. That’s why we see repeat scam victims who never learn from their mistakes. IMO the scams haven’t gotten more sophisticated, rather the world has become more greedy and the culture today is all about money.",

If you read news constantly about crypto scam news you'll start wondering if this people could not even relate what's possible to what's not, like you here of people falling for a scam that has been in existence right from or before the creation of crypto. Although, scammers are now moving into different niche in the crypto ecosystem from creating new scam coims to creating a whole new scam crypto exchange, it's not like they're creating new types of scams or anything all they are doing is to improve the scam that we already know about so they try as much as possible to mask it as if it's genuine. For example if you caught a scam project due to them using a fake or plagarised whitepaper when next they're coming they'll try to eliminate what gave them out in their first scam attempt.",

Today's AI ways of swapping faces with celebrities who pretend to be investors themselves, again, encourage naive people to believe in a miracle.I see regularly in the news that some person gives away all his money and then takes loans and mortgages his house in another fraudulent project, and of course, he ends up with nothing.People are uneducated and stupid; some are easily manipulated; and others are affected by the time factor (now, or you'll be late). Such people were, are, and will be; it seems that this is becoming a part of life.

Connecting wallet on the platform to claim something from them and participating on testnets is really risky to do so to make sure that airdrop hunters could avoid on the risk beneath on those activities they should never use their main wallet so that if they spot a wrong one which is planted by scammers they can avoid to drain up their balances earned. There are to many victims on this schemes and we need to be cautious to avoid money lose from such methods use by techy scammers.",

Yes connecting their main wallet is a bad idea unless how sure they are of the platform. Using a dummy one for airdrops is always a good thing to do especially if you are a guy who always fond of testnet. Cause whatever legit or legal things they say, we can always be sure that they will follow it in the right way. Some codes can be bugged or modified in their favor as always.",

That’s why you see this projects brag about there ranking on their social media handles to sway people to the coin.Another scam is believing nothing will happen to Alticoins because it is listed on many top exchanges. There area many projects that have also used this has bragging rights when they do adverts and this trick has also worked out for so many projects and the funny enough it is still working out for them because these are the things people use as case study when they do there research about a project.",
