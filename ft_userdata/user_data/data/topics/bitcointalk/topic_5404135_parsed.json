First of all this is a wrong board to ask suggestion.Second, unless you are serious about what you are saying, at least not giving much useful information I do not think anyone will really be interested to spend time to write you back.Project Development board could be a good choice for you. Please move it there.",

Is it an Android app or an IOS?What is the benefit of the application? We do not trust closed source applications, and since you will not make the application open source, why does your “blockchain” need an application and not a website?Is the application a new cryptocurrency or are you thinking of using the blockchain outside the traditional system.The market is not in a good position at the moment, so unless you have done your marketing calculations well, you may end up losing your money and the project's death before starting implementation.",
