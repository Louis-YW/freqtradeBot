      "body": "House and senate elections aren't too consequential because nearly every piece of legislation that makes its way through the U.S. congress is along party lines. And both political parties aren't too friendly to crypto anyways, so he'd be stifled by his own party. The executive branch has a lot of power appointing people to lead the government agencies and influence the central banks which have a greater impact on crypto, and the executive branch has only gotten more powerful over the last 20 years. Presidential elections are the only significant elections.That being said, I would rather he win. Better than nothing.",

Since he is running for the Texas House of Representatives, he will more easily be able to express his opinions and beliefs to people in the Texas Congress.If he wins, he might have a better chance at getting Texas to resist the Federal Reserve Bank's ideas for a blockchain currency run by the banking system.",

If someone like Steve Kinard who's already a Bitcoiner and also the director of BTC mining analytics is elected as the House of Rep for Texas District 70 there's a huge chance of him creating some legislation that will support BTC mining in Texas and also monitor the major things that hinder the adoption of BTC in Texas.",
