If you run your own node and then point electrum server towards it then your privacy might be protected and you won’t depend on other nodes for information and also you can use Tor or VPN to hide your IP too if you’re connected to other nodes It is worth mentioning also that running your own node or personal electrum server should be connected with Tor for privacy reason. Connecting it with IP is not private enough as your Internet network provider can still see some information about you and that you are using Bitcoin Core.Question:How does it work to connect to my own fullnode without IP? Copy the the transaction physically to the full node, e.g. by using an USB stick?",

      "body": "you could do this, sure... But if you have your node, your electrum server and your electrum client all running on the same home network (lan) or even on the same machine, you could potentially configure your node to only listen for P2P traffic on tor (by setting listenonion=1 and onlynet=onion in your bitcoin.conf) but still listen for json-rpc calls on your node's LAN network interface (rpcbind=0.0.0.0 and rpcallowip=192.168.1.0/24 in your bitcoin.conf... the allowip needs to be adjusted to your home subnet).That way, you could configure your electrum server to connect to the rpc port on your node, using the credentials or cookie file, using the network interface inside your lan.Afterward, you could connect you electrum client to your electrum server... You *might* not even want to use ssl for the client to electrum server connection, since all traffic stays within your home network (but for some reasons, you might want to chose an ssl setup nontheless).If you run your node on a VPS somewhere on the internet, and your electrum server on an other vps, and your client on your home computer, privacy-wise it might be the best idear to setup your node for tor communication only, setup your electrum server to connect to your node over tor, and setup your client to connect to your electrum server over tor... Like the person you quoted already said: your isp might not be able to read the actual packages (if ssl is used), they'll still know you're exchanging packages with your electrum server...",
