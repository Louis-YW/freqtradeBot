Maybe its a glitch. There are projects showing price even there is no trading or liquidity being used deployed. Can you share the name of the project that has value but liquidity isnt correct. Cause no matter what value it did represent its gonna be useless when the token traded on exchange has no trading volume, or enough liquidity for it to be exchange to other coins.",

Under exchanges/markets tab, check what exchange is showing the most volume and the highest price. Sometimes, these tokens have little volume and price could be pumped easily with just $100.",

It doesn't show up on the coinmarket and coingecko... does that mean its necessarily bunk or I'm just too early? I have checked it on dextool and there was also awareness if this token only controlled by the team. That wallets that owned by the team that has not been marked to be able to sell the token in the market. You can even check this by yourself. You are interesting with the price in your wallet but this token was a scam token. This is junk token that must be throwed to the trash can. https://www.dextools.io/app/bsc/pair-explorer/0x79ac5b76bef7cee9505f1d743a6399826cef3ae3",

Usually scam tokens won't be listed that fast even to the DEX before spreading some of their supply for free to thousands of random addresses.",

You don't liquidate or swap scam coins because the code can be malicious and drain your wallet. You just move the tokens worth something to a new wallet and start over.",
