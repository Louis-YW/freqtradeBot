I couldn't take part in it cos I wasn't good at trading.,But now I'm curious if anyone here participated. Has the tournament concluded, and if so, how was your experience?",

He created same thread about this KCGI before https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5464563.msg62747399#msg62747399 and you can notice on his post that he keeps mentioning Bitget.Either he is an avid fan or shiller of Bitget here in the forum. This kind of tournament is not suitable for small trader because they always consider trading volume as main factor to win the tournament.",
