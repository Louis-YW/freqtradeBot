He should have a well designed plan to avoid regrets. It wouldn't be a bad idea to sell property to invest in Bitcoin if the individual has more than one. Real estate is a good investment, so it will be better to diversify investment than to depend only on one asset.

On the other hand, regulatory bodies don't want a decentralized system like that to take place, because they want to make sure to be in charge of the system, controlling and watching it in real time. Therefore, it's unlikely regulators adopt Bitcoin. For them, it's more interesting to just copy Bitcoin's technology, creating their own cryptocurrencies on the sequence.Regards real estate, I would really enjoy if it was possible to buy and sell properties through BTC currency. Actually, I've already tried, but real estate agents and houses' owners weren't interested on the proposal. They demand to make the deal in fiat currency.Bitcoin is too volatile and risky for most people, so you can conclude a large transaction involving real estate is definitely out of their radar.",

A person sold his home to buy ETH at $3. He is a multi millionaire today. Some people have taken calculated risk and came out as a winner at the end. But the experience may not be same for everyone. So I would say it's a move where a lot of factors need to be considered. I am not sure what do you mean by the crypto currency for real estate.

They are really that fully aware about those moving price or simply with volatility. There are ones who do able to just move on despite of those price increase and there are ones who do make out such regret at the moment that they've seen the coins have spent up have been able to increase its value on much more bigger.
