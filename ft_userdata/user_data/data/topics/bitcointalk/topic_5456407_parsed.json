  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussian rebellion, or the end of the empire  \"God forbid to see a Russian rebellion - senseless and merciless\"                                                                                                                 A.S. Pushkin                                                                  There was an unexpected, but expected, recognition of the famous apologist of Russian nationalism Konstantin Zatulin in the failure of a special operation to return the Ukrainian people to the bosom of the empire. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER5QeTVOCFE). As Zatulin said, none of the goals set, that is, denazification, demilitarization and protection of the Russian population of Ukraine, allegedly from destruction, was not completed, as planned in two or three days. The courageous Ukrainian people stood as an insurmountable wall before the horde of Russian invaders and murderers. Moreover, today, after a year and a half of war, it is quite clear that Russia has run out of resources to conduct offensive operations. Given this circumstance, the Kremlin spread the word about its readiness to enter into peace negotiations, in the hope that the West will persuade Zelensky to negotiate, which, if successful, will, firstly, secure the occupied territory of Ukraine to Russia, and secondly, Russia will get time to replenish losses in order to carry out with renewed vigor Putin's original plan for the liquidation of Ukraine as a state. However, Zelensky has a good reason not to agree on anything with Putin, because it costs nothing for a liar to violate any agreement, if you remember how Putin did not give a damn about Russia's obligations to be the guarantor of Ukraine's security and independence, prescribed in the Budapest Memorandum. Putin's intentions to make peace with Ukraine is a ploy more directed towards the West, which naturally did not work, and now the liar is in a very dangerous position for him personally, because defeat in the war he started is tantamount not only to the loss of power, but also of life. Although Putin, as the main person responsible for a number of war crimes, has been put on the wanted list by the International Court of Justice, which makes it dangerous for him to leave Russia, he should be even more wary of the wrath of his people, whom he treats as an expendable material for satisfying both his personal goals and revanchist aspirations to restore the empire within the former USSR, and possibly the times of tsarism, because it is not for nothing that the Finns, being a former colonial people of the Russian Empire, decided to protect themselves and join NATO.        It should be noted a very important circumstance, namely, the tacit consent of the Russian people to all the tricks of their president. Well, the invasion of the Russian army into Ukraine, followed by the annexation of Crimea, generally enthralled the Russian people, which, due to failures at the front, was replaced by confusion and the flight of young people abroad so as not to fall under mobilization. In Russia, they are still silent, but they know the criminal acts of their president, Putin has a series of crimes committed against the citizens of Russia, starting with a series of explosions of houses along with residents in Moscow and Volgodonsk, deliberately blaming the Chechens for the deaths of hundreds of people in order to start a victorious war with freedom Chechnya, and in the halo of the savior of the empire, become the master of the Kremlin, later changing the Constitution so much that it became the guarantor of his lifelong power. Putin is also responsible for a large number of economic crimes, thanks to which he gathered around him a group of people loyal to him, bound by crime, who, by the concept of a St. Petersburg kid brought up on the street, are a reliable support. Putin eliminated all potential rivals, not disdaining, like a true KGB officer, using the cloak and dagger method. bandit regime. (3.4)       In order to protect himself and the gangster regime created in the country, Putin established an additional military structure, namely the Russian Guard, a kind of army of guardsmen, whose only purpose is punitive actions against their people. Following the psychology of a bandit, Putin, in violation of the constitution, creates an army of mercenaries, the so-called private military company \"Wagner\", under the command of the same St. Petersburg bandit like himself, the former burglar thief Prigozhin, who served 9 years in prison. By the way, the FBI suspects Prigozhin of meddling in the US elections. There is no doubt that these two St. Petersburg gangsters are tied together and Prigozhin has enough criminal material on the president. It is this circumstance that explains Putin’s inaction on Prigozhin’s inadmissibly bold words addressed to him, in which Prigozhin accuses, as he said to his grandfather, Putin of incompetence as commander-in-chief, while calling the president of all Rus' a complete asshole (5).  The case with Prigozhin shows that among the gangsters created by Putin's organized criminal group, a dangerous ferment has begun, which may result in a conspiracy against the godfather. With a high probability, one can foresee a squabble for power in the closest circle, the so-called friends of Putin, which will cause additional indignation of the people deceived and robbed by the authorities.           During Putin's stay in the Kremlin, lies have become the hallmark of Russia, and if earlier Russia was called the Empire of Evil, then Putin supplemented the definition of Russia as the Empire of Lies (6), bringing to life, so to speak, the words of Victor Hugo: “Lie is the embodiment of Evil \". Lies and murders accompany Putin's entire stay in the Kremlin. Putin lies everywhere and always. It's hard to find when Putin would tell the truth. The fascist of the Russian spill took advantage of the experience of the Hitlerite propagandist Goebbels, who said \"Give me the media, and I will make a herd of pigs out of any people.\" False propagandists, mostly of Jewish nationality, which is especially strange for them as the last of the fascist Goebbels, flooded the Russian media. (7) It should be noted that they quite successfully managed to pit the two most ethnically close Slavic peoples of the former USSR against each other. Is it really not clear to these merchants with conscience that their dirty work of serving Russian fascism will certainly respond with anti-Semitism, when chaos will overwhelm the decaying empire after the defeat in the Russian-Ukrainian war, and the fooled people will see in the Jews, and in the Armenians, of whom there are also quite a few in the zomboyaschik (TV), the main culprits of the defeat and will answer, as always, with pogroms.      The Russian people, accustomed to lies, took Putin’s lies and his revanchist plans for granted, and in accordance with the imperial great-power worldview, thanks to which Putin came to power, but the defeat in the war and the threat to the existence of the empire, for the sake of which the Russian people could endure any hardships, is unlikely to forgive Putin.      The mass of the Russian population in Ukraine, who, according to Putin, were allegedly threatened with genocide, will face a choice - either forget about their Great Russianness and take an exam on knowledge of the Ukrainian language, or leave Ukraine and implement their Great Russian chauvinism ( in the Russian poverty.       The revanchist Putin's attempt to keep the Russian Empire from its incipient disintegration after the collapse of communist ideology is futile. All known empires have collapsed, the time has come for the end of the Russian Empire, and this historical process of the development of civilization cannot be stopped. It should be noted that social cataclysms in Russia are associated with Russia's defeats in wars. So, after the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, the revolution of 1905 took place, and the defeat in the First World War ended with the fall of the tsarist regime. The collapse of the USSR happened after a shameful defeat in Afghanistan. This historical fact was not taken into account by the St. Petersburg bandit, who imagined himself a great historian, who accidentally found himself in power.      Russia is like a drowning in a quagmire, when every gesture only accelerates death. The military invasion of Russia into Ukraine must be expected to end in its defeat, and the isolation of the empire will complete the disintegration of the last empire that began after the collapse of communism. This time, it must be assumed that the West will not be so supportive as to lend a helping hand and keep the Evil Empire from final collapse. Outside the empire, the Russian people with its great-power relic worldview will be lost, chaos and revolt, senseless and merciless, will bring down the “colossus with feet of clay” (Didero about Russia) and dozens of peoples of the patchwork empire will gain freedom.        For Putin, this is like a nightmare that will inevitably come true. The St. Petersburg bandit, of course, understands what awaits him, but he is powerless to stop the historical process, sending people into the muzzle of war in the hope of delaying the end of not only his power, but also his life. There is no bunker where Putin can hide from popular wrath, he will face the fate of dictators Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. I do not think that Putin will be lucky to be on the bench in The Hague, rather, the Russian people driven to despair will crucify the dictator at the gates of the Kremlin.        The empire will shrink to its original borders and its first president after Putin will be the first president of Muscovy. Varangians, as it was in the past, and will finally, discarding imperial ambitions, rational work in order to achieve the well-being of a normal European state. That is an example of the Finns, who have neither oil nor gas, they have nothing at all, except for the harsh nature and desire, and most importantly the ability to work in peace. Otherwise, the adjective \"Russians\" will have nothing to apply to.  1. Why Nemtsov was killed. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/23570.html2.
