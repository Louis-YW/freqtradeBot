That's a powerful tool.But the reality is, such lotteries usually have way worse odds than any casinos or gambling sites. So, mathematically speaking, you're better off gambling your money there.Thoughts?",

The odds are pretty low especially if there's a lot of numbers to play with, this is pretty cheap as well and that's why many can afford to bet and its pretty convenient. In my country, the government owned lotter serve another purpose by giving help to the poorest of the poor especially on giving medical and financial assistance. This is not a waste of time to others, but personally I see this as a waste of money even if its cheap because of multiple bets in just a month.",

It's actually funny how many regular lottery players would have a strong disdain for gambling, somehow thinking the lottery does not fall into that category.That's just how the perception is formed: if everyone is doing it and it's state-endorsed then it's all good. But any other form of gambling is for crooks and degenerates Quote from: goaldigger on January 01, 2023, 12:16:05 PMIn my country, the government owned lotter serve another purpose by giving help to the poorest of the poor especially on giving medical and financial assistance.

Fair enough, but they could still just finance any good causes from taxes, but there's a reason they prefer the lottery.",

So, mathematically speaking, you're better off gambling your money there.If we were to compare it based on something like that, then the lottery would be for someone who has no time, at all, to learn and spend the time playing in a casino. It's also better in terms of money spent in each session since you wouldn't exactly spend a single ticket worth of money for one session in casinos. Even if you consider multiple tickets worth it, it still isn't enough afaik. And that's the allure of the lottery, compared to regular gambling with slots, dice, etc. I honestly wouldn't even use \"possible profit\" as a metric, I reckon regular people who play the lottery don't even play gambling in the first place (other than the lottery that is) after all.",

Even if you consider multiple tickets worth it, it still isn't enough afaik.Good point, convenience and sometimes zero time needed to play the lottery is definitely some factor, i.e. in the UK you could just set up regular ticket purchases and you'd get notified if you win - so after the initial setup, you literally don't have to do anything. But that's definitely not a major factor here, I think it's got more to do with the mental perception of lottery Vs. other gambling.For example, placing a small, combination bet on a large number of completely random sports events could give you the same potential winnings but at much better odds, and yet most people just prefer the lottery, probably because it doesn't have the stigma that other gambling has.",

It is true that lottery gambling is indeed the majority of the most interested in small bettors because with a large multiple of the profit if the numbers at stake are correct with the numbers that come out.In lottery betting, you don't need a large betting capital, that's why small gamblers are very interested and can afford to bet at any time, even though the chances of winning are very small.But there are also those who can win the lottery with a very large total number of wins. However, such luck may be a once-in-a-lifetime percentage and not everyone gets that kind of luck.",
