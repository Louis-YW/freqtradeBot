Forget about it. Its one of few tokens that are traded now way below 2018 bear market bottom. Yea previous cycle. BNB is now at 60x from 2018 bottom.What BNB did that justify 60x:1- bought CMC2- build most popular futures platform (5x more volume than second place - bybit)3- remains the biggest CEX (more volume than all others from top 10 all together)4- buld the biggest traffic smart contract platform (BSC) - 2 times more transaction per day than on ETH...9 - binance card10 - invested 200M in Forbes.Everything in only 4 years. What eos did in the same time? 1-No one use it2-everyone forgets about it3-is now doing a Antelope upgrade that also no one will care about just after update.",

      "body": "the team experienced the worse of season, we have seen the manifestation thru its price how hard it plunges from its ath and it never breaks it during the bullrun of 2021. Larimer leaved like he did to his previous project and worse was that block.one turns out to be managed by assholes.why i believe it will succeed this time is because of the coalition of the communities to develop the new protocol. as for utility of the token, there are projects on EOS and remains in EOS despite what had happened. this will make EOS, Wax and Telos to perform well in smartcontract competition.",

They must be out of their God damn minds, once you ruined the trust of your fans in crypto space you are done for, as big as Shiba inu community is right now if the team fumbled the price will tank and majority will leave.",
