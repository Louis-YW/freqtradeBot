Just be extra careful with the links you click and double check the addresses before you input any personal information. Little things like bookmarking the legitimate sites helps a lot.",

What are you talking about? did you mean the highest security in blockchain need to record everyone KYC? it's a joke since someone can fake their KYC and KYC will become useless. Not to mention the hacker can hack the blockchain to get every KYC of people who submitted before and the hacker will use their KYC to make them in trouble. So does KYC will become a solution for to track the hacker? obviously not.",

Developers should always ensure they are up to date with their security network, and they must partner with reputable security firms for protection and they should have their security team too. Just the way good men are busy trying to secure the society, so also evil men are out to beat the security.",
