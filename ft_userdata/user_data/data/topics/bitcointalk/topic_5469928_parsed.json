  "content": "Legendary members spread completely fake information - merit system do not work. For example - this thread in Off-topic section -  FENBENDAZOLE and CANCER â€“ at least 12 anti-cancer mechanisms of action..First of all, this legendary member with more than 1350 merits can try to get the medicine degree, before spreading complete fake information in the forum about cancer. For example, fenbendazole from the thread & Â webpage is anthelmintic drug used for animals - sheep, cattle, horses, fish, dogs, cats, rabbits, etc., not for humans. Cancer is very serious disease, and everyone need to seek doctor advice as fast as possible. And if there is some medicine, which can help, there are clinical trials and official recognition, not just webpage or legendary member, which advertise something fake.All this is evidence that merit system do not work and is useless.Anthelmintic - drug against various internal parasites & worms - see here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthelmintic",

You are entitled to your own opinion, and you can also run your own research and discover what errors I have made or what lies I am trying to spread. My rank does not make me a perfect person.Â Because you discover that the said member posted something that appears to be completely false does not make the merit system incorrect, and beside, before the merit system was introduced, I guess the member was already in legendary rank, and the 1000 merits that equal the user's legendary rank were airdropped. Another thing is that because you discovered an error in my post today, which you used to judge me, it does not mean I have not been making posts that were helpful and contributing in the past and are worth meriting.Â Don't blame the merit system or someone else for what the person did wrong; always direct the attack directly at the person who deserves it. You can just ignore the user, as suggested above, if you receive anything from the account as a force or rumors.",

BADecker's information is not inaccurate because the same drug Fenbendazole has shown anti-cancer properties on humans. You should do your research perfectly before making such posts. The drug is basically a anthelmintic drug but it has shown some anti-cancer properties as well. You should visit the link below and then you will find that BADecker's information isn't false and some research has been done on that thing by other doctors as well. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fenbendazole-cancer-tom-rogers-mdQuoteFenbendazole has been around since 1974 and is used worldwide. In addition to killing parasites, it has been found to be effective as an anti-cancer agent. Note: I have seen it used in patients with great results, with virtually no side effects. Remember, thereâ€™s no medicine in the world that doesnâ€™t have a possible side effect.",

Just try to get medicine degree in the university, and then you will understand.First of all, I recommend you to learn proper quoting in this forum before saying such things and when it comes to medicine degree then I must tell you that I'm a pharmacist by profession and I'm currently working in health sector. The research on that drug's anti-cancer activity is going on for sometime and it will take sometime before it'll be officially recognized as a anti-cancer drug. I think you really don't understand medicine deeply and that's why you're saying such things. When it comes to research then I can surely say that there has been some research on this drug's anti-cancer properties and you'll have to read those researches yourself. Once you read those researches then you'll understand that the doctors or someone else who's saying something about the anti-cancer properties of this drug aren't spreading fake information.I will include some links of the researches that has been done on this drug and when you read those researches then you'll understand that the drug has shown some anti-cancer properties in those researches. I hope that after reading those articles you'll understand that research is already being done on that drug and there are some chances that in future we may see it in the list of anti-cancer drugs when enough researches show its anti-cancer properties. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30158-6https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/82/12_Supplement/2313/701049/Abstract-2313-Fenbendazole-induces-cell-cyclehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468294222000910https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9437363/",

OP, I second this.Â  I had to check when BADecker registered on the forum, and it was way before the merit system came into existence.Â  For the time he's been an active member here, he actually hasn't earned many merits at all.Â  Assuming he was already Legendary in January 2018, he would've been airdropped 1000 merits as did every Legendary member when Theymos created the system.Â  In other words, his posts aren't very popular and the merit system wouldn't have been able to suppress his nonsense anyway.Quote from: SamReomo on October 10, 2023, 09:51:14 PMFirst of all, I recommend you to learn proper quoting in this forum before saying such things and when it comes to medicine degree then I must tell you that I'm a pharmacist by profession and I'm currently working in health sector.

It's first time I'm hearing that o_e_l_e_o is a doctor and I'm happy to know that we have some people from health department on this forum. I have never said anything about my profession before because I thought that it would be totally off-topic for Bitcointalk members, but today the OP left me no choice and that's why I had to share details about my profession. I'm proud to say that I'm a pharmacist and I'm proud to say that I'm a member of this amazing forum. I have been serving as a hospital pharmacist for more than two years now and I think we can have great discussions about drugs or our profession which could be helpful for both of us. We can also have conversations related to our field in the form of private messages and it'll be a pleasure for me to learn something from a senior pharmacist like you. I'll be eagerly waiting for o_e_l_e_o's reply so we may get some better information about Fenbendazole's anti-cancer activity.",
