No legitimate exchange do this as it doesn't prove anything.Quote from: https://archive.is/ESjUs#selection-303.0-303.754If total balance of Your account is less than 15 BTC or the same value in other currencies You have the right to pass verification procedure by making a verification Deposit using the capabilities of our decentralized system. To verify Your account, You can make a Deposit (Transfer Funds from your External Account into CIRCLEEX Account). The exact amount of Deposit is 0.04 BTC in one payment. The System will automatically identify this Deposit as verification. The entire main balance including the last Deposit will be available for Transfer Funds from your CIRCLEEX Account into an External Account and Internal Addresses instantly. It will also open access to all Service functions (with the exception of Trading) and remove all restrictions. 2. They lied about their background. Whois says they're less than a year old, yet they claim to have 5 years of experience. Along with this, the volume and number of users doesn't add up as they are pretty obscure - try doing a few searches about them + as stated earlier they've only been here six months ago.

      "body": "A ton of fake exchanges have been popping up in the past few months. Some are trying to present ludicrous arbitrage opportunities in an attempt to lure users into depositing their funds there, while others are promoting so-called sign-up bonuses, promising an airdrop of a significant amount of cryptocurrency. The latter ones are usually found through Telegram and Discord groups. Avoid anything that looks sketchy and stick to the most well-known ones. There's no point in experimenting, there's an abundance of legit exchanges out there, such as Binance, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken etc.",

Sometimes they are hiding their motive of promoting their own platform by asking the community.But in any case, I would also suggest to avoid at all cost as the likelihood of not getting out your funds is high.Most of the time, they will offer tempting rewards, but people should remind themselves that scammers can always deceive their users.Better trust the known trading platforms with good liquidity and assurance that you can withdraw your funds without any issue.",

Moreover there are already many reputable and old exchanges present in the market. Why don’t you check out those and trade there? It’s very much safe to trade at those exchanges.

They are forced to do that because they are unfamiliar anyway so they are only trying their best to gain the attention of the public. I think it only takes a common sense sometimes to avoid the dangers. If we know that something is too promising or too good to be true then that is questionable and shouldn't be trusted easily.It's always better to go for the small and realistic offers but as long as its legit because we won't likely lose our money on them and then we can still gain more as long as we know how to play the crypto game (trading and investing).",
