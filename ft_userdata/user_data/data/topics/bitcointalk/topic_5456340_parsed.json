I was actually thinking of maybe a combination of both sites so basically:- Rates- Open source or not - Monero support- Supported networks/chains and coins (with the ability to filter) - LN support- link to Trustpilot reviews + the ability to review the exchange on the site as welletc.Your thoughts? Or do you still think it's a bit pointless?You could try to suggest a feature you wanna see as well. Who knows, they may consider it.",

I recently bookmarked https://www.athena-alpha.com/exchanges/ as a good source that has many non-KYC exchange services.

For some reason, many instant exchanges operate out of Russia. Probably because it's the second biggest market after the US.",

So, it's not right to say that there is no alternatives, offcourse, question how good they are. I also would suggest to use Bestchange, but if OP need alternative, probably there is reason behind it.",

      "body": "From your post history, it sounds like you're trying to build a website similar to BestChange, hence why you're looking for similar websites for your market research. If this is indeed your purpose, I suggest you make a new thread where you ask people what kind of feature they'd like to see from an aggregator website. I do believe it is more efficient compared to doing your own research, it also reduces the bias from your POV  to some extent IMO.Your review campaign is also nice, but there is no harm to share your current product so that others can review it freely. Some people do provide feedback even if you don't pay them.",
