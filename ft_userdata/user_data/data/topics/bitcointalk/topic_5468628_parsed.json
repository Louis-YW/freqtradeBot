What is the needful thing you think Imo, Kogi and Bayelsa people wan do now wey people all over the federal no do for the general elections wey mk INEC and court still mk the people's effort to seek for a better governance fruitless?2. You fit tell me of any time the electorates were so much educated about the importance of elections and why they should get involved compared to how the level of voters education was in the 2023 general elections, were private individuals provided their own resources to mk sure we get tins right on the election day but still nothing changed. So what's the power in there?3. If collecting of voters card nah go stop rigging for Nigeria nah for this 2023 election nah e for happen bcos this year nah people collect PVC pass in all other elections in the history of Nigeria but yet politicians with the hep of INEC and the court make people look foolish. So how u wan tk stop rigging now for sometin  u no fit stop for general elections?",
