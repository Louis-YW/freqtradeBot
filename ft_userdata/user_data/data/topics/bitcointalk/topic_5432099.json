  "content": "Just stumbled on this article, the guy who wrote this article is probably high on Bitcoin because he just came from Africa Bitcoin Conference  in Ghana.QuoteI just came back from the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Ghana — an inspirational event bringing together pan-Africa and international leaders to talk about Bitcoin’s purpose over its price (thank you Farida Nabourema!). First we need to define what is speculation first:speculation - the activity of guessing possible answers to a question without having enough information to be certain[1]Article Title: AFTER 2022, PURE BITCOIN SPECULATION IS NOW DEADAuthor: RAY YOUSSEFAs the article stated:This year was a turning point for Bitcoin and its community is now ready to cut the dead weight of price speculation.[2]And to support his claim, he presented these 5 factors that will support his ideals (quoting the explanation so that reader don't have the need to click out of the forum) THE GLOBAL SOUTH WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD BITCOIN ADOPTIONQuoteI just came back from the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Ghana — an inspirational event bringing together pan-Africa and international leaders to talk about Bitcoin’s purpose over its price (thank you Farida Nabourema!). As a legacy for the event, our team at the Built With Bitcoin Foundation opened the Bitcoin Technology Center (BTC), a learning and training center in Kumasi, Ghana — which is set to educate 400 people in its first year.This trip reenergized my hope for the future. Even in a bear market, trade volume in Africa continues to press forward. Looking at our volume on Paxful, we predict further increases in both Ghana and Nigeria for 2023. Why? We’re still seeing growth in Africa because of the necessity for Bitcoin on the continent — it offers a cheaper and more efficient solution for people to send money back home, make payments and preserve their wealth. And that does not go away because of market conditions. I expect Africa to continue to lead the way heading into the next year.THE DIVIDE BETWEEN BITCOIN AND THE REST WILL GROWQuoteBitcoin is backed by human work and has proven its utility beyond the West’s obsession with speculation. It has the ability to bank the unbanked and finally shift the tides of economic apartheid — Bitcoin’s impact cannot be overstated. The bulk of “cryptos” are for wild speculation and investing, relying on the morals of these shady authorities.As we’ve seen with FTX, people’s life savings can be demolished when there is only a single point of failure. This narrative is the same game the banks have been running for centuries. I’m not buying it. Next year, we will see more Bitcoin-only companies and conferences as the Bitcoin community works to clean up the mess of misinformation caused by these bad actors.GOVERNMENTS NEED A RETHINKQuoteSmart regulation fosters safety, but poor- or overregulation stifles innovation and growth. We need to strike a balance and that comes with education. My hope for next year is that more Bitcoin companies come together to share why Bitcoin cannot and should not be regulated as you would, for example, stocks or wheat futures.It’s our responsibility to also advocate for transparency — like requiring companies to share their proof of reserves. Without this, we’re going to see more far-reaching regulation like the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which pegs more consumer surveillance as the savior and touts Western Union as an example to lead the industry. We know how that narrative will play out...‘NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS’ WILL GET LOUDERQuoteThe trust of the people was tested this year and I don’t blame them for shying away. Life savings were destroyed because of despicable morals and we need to earn back that trust. This is why I advocate for decentralization and for users to self custody their savings.Using a non-custodial wallet means that users are their own banks, managing their own money and controlling the future of their own finances. In 2023, we’ll see more of a narrative and product push around self custody. I am already doing my part to amplify this message, including sharing a step-by-step process on how to self custody your bitcoin.BEAR MARKETS WILL BUILD A STRONGER INDUSTRYQuoteI am a natural builder and I have gone back to my roots this year. I’ve come to realize that we are not building products for how people live their daily lives in the Global South. There is too much focus on the unrealistic dream of minting millionaires and not enough around the pain points that keeps billions of people enclosed in economic apartheid. Next year, you will see more products that cater to the true needs of everyday people and offer them solutions for remittance, payments, e-commerce, wealth preservation and basic communication.While reading the article, I am convinced that Pure Bitcoin Speculation is Dead by 2023.  With all the development and achievement of Bitcoin, it has set its ground to be one of the ever growing industry in the market.  It is not a speculation anymore that Bitcoin will be globally adopted.  We can have references as why Bitcoin will be adopted by countries in fact there is already a proof for it.With the collapse of central exchanges and popular altcoin demise such as FTT, LUNA and many other altcoin hack, Bitcoin will continue to get the bigger part of the pie.  It also become stronger when ETH moved to POS.With the current bear market, the longer the bear market stay the better the industry is filtered out.  So surviving this bear market will make Bitcoin even stronger.  So yeah, people do not need to speculate about Bitcoin growth anymore because Bitcoin had already established a good foundation we just need to wait for the good result.There is a chance that many of us does not share the same point of view as the writer, so what do you think?  Is pure Bitcoin speculation will be dead after 2022?[1] https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/speculation[2] https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/in-2022-bitcoin-price-speculation-died",

Although I know Bitcoin journey is very bright and there's many good news around it, but don't forget those good news has been started since 2017 where Bitcoin price reach $20K and this year El Salvador accept Bitcoin as legal tender. But does Bitcoin become a legal tender in El Salvador make Bitcoin price increase and reduce the volatility? nope. So it's still really long to wait Bitcoin isn't a speculation asset anymore.",

They were still using bitcoin despite the ban and refused to support a CBDC, so the government lifted the ban and decided not to launch a shitcoin.

The presence of Pure on the speculation gives another depth to the terms which somehow makes me think that pure speculation means everything happen without a reason and just pure guesses which the author wanted to refute by providing evidences why the next thing will happen.  I agree even the author expresses a speculation but it isn't pure speculation because there is reasons and facts that those thing might possibly happen.Taken into facts that speculation will never ceased to exist in the market.  It is the core reason why the market is fluctuating and alive.  Without traders and investors speculation, the market will be boring as hell.",

Speculative activity is one of the most prominent activity in the crypto market. Millions of traders live by this activity. If speculation goes dead, the market will also go dead. So I don't see any chance. Rather the bitcoin market thrives on speculation. But there are some positive points as well. The speculation can only go dead if the price of bitcoin stabilizes. If that happens, more and more merchants around the world might see value in accepting bitcoin for their business. Especially those who need rolling cash for their business and can't hold of their bitcoins. Many companies will want to buy bitcoin as a cash equivalent.

The author basically uses some random bullish points to argue that Bitcoin's value is no longer speculative without any clear connection.Here's some hard truth for the author - Bitcoin will always be speculative. Just like gold. That's the reason why investors like Warren Buffet don't like both gold and Bitcoin - they don't see any mathematical formula for approximating their value. So the value is just a pure guess, aka speculation.You can't calculate how much a bitcoin is worth because Bitcoin is not based on anything, not tied to anything. You can't take a number of users or a number of transactions and derive the value of utility Bitcoin provides. You can't put a price tag on a store of value that can't be confiscated by third party.
