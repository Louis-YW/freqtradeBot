I don't really understand why you need to trade with very low risk if investment is quite similar with that, you only need to hold your Bitcoin until the price reach very high in the next few years.",

That's much more than my bank gives as APY. For me it sounds good. And you choose a pair in Binance without fees right now even as taker. Clever. Buy low and sell high. Or higher. That's the rule you follow and it's a good one. I would say: just continue and have fun trading.",

I see you started trading by landing on cryptocurrency. There are some trading strategies that you may not know properly. That's why in just 6-7 days you earned 0.51$ from 26$.

You can earn more if you will just buy and hold for a week rather than continuously doing small trade since your gain is just small as the fee you are using per trade. For that small capital of yours, I suggest to you to trade in long term basis or add some small leverage if you want to earn good profit that equivalent to your waiting time. The time and effort that you put on that trade is not worthy for a 0.51$ profit for a week mate. I’d rather focus on my job and have an overtime pay compared to that small return that requires too much of my time.",

I know the amount of profit mentioned in the OP is very less, but to be honest it’s really great and fun to see that without any great knowledge or experience OP has shown some guts and thought of trading with real money. Moreover he has also maintained the minimum risk throughout the trades as he didn’t want to face a slight loss also. So far the game is great, but i guess it won’t be sufficient. OP I would suggest before using more money, just track the market and learn the terms. Then after you feel confident, buy coins and trade with perfection.",
