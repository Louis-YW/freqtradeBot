When institutions sold their Bitcoins, the price of bitcoin crashed, and we should have expected a significant decline in price. Now that we are aware of the market cycle, we must wait until it has accumulated before making a purchase. It's challenging to determine whether the accumulation starting or whether the decline is still continuing. Knowing how the market cycle operates will prevent you from being a liquidity in the market.",

You can use 99bitcoins with the chart from visualcapitalist to check that in the past, around big corrections, what were fuds around those bad times for Bitcoin.No real reason at all, just fuds.",

      "body": "There is just countless number of reasons that can affect and have affected bitcoin price. There is rarely ever only one reason leading to a drop/crash but there is always certain major reasons contributing to a drop. It is also not only drops, the rises are also the same.For example one of the reasons that is well known to affect the price is being far away from the intrinsic value. 2 top examples is $20k price in 2017 and $3k price in 2019. Both prices were far from the intrinsic value, $20k above it and $3k below it. Which is why the market reacts \"violently\" with a crash in 2018 and a huge jump in second half of 2019.I personally believe that we are currently in a similar situation to 2019 where price is below intrinsic value.Another major reason affecting bitcoin price is the global economy. Some people naively interpret this as \"bitcoin following other markets\", for example they mistakenly think that if the stock market crashes, bitcoin should crash too. Which is proven to be wrong.But when the global economy is bad, like this days where majority of the countries specially in the West are struggling with inflation+recession (in the East there is only inflation without recession) that affects all the markets including bitcoin which is pretty much what we saw in both 2020 and 2022, one being the result of pandemic and the other the result of Russia-NATO conflict.",

Bitcoin is like every other businesses that experience its challenges and mind you nobody says bitcoin can never crash or end some days but the project of bitcoin survive as long as people investment keeps coming and multiplying. Bitcoin has reason for dropping in volume, let's look out it this scenario's you plant an orange tree with others as shareholders and the oranges begins to produce fruits in large qualities, people start coming in to buy and suck the juicy part of it, some people begins to invest with you so that can calculate returns for them the more the oranges keeps produces fruits. Now is the stands of the oranges keep produce the people support on it the more commercial values but if for any reason people begins to withdraw their investment, maybe the major shareholders begins to pulled out of the business, will the life sperm of the oranges remains the same? Probably NO.So bitcoin dropping is because most substantial countries like US, China, Nigeria and others are swings against the pumping of bitcoin or the trading to exist legally in their countries. Bitcoin is experiencing low investment power to pump, shareholders have withdrew from it and still kick against it. But the price dropping will never affects the figures values, bitcoin only needs people who have good resources to come in. The higher the volume of bitcoin investment the higher the rising or pumping price, and the lower the investment the lower the pump. And that's most affects everybody especially people with little trading or investment capital.",

When market demand increases and supply is limited, the price of Bitcoin will naturally increase because many people want it and vice versa. In addition, the skewed issues addressed to Bitcoin also greatly affect the price, investors will be worried about this issue so that many of them decide to sell their assets which makes market demand fall and prices also fall.If you ask when it will happen, no one can answer with certainty.",

      "body": "We can observe that the halving of bitcoin every four years has an effect if we check on the price of bitcoin in previous years. In most cases, it still comes down to supply and demand. The price is anticipated to rise whenever there is a halving of the bitcoin, which also indicates that its supply is becoming more scarce. Bitcoin surges during the halving years, triggering FOMO, making it bullish even in the subsequent year. However, investors and traders will leave with their gains because they may already be overpriced and the bulls are exhausted, resulting in a price drop over the coming years.",

I think last bull run bitcoin has increase in price from 18k to 64k in just span of few months and a major set back is necessary for a healthy market. Plus there are a lots of sellers or profit takers thats why the price plummeted too. No one can knew the exact reason but if youll see the possible scenario, a lot of fud and panic, especially during declaration on war and heavy recessions.",

However, for the decline as you saw last year, it is clear that there are reasons such as conditions and the economic situation that is not doing well globally and makes investors afraid to save more assets in any form of crypto.So as usual when there are more and more people selling Bitcoins in the market out of panic and fear due to the erratic conditions of the past year, obviously the drop in price is something that everyone can see so some people are starting to wonder why it happened after the year where Bitcoin made the highest ATH in its history. So it all happened for a reason and it didn't happen by itself without any reason, and moreover last year there was a bad case that happened to a large stock exchange and it also caused excessive panic among investors.",

In 2017 we had the collapse of ponzi projects leading to a market crash, and in 2022, besides economic factors, black swan events like Luna or FTX are the cause. And I believe that if it weren't Luna or FTX, there would have been other crashes that caused bitcoin to plunge. There will always be a reason for bitcoin to drop in price and cause the market to panic, everything is repeating itself.",

To make a contribution to your question I will say, bitcoin can be crashed for a full year and you can see it from last. Bitcoin was on the bear market from April 2022 to January 2023. So it can take a year and plus to be on the bear market. While the reason of the bear market has been stated by mk4 that it is because of the selling more than the buying is the cause of the crash. And the reason is caused by whales. The more they buy, the more the price will rise and the more they sell, the more BTC will come down. That is why the market is not stable.",
