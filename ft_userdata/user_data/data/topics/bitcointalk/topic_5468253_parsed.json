Bitcoin is widely used in the gambling online industry and this industry is the biggest supporter of Bitcoin in the sense that many people gamble with such currency.Of course if you get addicted to anything in life it will be bad for you as a person as addiction or doing things more than you should is bad,even when you eat to much bread you do harm to your health.Trading is the same as gambling unless for trading you mean hodling Bitcoin to a point where only at the next bull run you exchange it for cash and not all of what you have at your disposal.",

And off course people must use bitcoin to gamble with it and there is no way this two things won't work together, in as much as people do trade bitcoin there's every tendency that one could also lose his money while trading especially if that person is not an experts on trading.  Both trading and gambling posses the same risk so partially they should be treated as the same and same limitations that is sets on gambling should be also applicable with trading.",

Bitcoin is safer because it's not a gambling platform, that's a valid point but you can still lose money with Bitcoin as well, hackers can steal your coins from you if you are not very careful with what you do online. Be responsible with everything, nothing is safe because everything carries a risk at least, not even our lives are safe, we sleep everyday and wake up the following morning, but not everyone walked up the next day, some died in their sleep. All you need is understanding what you are getting into, understand the risks of gambling vs the risk of investing in Bitcoin, and be responsible enough to keep your financial life safe from possible never ending debts.",

I guess you have to understand that if everyone holds Bitcoin, it's not good for the future, since it's the demand that will help the market grow. I'd like to tell you that the gambling industry is one of the major demand drivers in crypto.Investing is not suitable for everyone, and neither is gambling, but as individuals, we have our personal preferences. I think the suggestion should be for us to be able to determine the risk and learn how to manage it.",

I don’t understand the call to stop gambling or alcohol ingestion while investing money is completely irrelevant to gambling since it’s not an investment nor income generating activity. Many get the wrong misconceptions about gambling as source of income that’s why they are often being compared to investment. It’s like why buy phone instead of putting your money on food while both phone and food has different functions that both needed in different way. Gambling is a leisure activity or source of entertainment. It’s really not a game for shallow pockets since it burns money most of the time due to its nature but it's for player that seeking for fun by risking money that they can afford to lose. Gambling is not investing and you can do both with proper asset management.",

Losing money in gambling is not the only reason gamblers go for alcohol or drug. Other things affects these people, and most of them were alcoholics before going into gambling. So, exaggerating that gambling and trading is the reason for their high intake of alcohol is also wrong. Holding, for low income earners is also bad, because they may not be able to hold for long term. Additionally, games have no comparison to bitcoin, as they're both different things. Bitcoin is used to play games and it's not the only payment method required to play games online. Online gambling sites that accepts cryptocurrency is increasing, and bitcoin heads the cryptocurrency market. Because it lures bitcoin holders to gamble with their coin, doesn't mix bitcoin to the reason of their lifestyle after losing bitcoin in gaming. Your advise of taking less alcohol is very nice, because too much intake of alcohol leads to bad gambling decision. And, when that happens, players lose control of the amount of money wagered in a casino.",

How do you know when someone will be more severely damaged than that? Not all do that even some addicted gamblers don't get involved in drugs or alcohol they are just addicted to more money drains and very rarely get involved with these.Then you compare gambling to trading, as if trading is easier to make money but in reality it's harder and more risky than investing which you can only hold.Could you say trading is easy because you made $80 in two days? I'm not sure about that story.",

Sure, it's better to invest the money in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but there are those who like the added entertainment given by gambling in either sports or casino games. I think it will depend on each individual on how they are disciplined to maintain the losses to a minimum or better, to win every bet they make. Sports betting today gives odds that could be for our side if we analyze the game correctly. But, I do agree with what you said, if we can avoid gambling then it's better, that way we can maximize our investments in other assets because we are not spending on bad habits.",

Bitcoin investment is not as risky as that of gambling because gamblers are addictive to put money without worrying of winning or losing whereas bitcoin investors once loss money will never put money again in it. Other possibility is also that it depends on the behavior of person that will he continue trading as trading or covert trading onto gambling because a person addiction and behaviors matters a lot.",

I do not know why you think investing into a risky activity like Bitcoin trading is somehow better than gambling nor am I sure where \"Those who do not have personal income will not be involved in gambling\" fits into the scheme of investing to learn about something, but hey, to each his own. Gambling is almost just as risky as trading, especially for trading newbies who tend to trade on emotional decisions instead on good and professional strategies. And they most definitely will do that. And they will lose their money, just the same as if they lost it in gambling.",
