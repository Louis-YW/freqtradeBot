  "content": "Hi all, First started crypto in February earlier this year so like most of us at the moment I am currently down but lately have been thinking what to do when the market does eventually start going up again. I understand this will be a while away but just wondering how & when to take profit and what everyone has done in the past or plans to do in the future? I am thinking of taking out my initial investment when I double my money and just leaving the profit to see what returns I can get long term. Is that a common way or is it best to just take small amounts at a time? I have read a lot lately of many people saying they did not take enough profit when the highs came in November last year and I don’t want to be one of them people and having regrets when the next bull run comes. I have been accumulating a lot over the last 4 weeks to bring my average price down on all the cryptos I own so that when the bull run does come it will not take a lot for me to double my investments and bank some profit. Would be interesting to hear everyone’s thoughts.",

You cant know the future so yes you can take small profits or you can take after double, all its fine.Imagine if Warren Buffet sell his position after double his gains in his early years, maybe he dont have today a lot of his well know posetion.Its this the correct mindset? Yes and No. Maybe he can sell and if the market go down buy the dip, but again, how you can know with accuracy the time?.Other thing its how much you need that money back.Also you can be a Holder or being a man with cash in his hand. You need to know yourself and know what tipe of investor you are. And most important, how much this affects in your lifes, because you can maybe be a good investor who trade and take smalls profit, but if you feel this makes you stay a lot of hours behind the screen and you feel so stresed because of that, i recomend to you to saty out of that mindset, and take the long way to double and after takes profit lets see whats happen without thinking so much in it.Well i dont know if my answer feels your requeriments or if give you more questions. But that its, its a difficult and deep question even if it seems simple.",

If that will be enough for your needs then go for it, because IMO, I only take profit when I needed it most and I think only dumb investors who sell at a lower price.  The important thing is you've satisfied the profit that you have, if your goal profit was achieved, then that's the time to take your profit out and reinvest when the market decline again. It sounds greedy to me if you're seeking more profit to come.However, that's not a big deal but it should be you must be contented with what you'd have.I would prefer to hold it for a long term and wait for a bull run or even when another ATH will come.",

If you set that you will hold for 3 years and you will sell your holdings whatever the price at that time is then do it (but not at a loss ).",

Because greed is on the way actually.There are lots of users including myself whom already gained more than 2x profit but due to greed didnt sell and when the time it go down will sell it. I dont know too but why did I sold at a time it should be. The perfect answer is people become greedy and this is one thing hard to control cause we wanted more and we cant dump due to this eagerness of us to earn more. I suggest when in profit dont hesitate or at least take out your capital money.",

There is no one answer for everyone, as mk4 says.What you raise is what Kiyosaki calls infinite returns: once you take out your initial investment the return you get is infinite because the initial investment is zero.But if I were you, I would actually ask myself if you need to take it out. Think, for example, of someone who bought Bitcoin at $10. When Bitcoin reached $20 he could have taken out his initial investment, but that's not the important thing. The important thing is how long he could hold out without selling, because the longer he held out, the richer he became.There were many people who bought very cheaply in the early years, and the vast majority sold when they made a little profit.The few who made real money, some of them becoming multimillionaires, were those who did not sell anything for a long time, and that means enduring market downturns as well. This is what you should consider.",

I mean, after you take out your initial investment and hold it, you either grow your profit or lose some of your profit, and at the end of the day, you still have profit.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on June 27, 2022, 10:10:44 PMI have read a lot lately of many people saying they did not take enough profit when the highs came in November last year and I don’t want to be one of them people and having regrets when the next bull run comes.

Because if you prolong the chance of making a profit it may suddenly disappear due to the rapid movement of prices so what profit you expect may disappear again and may not come back soon then wait again when will your expected profit return.And if you have already made money from your initial investment, you have made the right decision to take it from what you have earned so that you are safe and you have nothing to worry about in case you do not favor the next market trend and go bankrupt but at least you have experienced it, how to take profit.",

If you are bag holding altcoins there is a good chance that you will continue seeing losses indefinitely.

There's often regrets on the hindsight, either of taking it too early or taking it too late, of either not taking enough when price begins to dip or taking too much when price begins to rally up again. Greed and regret should be properly put in check when it comes to cryptos.QuoteI have been accumulating a lot over the last 4 weeks to bring my average price down on all the cryptos I own so that when the bull run does come it will not take a lot for me to double my investments and bank some profit.Yes, DCA is the way to go.
