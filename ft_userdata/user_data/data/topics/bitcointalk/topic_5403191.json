  "content": "The main reason I'm creating this thread is because @The Pharmacist asking this question on his thread Is there a place in the world you could live like a king via sig campaigns?  and also many new campaigns in this year come up like 1-2 campaign(s)/month. Quote from: The Pharmacist on June 14, 2022, 01:13:36 AMHas anyone seen any statistics on pay rates over time?  I'd be interested to know how much bitcoin (or the dollar amount) could be earned per pay period in each of them throughout the years.  I suspect it's gone down a lot.I spend few days to collect 3 threads on every year to have better statistic since each campaign do pay low and some are high, so we can see in every year how much the lowest you can earn and how much the highest you can earn. I did cherry pick for the latest campaign who still survived until now, because not all campaigns can survive so that long especially Chipmixer which already 5 years long. You may see the pay rate is different with the payment right now, the reason is I want to see how much the beginning plan of the project want to pay their participants at the current date where the signature campaign thread was posted and I also using the BTC price when the signature campaign was posted to make it fair, that's why you see the BTC price is difference though it's in the same year. I use CoinMarketCap to see the Bitcoin price from 2014 until now and some articles to know how much Bitcoin price on 2013.  The data are calculated and presented every month in both BTC and USD pay rates in every year.The first signature campaign was started since 2013 based on my researchOn 2013, the pay rate at that year around 0.05 BTC/month to 0.5 BTC/month.1.

(BTC price $40,000, $400=0.01 BTC)Based on above data, so here's the summarize:2013: 0.05-0.5 BTC/month and $39-$65/month2014: 0.1-0.14 BTC/month and $45-$121.8/month2015: 0.2-0.4 BTC/month and $24-$45/month2016: 0.12-0.2 BTC/month and $74-$156/month2017: 0.04-0.171 BTC/month and $177.84-$345/month2018: 0.04-0.072 BTC/month and $268-$554.4/month2019: 0.024-0.14 BTC/month and $54.6-$396/month2020: 0.015-0.056 BTC/month and $100-$360/month2021: 0.0022-0.0062 BTC/month and $80-$320/month2022: 0.008-0.01 BTC/month and $240-$400/monthThis is the graph of signature campaigns pay rate since 2013-2022 in BTC This is the graph of signature campaigns pay rate since 2013-2022 in USDThe insight of two graphs above is:The highest payment in BTC was in 2013, this is make sense considering how cheap Bitcoin is, so they're not losing to much money. However on 2014 there's no campaign want to pay higher pay rate, then since 2015 and so on, the Bitcoin pay rate continuously drop in both lowest and highest.The highest payment in USD was in 2018, where they want to pay $554,40/month while this is the worst dump ever in Bitcoin history, I don't know the reason, perhaps they think BTC will go lower and lower? but the campaign is still alive, so they're proving they don't have any problem with huge payment (I also don't know how much this campaign pay rate in this year). However the highest payment in USD are quite stable since 2017 until now, around $300/month. On 2019-2021 there's a huge gap between the lowest and highest pay rate, especially on 2017 where they're paying only for $54,6/month.The most interesting fact is: You will earn less BTC value, but you will earn higher USD valueMaybe in the next year there's a new campaign want to pay higher pay rate and beat the 2018 record in USD value? we will see",

In fact at one point when BTC when the recent bull market started, members who met the maximum post requirement were recieving close to or more than $500 a week.So what criteria are you using to select sig campaigns every year?Because I believe Chipmixer should be representing every year (yet it appears only once) since 2017, because;1. They have been consistent every week since they started2. They hve been he undisputed highest paying campaign for a very long time",

Also it will make a confusion and not good for readers to read a complex calculation. But you're not entirely correct Chipmixer will represented in every year because when they change their pay rate from 0.0375 BTC to $300, if Bitcasino still pay their participants with 0.018 BTC/week, they're the biggest paying campaign now.Quote from: The Pharmacist on June 19, 2022, 11:04:05 PMSomeone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the absolute first sig campaign was earlier than 2013.  I remember browsing very old posts, and I stumbled across the thread where the idea to rent out signature space for advertising was floated, and I could swear it was 2011 or thereabouts.  Either way, nine years' worth of data are more than enough to satisfy my curiosity.You're correct, sometime the forum engine kinda suck lol.2011:1.

      "body": "Great effort. Much appreciated.But I would place the thread in economy board with different headline (title).Let me get you the true picture based on the country I live (Bangladesh)-Per capita income is Bangladesh is ~$2000 which you can earn through ChipMixer campaign in less than 2 months. In our country, govt jobs are cherished by everyone. So, if I take a 1st class job holder salary, they get around ~$800/month at maximum and they are living a good life. That's not of course like a king lol. However, with ChipMixer campaign, one can live a far better life than a 1st class govt job holder as from ChipMixer, one can earn $1200/month.But I don't think a lot of people are thinking to live a good life from signature campaign earning. Most people here have IRL jobs, business and they are taking signature campaign as partial benefits only. Because signature campaign doesn’t ensure X years of guaranteed income. If theymos today says fuck signature, they will have zero income think lol To live like a king- I think it's not possible from signature income, not at least in my country.",

If members lose earning opportunities then most people will leave these places expect those who are really here for the BTC not earning.

At least we have a general idea of how signature campaign salaries would fare in different countries. However, if we really want to do this in real life, the truth is that, as in almost all countries in the world, cost of living also highly depends on particular regions or cities or provinces in the country. The disparity between cost of living within a country could be huge, such that you're like comparing countries also. In my country, for example, a $400-monthly wage is barely decent if you're in the capital city while it is more than sufficient if you're in the countryside.",

Is it a good bonus if you don't spend your coins? like .5BTC is better than average global month salary.",

      "body": "Very interesting topic to see how payments of signature campaigns had changed throughout years. I want to add one point. In past most campaigns had their payment rates not related to USD value of BTC. Let's say campaign were paying 0.05 BTC/week and it doesn't matter whether Bitcoin costs $500 or $1500. I think that most campaigns made their rates fixed in $ value in 2017 when Bitcoin reached $20 000 for the first time. IIRC, Chipmixer switched to $ fixed payments much later. Yobit also didn't lowered their rates until relaunch of campaign in 2019. I remember they were paying 0.0003 BTC, up to 20 posts per day. So, in theory it was possible to earn 0.006 BTC per day or 0.18 BTC per month. Offcourse, it's not realistic. With normal posting, let's say 5 posts per day in average, it was possible to make 0.0015 BTC per day or 0.045 BTC per month. With BTC value $20 000, it's over $900 what is enough for a living even in average European country. Considering inflation in these 4-5 years, these $900 were much more valuable than it's now and you were able to purchase more than now.But in general, without few exceptions, it's not possible to earn for a living through sgnature campaigns, unless you live in poor country.",

All this data is based on the pay for Legendary members?Imagine just being active for 1 year in 2013 in the highest paying campaign and you would have earned 6 BTC; which would nowadays be worth more than 120,000$!Quote from: LTU_btc on June 24, 2022, 04:35:24 PMVery interesting topic to see how payments of signature campaigns had changed throughout years.

Also it will make a confusion and not good for readers to read a complex calculation. But you're not entirely correct Chipmixer will represented in every year because when they change their pay rate from 0.0375 BTC to $300, if Bitcasino still pay their participants with 0.018 BTC/week, they're the biggest paying campaign now.There were campaigns that at some point were paying ridiculously high rates when compared to when they started. For instance, Yolodice. In January and February of 2021, the campaign was paying 800 USD a month if we count the average price in those months at 35k USD, but that was after they lowered the rates. Until the end of December 2020 they were paying 0.014 BTC a week @20k USD per coin, which was 280 a week (1120 USD a month!).According to the OP the pay rates at the time were between $100 and $360 a month. Here's a spreadsheet if someone wants to verify. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AaoYn8hm0KV7NQm_f4UNJylN4lxa65rdNpDquhxWz4w/edit#gid=1488910859",

Considering how famous (for a lack of a better word) they've become they're basically cementing themselves in the history of this place, which in return equals more customers. You can't get better reputation than having your signature campaign run for that long. Quote from: LTU_btc on June 24, 2022, 04:35:24 PM I want to add one point.

Alright, we all love receiving very high amounts when Bitcoin smashes up in price, but for the longevity of signature campaigns, fixing it to a USD value probably makes the most sense, that's until fiat collapses, but that's another topic for another day. I personally welcome the changes for the longevity. I think a lot of users will find it hard to admit, but signature campaigns have helped this forum over the years, a sort of sub economy has thrived. Although, that doesn't come without its own problems, which have also been pretty evident through the years, and still are very much a problem today.",
