At this point, It would not surprise me if in three days the rocket appeared to be painted with the Dogecoin logo, to make the launch even more news-worthy. I do not follow much the progress done by Spacex as company, so I would have guessed they had already launcher vessels into space before, but according to what I just read on internet, I would be wrong. Let us see how it goes.",

Anyway, there must be some kind of a problem and they really need to make sure to be 100% when they launch this starship because its mission is the most important of all when it comes to making Mars a livable planet. I'm just glad that I'm witnessing such events in my time and really appreciate these people's work of doing this despite their difficult situations when it comes to making possible the impossible.",

Everything must be in good condition before the take-off. This project cost a whole lot of money and the reputation of Elon Musk and his firm is at stake. It is better to delay the flight than to fail in this project. The reusability of the rocket is a unique feature that will help to reduce cost and promote mastery for the crew members. I just hope the launch will not be delayed and it will not be out of place to watch this great event.

Elon Musk's crypto career is dead because he has not always kept his promise concerning his involvement in cryptocurrencies. He will only attract newbies or gullible investors to his Dogecoin promotion if he ever does that.",

Which should have given me a sigh of relief but oddly enough, I got disappointed again that it still hasn't launched yet haha. I'm excited though, since I really am a fan of his work and dedication when it comes to this field. Can't say the same thing on other things he does though. I guess it's good that along with his genius he still has a sense of humor at least? xD",

I think I watched one a couple months ago where they've already placed astronauts in there, started counting, fueling the engines and shut it down because of not having enough fuel or too much fuel I don't remember. I love that he resurrected the mostly dead US space program. Rocket launches was what we used to all watch in the 80s and 90s and then it stopped, mostly due to the shuttle program being discontinued.",
