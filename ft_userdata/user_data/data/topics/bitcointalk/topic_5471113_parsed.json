No pointless or uninteresting threads.Off topic is a section for any other topics that do not fit into any other sub, however, it is not a subforum for account farmers to lazily spam their way through the ranks and doing so will no longer be tolerated. If you are caught spamming unsubstantial posts just to farm or rank up your account your account(s) will be immediately permabanned without warning.However, during time, I noticed many topics which have absolutely no connection to bitcoiners nor present any interest for them. So I decided to make a list with such topics (those interested are free to contribute), in part for the lulz, as they are hilarious, and in part thinking that maybe their authors may be banned for posting such content, which violates the description of the board and the rules quoted above.1.

Finding Uniq nickname for my girlfriend..6. Flat EarthAs of February 26, 2020, notbatman - the Supreme Leader of this gang - closed the gates of his Church, without any explanation, leaving the believers lost under the (flat?) Sun. The terrible news were brought by suchmoon: \"Unfortunately Bitcointalk's most famous flatearther locked his thread after merely ~800 pages without conclusively proving whether the Earth is flat or not\". After almost 5 years of hard, scientific debates, everything appears to be lost. Not entirely though, thanks to suchmoon, which although declined her competences on this delicate matter, she generously offered a shelter for these poor people who lost their leader, but hopefully, not their faith. Thus, with her help, maybe the remains of what was once a prosperous gang, will raise again!7. Let's talk about how hot Asian girls are. [NSFW]Quote from: nutildah on October 21, 2023, 08:22:56 AMIt is 187 pages of exactly what the title infers, with (NSFW) pics to back up the discussion.This topic probably must be of very high interest for bitcoiners. Sadly, it was locked.8. Pictures from Russia. NSFW!!!Quote from: LTU_btc on October 24, 2023, 08:06:56 PMTo add to hot Asian girls NSFW topic, there is topic called ''Pictures from Russia.
