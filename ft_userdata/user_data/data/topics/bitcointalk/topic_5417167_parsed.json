Many have claimed the title of being the first in this and that in terms of real estate. But as a matter of fact, there were too many of them already and I didn't even see one of them become a successful project that focused on real estate. Except for that real estate for sale and they've accepted bitcoin in payment. With the NFTs today even they're going to be backed with real estate asset, I don't think that many will be hyped with it.",

      "body": "that's actually BS. I meant look at this https://twitter.com/hdwycryptoThe twitter of HDWS full with crap tweets about pre sale. Big bonus and big lucky draw. A legit project never try to do this. This project looks so scammy for me. There's nothing to argue. I do believe this project was just another BS for sure. I think that anyone can see that easily even its tweeter has been showing how pathetic the scammer behind this project keeps promoting its sale without any demand.",

It blasted through it's first 2 pre-sale stages and is currently on stage 3. Open discussion!Link: https://www.thehideaways.io/There were dozens of projects like that. None of them delivered product because of legal problems. Its simply impossible in 2022 to do this in any jurisdiction. SEC is thinking for last 2 years what XRP is. Security or not. Whichgovernment/legislator would allow \"pre sale. Big bonus and big lucky draw.\" combined with real estate investments? \"Re: Hideaways (HDWY) Giant Scam or True Potential?\"None of them. It has 0 potential. No doubt about that. Giant scam was a LUNA ponzi. HDWY is a small scam made to steal 100$ from few newbies. Something close to pickpocketing.",

I wonder how many fake real estate they own to convince people thinking it's real, probably unreal estate. I invested a little on a UK real estate in the past but it's yet to be seen these days, they easily rug pull.",

Crypto can be used to bought real estate but you didn't even need such project to make it happen. You can buy it by yourself. I think that if you were smart enough and then you will be seeing the project like hideaways just like a scam project. That will never have any potential to growth. I just tell you about the truth.",

No information about team  and as a \"potential investor\", certain numbers leave me skeptical ... because they invest about 11% in marketing, 10% exchange listing, 8% in the team...In practice, 1/3 of the tokens sold are used to \"make the project work\"...in practice the tokens are already sold with a surcharge.In addition, 34% is offered in pre-sale. Anyone who buys later will be able to dump these coins in case they have a small profit.Correct me if I am wrong with this basic analysis ....",
