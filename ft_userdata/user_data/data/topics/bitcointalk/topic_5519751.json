  "content": "Bitcoin is now increasingly spreading throughout the world, even El Salvador has adopted bitcoin en masse over the last 3 years. Then large countries such as America, China and England are also reported to have very large bitcoin deposits. Especially for America, after Trump, who is very pro-bitcoin, was re-elected as president in America, this will definitely make America buy more bitcoin. With this, Bitcoin is currently heading towards mass adoption in the world. In fact, according to news circulating recently, Polish presidential candidate Slawomir Menzhen made a statement saying that if he wins as president in Poland, he will create a bitcoin reserve.https://www.cryptonewsz.com/poland-slamowir-mentzen-bitcoin-reserve/QuotePoland should create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.If I were President of Poland, our country would be a cryptocurrency haven, with very friendly regulations, low taxes and a supportive approach from banks and regulators.If, for example, Slawomir Menzhen is actually elected as president in Poland and he really realizes his plan, it will definitely have a very good impact on the price of bitcoin. Elections in Poland will be held next year or more precisely in May. So if, for example, Slawomir Menzhen really wins, I am sure that the price of bitcoin will most likely experience a fairly high price increase again. The point is that next year's bull market, the price of bitcoin could exceed all of our expectations.So what do you all think about this news?Will this have a very high impact on the price of bitcoin or not?",

If a big country adopt Bitcoin and other countries know about that, they will follow but after research about Bitcoin. More people will comes to Bitcoin and use Bitcoin for the investment, reserve funds or other things.Maybe that will not be a high impact on the Bitcoin price but still, that is a good news for other countries that Poland can be the next countries that will adopt Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently heading towards mass adoption in the world so we must be prepares too for the coming. If we can starts from now on by buying more Bitcoin, we will be ready when Bitcoin use for globally.",

What I don't know is whether the candidate in question has any chance of winning the next presidential elections that will be held next year.What is obvious is that some politicians will try to copy what the elected US president did, although the president in Poland certainly does not have nearly as much authority as the one in the US.",

It will be in the normie perception that Bitcoin, invented more than 10 years ago by an anonymous individual, HAS BECOME a new valuable asset class.

Slawomir Menzhen seems to have a better understanding of Bitcoin since he bought Bitcoin as far as in 2013. He said he has been hodling his coin since then and just sold a portion this year. As a Bitcoiner I would want him to win the elections because it will increase awareness and adoption. Poland might not be a European economic powerhouse but making Bitcoin a reserve currency might be the beginning of a shift in the crypto policies of other nations in that zone. If Trump fulfills his promise of making Bitcoin a reserve currency, it will signal the start of the Bitcoin scramble among nations.",

Most of these countries may have been interested in wanting to invest in Bitcoin as well because they invested and now imagine how much they would have made as profit.And this investment would have helped better shape the economy.

It would be better for other nations to look into options like this as well. It would have been preferable to using it in place of gold in foreign reserves if they had allowed their educational system to adopt it and make it legal tender.And their is a lot of countries that will actually will actually want to give somthing like this a trial and that will only happen when the price comes a little bit lower.",
