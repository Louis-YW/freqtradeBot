But i didn't write it down so the only possibilities are bruteforcing or make a wordlist with known passwords.",

It can't read blockchain.com wallets and obtaining an equivalent hash from the blokchain.com wallets is of no use since Hashcat can't understand the hash format either [for brute-force purposes].",

Then that's the only file that you need for brute-forcing you can use the BTCrecovery tool link below.- https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecoverIf your PC is low specs it may take months or years depending on how long your password is.But if you have a rig with GPU you can speed up the brute-forcing process check this link below.- https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/2020-10-06_Multi-GPU_with_vastai/Example_Multi-GPU_with_vastai/",

Use this up-to-date (and faster/more efficient) fork instead: https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/Here are the instructions to follow to use btcrecover to attempt to decrypt this wallet file: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/2020-05-08_Recovering_Blockchain_Wallet_Passwords/Example_Recovering_Blockchain_Wallet_Passwords/You can skip the step regarding downloading your wallet file since you already have the wallet.aes.json file. You'll need to create either a password list or a tokens list, depending on how much you know about the password. See more info here: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tokenlist_file/. I can help you construct this if you get stuck.How much can you remember about the password you used? Length? Letters, numbers, symbols? Any words or phrases? If you can't remember anything at all, then you are probably wasting your time even trying unless the password you used is very weak.",
