The support told me that unfortunately they cannot do much about it as it is the odd provider that fix limits for an event and for each user. Even on big events just like premier league games I cannot bet with a stake more than 0.2 mBtc (when it is possible).I had a similar situation with sportsbet.io (odds automatically lowered for my account, banned from some promotions) and they haven't gone backwards since  (more than 8 months).Has anyone been in this situation and was able to recover afterwards normal betting configuration?If my situation is never going to be reviewed, I might as well get my funds back right away.",

I have no idea what’s the exact reason for this limitation but odds provider have max bet limit on every specific games maybe it’s related on the number of odds being placed on that particular match because I only experienced this kind of betting limitations on games that is not popular. I try to place bets in different sportsbook with the same march and the limit is just the same. This issue is not from the casino but from the odds provider like the support already told you.",

Because CMIIW but rickmart's account has obviously been restricted without any email nor notice.Moreover, even if Stake is really sending \"official emails\" for that, like a professional or regulated sportsbook, don't you think it's a little bit late to care about it when you receive one?

The support told me that unfortunately they cannot do much about it as it is the odd provider that fix limits for an event and for each user. Even on big events just like premier league games I cannot bet with a stake more than 0.2 mBtc (when it is possible).I had a similar situation with sportsbet.io (odds automatically lowered for my account, banned from some promotions) and they haven't gone backwards since  (more than 8 months).Has anyone been in this situation and was able to recover afterwards normal betting configuration?If my situation is never going to be reviewed, I might as well get my funds back right away.I'm curious what exact betting behavior landed your account in this situation.  The only thing that I could think of off the top of my head is that you must have been using some sort of martingale betting style to where at some point they felt the need to put a cap on how far you can take that strategy.  Is it possible this or something like it is the reasoning behind your new limits?  If it were me, I'd take the hint and make sure my funds were protected, but reaching out to them and seeing what they're willing to do for you or what explanation they have seems like it would also be a good idea.",

      "body": "I'm referring to the sports book betting limit on the Stake gambling site, from the data I see it should not matter to the OP, what's more, the bet is only above 0.2 mBtc, it's not a suspicious nominal for Stake I think.As Stake com says below.QuoteLIMITSAt Stake, there are no maximum betting limits. Since you are betting with fully encrypted cryptocurrency, you can bet as much as you like. Of course, we are not saying you bet all of your Bitcoins on one event, but the option is there if you need it.If you feel safer with a betting limit, you can place your own limits so you don’t make any accidental huge bets.QuoteLIMITSAs with the Stake sportsbook section, there are no betting limits when it comes to the Stake casino. Having said that, certain tables cater to different budget levels. Low-risk players can play for between $1 and $500 per round, while high rollers can increase their stakes considerably, depending on their status tier.Obviously, not a barrier to betting limits, my assessment, most likely the OP's account has detected a suspicious violation, for that Stake limits and lowers bets for the OP, advice, try to contact your complaint in Chat directly about the problem faced by the OP, what is their response and feedback about this, Honestly, for me, in cases like this, there is a misunderstanding between the Stake team and its users, it could be that the Stake team is suspicious of something that endangers the bookie and the site.",
