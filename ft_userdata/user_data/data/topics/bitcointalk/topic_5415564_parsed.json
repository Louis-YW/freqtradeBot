      "body": "I feel many people make it past the risk of scam wallets at the point of download, where most of their problems start is how to keep their seed phrase and keys safe, because bitcoins are not stored in the wallets people download, but in the blockchain network, so even after avoiding scam wallet, there's still a lot to do.Write down your seed phrase and have many backups of it, if the bitcoin you want to store is small and you probably will be spending it frequently, you can keep it in a hot wallet, but if you'll be storing a large sum, then you probably should buy a hardware wallet, maybe ledger or trezor, or you can completely secure your funds by using an air-gapped device.You can also learn how to create an offline wallet on electrum here: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html after downloading from the official website: http://electrum.org/",

This is one mistake that people do while downloading wallets and using any legit services that ignoring the orginal link of the website as we have seen that there are many fake oninon links for CM also surrounding the net in order to scam you of your funds but it depends on how you take these things seriously.Like always check for the domain extension they have and for spellings like what the original one have which can be .com , .io or anything which you should always focus upon.The other best way to avoid goggle ads is turn off or use tor browser for your safety and privacy for the most as most scam wallet promotion are done on chrome ads.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on October 01, 2022, 06:09:50 AMIt's a good idea to search about a wallet in this forum, but take note that you shouldn't trust everything you read.

Carelessly means you arbitrarily click on links in DMs, especially DMs from strangers. After that, you will be directed to a scam page but at that point you don't mind about double checking it with search engine.Such as typing that domain name + \"scam\", then search engines can give you very good overview about that website.About fake apps in Google Play, that are abundant but fake apps don't have too high downloading times compare to real apps.

Ratings in this day are no longer valid. Maybe, even though there is a decentralized rating system, the rating can still be manipulated. Moreover, on 3rd party websites, this will be more often manipulated. But it would be better if we are seek information from various sources, forums, social media and so on. Sometimes, telegram chat provides a more reasonable rating, this can be obtained from various user who made a complaints that are generally carried out in groups. for me, it's better to avoid wallets that are mostly have positive ratings with high intensity, usually scam potential (exception for old wallets, which may be 80% scam free).",
