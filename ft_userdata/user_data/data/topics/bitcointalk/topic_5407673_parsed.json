So basically even if one would explode it will still be contained, there is no way for the amount of energy in a fusion reactor to keep building to generate a larger explosion, that energy build-up would again quench the reaction.Quote from: NeuroticFish on July 26, 2022, 01:40:59 PMNuclear fusion is the dream of scientists for quite some time now, and while it sounds great, ..

Improving solar, using hydroelectric dams (that are environmentally sustainable), making windmills that are more efficient, investing in wave power, looking at geothermal energy gathering improvements, even nuclear power is relatively clean - there are so many different options out there that we should be encouraging a variety of sources away instead of putting all our faith in one. We're still in the infancy of all this technology so it'll be great when it is powering every grid around the world in a much more sustainable way.",

Although I agree that they can be a good step forward for now, there are a few topics here that worth mentioning:1. Many people (and nations!) are afraid of nuclear power. From what I've read, that's one of the reasons Germany is closing them.2. Even small reactors do produce nuclear waste, which is problematic to be disposed (and I'm saying it overly nice).3. Nuclear fusion should give more power for longer time with virtually no waste at all, so it would be huge leap forward; it would make any fission based power plants \"instantly\" obsolete.
