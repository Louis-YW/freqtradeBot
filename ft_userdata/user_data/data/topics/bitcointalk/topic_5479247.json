The reasons why I agree with sharing your first Bitcoin experience is because, as a new Bitcoiner, you will need some advice. So, when you share your first Bitcoin experience, others who have been inside the Bitcoin world will give some good advice that might help you grow and accumulate more of your coins without getting scammed by scammers or losing your coins in some fucked exchanges wallets.",

If you have spent some Bitcoin to purchase physical goods or you have used it to purchase digital goods or maybe something else then you should never share that with anyone else.It not good to share your Bitcoin spending and it's better to have those as the most secret thing you do. I have spent Bitcoin on many good things but I won't share those with anyone. I have bought the things with Bitcoin that I found useful and that's something I would like to keep secret. I must say that I have never used Bitcoin to purchase anything illegal and I will never use it to purchase something illegal but still I don't think it's good to disclose your Bitcoin spending on a public forum like this. And, I suggest everyone to be careful when sharing your Bitcoin spending with others.",

Only problem with all of this is that I haven't had a lot of transactions lately so it's hard for me to still share.",

As trader or investor there is always a need for cushion and or a reserved fund maybe even spare cash to serve you for awhile even at this point of festive season we don't have to alter much of our holdings if we still have the reserved funds because i see no reason for selling our accumulated bitcoin so cheap at expense of festive season some people got them through DCA.",

I said that for the past year that I have been in bitcoin investment, I have achieved a lot to the extent that I have already bought a house, a luxurious car, and I got married. With the profit I got from my bitcoin investment, we know it can be possible, but it is just a friction story because it hasnâ€™t happened to me yet.

I have read some stories even here in BTT where a very close relative of someone is critically down in the hospital and then he returned to the forum to ask if it is right to sell his bitcoin to pay for hospital bills.You spend your bitcoin to build your dream house, you have nothing to regret in the future even if bitcoin gets to $100.
