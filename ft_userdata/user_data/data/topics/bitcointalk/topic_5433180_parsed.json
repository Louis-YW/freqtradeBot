  "content": "Hey fellows mortals,We are here and the blockchain is quite new technology they said: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evs2Hcn3nMY . It's ok to scam cause it's new they said, here is an inside of the series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-fugWMBwCgHere's a thread where you can spam your ideas on the battle between a scammer and a somewhat fair og crypto fellow.Myself I accept coffezilla, I don't accept any other crypto youtubers, he understands how scam works, he understands people, he understands to some extent the blockchain.On the other side we have Logan Paul, the hero of our generation (even tho, I am 3 years older than him lol), he is a fun, ongoing, native intelligent content creator who proved that he can overcome any challenge.Back to the story, he made a scam, he made a quick rich scam (Logan Paul), but the tricky part is....Was it a scam? Of course, when you start a project you think about getting rich fast, that's the goal of it. Make a company, make some useful product, sell it for google for 2 bil$ and live in the house with Alan and Jake, just kd.Logan at the same time was conned by the asian dude whatever big brain he had. But did Logan was actually scammed? And if he was, did he do anything to save the situation? This is the question of the thread.It may not look too much interesting for the people here, but it's the most interesting thing happened lately, even more interesting than FTX itself. This is an example that shows that crypto is not a scam, but the scam is about the people into it.",

He accused his dev of running his project while he was telling his followers that NFTs are just JPEGs. While the truth was that he didn't pay the dev.From the digging that Coffezilla did, I think Logan created 2 projects that turned out to be scams which is a meme coins and the NFT project. Successfully scammed his believers and true his followers are actually older than him.",

If you are creating it and promoting it without putting it all out there for people to look over / check the code / verify everything it's a scam.People like that are why the government is screaming for regulations. Idiots follow them, give them all their money and then go crying to the government when they loose it all.Kind of like the people watching the invest in gold infomercials who are loosing money every year vs other investments.-Dave",
