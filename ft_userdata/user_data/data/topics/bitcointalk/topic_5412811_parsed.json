That's how people define their own non-constant success goals, where they reach a higher point then they will find new thoughts that affect the goal. And changing the financial aspect for the better is the majority of their success goals. Uncontested.",

Being successful is being happy and satisfied with ones fully achieved dreams. Money cannot buy satisfaction and happiness. Satisfaction and happiness is the true definition of success and anyone without this can not be declare as being successful.Ok, let me jump into your conclusion. Yes, it's not always the money or fame that determines your success. It is indeed happiness and satisfaction. HOWEVER, happiness is somehow tied with money and humans are naturally born to be dissatisfied (consistent technological advancements and new inventions are the huge evidence of it).  Now, IMO success has a different levels and it doesn't stop at some point, It continues until your body are no longer able to pursue the next level of your success in life. Let's say you just graduated, got a college degree - that's called success right? Because you satisfied your desire to finish your study. Let's start there as level 1. Next level would be getting your dream job, and then getting your own business, then expanding it over and over again. I always believe people is never satisfied with what they currently have. You might be feeling satisfied at some point in your life, but the next morning you'll realize you still have desires to reach the next level of your success.",

Success is not only about finances, because for me like the piece of the story you shared above, the fact is also that money does not guarantee happiness and cannot buy happiness. Happiness grows from someone's emotional expression when what he hoped for a long time is achieved and gives positive feedback to the people around him. Success in the sense here will vary, career, family, and success like me are given the trust to have more offspring.",

Not really, there are a lot of people who spout a lot of garbage who are successful, it doesn't make them good or productive people who are benefiting society - in many cases they are helping to spread hate and division because it's easier than solving difficult problems. People should definitely focus their time and energy on the things that the like, because they're most likely to produce something valuable to others in that way.",

In life success different phases, and the end product of success in life is to be able to afford the necessary things life requires as a man.From the early stage of life we pursue education and if it is well achieved then we can call that success,  the next stage of life is to go after our different career that can be means for survival,  no matter the amount of money it brings  it is success as far as it keeps man going.",

Satisfaction and happiness is the true definition of success and anyone without this can not be declare as being successful.Success is not always about how much you have, how rich you are but actually what can be said to be successful is when you succeed in achieving what you target. Success is only the last point of every target, it can be many things because in my opinion what can make you satisfied with the results is real success.You can't be satisfied just because you have the intention to build a house, but you will feel satisfied when your intention is proven by building a house so that you can live in the house. Success is subjective, it's not all about big things but the small things that you manage to achieve can also be categorized as success.",

Satisfaction and happiness is the true definition of success and anyone without this can not be declare as being successful.I personally see money as a tool or a bridge to success by getting Satisfaction and happiness as you mean it. In this case I slightly agree with your statement that money and fame are not the only benchmarks for success. But believe me that someone will not be famous if he is still poor and someone will also find it difficult to get satisfaction and happiness if the money is still small. So there is another conclusion that you must underline here is \"money never guarantees someone to be successful, but people who success is definitely having money and also happiness in his life. And when these two things are already in one's life, then Satisfaction and Fame will easily come to him even though every human being is very difficult to be satisfied because it is influenced by his own lust.",

This will never change.Who are you to say what should and what shouldn't be measured as success?Happiness and satisfaction are something relative. Some people will never be satisfied and happy until the end of their lives.99% of the people link success/satisfaction/happiness with having enough money to live a comfortable life.Having more money means that you could get a high quality woman as a girlfriend/wife(I'm not talking about a gold digger/sugar daddy type of relationship).

For example, having a lot of money, you can pay for education of poor but talanted people, and some of them can achieve great success in one field or another. Will that make you happy?In short, if contributing to society in a positive way makes you happy, then money can buy satisfaction and happiness. Also, I disagree with this statement of yours, \"Being successful is being happy and satisfied with ones fully achieved dreams.\" Your dreams can be different in different periods of time. Your childhood dreams may seem stupid today, and achieving them can make your life worse. And the things you are dreaming of now may make you shudder ten years later. Since a few years ago, when I need an answer I ask Google, and mostly satisfied with the results. Look at this one, for instance:I have nothing more to add, they said it all.",

On the other hand, someone is happy and considers themselves successful if they made a good family, average living without any headache of financial stress and stuff like that. Its entirely personal thing these days. However, those who think what others will think about them and run for getting success just because of what others will say then that's entirely wrong protocol to live a life!

For example, I watched a video some time ago about a boy from my developing country who has Down's syndrome. He was really into history and his family had to argue for him to be allowed to pass general entrance examination to the university (our version of SAT). He was allowed to take the test, he scored high enough to get a scholarship to a pretty good university (in my country, scholarships are purely based on the grades you get), and during uni he also became a guide in a local museum. To me, this is a huge success because a person had serious obstacles, definite goals, and succeeded in overcoming obstacles and reaching the goals.For some spoiled healthy rich kid getting into uni and doing some internship at a museum wouldn't be anything, though, and wouldn't be much of an achievement. So it's not just about the actions, it's also about what it takes for a person to get there.I also agree with the op that success shouldn't just be about money or fame: IMO if one wants to build a healthy strong relationship with someone else and does that, it's also a great success.As for objective things, I think we should focus on things that are making the world better or at least aren't making it worse when we talk of people as successful.",
