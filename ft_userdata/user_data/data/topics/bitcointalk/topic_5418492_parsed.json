The address OP is referring to isn't a vanity address. Vanity addresses are derived with testing a large number of private keys. So, the owner knows the private key. No one knows the private key of the address mentioned in the OP and creating an address like that is very very easy. The only requirement is that the address must have the correct format of a bitcoin address and pass the checksum. It may worth mentioning that creating an address like the one mentioned in the OP with a known private key is almost impossible.",

This other end of 2017 external site includes a longer list, and indicates that 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 was identified as Blockstore’s burn address. When I looked at this matter recently, I focused more on 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr, which is XCP cryptocurrency’s proof of burn address, and I believe is the largest holder of its nature. The story behind this case is interesting, and well worth a read to understand why they burned those BTCs.In terms of how these addresses are created, I found the following two posts to be rather clarifying:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5123840.msg50282766#msg50282766https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5278431.msg55270386#msg55270386As depicted in the above posts, these type of addresses are created to fit the structure and rules of a public address without being originated from a private key. They is therefore nobody that can actually access the burnt BTCs.I do have the doubt though of how one can distinguish a vanity address from a burn address, whereby the former will be in control of somebody as (theoretically) opposed to the latter (perhaps the length of the legible part of the public address is part of the answer, but it seems like a simple non-exhaustive criteria).",

This being said, it would take gazillions of years to create a vanity adress depicted above, the odds of finding an address like that within a lifetime are so close to zero that you can safely say it IS zero.If you see an address like my vanity address: 1MocACiWLM8bYn8pCrYjy6uHq4U3CkxLaa you can easily see the \"vanity\" part is only 6 characters... If you have a GPU farm and a lot of time, you could probably go to 10 or 11 (i guess, not calculated tough), but more than that doesn't seem feasible.A second thing you can look for is a block explorer: if an address looking like a burn address was funded with hundreds of BTC over many years, and not a single unspent output was ever spent, odds are big it's a burn address...Last but not least: any address can be a burn address. If you generate an address without a private key, or you immediately destroy the private key after generation, it's a burn address... But it's kind of hard to prove a \"normal\" looking address is a burn address... Anybody could generate an address and just say it's a burn address.",

If a person could really \"crack the code and do what he wants\" (which is very, very unlikely), then they would have already spent at least some of the funds from the given address. Or better yet, why not crack some of the addresses that contain thousands of bitcoins, like Binance's cold wallet or some of the other Bitcoin Rich List addresses?No, what you are looking at is a \"burn address\" or \"black hole\" address. It's a valid address, but nobody has their private key to use in order to spend the funds from that address.",

I could just as easily install a new copy of core, copy the 1st address it gave me and then shut it down and delete my wallet.dat file. But it's impossible to prove that.Quote from: mocacinno on October 27, 2022, 10:04:05 AMIf you see an address like my vanity address: 1MocACiWLM8bYn8pCrYjy6uHq4U3CkxLaa you can easily see the \"vanity\" part is only 6 characters... If you have a GPU farm and a lot of time, you could probably go to 10 or 11 (i guess, not calculated tough), but more than that doesn't seem feasible.8 or 9 is about the limit, not counting the 1 at the beginning, that you can do with a sane sized GPU farm. The new 4xxx Nvidia stuff might do better, but it's so power hungry and overpriced at the moment that it's not a real option. Also, some addresses of even the same length are going to be more difficult and take longer to find then others.Others have posted links to some guides here are the discussions about the actual code / software:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5112311.0andhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25804.0If you want to pay someone to do it user WhyFly has a service: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5397602-Dave",
