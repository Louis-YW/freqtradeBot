  "content": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo (Known as Zaire between the early 70's up until the late 90's) is a central african state that is known for its political instability, corrupt government officials and inability to protect its territory. Its territory is worthy of being called the biblical garden of Eden though. With its lush forests, amazing wildlife, great agricultural potential and immense mineral resources, it has the potential to be a new age african eldorado and economic hub. Despite its great potential, its inhabitants are one of the poorest in the world. Congo also has one of the largest diaspora in the world and this is due to the instabilty that is found in the country. Poor leadership from the Congolese ruling class as well as policies from multinational backed States mean that mineral plundering done under the guise of miniature rebellions have become a part of the country's daily bread. Project NDALA is a project that aims to overthrow the current corrupt and visionless Congolese kakistocracy and to restore the dignity of the central africans inhabiting this territory. In the honour of Mamadou Ndala, a Congolese militant that fought against the injustices and mediocrity faced by the Congolese, we would like to get into power and build the Congo that Mamadou envisioned.If you know somebody that knows somebody that knows someone who can help us realize this project in any way, kindly inbox. If you are that somebody, kindly inbox as well . Its for a good cause. In the event that the project succeeds, tokens of appreciatoions will certainly and rightfully be arranged.",

They will be happy to offer free assistance unless they think you are mostly doing it for your own benefits. Well, wish we have people who don't know or care about the wonderful natural resources of the countries they seek to help but are very focused on making the people healthier, happier, better, independent, etc.",
