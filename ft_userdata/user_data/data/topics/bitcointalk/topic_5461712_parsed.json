  "content": "Hi all, Just gauging some interest here. I've been collecting these over the years and may be interested in letting some or all go. They do NOT come with the Full Address.  None of these coins have been peeled and all are inside an airtight capsule, and have been for years. I'd be interested in separating them if needed, or all to a single buyer. Would there be some interest in something like this?",

The private keys are fine as they are under the holo, the missing piece is the public address. These coins were unfunded and have 'Buyer Funded' lasered in from Smoothie when he initially sold these.",

Trust me, I wish I had the addresses, but I’ve seen singles sell on here from time to time for a decent price. Maybe I’ll break them up, as it doesn’t seem they come up too often.",

I assumed once public address was set up on the chain is was traceable via firstbits, but see now it's only ones with tx history.  Appreciate info / education, thanks  MoparMining, sorry ejd i was hoping for work around to be able to make offer if I could have funded.",

I understand that they have to have activity to be able to look up short bits, Mike should have loaded every coin with a very small fraction of btc so they could always be looked up by short bits and have enough to cover transactions cost when someone sends the amount designated to be funded in the coin to another address.  Example : Mike loaded each coin with 0.00002 btc so now that short address can be traced and if it is a coin that is supposed to be loaded with .0.01 btc when the owner of the coin peels it and sends the btc to another address the whole 0.01 btc show up in that address .   (Hope this is correct and makes sense)",
