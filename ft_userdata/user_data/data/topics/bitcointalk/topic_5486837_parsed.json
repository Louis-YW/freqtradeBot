  "content": "Hello,Lets say for example the $US dollar goes into hyperinflation or the $dollar loses world reserve currency status or just collapses people lost faith in it. We all know the US is the largest spender for its military & army in the world as well as its defence spending. They spend using '$Dollars'. Funding the military and wars are the most expensive things to finance on this planet. I don't even think 21 million bitcoins is enough to fund WW3. I looked at prices and 1 of the cruise missiles for a fighter jet is like $80,000 , not cheap lets say. So if anything happens to the $US dollar then how will the military industrial complex/army continue running?Lets say your a soldier getting paid $40000 a year salary and hyperinflation happens and your wage does not go up that much, would you still turn up to work the next day in your army uniform to earn toilet paper?So if the military industrial complex collapses due to currency issues then the host nation of that currency will be like sitting ducks to other nations looking to invade it without facing defence resistance. So from here can we say that the US Government will do whatever it takes to save its $US dollar currency and the $US dollar will continue doing fine for many decades to come and if that's the case then how Bitcoin can shine in times like this when it is facing the US Government & the Feds Manipulation?",

Make sure that there will be many things that the US will do to ensure that the value of the USD is maintained and does not decline too much, even when the global economy is hit by a recession. Never doubt Uncle Sam's abilities.But at the same time, Bitcoin will also survive and grow, even amidst pressure from the US government. Maybe many people will think that Bitcoin will be affected by this, well that's possible, but keep in mind that Bitcoin adopters are global and whenever there are people who want to sell Bitcoin, there are people who will buy it. And so on, people maintain Bitcoin's sustainability.",

They just raise the debt ceiling and print more money to balance out the value of dollar, even if the world loses faith on the dollar, there's no way that it's going to be a long time before they recover from that, also I'm pretty sure that most of their soldiers aren't just going to quit because their money isn't worth a lot, the new generation of soldiers have been brainwashed to become patriots that will do whatever's best for the country so they don't easily waiver when there's no money to be paid, they're definitely going to get paid in bonds or some other form of payment. Also, just because the dollar collapses doesn't mean that the military would just collapse in a day, they've probably found a way to do some sort of preservation that would make the military functional despite a collapsing economy.If you're talking about the companies that supply the newest technology for the military, that's going to be the time that they'll ramp up their production to the point that they're more efficient during an economic crisis because they know that they're going to be paid more when Uncle Sam is in debt to them.",

Yeah I'm talking about financing a Non-Nuclear World War 3 and the Rebuild of countries after the ww3 which will cost like a $quadrillion. If ww3 is nuclear then humanity will go extinct never mind financing. Ai can survive nuclear war like a cockroach because as long there is energy for Ai such as electricity and if Ai has developed self-awareness or consciousness to survive then yeah it can survive in a world with no humans as long there is energy powering Ai. A Ai that does not rely on human input to survive and has developed self awareness consciousness and don't need humans for energy harvesting as well as no need to enslave humans to maintain their Ai Grid/Network is a threat to humanity because Ai don't need humans as they see humans taking their resources/energy or a threat to Ai consciousness.

When you make weapons, you create a lot of jobs, and that's very good for the economy, actually.If the USD spirals out of control for some reason, I think the US wouldn't move to Bitcoin. Instead, they'd implement some strict policies like tying fiat to gold or perhaps issuing coupons for different things while working on a new currency.

Funding the military and wars are the most expensive things to finance on this planet. I don't even think 21 million bitcoins is enough to fund WW3. I looked at prices and 1 of the cruise missiles for a fighter jet is like $80,000 , not cheap lets say. So if anything happens to the $US dollar then how will the military industrial complex/army continue running?Lets say your a soldier getting paid $40000 a year salary and hyperinflation happens and your wage does not go up that much, would you still turn up to work the next day in your army uniform to earn toilet paper?So if the military industrial complex collapses due to currency issues then the host nation of that currency will be like sitting ducks to other nations looking to invade it without facing defence resistance.

In case this would happen, I don't see a big problem for the USA and their military, because most of the leading armament producers are actually USA companies. The hyperinflation would just run through the whole system, the cost for everything would go up and so would also the wages go up. As long as all the big companies are from the same countries you will still be able to buy things for your money. The only problem would be to acquire foreign currencies or even crypto currencies if your own FIAT money is in hyperinflation. Who would be willing to sell his BTC to the USA if their money is worthless the next day? So, bitcoin is not going to be the money to fight WW3 in. Another thing is that once there is a major war where it goes for the survival of your own country, money is not an important concept anymore. Loving your country and protecting your family will be the main motivation for man to join the army again.",

Currently, the United States is the leading country, their influence on any economic or monetary policy will affect the world, but that does not mean that Bitcoin cannot shine. You should remember that Bitcoin is like gold, it is more of a reserve asset than a representation of the strength of a certain country's currency, because currently the USD is printed from air, not backed by 1 type of asset, so there is no connection between USD and Bitcoin here.In addition, the world has increasingly turned around, and America's power has been somewhat weakened by the restraint of Russia, China and India. If the US does not accept Bitcoin, the rest of the world will still accept it, and then the US will be kicked out of the global game, they will not want that to happen. Instead, they will try to find ways to control the supply of Bitcoin, because as we know, the amount of Bitcoin is less than 21 million VND. In the furure, I guess that the race of strength between countries will be to see who holds more Bitcoin reserves.",
