The Quantum Computin still not a risk for cryptos because the amount of quibits is low, but in the future the only option will be to integrate the anti-quantum encription created by the nist, there are 3 algorithms made with this propose, you can google them.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography",

However, I am unsure whether internet connection speed would impose a limitation on such attacks. ~Yeah, like connection speed will be a limitation!  Why would you even need an internet connection for brute-forcing private keys?  Its not like quantum computers are downloading them off the web.   The real issue with quantum computing and crypto isnt about internet speed; its that quantum computers could potentially break the math that secures it.  But thats not related just to crypto currencies - almost all cryptography encryptions will be in jeopardy, including your bank account.",

Additionally, how can I contribute, follow existing projects working on this issue, or learn more about this topic?It has been discussed multiple times here in this forum. But just know one thing, quantum computing is a distant dream. An actual quantum computer will cost billions of dollars to make and operate. So none from our generation will be able to see an actual working prototype of a quantum computer, let alone breaking open Bitcoin. Even NVIDIA CEO mentioned that it will take another 15-30 years to make an actually useful quantum computer. So chill!",

Additionally, how can I contribute, follow existing projects working on this issue, or learn more about this topic?Quantum computing doesn't scale. It just generates noise.Shor's algorithm, which is supposed to break ECDSA, fails miserably with any presence of noise, even in theory. Hence the largest integer reliably factored up to now by a quantum computer using Shor's is 21. All those new and \"very superior\" QC managed only to generate more noise.",

I don't think bitcoin developers will just sit and relax while seeing that the network is about to collapse owed to quantum algo. So yes, they would surely find a way how to attack this kind of threat. I guess even now, they are already working on this kind of potential issue.",
