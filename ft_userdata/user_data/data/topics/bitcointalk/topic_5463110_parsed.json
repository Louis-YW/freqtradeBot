The so-called de-dollarization is greatly overestimated, and wild allegations of moving away from the USD usually aren't serious. There's a neat Wikipedia table that summarizes the IMF data on foreign reserves. As of 2022, the USD accounts for more than 58%, with the next currency (EUR) having 20%, and the next being shy of 6% (Japanese yen). So the USD dominance is clearly still very string, and it's not even falling if you zoom out, as it was lower in 1990, 1985, and around the same in 1980, for example.What I'm trying to say is that the USD doesn't need anything to get stronger and prevent de-dollarization, and there's data that supports that claim. As for stablecoins, I don't think they increase the trust in the USD, to be honest, but I don't think they do much harm to it internationally either.",

Paypal has an estimated 429 million users worldwide and PayPal USD (PYUSD) will be available for them to adopt. But this doesn't mean that it will make the dollar stronger because other factors contribute to the value of a currency. With this news, Alipay might come up with its stablecoin backed by the Chinese Yen. The McHenry bill will be the first comprehensive law on crypto regulations, we are expecting to see the effect of its provisions. But there is not much difference between Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins. The only difference is that CBDCs are issued by the government while stablecoins are handled by private firms. They are all fiat clothed in crypto.",

I think the central bank digital currency will do the opposite adoption for people who value dollar than stablecoins that always have dishonesty in financial audit.Perhaps this will strengthen the PayPal company transaction, nothing new under this new polarized stablecoin. Only PayPal will earn from the loans they will lend out, interest rate from borrowers and fee from transaction because people will be willing to use PYUSD since people can get the chance to redeem it for physical USD, more transactions, more fees and more revenue for the company, and when people don't feel safe with USDT and USDC, they will rush to PYUSD especially during depegging of the value we normally have in FUD times.",

De-dollarization is happening but it isn't showing a much impact on dollar since no other fiat currency in the world has the same value as dollar. Also we should know that other country fiat currency is depreciating due to   inflation. No government can stop inflation since it is part of the economy.",

So that the stigma remains the same as the unstoppable US Dollar threat. De Dollarization aims to break the dominance of the US Dollar, PayPal adopted a stablecoin backed by the US dollar. so I did not find a point of difference in solving global economic problems. I think current stablecoin still haven't prevented de-dollarization. Or is the solution really not a stablecoin? The Threat of De Dollarization continues to challenge the resilience of the US Dollar.",

And since most stablecoins are backed by the USD, then it's a better strength for the USD because they are actually acting like it.I've always said that those who are trying to change the world balance would fail, we should enjoy the somewhat freedom and stability we have now because those countries trying to enforce de-dollarization will become more evil than good over time, they have the tendency to rule maximally.However, my resolve remains that they will only try but will always fail as the USD is the only currency with reference to the past history that can hold that status. Not even the Chinese Yuan that is often been manipulated through pegging and is less popular in the FX market.",

Such companies can be easily shut down not to mention that they are practically releasing dollar just in digital form.You are also forgetting that the countries are decreasing their dependence on dollar (aka dedollarisation) because they want to reduce the effects that dollar (in any form it has) on their economy and country as a whole. For example they don't want to have their funds frozen in off-shore accounts or services like SWIFT just because they didn't fully obey what US had ordered them to do. So whether it is SWIFT or iFinex (releasing tether) or Circle or PayPal or whatever is not going to change that.",

USD is still the world's reserve currency, so it is very normal for stable coins to remain pegged to USD. But if de-dollarization happens faster and the USD loses its position and value, then stablecoins will soon be pegged to another currency as well. Like CZ came up with this idea when the stable coin BUSD was attacked by the government. He also shared his view that he will find ways to reduce dependence on the USD and create stablecoins pegged to currencies such as the Yuan or the JPY...Currency wars are much bigger and it is outside the influence of the cryptocurrency market, so the stablecoins market will not affect the currency wars of countries.",

But what other ways has he found now? If he talked about using Yuan and Yen, he is only deceiving himself. Those backed stable coins are backed by their respective fiat, like USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD all backed by United States dollar, while coins like Euro Tether backup by Euro which is the second strongest currency in the world. No on can use the fiat of another country to back the stable coin that is not backed by the fiat. Instead, using assets like gold may be better but which would be of small percentage to fiat.",

The dollar was threatened many times and they also thought that GBP would be the next currency we will be considering as the king of all, but it never happened even when sterling ruled the world already back in the time.

It's so small and basically does not affect the \"de-dollarization\" if the term is real, and not wishful thinking. As long as goods and services are happily using USD for international trade, I don't think de-dollarization will happen. There must be some incentive to use the non-USD currency for International Trade to make it work.

If the McHenry bill is passed in the US, will it strengthen the dollar as the world's reserve currency?Are you referring to this billQuote from: https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1639323This bill establishes a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins (digital assets which an issuer must redeem for a fixed monetary value).Only permitted issuers are allowed to issue a payment stablecoin for use by U.S. persons. Permitted issuers must be a subsidiary of an insured depository institution, a federal-qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer, or a state-qualified payment stablecoin issuer. In general, permitted issuers must be regulated by the appropriate federal regulator, however, state-qualified issuers must be regulated by an appropriate state regulator.Permitted issuers must maintain reserves backing the stablecoin on a one-to-one basis using assets as outlined by the bill, such as U.S. coins and currency or other assets regulators determine appropriate. Permitted issuers must also publicly disclose their redemption policy, establish redemption procedures, and publish on their website every month the details of the issuer's reserves.The bill sets forth requirements for (1) the rehypothecation, or reusing, of such reserves; (2) providing custodial or safekeeping services for stablecoins or private keys; and (3) supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over non-state qualified issuers.In addition, the bill places a two-year moratorium on new endogenously collateralized stablecoins (i.e., stablecoins that rely on the value of another digital asset created or maintained by the same originator to maintain the fixed price).Under the bill, permitted payment stablecoins are not considered securities under securities law. Because if yes, then i am amazed to hear that companies could actually use stable coin because the bill is still in progress. I am just amazed because i thought if a company like USDT wants to live in USA then they must have 1 to 1 real USD to back them up but this bill in progress tell another story. Well, i am just asking here.My views on this bill are, if it got approved then definitely it will bring good impact to US dollar because as the first member's comment says, pegged stable coin do need one to one US dollar back there to back there stable coin so in the process the demand for US Dollar will increase.",
