Click Update blockchain to update to the latest data block8: After the above steps are completed, select the Get a block option, and the constant mining 576 block in while starts runningNote: It is single-threaded now, and multi-threaded will be launched in the future when the difficulty and personnel increase. If the synchronization is not normal, you need to delete the package resources in the disk C:\\resources\\blockchain, and then run it again. After running, don’t worry about it and let it run It’s ok, don’t operate frequently, the webpage commands will eventually operate on the computer’s running port, some commands will terminate the current mining, and execute other commands you operate to see if there are blocks and synchronizations on the browser, the first operation One is enough, the block is not synchronized, click to update the latest block, do not start the mining command when updating the block.A single computer is not good and it is useless to try to open more, because its corresponding port is connected to the server background.POW believers BOSSZD salute",

This is a big-tittied and smooth-assed project with remarkable assets to compliment its bold outlook. I will get in touch with u later to confer on the key milestones. We are taking u in. Being part of community initiative to help it grow legs with a prompt pace is a vital aspect of our developing at the frontier of decentralization here, in this vast crypto land.  My grandfather has always said, I need more but not everything because otherwise I would yield under the pressure.
