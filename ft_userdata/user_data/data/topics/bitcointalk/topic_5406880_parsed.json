BTC Maybe there should be a special day, like celebration, festival. Where exactly will be noted \"Sound Money\" day. Just a thought. When the bull market comes, I think these artworks will be sold out quickly.",

The concept of \"sound money\" is something that is often overlooked in today's world of fiat currency, but it is an incredibly important aspect of a free and fair economy. By purchasing this artwork, you are not only supporting the artist, but also making a statement about the importance of financial freedom and the role that bitcoin can play in achieving it. Plus, with only 12 available and a time-stamped certificate of authenticity on the blockchain, this piece is sure to be a valuable addition to any collection.",

I often ask myself how this artwork makes me feel and where is the right place to hang it up. This is one of the favorite artworks, many people have pointed it out as their favorite. This artwork serves as a reminder for me, reminding us why we are here and fighting in this peaceful revolution.

The loadable card will be glued to the artwork, and guess what? You don't need to load it, you can keep it unloaded too ‚Äì that's totally okay! üòÑ But here's the twist, it's a bit different from what other collectible creators are doing in this space. Think of it like an Opendime, but way cooler.Firstly, there's no trust involved. You don't have to trust me with the private keys or worry about how I deleted them, and all that jazz. The collector can 'scan' the card and check out the content. If they want to recover the private key, they'll have to remove the card reader to grab those ownership rights. It's all thanks to the 'dual interface' and the cool ownership functionality on the NFC interface.Here's a quick example:It's a Satodime card loaded with some coins.The ownership right is NOT RELEASED.Whoever scans the card can only see the public info (the vaults, the deposit address), but they CAN'T unseal a slot. The only way to grab those coins is to plug the card into a chip card reader. üöÄTake care, my friend, and don't forget to enjoy life! Can't wait to catch up with you. Your message will brighten my busy day as well!",
