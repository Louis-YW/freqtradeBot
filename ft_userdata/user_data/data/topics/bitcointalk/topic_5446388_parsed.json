  "content": "Background:In 1568, The Dutch revolted against the oppressive ruling of the Spanish Kingdom, which led to a bloody 80 years of war. Due to the Spanish/Portuguese alliance, the Dutch got banned from the Lisbon market, where they bought most of their spices to resell in other European ports.Because of this ban, the Dutch organized and founded the VOC or the “Dutch East India Company” in an effort to loot and capture the Portuguese colonies in Asia. Through the VOC and other in-land efforts, the Dutch managed to seize their independence from the Spanish and become one of the world’s richest countries to this day.During this time Militia Companies were in charge of protecting the cities against invasions and other threats.

      "body": "Yeah, it's fascinating how historical events can have such a profound impact on art and culture centuries later. I think it's amazing that the Delft Blue Night Watch is not only a beautiful work of art but also a symbol of Dutch independence and innovation.Personally, I find the concept of Art Attainment and their NFT art collective really interesting. It's a unique way to bring the world's greatest masterpieces to a wider audience and make them more accessible in the digital age.I means, the idea of having a physical ceramic tile that is blockchain-certified to claim an NFT is pretty innovative. It combines the physical and digital worlds in a way that I haven't seen before. Then, there's the added bonus of exclusive access to future drops of never-before-seen artwork from well-known artists, which is a great incentive for collectors.",
