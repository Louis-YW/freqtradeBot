  "content": "Hello,I am searching for a self Hosted (!!) solution to generate addresses from a public zpub key. It would be great, if it has an intigrated rest api inside. Maybe something for nodejs would be very nice. This would be a nice solution for cold storage wallets.I am currently using https://github.com/romanz/electrs for various stuff, but unfortunately I dont find any api details anymore.",
