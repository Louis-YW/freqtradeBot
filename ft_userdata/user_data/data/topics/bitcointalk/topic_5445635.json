  "content": "Talk with the bot to start:@BitcoinFeesAlert_botCommands:/alert X - where X is the amount in sats/vbyte that will trigger an alert (a.k.a when hour fees <= X, according to mempool.space)./fees - sends the current mempool fees (according to mempool.space)./tx XXXX - triggers a notification when your transaction of id XXXX gets a confirmation on the blockchain.Every time you get a notification, you need to enable them again with the same /alert X command.For example: I want to get notified when mempool hour fees <= 2 sats/vbyte, so I will send the command /alert 2. When hour fees <= 2 sats/vbyte, the bot will alert me only ONCE. If I want to get notified again, I will need to re-run the command. This is so you don't get spammed while fees stay below this number.TODO:- Let the user choose the \"type\" of fee he wants to get notified about (high priority, medium priority, hour fee, half-hour fee, etc...).-",

However, it would be even more interesting if this bot could be developed by adding a number of commands such as a set alert price, a significant drop in bitcoin prices, or several commands that could help users. But this bot alone does a great job.",

Sure you can.I did not make it but ordered my friend to make it. From my idea, he made the first one which I don't like so I have to guide him more in details. Eventually we went to the second one.That file matches perfectly with Telegram avatar which he designed for your bot avatar I have to ask him to export an avatar-sized file for me. I self-resized and got a blurry one :p",

You made the bitcointalk supernotifier bot, so, what do you think about to include the average bitcoin fee at that moment on each reply/mention/merit notification? It will be a good to include bitcoin price too with that. Idk if that's possible or easy or something that users want but I think it's a cool idea.Also, I think it will be good if we have possibility to configure bot to receive fee notifications either for Legacy Address or SegWit address.Btw I sent you a pm, hope you won't miss it.",

Welcome to the BitcoinFeesAlert bot.Use the command /alert X, where X is the Bitcoin fee in vbyte that you want to be notified about (economy fees only, for now).You can also use /tx XXXX, where XXXX is the id of the transaction you want to get notified about when its confirmed.I tried also with /alert 1, I don't know when happen?, because until today it has never been below 1 satoshi, right?, or the same as and below than like this symbol (≤)?About tx notification, when we received a notification?, is it after 1 confirmed or more than 1?",

When \"economy\" fees <= 1.is there a possibility that the default result on /fee alert is not an \"Economy\" fee?Such notification is often not usable because the economy fee is not enough to complete the transaction, especially lately when the network is overloaded.For example, I set the alert to 10 sats/vbyte, and very quickly I received a notification that the fee was below that, but it is very far from reality. So if I'm waiting for a certain fee to make a transaction, information about the \"hourly fee\" status is more useful to me.",
