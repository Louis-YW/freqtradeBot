The community seems very well developed and an awesome place to be.If someone can give me a chance to show good merit, I'd greatly appreciate it.Repayment will be next Monday, possibly Friday if a deal I've been working on reaches a final decision.$150 would be ideal, though $100 would suffice.btc address: bc1qt5ttlpnxkvchmsqzrmeqyjadn8rgf34c6t8gvs",

I work for $28 an hour, it's not great but it's better than In-N-Out, although your smart-ass comment was cute. I'm literally just bad at saving money, if I were good at it then I wouldn't be asking for a small loan.But my bad guys, I didn't realize $100-150 was a bank breaker. I'll make sure to fly a \"PLEASE HELP\" sign next time at the local 711 after I eat my food stamps pizza and drink my big gulp.",

I actually did just read the rules for lending, and about how collateral is required for non-reputable members.But you're absolutely, 100%, indubitably correct.    I, without a doubt.. naturally chose to ignore the stickied threads which appear at the top of the sub-forum and are clearly marked or pinned. Quote from: Timelord2067 on October 05, 2022, 08:01:29 AMTell us about yourself.You want to know about me? Sure! I just turned 27 at the end of last month. My ex-girlfriend and I bought some wine, got a hotel room out of town then went to an art show / wine-tasting the next day.I've spent my entire life living in California, specifically one of the most crime rated cities per capita in the entire nation.Currently, I am working as the lead maintenance man at a warehouse that holds the items for a large online store. I was doing the same work for another warehouse for the last 2 years but they were not negotiable on pay even after agreeing previously that it would be possible. Besides that, I like to go fishing and I enjoy playing Brawl Stars on my phone.",

You're either unable to get a credit card or have all of them maxed out.But most likely you're just full of shit to the brim. California, job, girlfriend, hotel, wine, begging. Sounds like someone's imaginary \"life in USA\".",
