  "content": "Many of us have seen many reasons why Bitcoin is one of the best and rapidly growing technologies in the world today. Many Nigerians who have seized this great opportunity are testifying about how this technology has changed their lives in numerous ways. In our country today, with the rise of various online jobs, many people are sometimes confused about where to focus their efforts. The interesting part is that any online job within your reach can still offer you something valuable. The question now is how to find these opportunities. Some days ago, I encountered people who identified themselves as business strategists or affiliate marketers. They walked around, showcasing these business opportunities to anyone they came into contact with. This made me think it's a good way to help others discover available business ideas. Although I know that some might have ulterior motives, there are genuine opportunities out there.The idea is that many of us in this forum are familiar with Bitcoin and, as Bitcoin enthusiasts, we want the technology to be adopted worldwide, even in our country Nigeria. But how can we help promote Bitcoin to others and make them aware of it? I've heard of people in forums talking about how they added Bitcoin as a payment option for their businesses, seeing it as a way to promote Bitcoin. However, that alone isn't enough. Similar to those affiliate marketers, how many people have you shared your Bitcoin testimony with? How many people have you told about Bitcoin who have actually taken it seriously and shown interest in learning more? The goal is for each of us to play our part and make others aware of the technology behind Bitcoin and how it can help them. Bitcoin is not just a currency; it's a solution to many financial problems that people face in our country. If they can understand the technology, they can also enjoy its benefits, making everyone happy.So far, the few people I have taught about Bitcoin are happy to see that they made a profit from the recent bull run or increase in BITCOIN price and this has made them even more interested. Let's make an effort to occasionally tell people about Bitcoin. you never know how it might significantly improve their lives.",

Bitcoin has risen over the years and many people have heard about it even if they haven’t had any idea about how it works. Those people that tell or teach them are the real bitcoin enthusiasts amongst others that are found in this crypto space. I have also heard of occasions where people do not want others to know that they’re into bitcoin because of the good and bad name attached to it, such people will not want to teach others and will want to be using in anonymously. Some say bitcoin is a scam and mostly a cover for illegal activities in the internet especially yahoo, while some have a notion that anyone that is into it is a millionaire. With this two mindsets people share about it, many people prefer to remain anonymous throughout their usage of it and I think it is okay for their own safety. So not all people can disseminate and invite people to learn about bitcoin without putting themselves into risk.",

Bitcoin is not looking for who will promote it's market to gain popularity or make money through it, but a digital market where you can invest and make profit if you wish but that does not mean that someone must go and advertise it to people. Bitcoin is just a kind of thing that need not to stress yourself up my forcing people to learn. It's just what you can introduce to your friends and relatives, and if they fail to understand you forget about it an move on because success is not by force.Quote from: Hatchy on November 18, 2023, 09:20:13 PMThe idea is that many of us in this forum are familiar with Bitcoin and, as Bitcoin enthusiasts, we want the technology to be adopted worldwide, even in our country Nigeria.

Bitcoin is not just a currency; it's a solution to many financial problems that people face in our country. If they can understand the technology, they can also enjoy its benefits, making everyone happy.Like I have said bitcoin is not looking for promoters. I think most people are already aware about bitcoin and also knows the inportant of it, how it is used and how it can help to facilitate the growth of the economy, but there are some factors hindering them not to participate. 1) Negative mindset: they think that bitcoin is use by Yahoo boys to defraud people online just like @jegileman said2) Due to temporary ban: the ban placed on bitcoin by CBN has got many thinking that is it truly an investment Worth investing? If yes why the ban on CBN.3) Anything online business is scam: I have encountered many people several times when I talk about bitcoin, what dey will reply is MMM people don come again! You want Make them carry my money go? Forget them. Naso them dey carry different format they come4) illetracy: many people dey ready to learn about am but the fact still remain that you can never cheat nature. If you are not educated you can not force yourself to it.5) Zero knowledge or lack of zeal: many people no matter how you preach about it they can never give it a trial. E go just dey sweet them for mouth/mind but to make move na problem.6) Bitcoin has no braches: just like banks where you can lay your complain if problem arisis, bitcoin don't have costumer service line or braches to attend to cleint financial issues.Despite all this I have mentioned I think if CBN can remove that ban placed on bitcoin, bitcoin still remain a Negative trust or a red flag to Nigerians. I also think that Binance should open a branch in Nigeria where dey can employe people to make people bright out there mind on bitcoin adoption just like what @brainboss said in a comment.",

Not teaching or preaching to people about bitcoin doesn't mean you are not a real bitcoiner there is a state of condition you find yourself that you don't speak of bitcoin to others or make it known that you are a bitcoiner. Imagine finding yourself were the laws strictly restricts banks and every other financial institutions from affiliating with cryptocurrency transactions or to crown it all there's a complete ban against the use of bitcoin terming it as illegitimate for use by the government of the country you live in.Living in such a country the wise decision to embark on is going absolutely underground about your bitcoin activities you make it anonymous even down to your family and friends not only for your own safety but that of theirs too. Now does it mean these people living in these bitcoin ban countries that have chosen to stay anonymous not telling anyone about bitcoin  are not real bitcoiners or what? In my view, teach or telling people about bitcoin is a matter of volition and not a metric to decide who's a real bitcoiner or not.",

If the founder of BTC can remain enormous till date, you think he or she don't know what they are doing because they know BTC will dominate the whole world.",

I also love the fact that the people you introduced are able to experience good thing that can happen to people who embrace Bitcoin which is making more money. However, I will love to understand certain things about your approach since the topic is up for discussion. Are you teaching them Bitcoin trading or how to buy and hodl? You mentioned that they made profits and that sounds very much to me like short term trading. If that be the case, I have serious concerns. You will agree with me that Bitcoin trading is not something for Bitcoin newbies because the risk is extremely high. It only requires you going through the forum to read about the experience of others so you know the ultimate end of Bitcoin trading. Few wins might be like a bait to lure you in after which reality might dawn on you. I am not saying there are no successful Bitcoin traders. But for any single successful Bitcoin trader, you will see hundreds of people who lost money in Bitcoin. Therefore, instead of teaching people how to trade Bitcoin for quick profits, I will suggest you mentor them on how to buy and hodl to build their portfolio for a long term. This way, they will be relaxed even when bear market comes because they know it is a long term investment. This us just my opinion though.",

      "body": "Op With the way things are going in this country I don't think this you suggestion is a nice idea. Yes you have good intention to create more awareness about bitcoin but my brother in everything you are doing think about your safety first. The mentality of most of our country men and women are still very low when it comes to technology advancement. I think the high rate of illiteracy in the is a major factor that is contributing to this. Most of the youth you will meet out there to tell about bitcoin already knows about bitcoin, I know this because I have tried interviewing some good number of youths in my place of residence and a good number said they know about bitcoin but their major challenge is finance. And you know the high rate of unemployment in the country. So are you going to tell them to go and borrow money to invest in bitcoin? That one aside you that people who will readily have money to invest in bitcoin are the market men and women and majority of these people are illiterates, all they know is their business and are only interested in what they will invest today and see their profit tomorrow or a week later, so they won't even listen to you. And when you stress further it will be as if you have a special interest. Also you know that most of Nigerians pay much attention and listen to whatever our government says and the Nigerian government through the CBN has place a temporary ban on cryptocurrency trading and are blocking any account associated with crypto trading. So most Nigerians are still scared as they don't want their account closed. Also you know what happen to MBA Forex/Trading company, when the Nigerian government came for them and closed the company. Millions of Nigerians lost their hard earned money and there was no refund even as we speak. So Nigerians are skeptical when it comes to online investment as you know that bitcoin trading and investment is online. There awareness of bitcoin in Nigeria is already high, what we need now is just an enabling environment from the government and sensitizing the public that bitcoin investment is not a bad thing and it's welcome in the country and that no authority will come after you when you engage in bitcoin trading publicly or privately in the country. And also introduce bitcoin teaching in our educational curriculum for secondary and tertiary institutions, because that's where the youths are and those students can teach their parents at home about bitcoin. Parents and elderly ones will be more attentive and willing to learn when their children are the ones teaching them about bitcoin investment than a stranger they just meet on the street.",

You fit tell them the benefits wey dey for Bitcoin investment like the anonymity, privacy and other benefits wey dey when you dey use Bitcoin especially the security against inflation when you buy and hodl Bitcoin. Also the profits wey go dey come your side as the price of Bitcoin dey increase. You fit use all this one dey preach to them. No go dey pressure anybody oh because dis industry wey we dey so no be everybody dey make am, some people dey buy high and sell low instead of buying low and sell high. Some people no sabi safeguard their investment so scammers and hackers dey use dem shine.

Long-term holding of Bitcoin is the best advice for someone new to the technology. If you have Bitcoin now during this bullish phase, you'll likely profit, but that's not the same as trading. For example, if you bought $100 worth of Bitcoin when it was $27,000, and now it's $36,600, your profit would be around $35.42. It would be nice to seeing such profits from your initial investment.Quote from: EluguHcman on November 19, 2023, 12:37:37 AMThough while I am enumerating the challenges hindering to execute my aspirations, I am gets weak otherwisely asking myself that... \"What would be my benefits after all the efforts\"? Because Satoshi and other investors whom would benefit from the additions through my initiates would definitely not recognize me for a credit.That's where u are getting it wrong mate. You don't do something at free will and expect something I'm return or for people to recognize you. Adding a good value to the Bitcoin world has been the work of somany Bitcoiners, developers and more without asking for anything in return. If you check well, Satoshi created this wonderful technology and left it for other people to enjoy. He never asked for something in return. So if u are willing to play your part then you shouldn't be expecting anything but hoping that your value would be useful to others in the community.Quote from: Samlucky O on November 19, 2023, 12:52:17 AM You might be right, but you can't just compear bitcoin and any affiliate marketing firm.

So if we want to make even more profits from the little we have invested, more people will have to buy Bitcoin. I'm not saying you should force anyone. The thing is that so many people might not be aware of what Bitcoin truly is. Yes they may have heard of it but only understand that it's a digital currency. So if we can explain to them throughly what  Bitcoin is, then they will be willing to give it a try.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on November 19, 2023, 09:00:00 AMYour thoughts no bad but make we know say e get as we go dey go around dey tell people's how we dey do well with Bitcoin and we go become targets of kidnappers from jealous people and dem go set us up. I get ur point @CryptopreneurBrainboss. No be every person wey u see u go dey tell about Bitcoin or your profit wey u don make although I no say we Nigerians dey only wan hear big money b4 we go dey interested for any business ideas. d tin be say u fit share am with people Dem wey dey close to u and wey dey ur area. Dat wan no mean say make u dey waka like all those affiliate marketing people dem.But sometimes when u see people dey talk about cryptocurrency, u fit still chuck mouth put. I don dey one gathering like dat before, wey some guys con dey talk of Bitcoin. But watin I hear Dem dey talk was all rubbish and wrong information I had to step in, con correct Dem in many ways I knew of. Since dat day, if Dem get question and Dem see me. Dem no dey fear to ask. U go see say in dat way, I don play my own role small. But nevertheless, we should be careful as nija no be where u go dey cast urself.

It is good that you already know that long term is the way to go. What I expect you to do is to ensure they are not carried away by the profits because anything can happen and the market dump again below their entry point. It will be bad if they begin to panic over that. So the best is for them to have the right mindset to be able to hold even if price dumps.",

Due to various scams and frauds that has been going on in the financial system of our society, it is really very difficult to convince people. A lot of people believes in practical example of what you're talking about like if they've seen huge successes in you as a result of the fact that you're a bitcoin investor then they can be convinced that they can also do well just like you. Now the problem with introducing people into something is that no matter how successful they get through what you introduced to them, if peradventure something goes wrong along the line they will point fingers at you that you were the one that got them into such mess as people you do good to can actually turn against you when things ain't going to well with them again and they will even forget that you both are in it together. I think we should just do things our own way and achieve notable success that people will come to you to ask how you made it rather than walking to people and trying to convince them because if they meet you for help and you show them the way if anything goes wrong in the future, no one will blame you because they were actually the people that met you and not the other way round. It is unfortunate that we are living in a world were people sees our good deeds are bad when things start going wrong so we have to be extremely careful.",

Let's make an effort to occasionally tell people about Bitcoin. you never know how it might significantly improve their lives.The thing is that most people have actually heard about Bitcoin and how good it is to invest on Bitcoin but doesn't have somebody that would guide them through because just like you, I have actually known someone who was interested on investing on Bitcoin but the challenge he was having was there was nobody to mentor him or coach him about what Bitcoin is all about. So when he came to me I showed him how I started my Bitcoin journey and from there he invested and now he is a Bitcoin holder, so I believe there are many people out there who are wishing to meet someone that could guide them on how to start there Bitcoin journey so helping someone like that could also be another way of creating Bitcoin awareness.",
