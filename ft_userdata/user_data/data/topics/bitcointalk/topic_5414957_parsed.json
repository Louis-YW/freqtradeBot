The high volatility on crypto is what makes crypto trading unpredictable and very hard to master unlike other skills that you mention in the OP. You need a crystal ball to become an accurate trader in crypto because the price moves base on whales manipulation and mainstream media news that affecting normal traders decision making.TA can help you but sometimes it’s a double edge sword when the signal and the actual result is showing opposite outcome.",

So yes it’s basically subjective and varies from people to people and depends on their trading skills.Maybe, he meant also expert traders. But even them, they can experience losses.No one can beat the trading market if the project itself will do such strategies like pump and dump or rug pull.No matter how good you are, you will be at a loss because of unforeseen events.But with some warning signals, you can also minimize your losses. In this market, it doesn't matter what you studied, it is how well you are familiar with the projects that you are getting into.",

Therefore you can analyse your theory and do the practical leading you to same result but trading is not that way. You can analyse the theoritical aspect of trading but the practical doesn't really come out same way it was analysed and this is why we have more of market analysers and YouTube, telegram call groups because trading is not easy so they rely that way to make the money from others and not directly from the market  Trading is complex because it involves different figures of market decision markers that you can't read their minds but only rely on figures, speculation and emotional sentiment. This is a major challenge for trading, it is more of practical than classroom learning.",

We could be masters in trading by just taking little steps at a time. We don't have to rush things out because it's a long process of learning. Yeah, many are good already with what they know and that's having basic knowledge in trading. It's all that they need and want to know.Unlike the others that would like to master it, they dedicate time on it and it's one of their priorities because they're seeing the significance of it and their growth towards trading.

And so there is no substitute for acquiring knowledge about trade to become a master trader.Risk: And as much knowledge as you gain. Sometimes you will trade with risk yourself, then you will understand the weakness in your trade and in the future you will be able to correct your mistakes and become a master trader.Patience: And the most important thing is patience.

You can't just disregard them or their skills. They have a high success rate in trading. Those who fail woefully could mean that they need to practice a lot. The results in our crypto trade will depend on what we study but do you think it's easy on why would someone perfect it? Even studying in a real school is hard but it takes dedication and as you can see there are still many drop outs.What teaches us in trading is on how to work under pressure and on how to have a self control. What we learn here in crypto trading can also be applied in real life and you will notice that all seems easy. That is because trading is hard and we are used to that already.",
