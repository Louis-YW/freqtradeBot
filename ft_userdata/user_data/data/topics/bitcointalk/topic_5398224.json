  "content": "The latest breakdown - before attack they OTC accumulated $1Bn of UST- borrowed $3Bn in BTC- spread around some fud about peg and bank runs- dumped the fuck out of their $3Bn BTC on market to trigger wider panic- 10 min after TFL pulled some liquidity from curve in preparation for 4pool, the attackers pounced- first cleared all liquidity from Curve (needed just 350M UST to do that)- then started dumping their UST on Binance- creating a small depeg- terra market module was configured for $150m daily throughput for peg restoration, would be enough if liquidity on curve was the intended $4Bn instead of $350M- people in panic because BTC tanking and small UST depeg, so LFG started selling BTC to restore peg- that's exactly what the attackers wanted because they've shorted BTC..- TFL dumping BTC, while attackers putting pressure on by dumping UST- the more BTC sold, the lower BTC tanked increasing panic, the less UST sell pressure the attackers needed- finally people started panicking for good and mass congestion hit the chain, cexes suspended withdrawals and shit hit the fan, bank run- Jump/LFG likely realized what's happening somewhere in the middle of their BTC reserve bag, stopped dumping BTC to save the peg, let it burn- now peg is being restored naturally via the market module- rumours on CT about big deals made during the nightAll of this would not be economically viable if the 4pool was live. Because clearing the 4pool alone would require $3Bn instead of 350M. The timing was not a coincidence.So, using just $350M they were able to make billions AND almost destroy LunaSource: https://t.me/TheNorwegianNews/431I still believe on Luna despite this massive failure on depegging. High risk high reward.",

The main question now is what is the fate of traders who bought after the attack?  They should also address that, I've read that there will distribution on holders before the attack, but those investors who take the risk of buying when Luna is crashing, does this mean that it's over for them I bought 1000 Luna it's just a small amount I can take my loss but how about those who bought 5 digits dollars I read that there are investors who are tempted to get in the crash and there are many of these people.",

I never owned any Luna or anything in their ecosystem, so I am not bothered by it financially aside from the crypto I own to go down because of them.However, if they built a system that failed and there was a method that would be used to crash it, then it's not really a shock, it would be something normal for it to go down because the market will do anything to make a profit, including crashing a whole ecosystem and make tons of people lose money, just to make some profit. Do Kwon should have built something that is profitable and not have anything that will crash it. He is the responsible person for building something like this, so I do not care about how \"upset\" he is.",

Most probably, people will start to hype this project again for a hope that it can rise again, but with its current total supply I believe it will be hard and a big challenge for the team to regain the trust of the public, this is not an easy year for them and I fee sorry to those who loss money from this LUNA and the manipulator, try to bounce back again.",
