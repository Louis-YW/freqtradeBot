Your money will be always yours, and in the case we need to shutdown ( not likely) you will always receive your money back. We are just transparent.QuoteYou have coinpaycard.com in some parts of your site and .net on other.You refer to our footer copyright bottom, thanks for that we fixed the small human mistake.QuoteNo physical address / business information given.Correct, we don’t have any company information on our website.

You should look into getting that lower. I know a gift card is different then a debit card, but you still have to look at the out of pocket cost to people.As you probably guessed, there is a big difference between a prepaid card and debit cards. The cost of debit cards are also much different. Not to forget our spending limits are higher, you can use our cards worldwide, in a couple of weeks you can add your card to Apple/Google pay. We have carefully and for a long time thought about our card pricing to make it affordable for a lot of users and profitable enough for use to continue this service for years. And yes we understand that at this moment, we may not be the best choice for everybody. But we hope to lower our overall pricing in the near future.",

Are there any exception (such as sanctioned country by US government)? 2. Do you have any plan to offer virtual credit card?3. I feel $99/year or more is too expensive for those who rarely use debit card.4. I didn't find privacy policy page on your website. Even though you offer KYC-FREE, some people want to know what other information you collect.Hi EFTBitcoin,1. You can use our card online everywhere as long as Visa is accepted. When Apple/Google Pay will be available, it will depend on the store if they accept Apple/Google Pay.2. We don't offer any credit, we are not a bank.3. 99$/Y for a $2000/Monthly limit is a bargain if you compare our cards to competitors.4. Privacy policy is yet to be uploaded. Keep in mind, we don't collet any private information. That includes no IP tracking, no cookies and no fingerprinting. Btw guys, use the discount code: 479ea80d-90e0-46ee-9979-269e37fee3c0 for $10 OFF your first card.[/size]",

This will always help us ensure to create a good and reliable platform for crypto users. Let me answer your questions below.At this time we only support USDT, But we will support the following cryptocurrencies within the next 2 weeks: BTC, ETH, USDC, LTC and DOGE (maybe even more). In the case that we would ever shut down (will not happen) you will receive 100% of your remaining funds back. We have good contracts with multiple card issuers. So there will be always a place for us. 1. We of course display every purchase you made, you can also see all your card purchases in your card history tab. However, we don't receive your delivery address data from any retailer. Not even a bank receives those details.2. When signing up, you will need to enter a first and last name. These data will be your cardholder details.3. If you send any stole coins, our payment processer will automatically block that specific transaction if that wallet is blacklisted. We are not a platform for laundering stole coins. Simple as that.4. We use a variety of 3rd parties, for example Coinbase institutional  and Binance. If you have any more questions, please let me know.",

These coins will ofcourse not be blacklisted. I think everybody that uses crypto knows if they have stolen coins, they won't send it to any service directly. So if you have stolen coins in a wallet that is blacklisted, no matter what service or website you will use. Your funds will not come true. If you have coins from gambling or mixing, who cares. You can use these coins.Please don't twist our words. But again, till the whole conversation is absolutely off-topic. We are not a service to be used for illegal activities, such as money laundering.",

I can assure you that we have years of experience using, handling and building on crypto, so I can brag a little that we are experts in this field.There are several types of service that these 3rd party provides. Please go to their website, and you may find more information about their service. If you used the costumer sideof Coinbase for example, their Exchange YOU are maybe limited in what coins you can send and from where. We don't use consumer grade services, we use Institutional level services, which gives us much more power in what kind of transactions we can accept and how. We also don't use their service to directly accepted payments from users. Furthermore, we use our own internal relay system. That means user pay first to us -> then coins are sent to a 3rd party service provider (also called off-ramps) in order to exchange the coins to for example USD in real-time. However, the moment you send a payment, there is and will be always a check to verify that the wallet you used is not blacklisted by any government entity. Not doing so would make us money launders, and banks wouldn't work with us to issue cards. This is explained as simple as possible, but the systems and infrastructure behind the scenes are more complicated than you would guess. I hope this clears it more up for you.",

We work with card issuers to issue our cards. You can google it more to figure out how that works.Every website/service even BitcoinTalk.org cannot guarantee that their service will work 100% of the time. There can be a dozen of reason why a service disruption would be happening, for example our hosting providergets cut of electricity. Our card issuer suffers from a disturbance, our payment system API is out. We are just a transparent about the availability of our service as we can be. And we of course don't expect such things to happen, these things happen to the best. Moreover, we are new on this forum and our service is new. Ass we said in our pre-announcement and in the announcement text.",
