  "content": "For Crypto Sports betting, Sportsbet.io seems to be a nice site. Please, if you can, can you answer my questions? 1. When was your last paid out profit? 2. How much did you pay out at once? 3. How much did you pay out in total? 4. Did you need KYC personally for your payout? Does Sportsbet.io have any definitive KYC limits total payout / payout per day? Sportsbet.io seems to be a sponsor of some established Premier League Clubs. I just want to have a reliable Crypto sports bet site, no Fiat Exchange!  Is anonymous Bitcoin Sports betting possible at Sportsbet? Feedback about payouts / KYC on Sportsbet.io is appreciated! Plz many replies!  BitCoinBeet",

      "body": "Your questions from 1-3 seems confusing to me, this doesn't make sense. What payout, you mean withdrawal? For question number 4, you don't need KYC to withdraw if the payout you're referring to was actually withdrawal in the first place.As far as I know there's a limit but to increase it that's when KYC will be implemented. You can read more from their T&C: https://sportsbet.io/help-centre/help-other/help-other-terms-and-conditions/general-terms-conditions regarding withdrawals and other questions you can think of.",

      "body": "Have been playing at Sportsbet.io for sometime now and I can answer some of your questions.1. My recent payout was about 600 bucks.2. Didn't understand.3. No comment.4. Didn't need to submit KYC so far.They are reliable obviously, but KYC is a very complicated topic. It's not mandatory or anything, but they will request KYC if they find something shady related to your account. Overall, you should be able to bet anonymously if you don't do anything shady upto a certain limit.",
