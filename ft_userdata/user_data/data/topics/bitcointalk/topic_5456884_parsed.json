You can do that, but it's not recommended and Electrum won't be able to read it either.Electrum is able to generate wallet from any random characters or words.All you need to do is to go to \"options\" and check \"BIP39 seed\" and enter your random characters or words. Electrum will display a message saying \"unknown wordlist\", but it will generate a wallet.See the following image. I entered random characters and the \"next\" button is clickable. To OP:This method is not standard and I would never recommend anyone to generate a wallet in this way.",

Once it's done Electrum generates an encrypted and password-protected wallet file that you can later transfer to the online device only if you want to use it on an online device it is way more safer from keyloggers than doing it all on an online device or completely use it on an offline device and use it only for signing transaction.",

Option for passphrase may even not be there. That is why it is good to use a reputed open source wallet.Passphrase (extended word) can help against attack, for wallet not to be compromised by an attacker.",

You can check \"BIP39\" option, so that you can import a BIP39 seed in electrum. There is no BIP39 option when you generate a seed phrase. According to the message displayed on electrum when importing a BIP39 seed, electrum doesn't generate BIP39 seed phrases, because BIP39 doesn't meet their safety standards.",
