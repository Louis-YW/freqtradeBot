Direct Contact at: DoubleDices#4802 BTCFor any reason if they ask to verify then will you provide a KYC document? And if they are required to verify via video call then will you be able to verify that? If yes and there is 5000$ on the account then will the buyer get back the account or you will take that? How to rely on you? Also, is it too hard to recover the account after changing the hand it is too easy as the country/city will not be the same as you.",
