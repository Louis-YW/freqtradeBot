I believe you can find other exchanges they are listed on and look if their polygon deposit and withdrawal is still open.",

I meant im still holding some tokens based on polygon network and nothing happened with it instead of these tokens being listed into the new exchange sites. May i wrong about this? Lets see what token it is. I guess if such token has a very poor performance during the bearish market and that makes token has low daily trade volume then exchange site decide to delist it.",

Also, I do not want you to view this like an agenda against polygon network, no it is not. Bad projects get delisted all the time; and this is exactly what is happening to some stable coins. For now I think you should trust bsc stable coins, it is also a low fee blockchain network",

I was shocked reading the OP but I just checked and everything is working efficiently. It might be an error from the end of the exchanges he uses. There's actually low traffic on polygon coins but it will be unfair for exchanges to delist any of its coins without making announcement to their community.",

Please make sure that the wallet you use is good, for example I used Zebpay and they delisted the Luna etc, instantly shib was banned for trading suddenly and I also lost a lot because of it, thus it's wiser to have like 5-6 exchanges you know, have registered for and can trade instantly.",

If there's a maintenance going on then why would they remove polygon when they can simply suspend withdrawal and deposit like many changes do. If they remove polygon then they would have to add it again if it is temporary. We don't know the reason why many exchanges remove polygon and as I have said that many exchanges only suspended withdrawal and deposit for a certain crypto if there's a maintenance going on rather than removing the crypto.",

Well, delisting a crypto could also mean that something is wrong with the crypto that's why I have stated those and it's not just one exchange which could bring more confusion or even panic to some people except I didn't get affected by it just curious.",

Overall this Polygon chain is quite popular now and in future it will overtake Previous ATH. Moreover, the investment on this project is constantly increasing.",
