It's only ourselves that can create our own success no one will put in hard work for us, we need of course do ourselves. Many people today 2023 have forgotten about it because the new world being so curled.Lucky many on this forum have seen this and don't buying the shit the governments trying to play with us citizens. Crypto is a perfect way around this that's why I love places like this forum. Even tho I don't agree with everyone here about everything, we all agree in the love of bitcoin and decentralized places.",

I can understand that, it's a rookie mistake. They're green to the industry so they don't know much about it. They do not know why it's best to stick to Bitcoin, they don't know that there are so many altcoins that will remain shitcoins.They might just gotten the idea that if you buy a crypto coin today,  it might make you a millionaire sometime in the future. So that's an understandable rookie mistake. The same goes for trading Bitcoin. They already know how to buy and sell Bitcoin. They know how to use an exchange \"How hard could it be\". They've already gotten the orientation that crypto trading is the new oil. They feel it's just normal to buy and sell until they start losing so much money and realize there are so many technicalities between buying and selling in trading.",

Basically, it doesn't matter which asset you trade ... whether houses, stocks, gold or cryptos, the point of the whole thing is to end up with more than before. Of course, this also applies to Bitcoin and altcoins. Where I agree with you, however, is that you should simply HODL with by far the largest part of your crypto portfolio. This is by far the most lucrative way to increase your FIAT, especially for beginners. Of course, you won't get more cryptos this way.",

I mean if you are a beginner, obviously it's going to be very difficult. But if you continue to chase it and believed that you can make money, then go for several months and see how it goes.And with that, it's a learning process, there are ups and downs, but definitely there is a learning curve for months and years. And if someone do learn from their mistakes in trading and as you gain that knowledge and mature, maybe there will be time that you can make profits in trading.",

Nothing good comes easy, so if we must succeed in trading even as experience as we are, we must keep on putting in the work to learn more, so that we can be a better trader and reap the rewards of our work.Just like what I advised at the gambling section of the platform a while ago, there is no perfect advice for trading as well, while some advice of perseverance could amount to dragging people more to ruin. I always advise traders to learn and give trading all it takes to make them successful (that's if they could indeed make it as to have absolved themselves of all blame of not trying at all), but at the same time, I put the clause that if your limit is reached, do not fight it too harder. This is particularly important if the person has tried it for years and has wasted money in the guise of making money in trading. I see no sense in that.It can never be a misplaced fact that only a few would ever be making money in trading, and I believe that this makes much sense because if the majority were to be making money in trading, the market would crash itself because those who are providing liquidity are doing so because of the money they gain from it, and if they couldn't gain money when traders are so experienced and gaining all the time, they will pull out their liquidity. By the way, that's for the traditional market setting. For the crypto, assuming, traders are now providing liquidity for themselves just as the exchanges claim, the issue will arise when there is panic withdrawals as that is capable of ruining any exchange running their business on people's money alone, and this explains why Binance disallows some withdrawals when there is an obvious reason for tension on their platform at times. Therefore, everyone can't be winning in trading, and winning amounts are likened to withdrawing too, it doesn't support liquidity after the trader closes his trade and this would have shifted the right from the exchange to continue using it for liquidity at that time.",

People don't realize that there are thousands of altcoins and even if 100 of them pumps still it's too less because remaining altcoins fails, but Bitcoin is a sure shot gain. Unfortunately people realize this only after losing it all. But an experience trader can use Bitcoin for daily trading with minimal margins and small gains.",

It'll take you many trials and errors until you finally master a strategy that you can use to make profits when you use it. As you grow, you'll have to learn new things too or you'll be left behind and not have a modern day strategy to use for trading. Learning never stops when you're a trader, the market will keep improving everyday and so should you.But when you learnt very well during your earlier stages, you'll find it very easy to adapt to new strategies and make profits. The most difficult times are when you're starting new but as you grow you'll get use to the challenges that the market throws at you and when you defeat the market, you'll come out stronger with more experience that'll help you when you face the exact problem in the future or when you see similar challenges and you'll triumph over them and make profits.",

What and how a city will become will depend more on how it starts, how it prepares, and plans. If we come without any bribery in terms of knowledge, skills, and various other important things, as well as the city's unwillingness to learn, then the results will be clear, there will be more failures. However, this will be different when we start wisely and are prepared with knowledge, a continuous learning process, increasing personal competence, learning from experience, as well as good and wise management, then there will be more progress and appropriate results. Even though the city will certainly experience failure in the process, it can use this failure as a weapon to become a better trader. Is it easy? Of course the process is not easy Moreover, crypto trading is high risk and complicated. It won't be as easy as selling in the city like in the real world. There are many aspects that are often unexpected in crypto trading, especially market which is volatile and often surprising. Therefore, this takes time and stability in terms of knowledge and others when we are really ready to trade",
