  "content": "I don't know if you still know or know this man, but for me it was one of the memories when I first searched for information related to bitcoin and accidentally saw his analysis. I also used to think that what he said was ridiculous because, at that time, maybe my understanding of the banking system or the economy was too silly. The things he said at that time made me just think that maybe bitcoin is a ponzi project and hires some people to spread it.Source: Bitcoin Update - just buy $1 worth of bitcoin please!And some pictures after the investment process with bitcoin that changed his own life.This is just one of many cases where he had faith in bitcoin early on and is enjoying the most visible results in the wealth he has earned. It's just that through the story of this case, I see that I have missed out on many good opportunities due to ignorance. But even worse, the bitcoins I had earned before were also impossible. Look back a bit on the past, but don't be immersed in that regret, how we will approach this opportunity in the present and the future. And you, have you missed any opportunities with bitcoin?",

      "body": "To start with, flaunting such a luxury and expensive lifestyle online for someone who is given financial advice is not advisable. Many people might have a wrong picture of those successes; they might believe that if they just invest a small amount of money into bitcoin and hold it, they could sometimes be able to get a large profit that can get them as wealthy as their mentor, or even close to that, making bitcoin appear to look like a money-doubling currency or Ponzi scheme that gives 1000 times the reward. For the regret part, I don't remember ever misusing any opportunity to buy bitcoin when I had the time, and I don't think about my past mistakes either, as I take them for what they are and also think about the negative possibilities that could have come of it, not just thinking in positive ways just because Bitcoin has made it this far. I know if there is no risk, there will be little gain, but then again, who knew the risk was worth taking back then when fewer people believed in it? Join the train wherever you meet it and keep going; that's the idea. No matter the time, it's never too late to start on bitcoin.",

He has the right to do what ever with his wealth and I am not going to control that for him but if you really want to know more about Bitcoin he won't be amongst my trusted guide.",

Back then, people merely believed that money could exist in digital form, maybe if banking apps were common back then like they are now, Then people might trust the digital coins and might not think of this dude as a phishing scammer. You must be regretting it even after watching this video back then because I did not watch it back then. But still, time is in our favor.Many people on this forum consider them early adopters, compared to those who will join the crypto world 50 years later. This is just a definition of an early adopter from everyone's own perspective. So do not waste time on it and move on. Try to do whatever you have now and see how much you can do with it.You have the opportunity now and should avail of this opportunity by all means. Do not lose hope in BTC. Because the ideas about BTC and the market were not the same as they are now. Back then, there was less information, less knowledge, and more ambiguity among the users and the readers too. I was young back then, but talking about others who are old might come to avail of this opportunity, but many don't. Looking at the past will always make you feel grateful.",

I believe a lot of us have missed bitcoin opportunities in the past because most of us have no faith on bitcoin. We tend to think that bitcoin is like a ponzi scheme, maybe work at first but it in the end it will vanish like thin air.  The reason why majority of us never resort into long term hodling and eventually lose our investments, while those few who have established faith very early are now living their dream life. But we all know that in bitcoin, there is no late or early. Now we are just on time. So we need to grab the opportunities again and never do the same mistakes as before to avoid missing bitcoin opportunities again.",

His story is a testament that bitcoin isn’t a scam and truly bitcoin investment can change lives.

I agree with you that for those who have missed the investment opportunity in Bitcoin, the current scenario of the market is still a golden opportunity for them because, as you see, Bitcoin has also changed its sentiment. And his move has been completely parallel to the bull. And at the same time, it is clearly visible that the countdown to Bitcoin halving has started and is ready to happen in just a few months. After the occurrence of Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin is often successfully testing its new ATH, and this time too, it is expected that the same bull process will be repeated.So, those who missed the opportunity and had regrets about getting Bitcoin at a low price So they can take entry now based on their acquired knowledge and research, and I think this is also a suitable time for profit-gainers. If the bull run happens, then according to experts, the price of bitcoin can be predicted at up to 150k or even more. If someone is a long-term holder, then they must have already entered the market and are still looking to enter the current market as well.So the purpose of saying this is that it gives the opportunity for Bitcoin investment all the time, but it depends on you when you take the opportunity as a booty for yourself and take the entry and book the profit by holding it.",

Well, that's one thing I don't like when you decide to invest. Investments should start with a good preparation not only on the sufficient funds you need for capital but also when it comes to your mental and emotional aspects. Make sure that you obtained prior knowledge about bitcoin and you are not faint-hearted so you won't be easily affected whatever the outcome of your investment. However, if you think of investing is like gambling, that it needs more luck than knowledge or skills, then you will never gained financial freedom in the end. This man is just so lucky that his investment had succeeded despite of his different mindset about investing. The only positive thing about him is that he trusted bitcoin more than any other investment and at such a very early time. I think that's one positive trait that we are lacking. Yes, we don't miss opportunities that bitcoin has to offer but we all know that our faith is not that strong and firm like him that's why in every market crash and price decline, we tend to change our decision towards reaching our goals in our investment.",

Even if the opportunity of Buying Bitcoin e earlier was there what is the probability that you would have hold it till the price became what it is today? A lot of persons who have sold earlier if they were given a second chance, they might not had kept it until now. Because I could remember large number of people who saw that the price had an X amount of rise sold on the way and couldn't endured to the point it became now. Withing the past few days or weeks we have seen a bit of increase from 27k to 34k and some persons have sold, these set of people will feel very disappointed if it goes higher than the current price. There is always a chance of missing out. Missing out is always a possibility, but dwelling on regret won't change the situation. Like you mentioned, there are still opportunities on the way so it's best to adopt now to avoid regret for miss.",

He said that 10 years ago where nobody is trusting Bitcoin since it's a new invention. Now he's reaping the fruits of his investments, and what's the reason why he got rich? Faith, and trust.When did you start involving yourself into crypto, and you are saying that you missed out on good opportunities OP? If you missed out during then it's your problem now, but if you missed out before you even started then wake up. Another thing is that, you can't change the past anymore, but you can change the future, so instead of focusing on those missed opportunities, just focus on the future opportunities that you might encounter like the upcoming bull run. Did I have missed any opportunities with Bitcoin? Yes, and the most recent one is the bull run in 2021. I have the opportunity to sell all of my assets, and re-buy it on the bear market, but instead I didn't sell all of my assets, but I slowly accumulating different assets during the bear market in preparation for the upcoming bull run. I hope others do it as well instead of buying at the peak or near the peak of the bull run.",

Of course anybody hearing such a description thinks bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. What else are they supposed to think? Your topic here is also only talking about \"opportunities\" missed and \"profit\" that could have been made by you that is made by others.That is NOT Bitcoin.Bitcoin is the only existing decentralized currency that is working as it should; without being censored and without being broken. Of course being in the adoption phase means its value keeps going up, but \"making profit\" should not be the main reason why people adopt bitcoin.",
