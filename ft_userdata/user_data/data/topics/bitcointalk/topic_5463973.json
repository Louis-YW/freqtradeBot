So i don’t really know what’s the issue if with my card or my region.Have you tried exchanging your Dinars to USD or Euros through one of the digital banking apps?  I've used Revolut, and I just checked to make sure and they do list Algerian Dinars.  I imagine there are others, but that's the one I'm familiar with.  If you have a Revolut account and convert your Dinars to Euros or USD, you can take advantage of the markets on Bisq.network.  Most of the offers for Revolut are for Euros, but that shouldn't be a problem, it's one of the markets with the most offers.",

Even the 3D secure option is disabled and when i contacted the bank support they told me we are not allowing much foreign websites and services and if i want to use that card in a specific website i should write them a letter mentioning the websites i want to allow and wait for them to activate them! I was shocked to be honest for this news and how centralization work.Unfortunately Revolut also is not supporting our country and i can’t use it. Just like many other banks all over the world . And that’s why I’m stuck and not finding a solution to exchange our currency to any other currency.",

Just try it out and get back to me on the outcome.",
