Social vices should be discouraged and campaign against in society.Human must socialize and in the quest for that socialization you need to interact with other civilly,  our morals and values, this are what makes humans different from animals even though we have some humans with animalistic behaviours, I am sure most of us are familiar with insecurity, terrorism,  and other social negative actions in the society. If you leave and grow up in an environment that is highly influenced negatively, you must demise means to survive in with a positive mindset but those that are mostly affected are kids and young adults who have failed to be responsible. Security is zero and citizens are left in defended by the government, this isn't the situation in my country and most other Afric countries we are faced with the constant fear of attacks from various vices and government due to poor administrative management and a high rate of corruption have not taken any action towards solving the internal security issues in Nigeria.",

Some communities has no peace around their environment because they're people who have decided to create tends atmosphere. You can not move freely because you're sore afraid of another persons posting as threats to their lives. I want to add that one of the reason for this high rate of crime is religion and racism. The open killing of Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf Ahmed by suspected Hindu nationalists because of the hatred they have for Muslims is a sign that nobody is safe. The most terrible part of the story is that they were heavily protected by the police before this ugly incident. And his son was recently murdered by the police. There are reports that these killing were orchestrated by the Hindus because they have the full support of the government.  The killing of some youths that were in a birthday party in the US is an indication that the world is becoming unsafe everyday. For me, I ensure that my family take every security measure to limit attack of these criminals. We don't keep late night, we live a modest life, keep a dog that serves as an alarm if there is any stranger in our compound, avoid areas with high crime rate, avoid large gathering etc.           QuoteAny society that do not practice harmony and coherent society tends to destroy lives of its members and when lives is negatively affected it becomes a threats to the society. We should leader to maintain healthy society by been clean to yourself and your community. Let's avoid bad habits and drugs to build possible society for the future. Drugs are part of the problems in our society but it is not the major cause of these abnormalities. Tribalism, religious fanaticism, racism, greed, materialism and uncontrollable quest for political power plays key roles in the high crime rate we are experiencing in our society. Let us treat our fellow countrymen the way we want them to treat us and we will all live a peaceful and prosperous society.",

Government contribute more to ignite these social vices due to their greed and desperate for power. The young ones are watching what is happening and they think it is the right thing to do and might definitely be influenced by their environments. The leaders in my country are doing more harm to the citizens than good,especially the youths. There is high rate of unemployment in the country, which has made the lazy youths see prostitution,robbery and kidnapping as the only option to carter for themselves. It takes the grace of God for one to grow up in a society with all these vices without involving in them. A good moral and God fearing life is the best way to overcome these vices. Loving one another regardless of the skin color, tribe and religion is the only way out to a peaceful society.",

It depends whom you ask.That is where the struggle between faction of society come from, because what some could consider to be a vice or a sin, to other it is just freedom and a personal choice.",

The society we leave in today has become vulnerable to all these things and only holistic ideological healing can take life back to its previous peaceful and civil manner of doing things one other thing we must expect to play an important role in all this is the Government since their the custodians of the law and orderliness in the society, the society is inflicted with a high rate of corruption and the government officials have played a major role in all of this.But just as you said in the last paragraph, we have to take personal precautional measures to ensure our safety because we are our first security, and at that, we must concur to present security situation and try as much as possible to stay safe and protect our family from every form of possible threat and security problem, by leaving a modest life and also watch out for what can lead to security problems around our environment.",

You can't just group random things you don't personally and say they are all affecting negatively to society. And that's such a weird set of \"vices\" when there are actual crimes listed. And still that somehow doesn't include worst of human kind. And we have already laws against robbing and kidnapping. So what exactly do you want to do? More surveillance? In what country?There's nothing wrong with a little cultism, witchcrafting if there's nothing wrong with religions. They are all cults to me. And a sex worker as a profession is a human right in my books too. Personally i don't smoke or drink but i see those as important civil rights as well.",

The only way to curb these crimes is through economic prosperity and the provision of employment opportunities. Like in my country crime increased as our economy nosedived. Before in my country, you can leave your doors open and sleep at night. Currently, because of the high rate of unemployment, you need to fence your house and put iron bars on the windows and doors for protection against criminals. The crimes that we see in the developed world such as mass shootings, suicide, and drug addiction are the result of lack of gun control, violent social media, and the collapse of social systems such as the family coupled with societal and peer influence. These crimes can be curtailed by government policies, positive value orientation, and education.",
