  "content": "Sometimes, I see things differently from other people's perspective, and this case of CZ against other exchanges is no different. This might be because I started trading and investments in sane climes where strict regulation thrives, not like in crypto where exchanges do whatever they want with people's money. Many might be blaming CZ, but I blame him less.Yes, he's instrumental in crashing FTX, but is FTX and SBF guiltless? No. How many of you would have a $2.1B investment in a company and suspect stress and foul play and will not withdraw the money? His (BSF) illegal activities called for it and made the decision of CZ effective. This would have played differently if SBF is ethical, sincere, and played with people's money with a good level of professionalism.As the largest exchange in the industry, Binance has the responsibility to protect its business and its environment, especially when it is underregulated. If the environment becomes unconducive and panic lingers beyond normal, it might affect even Binance, that's business for you. This is what the guy is avoiding, I think, though many see it differently as being selfish.This is people's money we are talking about, none of the rivals of Binance should panic or conclude a foul play if they are sincere and professional enough. We should stop pitying centralized exchanges, they don't care about their customers and their money, they act like gods and play as they like with people's money living 5-star lives all around the world. They should come clean if they are truly what they preach. But I dare them, only a few would survive integrity test.Should we now be supporting their illegality? Anyone of them should attack Binance too if they want to, it's called a healthy rivalry, all I want is the protection of people's money and sincerity of their operation.I don't even support centralization again, yet let's stop accusing CZ to force other centralized exchanges to do the right thing and stop fooling people in the name of exchange.",

Exchanges means to exchange and not to safe or hold your coins on an exchanging platform. Nobody is blaming Binance CEO, and if anyone is blaming him, that is life, you can not expect people to think the same. But what most people are after is that CZ actions is leading to centralization, he created the Beacon chain, the BSC, automatically converting USDC, TUSD and USDP to BUSD on Binance, said to increase liquidity when USDC has been the alternative main traidng pair on some other exchanges. He bought Coinmarketcap, Forbes announces $200 million strategic investment from Binance in early this year. CZ wanted to be a big player and dominate the crypto market (although bitcoin remain strong), but this is leading to centralization in a way that if Binance fall, it might almost collapse crypto market which will lead to loss of money even beyond what happened to FTX.",

Watch from 1:00, it's SBF speaking himself twisting things like crazy. You guys can check  this post from me as well. There is another video mentioned (I posted elsewhere as well I think), but that one is worth watching because it clearly shows who SBF was. You won't believe it... That might also have contributed to CZ making his decisions. If he didn't have any insights into FTX and Alameda, there were certainly enough indicators to take action at some point. The way he did it remains perhaps questionable though. But FTX had to collapse. Enjoy the videos.",

The topic is perfect for what I expressed. I had five different topics before opting for this since I didn't want to be biased. Advising us not to be too judgmental is not what I see as bad for people to carefully review the situation without taking sides and see another good possibility for the industry with what he (CZ) is doing. He might be wrong somewhere but not entirely wrong, and what he is doing might instil fear in other exchanges for them to do what is right.2. Contrarily, he was aware of the bad situation of the company which made him want to sell all his shares there, but did not know it was that bad. 3. And as for Coinbase and others, they can fire back at him and his company, I don't care, I don't entirely support him but some of his actions. What I want is for them to force regulation among themselves by revealing what they are doing wrong. Binance is not left out of this, let others attack it too and let people know what is going on in there in the bid to better protect people's money.Quote from: Darker45 on November 30, 2022, 03:55:08 AMWhy shouldn't we not be judgmental about CZ?

Not being too judgemental as per my title means we should be even with our conclusions and weigh the bad and good sides of what he is doing. Others (exchanges) could attack him for all I care, all I want is a healthy rivalry amongst exchanges and people to stop thinking CZ is entirely evil. The attack he has started is good for the industry as far as I'm concerned, others should attack him too and leak expose about him if they could do. With this, more insanity would come to the industry and they would seat rightly instead of playing pranks on people and their money.Also, stop defending any exchanges or any personality linked to them, you might be surprised by their internal nonsense in which CZ is not excluded. I am not defending him! In other words, I was just saying his actions are good for the underregulated industry where anyone could do as they like. Anyone could start it, CZ starting it as the largest in the industry is not a big deal.",

But Binance is not really better, and I cannot support CZ backstabbing, although it can bring good results for the ecosystem. But, let's just think, why didn't CZ do this kind of actions years ago? Instead of calling for transparency, he did odd (at best) actions many times in the \"history\" and Binance is faking its volumes just as badly as (or maybe even more than) the rest.I find also funny that the funds he's proposing to aid other companies are all in his shitcoins, not in bitcoin. So, sadly, all his actions are not for the common good, they're cold business calculations.",

Your explanation is good and your found facts are true as well, but you are looking at it in the direction of BSF's mismanagement of FTX. What he did is truly wrong, but have you ever thought that FTX would still be operational if CZ did not announce his withdrawal of the $2.1B? Indeed, it was that announcement that caused the panic withdrawal that eventually caused the collapse of the company.This is likened to a tree that is about to fall but was supported by another tree or a solid plank. It would surely easily fall if the support is removed. That was what happened. Though CZ is not part of the mismanagement, his action was powerful to an already stressed company.",

This is, good for the industry?Quote from: EarnOnVictor on December 04, 2022, 02:16:00 PMGoodness! You still went in search of what I wrote about two months ago? Well, you should not just take that out of context, I wrote the topic in search of a better exchange that offers Options trading better than Binance, so you have no valid point here. It doesn't matter, Binance is the only exchange you trade on and you're here praising Binance, that is called bias and that's how it is.",

If they do business honestly, without lying, no matter how big FUDS is, they will always stand firm and not collapse so quickly. CZ as a billion USD investor in FTX he has the right to doubt and need clarification to avoid affecting his interests. If we were in his position, we would do the same because no one can be silent once money is involved.",

Although business do fail if mismanaged. But in the alleged conspiracy I have always imagined CZ in the picture as the big fish and chief strategist.I consider him so in general terms, but in personal terms I consider him a smart guy who is always ahead of thr happenings in the crypto world. His empire is too large and he cannot be easily taken down. What makes him bleed will largely affect the whole crypto industry.",

And the more info comes out about the ways FTX operated, its more obvious that it was more their megalomania than anything else. CZ tweet and Coindesk article probably just speed things up but if they did a legit business and didn't mismanaged users fund, no FUD could touch them.Quote from: KingsDen on December 05, 2022, 09:23:06 PMI consider him so in general terms, but in personal terms I consider him a smart guy who is always ahead of thr happenings in the crypto world.

Problem is that even smart people (and its safe assume that CZ is a smart and capable guy) do stupid things that bring their companies down, not just in crypto but in general so no matter how big Binance is (and I often hear people saying for them that they are \"too big to fail\") they could still fail.",

Binance could still collapse like other companies, but it is highly unlikely that it will die now or in the near future. All are centralized exchanges, dead FTX or dead Lunc doesn't mean binance will die or ETH will die like Lunc, they are still completely independent entities from each other. Similar in the past, Mt.gox died but looking at the coinbase it still stands to this day.",
