He merely said that some sectors of the economy had sticky inflation that might require more rate hikes to control, and other sectors were already showing stability. His final statements were neither bullish nor bearish, and he concluded his speech with, \"We are going to react depending on the data we gather\". - Who's in control in this situation? The Federal Reserve or Inflation?",

      "body": "To bad he had to undecided about his take on the issue of rate hikes because market participants were expectant about his speech so it could help them gauge the future of US monetary bank's policy.Since July of 2022, most decisions on interest rates have been unanimous but I guess it's not going to be the same now as banks remain divided. IMO, it will be much of a load to introduce more stressors to the economy in form of rate hikes as the effects of the previous ones haven't fully materialized. Powell thinks he can corrall inflation to 2% target they set and here I am waiting for that to happen.",

The Federal Reserve or Inflation?Isn't the same thing!   Well, Inflation could be tackle with many possible solution if people wants to but federal reserve's problem will be solved if they want to.",

The Federal Reserve or Inflation?Seems that the spiral for USD is behind them given that inflation is on the downward trend. Though I'm also concerned that the Chinese economy seems to be on the brink of a recession, which would then cause the U.S. economy to enter a recession given it's fragile state already. If the federal reserve does raise interest rates, a recession just arrives sooner.",

The Federal Reserve or Inflation?I guess the market took Powell's statement and his lack of conviction as a bullish sign as the major indices went up after his speech. I would expect the opposite move as he confirmed more rate hikes will probably be needed, but I guess not sounding too hawkish can now be considered a pivot.I haven't been following market news recently so am clueless on the current moods.",

He also said that, \"they will asses their progress based on the totality of the data\". That could be translate into = \"We're not in control, Inflation is\".Plus truly, the Federal Reserve's original mandate is not \"dual\", it's just for price stability. Employment is merely secondary, and if \"the data\" shows that they need to raise rates higher, they would do it even if killing the labor market would get their job in controlling inflation done.",
