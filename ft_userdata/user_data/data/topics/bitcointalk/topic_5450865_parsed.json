      "body": "I am surprised that your team decided to start charging users now when the product is still in close beta, why not open it to users and let it be tested the result will speak for itself, the most worrying thing about this is that you want to charge 20% of the PNL weekly, that is too high for me if you compound the fee annually and also for big account letting 20% go will be an issue. I just hope you guys look into your go-to-market strategy and do not let your pricing push your clients away.",
