In the past, creating wealth or being able to feed was mainly dependent on how muscline you are, how much strength you have, how heavy or big you are because must of the jobs except few then needed you to be physically endowed, present and more.Just today some argument was going on or deliberation and in the midst of the discussion, the consensus was that it is easier to get money now than what it was 20 years plus ago and I think it is true. The reason is this time area, there are different opportunities and means to make money. Apart from the opportunities online that didn't exist before now, there are other domestic stuff that people do or resell to make money no matter how little they are. There are recycling of waste, there are domestic jobs, outdoor services etc.To online which is the game changer for the modern day people, people no longer depend on physical strength or muscle to life a good life, they don't wwork hard but working smart is the key thin. Youth who is still waiting for pay jobs or government job will have AI to contend with.",

Especially to kids that are working student, cause they are making their own money to provide all their needs which I really salute. From what I have observed, mostly of the freshly graduates or 20 years old people are having a lot of jobs, from that it seems they are just exploring the different of jobs that could suitable for them as well as paying good. Then the internet came where you can literally have access to everything like finding source of income. There's an influencer who started from nothing as I follow him. By just a simple viral video that he edited, boom he changed his life as there's a lot of collaboration as well the payment from the every views he makes. You could also add the advertisement which could literally have a lot of money. I'm just amazed that even kids could do things like that by doing their own thing.",

So, it's natural to make money from being productive. In any form, online, offline or drop shipping. What matters is figuring out the lacking services in a neighborhood, town, or city then implement it and watch profits flow. They're neighborhoods where people buy cooking gas in a distant place. Opening such a shop in that neighborhood would be solving a huge problem for the people there. Yet it doesn't stop the person from venturing into a government job. Generating money from different sources is encouraged for young people. Because most times the income we see online or even offline may fluctuate. A single business may not flourish at all times. Hence, having other little ways of generating money, can be a strategy to sustain us during the hard times in our main business. The mistake young people make is that they enter businesses they can't market. A lot of small businesses, yield huge profits. But, today, everyone wants to start big. Not knowing that making sales is the primary aim of business. Not having a nice office. There think one needs huge capital to be productive. Some home processed drinks still sell out in the market. What matters is having the product. How well organized the place is or how many workers you have is not crucial. Giving the quality product is what makes us more customers. Countries like India with big population, pay so much money to restaurants. Opening a food business in India is very profitable. Managers of such business make upto 1 million dollars, yet maintain a low key lifestyle. Agriculture is also nice, and requires few capitals to fit into the market and scale. On the side of the courses we studied in school. Graduates fail to offer what they've learnt in school as a service. And, also, not searching to get hired, they've concluded within them that they is no job out there. A lot of good courses; computer science, mathematics, business, agriculture etc are easy to monetize as a graduate. Only students who don't know much about their discipline would see no light in venturing into the course they've studied in school as business. Consistency is what makes us successful in this era. Hence whatever we do, it's important we stick to it. One day can level up or level down one's enterprise.",

All young people expectation after pass from college have expected dreaming as government job, their old age have been guarantee with salary payment from government but they don't try form comfortable position with higher payment income by build up their own business. Right now many young people still depend or get huge pressure from their parent, get job from government most dreaming by their parent and difficult for them how to explore their own ideas more productive than working in government. Its not only mistake from young people but also have pressure form their parent have get job from government although with small salary payment.",

The way in which skills are being prioritized is next to none. People prefer to work with skilled people more than they value some certificates, because they do not seem to believe the certificates are merited. But the case of skills can not be compromised. If you are not skilled, you are not skilled.",

But the lesson is not to be dependent to the aid of the government, since you're already a graduate, you can apply whenever you want or pursue more higher degree of studies. And I agree about acquiring skills because it's more than of the competition today and companies would hire someone who's got more skills and is also a graduate. That's a tough market for the freshmen but they shouldn't be discouraged because it's also part of survival skills that everyone has to learn.",

In countries like the US, Europe and the UK unemployment rates are at record lows - which considering turmoil happening like the war in Ukraine and prices pushing up because of it, might be surprising. This would suggest that we are living in one of the most prosperous times ever and the amount of open job vacancies also suggests that employers are still competing for staff. However graduates face a tougher time, because the inexperience can create a shock to the system when they enter the workforce - academia is much different to actual business challenges they may face.",

There was a lot of vacancies at work and low manpower to be able to do those jobs. You don’t need to be a degree holder before getting a job with the government in the past, with your secondary school certificate you can be employed and will continue school as you’re working. Also, if you check the population in the world in each country and now, you’ll see a significant increase and no much significant increase in work that’ll require more manpower to do it. In recent days, technology have taken over and with only one person operating a machine, he/she can do the work of upto 100 people with the help of the machine he operates and guides in doing that.

It depends on where you are, and your uniqueness as an undergraduate that has distinguished themselves. A very distinguished graduate will not struggle to get a job if they are able to add some extra qualifications to their very good certificate and are able to stay informed about job openings because information about job openings to apply with your qualification is also important and necessary when you are not being offered a job or sort after.
