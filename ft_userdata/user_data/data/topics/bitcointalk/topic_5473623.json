I almost forgot this happened as it was only 9900 at the time, and I didn't even include this in my complaint (see my case here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5473289.0). I asked my host what happened afterwards. They basically said it was a display issue on their part and the actual deposit bonus is capped at $100 lol. However, the wagering requirement is still 40x whatever you deposited up to 10k (so 400k maximum wager requirement). So if you deposited 10k, you would have been mistakenly led into wagering 400k to win 10k, only to have 9900 subtracted from your balance when you completed the wager. That is what happened to me and many others as well. I highly doubt BC.Game will do anything about this unfortunately. Best of luck to you.",

BC.Game's negative feedback was placed by me, it's there to warn the forum participants of the current situation the platform has. For OP... not sure why, I think he had a questionable history. A quick glance into their trust page gave a hint that his account changed hand and he immediately requested a loan?
