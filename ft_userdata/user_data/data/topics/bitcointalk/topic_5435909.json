  "content": "Fear is a natural emotion, and we all experience it every once in a while. However, buying bitcoin as a beginner and dealing with the volatility can be traumatizing due to the volatility anxiety, it startled newbies when they saw their bags decline; it makes one feel like they are losing everything for a first-timer, but that's just part of the holding process.Price volatility is what distinguishes bitcoin, the fear of it dropping to zero should never enter your thoughts, it has never occurred and is unlikely to occur. If you are new to bitcoin and have discovered that it has been driven down by price fluctuation or worry, here are some things you should do:(1) Detailed understanding of the nature of Bitcoin: It is important that you understand what bitcoin is all about; it is not about purchasing when the price is low and selling when the price is high. It's essential that you know the details of what you're buying and holding, you'll be amazed to discover that the more you learn about bitcoin, the less worried you'll be about price volatility.(2) Always ignore the FUD: Bitcoin has been around and would continue to stay for people who believe in it, don't listen to fake rumors, bitcoin says you shouldn't trust anyone but verify it yourself.(3) Avoid investing money that you badly need: In order to avoid worrying about the price later in the day, you should never borrow money or use emergency funds to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a fast get rich fast on the internet investment.(4) Take a break and take care of your health: Not everything in life should be bitcoin, therefore check on yourself, make an appointment with your health instructor, listen to the advice, and spend more time with your loved ones and family, your bitcoin will never run out as long as you keep them secure.(5) Stay informed: There are other reliable sources that generate great material on bitcoin, that may also assist you when you need solid information about bitcoin. If in doubt, check such platforms and learn more about bitcoin.(6) Stay positive: Your goal should be what motivates you to acquire bitcoin from the start of your journey, don't change your goals because you're afraid bitcoin will fall to zero, your goal should constantly ring in your brain; it will keep you stronger and better as you progress.There are could be more information that may help you break the bond of fear as a bitcoin holder but these points are valid and will help you as a bitcoin holder who is new to bitcoin, it will help you fight that fear and the things that will discourage you from BITCOIN.",

Once you know what you're doing and have a few months or years of practical experience then investing what you can afford makes more sense (but not investing what you're going to need soon).People new to bitcoin might also do well by discovering hodl. It can make you miss selling at the ath but it's ultimately quite a bit safer (but don't hodl for too long without checking back and keep an understanding of how to send transactions).",

OP has made a great list that will help not only newbies but all the members in the forum especially those who keep repeating the same mistakes again. There can be no fears and losses in bitcoin if we just stick to the basics, never invest what you can afford to lose and always avoid the FUDs. The market may be uncertain most of the time but if we know how to deal with it, we will likely to benefit in the future. Just stay patient and always manage to learn every single day by having DYOR.",

Some people leave their coins on web wallet and they say it's secure since they've back up the seeds and they've hold for 5 years without any problem.Some people leave their coins on hardware wallet and they say it's secure since hardware wallet is offline and there's no way virus or keylogger can attack cold storage.But they just not realize if centralized exchange and web wallet are have low security, it will different if they're a FTX holder or their device infected with virus.

The reason why a lot of us here still expecting that bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme and that they maximize their bitcoin accumulation when the price is on top. Because of this, these people end up having bitcoin anxiety because they never see the negative side of bitcoin and they were never completely informed in the first place about bitcoins high volatility.",
