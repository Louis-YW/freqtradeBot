The last hash in the chain is: 4bd4b23738b0450122f8b73983c921835d3903b7e04398281c8943b3e93a8186Every game maps to a hash in the chain: The 10,000,000th element of the chain is the hash of game #1 and the first element in the chain is the hash of game #10,000,000. To verify that a hash belongs to a game #n, simply hash it n times and compare the result with the terminating hash.To calculate a game's result from its hash:Code:const gameHash = hashChain.pop()const hmac = createHmac('sha256', gameHash);// blockHash is the hash of bitcoin block 746,700hmac.update(blockHash);const hex = hmac.digest('hex').substr(0, 8);const int = parseInt(hex, 16);// 0.01 will result in 1% house edge with a lowest crashpoint of 1const crashpoint = Math.max(1, (2  32 / (int + 1)) * (1 - 0.01))blockHash used is Bitcoin block 746,700 which has not been mined at time of posting. Basically we are using the hash of a future bitcoin block as a client seed so players can be certain that we did not pick one in the house's favor.",

The population counter can be faked. If you've ever played online MMO games many server providers fake the counters by adding a fixed number of bots or simply faking the code so that the server doesn't show as empty on the list. Many people filter out empty servers because they don't want to waste time on playing alone and they don't know if a server will nor repopulate so they don't set like 50+ people or something, just set the rules to >1. Faking the counter makes the site look popular, but in reality you're playing alone. You see 105 players but there's just 5.Especially the high number of 100 online for a completely new casino makes it look fishy.THe site loads but it's very simple and everything is in Chinese",

I wonder how many brave ones will use this casino?OP you should put English as the default language in your casino, I particularly had a lot of difficulties to see things on your sitealso put TOS and FAQYour casino is very similar to stake.com, it seems to me that you didn't have much time to create something different",

Yes, thank you, I didn't pay attention to it. Something tells me that these are still not real online players, the deposit is only available in USDT and the bets are usually more than $1000 and reach up to $100,000, it seems to me that these are most likely bots to attract potential users, maybe I'm wrong.",

Because I believe that if the platform is having problem it is off the designer of the side or the management of the site to find the error and correct it with immediate effect. I believe that this experience you have gotten to the side you have to pm them. But I know too well not with your explanation based on what you and analyze during the visitation of their site, they have seen it  been the management and they are supposed to fix they complain of client to avoid bad record and reputation of the platform",
