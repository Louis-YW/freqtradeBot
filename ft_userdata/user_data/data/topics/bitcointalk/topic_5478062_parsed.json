      "body": "This post is a very lovely one if one looks into it insightfully, but you would have attracted more responses if you created it better than this. Still, I got the gist so well, and as an experienced trader, I know that as simple as this warning/advice is, it's the reason why most traders are losing. Only that these traders will never locate the issue in their trading and will continue to find other means to change the narrative, even as the fault still stands. Let me tell you, as difficult as making a 100% successful trade could sound, it's possible for me to achieve that once in a while, and I have noticed this since a few years ago judging by my current standing in the market trading.But for the fact that I love to take more unreasonable risks and always try to enter every possible trade, which puts my result to the limits of about 85-90% winning nowadays. You can now see why I appreciate this post so much even as it looks scattered. Traders who refine their trading signals and find no fault whatsoever in it before opening a position will always get to be more accurate than the traders who do otherwise.However, I would like it if you could still reconstruct this post better so that it will be more attractive to your readers than the way you did it. Also, expect a merit from me if done.",

When you wake up, your position can be done, done with a liquidation.I know many traders say I am sure about the market, I analyzed many things and I don't feel need to use stop loss order for my position. You know, such confident traders will have loss in this volatile market. Because you will not be able to be correct 100 times, 100%.Use stop loss order.Use stop limit order.One of best weapon in tradingStop limit order",

Traders should not be greedy. As traders is winning during the day, he may be greedy and wants to win more. But at the end, he may find himself losing overall before the day is over. Also if a trader is losing, they should have a limit to their loss, once the limit is exceeded, they should stop trading. Losing is when traders are vulnerable to lose more.Sometimes, a trader can be sure of the market, enter the market and the market will go in the opposite direction against the position opened by the trader. It is good for traders to know that they should not trade with the money that they can not afford to lose.",

Benefits are for the trader's that have strong foundation in the system, its not always consider easy path to withstand the pressure coming. A trader's port folio determines how strong or weak a trader can become in the system. We make decisions which will later haunt us in this present day or in the future.

But buying btc and leave it to your potfolio will totally make life easy for you by removing your mind from fear of loss. Because fear of loss is the root cause of people do sell off there coin for no good reason. While some choose trading because of quick money.

We know that trading can provide profits and losses, the more we use emotions in trading, the more unstable each decision in trading will be and the logic of analysis will be ignored.More like being not sure, because there is no way to accurately predict our trades. It does not mean though that we will not trade. Of course we will still do it, because how do we know if our trades are going to be successful or not? And how can we earn a profit if we won't take a risk?Any outcome can trigger our emotions. If we lose, we are going to feel sad but if we are profiting, we are going to feel happy. I see nothing wrong with that but as long as we can snap out immediately because over feeling it can lead to dangers. Long-term investment might have advantages but it also have disadvantages, which can still trigger our emotions.",

If you are ready to do it then you have to be 100% sure, if there is the slightest doubt then you can always have an exit strategy right at that point. If we miss doing this then things can go south and this happened with me when I bought one of the alt blindly. The project had amazing marketing geeks, they published it via affiliate marketing and social media accounts. When I looked at it from top to bottom it seemed just fine. However, when it came to the point when I wanted to invest my money in it I had some doubts, or you can say that they started rolling at that exact movement somehow. Maybe call it subconscious analysis that made me go away from it and not invest but somehow I did not triple-check the facts and invested anyways. This made me a lot of losses via that investment. Since then, the goal is to keep myself away from the trading on daily basis. Only invest when something excellent and of the Bitcoin quality comes out.",
