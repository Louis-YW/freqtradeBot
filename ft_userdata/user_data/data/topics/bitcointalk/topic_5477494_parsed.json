  "content": "Do you believe the NBA, the NFL and others should be treated like financial markets?For example, a line of 33, 0-0 at halftime, o/u 16.5 - goes 36 pts in the 2nd half for the full game.A line of 40.5, 0-0 at halftime, o/u 17.5 - goes under for the full game 3-0.Both examples are from yesterday.Reasonably speaking, the 33 game should have gone under, and the 40 game should have gone over, but the oddsmakers twist the lines and thus if you can read that - you can profit from it.What do you think?
