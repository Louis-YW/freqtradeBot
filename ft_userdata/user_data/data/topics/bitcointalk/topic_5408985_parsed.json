You that asked the question honestly know the best practice but I am surprised you still put up the question. Well, since there is a question there will be an answer. The former is a better practice or approach than the later.My concern is where you said of taking alot of time. You must not take alot of time. Too much delay is dangerous for a project. Every project should have an estimated project duration and it is based on the stipulated time that the team members will work towards. In this industry, it is all about timing and trend, when you waste alot of time before releasing your project, the time it was supposed to get the required hype might pass and your project will struggle and eventually die off.",

I personally think that a slight delay was not a problem as long as the project developers can deliver what they have written in their roadmap. The thing might be different if they were giving a very long delay. that may make investors feel bad with it. You must also know that if that was also a red flag to the project caused by the dev was not competence to continue its development.",

It was best to put everything is well-prepared and must be working. In fact, there is no reason why these new projects have to be in hurry aside from their evil intention (scam). If we are going to invest be sure that the project is already finished, it was an ideal and a big factor to consider as this will be the basis that this project will become successful. That is why research must be done before investing, a wrong choice of project to invest ended up nothing but losses.",

Being in a hurry will not make sense, you will just experience a lot of problem along the way so its better to take this slowly but surely. Always follow the roadmap because this is the basis of the investors and if they see that you are not following your own timeline with a lot of delay and changes, you can expect to lose a lot of investors. Making a good project will always take time and will take a lot of effort, you should avoid getting in a hurry especially in entering in cryptomarket.",

It feels better when the project publishes her road map and sticks to it. The road map was designed and published by the project without interference from the community. The project should consider every modality and strategy before coming out with a road map.It's careless for them to go back on their word after telling the community about the plans and duration of execution. It only shows that the team are disorganized and lack the necessary skills to get this done properly and timely.",

I think you just need to sort it out every time you see new projects and their roadmaps, because not all of those new projects will work according to their roadmap. So you still need to research and verify every new project that appears at this time, because without stronger support for new projects now, they will find it difficult to develop as many people or employers expect.",

It's not easy to create a platform it takes money and skills and determination of the people behind the project, for me, it doesn't matter if they go fast or slow as long as they are transparent and do not make up a lot of promises and create useless hype on their project, I am ok on a steady growth making sure that they are on target and they fulfill on their promises, some projects are tagged because of dishonesty on their whitepaper and their capability, once you feel that they are being dishonest it's time to leave this kind of project.",

Unpredictable details can sometimes slow down large projects. The important thing is whether the team is really working on the problems. If the team is working, the roadmap will be completed sooner or later.The development team, marketing team and very important is the management team. Only the management can make a schedule on the projects progress and push the development team to make things faster according to the requirement. Marketing team on the other side needs to work, so that people get to know about that particular project even before the launch. Combined effort is much required.",

It is never healthy to rush things up.  What is the most important in a newly created project is the timing.  Of course, the project should follow the roadmap and it is always a good sign if the roadmap is delivered before the promised date.  There is a huge difference between rushing and delivering early.  And delayed delivery of the road map is a red flag that the development team isn't up for the task.",

A lot are delaying their tasks because of insufficient funds or lack of it. So if they can't raise their targets, high likely that their planned activities will be delayed. This is why if the projects wants a continuous implementation of their roadmap, they need to secure private funding so it won't deter their activities.",

It's healthy if the project have their own plans on how to sustain the business in long term, there's no rush if you are building a great project because it always take time. Have you seen the rushed projects? Look at them now they are no where to be find. Always follow the roadmap, its very important because that is your target date and if  you are able to meet those timeline, for sure the investors will trust the project more. Also, its better to update the roadmap from time to time, because as I can see most of the old projects now failed to update their roadmap, and it looks like they also forget to work with the updates on their platform which is not good at all.",

Rushing things up is never a good idea especially when we consider the nature of cryptocurrencies, a single mistake can be more than enough for hackers to take advantage of the situation and steal millions of dollars, and we have examples of this almost every week, so without a doubt it is better for the developers of new coins to take their time when developing their coins and even more importantly to not impose themselves milestones they will not be able to achieve, because when they fail to follow their roadmap and fall behind it their investors will begin to lose confidence in them.",
