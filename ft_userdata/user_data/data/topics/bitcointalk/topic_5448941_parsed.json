Sample if you touch something on public places this would lead to identity theft and can be use to recover your wallet using the fingerprint that they stole from public places.Biometrics is only good as your extra security layer for your wallet and your device.",

Maybe your identical twin can use their face and restore your wallet.That's not what he/she meant (AFAIK) because we use our fingerprints in many devices like you may have set a fingerprint lock on your smartphone, or any IoT (internet of things) in your home which has a feature of fingerprint, and once you have set your fingerprints on any of these unsecured devices the metadata of your prints can easily be extracted once your any containing device compromised and can be used to unlock your wallets plus to make transactions too. These types of attacks are mostly used to extract data through normal IoT devices such as fingerprint speaker systems, light systems home door locks, and those smartphones which has less secure OS built in. So, i think linking your biometric data to decentralized platforms is not wise even due to identity concerns. Because you could easily be identified once you used such a feature. Secondly, even if you have a twin but the metadata/details of your fingerprints will be different, and for faces, low-quality fingerprints can easily be unlocked if you even bring a photo of your face in front of a camera. But not with advance sensors.",

Proposing a solution that has an obviously weaker security does not solve this problem, it even creates more loopholes and ways for more people to lose their private keys. Always have a backup in a different location is like the best way to avoid losing your private key, or if you are afraid your may lose your seed phrase if it is written on paper, you can engrave it on a steel. Weaker and more convenient solutions create more problems and losses, it is the same mistake as keeping your funds in a centralized exchange because you are afraid of self custody.",

Biometric authentication methods rely on unique physical characteristics of an individual, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify their identity. However, these physical characteristics can potentially be replicated or spoofed using various methods, such as fake fingerprints or deepfakes. There is also the risk of false positives or false negatives, where the biometric data is incorrectly recognized or not recognized at all, leading to potential authentication errors.",

But in real life cases, there are many challenges and practical cases that need to be addressed in order for it to effective. From the example you gave, you said - if your wallet address was generated using your face ID, then you lose your keys and you can recover those keys through the face ID again. What if there are tiny variations due to poor lighting or changes in look when you try to retrieve those keys using your face ID? If this happens, it could result in false positives or false negatives, which would subsequently result in inaccurate identity verification or access denial.The gathering and storing of biometric data is another aspect of this idea that is a challenge or that worries me. In order to protect user privacy and security, compliance with a number of legal and regulatory requirements that are specific to each country's biometric data collection and storage practices is necessary.",

No!Can it be an optional feature for those that want it? Yes (I would never use it, but why should I tell others what to do!?)I prefer changes that make the network better and stronger. I know you might think that introducing a new recovery method (biometrics) is a step in that direction, but it isn't. Only those who have the keys can spend the coins. It's as simple as that. The fact that lost keys mean unspendable coins is proof that everything works as described and that it is safe. If you introduce a new system that makes unspendable coinn spendable again, you aren't making Bitcoin more secure. You are giving anyone with your fingerprint and other biometric data the keys to your coins. And that's easier to obtain than a seed that is written down on paper or engraved in metal and stored securely.",

Such a thing isn't possible because it would generate absolutely new address and seed every time and it would need absolutely correct 3D model. I think one thing that you might be able to do is to save your keys somewhere and unlock access to these keys with your biometrics.But that's not reliable. Nor the fingerprint is reliable because there is a chance that you get scar on your finger and it may be deep enough to change your fingerprint.My advice is to just follow what has been proven and tested since its existence.",

For example, if my wallet address was generated using my fingerprint, then I lose my keys and I can recover those keys through the fingerprint again.I don't know if anyone already solved this.Since I read this post, this idea started to float in my mind but finally I realized that what you say is a terrible idea. The original post was about generating wallet address by using your face ID and being able to recover it again by using your face. I would say that that's impossible: In order to generate wallet address and recover anytime with your face, I assume you mean that the wallet address and keys should always be the same because the condition is always the face. But if things get so exclusive, then logically I think every next wallet generated by the face can be absolutely unique because mood, mimics, the time you sleep, how tired, rested you are, what happened around you, The scar, the pimple, what you think about right now, absolutely everything affects your facial gestures at the same time. I can't imagine one can be able to create an address on Bitcoincore and recover his wallet without any backup by looking at camera. That's why seed phrases are each unique to the wallet that created it. If you type 0 instead of O, you are not gonna get your wallet back. I hope you've got a point.While it may be possible to create an unique bitcoin address via fingerprint because your fingerprint itself is an unique, still you have to keep in mind that you may damage your finger so much that fingerprint may change and if someone knows that you have a lot of bitcoin and wants to steal your money or just revenge, they may cut your finger or damage it. And you have to keep in mind that Hackers can use a fingerprint photo to create a synthetic print.",
