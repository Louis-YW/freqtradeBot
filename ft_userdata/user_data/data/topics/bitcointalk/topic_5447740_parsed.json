  "content": "What happened:: Rollbit scammed me for $255, banned my account and claims I'm an abuserScammers Profile Link:  Rollbit.com Reference Link: Amount Scammed:  255Payment Method:  LTC, USDT Proof of Payment:  https://imgur.com/a/QMMU9uV PM/Chat Logs:  https://imgur.com/a/4gcXPWt Additional Notes:    I registered on April 4, immediately found out about rollbit, on bitcointalk, made a deposit with litecoin and started playing, bought two bonuses, in a cube where I received 500x and a dog house, after I put 98 usdt on the withdrawal, there was an even amount of $ 400 on the balance, on the next day (today) I go to live nba, make one bet (I watched this match) on the total quarter, the bet wins, I withdraw 400 dollars, they approved this withdrawal, after I put a withdrawal of 255 dollars, and they give me a manual check where, after checking, they tell me that I am a casino abuser. Lol, just funny, because of one bet? recognize me as a scammer and an abuser? Well, it's just a laugh. https://imgur.com/a/pEPqevp (screenshot of a casino game). Unfortunately, there is no screenshot of my NBA bet, and no new output screenshots either because they blocked my account. I also wrote to them in a chat in the discord where they immediately banned me (apparently it is not profitable for them to let their players know who they really are). I logged in from another discord account, and look how they communicate... https://imgur.com/a/qxfujUZ . They sit, laugh at me, say that I'm a scammer and just giggle, they clearly don't care about everything that happens, is it possible to communicate like that from the administration? 0 respect and no etiquette for site admins.  P.S I ask the community to help solve my issue, rollbit really banned me for no reason.",

I was good-natured with them when they wrote me to wait for the withdrawal of funds, but is it worth blocking the player's funds for his \"bad talk\"?I understand that being denied withdrawal without knowing the reason can be frustrating but from what I have seen it is most likely a protocol for casinos to ban gamblers who are spamming, rude, and cussing from chat and their other social platform. also, from what I have seen from the chat you shared, your account wasn't banned because you are bad talking their support.",
