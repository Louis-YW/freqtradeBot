  "content": "Hello people, I am interested in the significant differences that you have found between these two applications.I have googled it, but the best audience to answer are the people in this forum.1. I have a multisig vault, which I would like to be able to \"monitor\" using the cosigners xpubs.2. I have a cold storage wallet, which I would also like to monitor as \"watch-only\"3. I have a hot wallet, created using BlueWallet.I know I can do all 3 in both of them. But are there differences in features etc, that you have spotted?Example: I think, and I may be mistaken, that Electrum doesn't use BIP39 seed phrases, am I wrong?",

Sparrow also allows you to Whirlpool directly from your wallet, as well as supporting other privacy improvements such as PayNyms and Stonewall transactions, but this is probably irrelevant if you are just going to use it as a watch only wallet.",

Is it better (and for what reason), to run Electrum Server upon your node, instead of connecting Sparrow to your node?

In both cases, all your data will come from your own node rather than that of a third party, and so your privacy will be maintained.

It is more than capable of doing all of those, and you will maintain your privacy since it will only sync via your own node.Whirlpool is a coinjoin implementation, run by Samourai, which is accessible via Sparrow. You can read more about it here: https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html. Essentially, you pay a small fee and then coordinate with other users to create transactions which send the same amount of bitcoin you put in back to you, but in a way which obfuscates which bitcoin actually belong to you. If you are interested in anonymizing your bitcoin so entities such as centralized exchanges and blockchain analysis companies cannot trace it, then you could look in to this. If you do plan to use Whirlpool, make sure you also connect to the coordinator via Tor (explained in the link I just shared).",

You can usually export it as some form of raw text, save it to a file, generate a QR code, etc. Then you can send that partially signed transaction to another destination electronically, or put it on a USB drive, SD card, your phone, etc., and carry it with you.

But, the obvious question here is: what happens if I have signed a transaction with a fee of let's say 20sat/vB, but when I go to the other cosigner the fee is too low? Should I wait? Should I initiate another transaction and sign it with a higher fee using the cosigner where I am and then travel back to the other cosigner? This question also applies to timelocked transactions, and I think the answers are obvious, but somewhat inconvenient. Don't you think?",
