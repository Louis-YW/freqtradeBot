  "content": "Recently I have been trying to gain knowledge from other locals as I believe that some of the local boards do carry's some useful information which one would like want to interact with people around such local board but since the person ( me or any) are not a native of such local board is it permitted to reply post over there using at least page translator or a google translator to communicate in such board.Although this question may looks very silly but it's good to have a general knowledge of people around before either posting or before using one of the tools to get involved with their discussion over their board. Like for example our NLB ( Nigerian Local Board) since is pidgin anyone who is good at speaking pidgin can easily gets involved with our most the discussion, this doesn't mean such person will be penalized or their post got reported to mode for involving in discussion.I feels like to asked as I may want to also get some locals news abroad ( within other local boards) by trying to use a translator to read their contents. Please is there any rules that governs this aspect?If there are any then I will back off from going into other board to read their news, actually had the feels the interact in some board but I am afraid if anything would happened to me. Please I need answers",

      "body": "This local board kind of thing can be a little confusing but simple. Our local board happens to have one of the most common and simple rules from other local boards, as anyone who can’t write in Nigerian pidgin can reply to posts in general English, and it's acceptable there. But in most local boards, it's mainly meant for locals from that region; that's why their local language is what's only needed to be used on that local board. If you happen to go through most of those local board rules, you will realise that the use of Google translocation is highly discouraged as it will encourage broken communication, and the intrusion of asiders into local boards and merit farmers can also use it to farm merit from some local boards that are generous in giving out merit. If you happen to use google translator and read through some interesting topics on any local board I guess it could be of good option if you can create a thread regarding that topic if it's a good topic of interest and ask your questions their referencing original post so that people from the local board can give you the attention you need and the reply you need with English language and save you the stress of translating to understand.",

      "body": "Learning about new things does not necessarily mean you must reply, unless if you are asking a specific question. I think there is no specific rule prohibiting anyone from posting in any local board, so long as they use the common language there.About using translators like Google translator, I would like to let you know that they are not that perfect and a native of that specific language will easily know if you are using a translator to reply or not and it sort of makes the discussion quite hard to follow up. I think you have seen some folks try to translate their local language to English in these English boards using Google translator. Sometimes it's so hard to grasp what they are tying to put across. I bet that the same thing the locals will feel if you try posting in their local boards using google translator.",

Just as a popular saying that's says with our local pidgin \" person wey dey asked questions no dey miss road\" meaning someone who always asking questions doesn't miss their way about in any place they found themselves, I guess you people understands it.Thank you all",

First of all, you can simply know several languages which makes it possible for you to communicate with different language ground in local boards. Secondly, it often happens that a language covers much more than one national group. You can communicate in German as a German, Austrian or Swiss. Also, not only Russians write in the Russian local board, but also many representatives of the countries of the former Soviet block.",

But if you'll decide to start communicating in many topics on a local language board with a help of an online translator on a regular base it will likely be considered as spamming.

Despite no business running with those locals most times it's good to diversify in knowledge knowing what other happening going on in must of the countries, what they are facing and what is the current news around. But still I think my question has been answered above and I want to use this medium to lock this thread to avoid further spamming this thread as most of the post are all repeated posts and replies.",
