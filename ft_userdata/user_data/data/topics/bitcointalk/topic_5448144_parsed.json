  "content": "photo credit: cnet.comAm no expert in this quantum computing field, but from my research the experts say these are not the fastest computers out there but when it comes to structured data and the alike they are king.With the capabilities of the quantum computer, it's believed it could break the internet, and bitcoin being a digital currency this makes these computers direct threats.Just looking at some of the headlines around this topic, you can tell that quantum computers are a threat to our digital wellbeing just look at the interesting headlines I  found around the Internet;\"Chinese researchers claim to find way to break encryption using quantum computers\"\"Chinese scientists propose a new way to break encryption, changing the world of security\"\"Are quantum computers about to break online privacy\"\"Quantum computers could Crack today's encrypted messages. That's a problem\"With these headlines and the alike, are Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies safe with Quantum computers just around the corner ??Is regulation the answer to protect our data from quantum computing or maybe it's time to roll out quantum safe encryption for crypto to survive this era that's coming ?",

Even allowing for a whole day, this figure only drops to 13 million qubits. This is reassuring news for bitcoin owners because current machines have only a tiny fraction of this – IBM’s record-breaking superconducting quantum computer has only 127 qubits, so devices would need to become a million times larger to threaten the cryptocurrency, something Webber says is unlikely to happen for a decade. \"Quantum computers are a million times too small to hack bitcoin\"There are probably hundreds of topics on this forum where this question is asked - and I think that quantum computers will hack Bitcoin sooner than people will learn to use search engines, unfortunately.",

Yes, this is the logic, in my opinion, time machine is the same as quantum computer, both can change the world if happen, but as I know, more increase technology, the more increase the security, I really sure, there will be powerful security to avoid that growth.",
