      "body": "I never heard about Barclays it seems it's a bank? Their terms about buying crypto with Barclays seem fine.Based on a bit of research Barclays can be charged back or reverse the transaction but since you use monese according to them the transaction cannot be a chargeback or reverse the transaction.",

      "body": "From their help article, it appears they can reverse mistakenly sent transactions. Quote from: https://support.monese.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360017330360-What-happens-if-I-make-a-payment-to-the-wrong-person-or-wrong-account-If you sent money to the wrong account details and you don't know the recipient, you should first wait 7 days to see if the money bounces back automatically into your account. This will happen if the wrong account details don't exist with any bank or financial institution, meaning your money wasn’t received by anyone.If your money hasn’t returned automatically within 7 days, contact our Customer Support team who can help to recover the money for you in the bank recall process.It’s worth noting that the bank recall process can take up to 120 days and we can't guarantee a successful outcome.In localbitcoins, I see monese is tagged as \"medium risk\" which by their definition means \"The payment is reversible and LocalBitcoins receive the occasional report of fraud.\", see: https://localbitcoins.com/guides/how-to-sell-bitcoins-online#toc4. Occasional fraud could mean the chargeback wasn't easy to achieve as I imagine users still have to go thru monese's protocols hence occasional or maybe there just aren't many people using them on their platform.Can we know which exchange platform did you use and did you check if your buyer's account has a great reputation?",

      "body": "Thanks for the reply. I’m using localcoinswap.com. I set up sale as bank transfer but it shows as a ‘Credit Transaction’. I have looked back at other payments I have received when I was on LBC and they are also labelled the same. I’m thinking this might be ok?The seller has now raised a dispute on localcoinswap. Not sure what to do tbh but I’m pretty sure it’s ok and seller has good FB and has transported FB from LBC Cheers",

Thankfully, you only did a small amount for this trade.Figured I should mention but there's a bitcoin focused subreddit for UK people (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinUK), you can try to ask your local people for their personal experiences on mentioned payment method.",

Seems not tbh, i know a few people who have got caught via Paypal though!!EDIT -The seller has also stated that he can use Starling Bank for bank transfers in the future, not sure if that's any better?

      "body": "Yep, LBC and now Pax have gone.Most i know are waiting on requests to join Noones due to massive demand, not one trader from the previous has joined/received email.Regarding 'valid transaction proof', me and the purchaser agreed that the description i received did not make sense, i had numerous screenshots of his chats with Monese.I still do not know if they operate as a normal bank regarding bank transfers, if they do then it's not a problem....When i traded on LBC and Pax and selected Bank Transfer it would eliminate Monese from the search results?Why??",
