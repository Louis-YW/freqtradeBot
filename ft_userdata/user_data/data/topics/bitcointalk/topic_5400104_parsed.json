There are hardware wallet that use secure chip, secure chip can be close source but it will be hard for anyone that steal your hardware wallet to know the seed phrase.Some wallets use MCU, they can be open source like Trezor but physical attack can make the attacker to know the hardware wallet seed phrase, this is why it is good to use passphrase with this type of wallet. If the passphrase is lost, the wallet is gone as bad as if the seed phrase is lost.Some wallets use both secure chip and MCU, it is will be hard to know the seed phrase with the physical attack on this type of wallet.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on May 25, 2022, 09:47:07 AMIs it possible in cryptocurrency to use something, as you write, without worries?Above, you were given answers that would be no different from using any wallet.

Historically, I recall cases of Ledger devices not being able to work with Ledger Live because they had skipped a bunch of prior upgrades (see this thread for example), although not upgrading has allegedly been a benefit in some specific cases).-   Hardware wallets may break, even if you handle them with care. Buttons and screens are sensitive and may degrade or simply break. Your real fallback guarantee is your very well hidden seed mnemonic.-   Revise the addresses & other info used in TXs, contrasting what you see on the hardware wallet’s screen with your pc/laptop/phone. It may seem a bit of a pain, but that’s what the feature is for.",

Perhaps one of its drawbacks is that it does not give you false security that your coins are safe, so always DYOR.Make sure that you have purchased a device directly from the company without intermediaries, that the device is locked, you have updated firmware, and that you do not use old seeds before.After that, make sure that your computer does not contain viruses, and do not download or click on random links.",

I don't know what exact model of hardware wallet you purchased, but they can all have disadvantages, some more than others.I would never buy closed source hardware wallets like ledger or safepal, and I would be very careful purchasing anything online with your real information like name and address, if you don't want your data leaked.Hardware wallets are in principle safer than hot wallets, but there is extra complexity with address and transaction confirmation, and some wallets can have flaws with this.My suggestion is to use hardware wallets with passphrases for better safety, and never enter your seed words on any online website.",

I do not think you can even use Coinomi to connect to any hardware wallet, if you connect your hardware wallet with Electrum, you can only use it for bitcoin, you will need to connect it to individual wallet apps to use it with the coin it support. But hardware wallet can have its own app which you will be able to connect more coins of it supports multiple cryptocurrencies, like Trezor Suite and Ledger Live. But if talking about bitcoin, I will recommend using Electrum wallet.",

Congratulations on your purchase. Now you have got rid of some problems, but have found completely new ones.  There is nothing universal in the world and therefore, hardware wallets allow you to protect your funds in one direction, but create vulnerabilities in another. Not necessarily directly affecting your money, but for example, personal data, which many will undoubtedly not like.It is not so easy to briefly describe all the features and disadvantages of hardware wallets. It will be better if you take the time to read the topics and discussions in the dedicated section -   Hardware wallets It will be better for you if you become familiar with the weak points of your device and take the necessary actions to minimize the impact.I would be curious to know which model of hardware wallet and from which manufacturer did you purchase?",

Owning a hardware wallet doesn't make you exempted from having the malware on your PC or laptop. This is a very common attack to everyone, newbies and not. So be always wise whenever you're about to send as you use that hardware wallet, check the address that you're about to send the funds for. Because if you're too confident and you haven't noticed that there's a malware on your PC.As you copy and paste the address, it will be automatically changed to the hackers address. It had happened to many and they're not aware of it so please be mindful about that. Always check the characters of the address for several times before pressing that send button.",

Exactly, every action on the device itself (HW) must be approved by the owner by pressing a button, and this includes checking the coin address, the amount we send in the transaction and fees, and the final confirmation that we want to make the transaction. With this, we can prevent the clipboard malware from replacing the destination address and thus stealing the amount we want to send.However, the biggest benefit of the hardware wallet is that it generates a backup (seed) in a secure offline environment and that this seed is not displayed anywhere else except on our device (HW) only once when the device is initialized.The real problem is in the way users keep/save that seed, which is often the cause of the so-called hacking of hardware wallets. As I have already written several times, the weakest link in all this is the user himself.",
