With the current price and a long time up and down, just do a timely purchase according to your budget.

Doesn't need to be at set intervals (e.g. monthly) but you can buy it at a set price say at every $5k decrements or less. Though I guess most would prefer buying at idk $30k then selling at $20k  I myself never look at the market after I invest since I do long term and if I look at the market for just an instant, my hands might go weak and start selling. It's why I bought all I wanted when it dumped down to $20k and I'm probably just gonna wait a few years before thinking of anything related to trading it back.",

Investing in bitcoin requires long patience, it's not just all about being patient but also wise. Because there will be times that your patience can be gone when you can't take it anymore watching the market plummet a lot. But being wise, you know where the market is heading, you have the vision of how what it's going to look like in the future and that's why you're moving forward in seeing that and won't be the one to sell in panic.",

So if they have to do this in bear market, even at bottom of bear market, it means they will have to sell $10000 initial money to get $5000 or $1000 because of bear market effects.Crypto market is volatile, more than usual and more risky than usual so let's prepare a bit of reserved money for expenses. Don't get in 100% in either bull or bear market because you won't control how your job will be in next few months as well as how the market will be in near or far future.",

Yes, but I am not certain if it will continue.2010-2012 volatility: 99x2012-2016 volatility: 33xPrevious all-time-high before 2020 halving, was 19600Low was 2800 or so2016-2020 volatility: 7Presently all-time-high is still $68900Low is still $17500Present volatility: 4Maybe the present volatility can increase, but normally the volatility of bitcoin since it was created was decreasing and getting to 7 and above as it was before may not become possible again.Even If bitcoin decreases, I do not think it can decrease below $14000 or $15000.Quote from: VRExpress on August 01, 2022, 02:20:13 PMremember it was because of CoViD that's why BTC plummeted to 3700$You meant 2017? Nothing called COVID-19 in 2017, but you are referring to bear market of March 2020 that got bitcoin to $3800. I do not believe COVID-19 caused that, but bitcoin price increase also during COVID-19.",

I also think that some new investors will start to buy when they see the prices rising. But, for those that are new to the investing game, they typically don't know about how these types of things work and are simply reacting to others' buying and selling behavior. The reason for this is usually that newbie investors are feeling anxious because others are making money from an investment's price movement while they are not. Therefore, they want to jump on the bandwagon and realize a profit.",

Sadly, it's true. I've noticed it too. That's a bad strategy according to what I learnt in my formative year going into trading. It's called chasing price. My question is why do investors do that? Is it because they don't have faith in what they're buying or what? This attitude cuts across all cryptos. It's not only a Bitcoin thing. For instant example, there were several altcoins that looked promising last year and prices were very high and many investors wished they had bought in while they were very cheap or that price could dip. Today, most of those altcoins have crashed beyond recognition but people still aren't rushing to buy them. They're waiting for a rally to kick in and then they go chasing it. For me, that isn't my method. I like to get in before the rush.",

It is not only the fear of missing out that is their problem, the inability to learn or understand what they are investing in also affects them, if they can take out some of their time to research, they will know the correct strategy that is best for them and they'll also understand that there is more possible returns if they invest in bitcoin for longer periods, rather than periodical fomo'ed buying and fud selling.It goes without saying that with altcoins it is a totally different game there, that may be the best way to invest in altcoins, they are not like bitcoin, many of them that have crashed are not going to rally again, so why should people buy them, altcoin buyers need to be extra careful before buying, for bitcoin buyers you know a plunge is a short-lived thing.",

I believe that cryptocurrency downfall is when real investors do want to invest into cryptocurrency.so through your suggestion, i don't think Bitcoin price can fall to the extent of getting to ten thousand dollars (10k).

The market will never tell you were the bottom or top is accurately and it only shows you area of conference and at that waiting to buy at the lowest of the lowest will always cost you to lose investment opportunities.",
