  "content": "I attempted to mint SATS tokens on the Bitcoin network using the Ordinals protocol and BRC20 standards by utilizing an intermediary software written in the Go language. I made no adjustments to the software and it likely sent raw data directly. My intention was to execute 500 repetitive minting transactions without being aware of the 25 transaction limit.However, I encountered the following error:\"Send error, reveal send error, 25 transaction hashes could not be parsed, sendrawtransaction RPC error: {\"code\":-26,\"message\":\"too-long-mempool-chain, too many descendants for tx 369a184f3e941a501b99a2865f6c1db09f39af379ef8c63fb52689e37e3376a7 [limit: 25]\"}: maximum hash string length is 64 bytes.\"As a result of this error, only 25 out of my 500 transactions were successful in executing the Bitcoin command. The remaining 475 transactions did not consume the sent â€Ž0,00002914 btc, and consequently, the tokens I minted did not reach me.Is there anything I can do for Bitcoin script that did not fulfill their task? https://mempool.space/tx/369a184f3e941a501b99a2865f6c1db09f39af379ef8c63fb52689e37e3376a7",

Perhaps try getting help from the sat minting groups or channels, they may have much better knowledge and experience.How about executing the minting transactions in batches of 25 due to the limit? Have you tried that?",

      "body": "Thanks so much for your help. I have one last question. I've been reading a lot for days and I'm so confused, I can't think logically. Do I need to enter witness information in this new transaction I am sending, or is it enough to just enter the scriptPubKey? If I need to be a witness, what do Item 1 and Item 3 represent in the example you gave? And finally, I would like to point out this: The script I use creates a new wallet for each new minting transaction. Do I need the private key of these wallets to resend unexecuted outputs from the main transaction as we discussed? Or is it enough to use my own wallet's private key which performs the main transaction with 500 outputs? And finally, as an example, can you show me how to generate the raw code for just one of these operations? Thank you very much for your support.",
