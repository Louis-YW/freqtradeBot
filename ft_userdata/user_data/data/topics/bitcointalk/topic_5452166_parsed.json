By the way, I quote you so that the image you share can display for others to read their comment.",

There might really be little that can be done here because the only person who even posted and created a thread about that case has not been online on this forum since July 2022, so I don't think they have any other official representative here again. But a proper scam accusations thread will warn people to be careful, and experienced members here could also supply you with a possible solution to your issue.",

Sorry for your loss.When it comes to scams, it makes no difference if the capital is large or small; they wipe off everything. Blizz.io is a legit site where gambling odds are activated for the aim of generating profits, but it hasn't happen to me or any one I could think of, and no one has the right to speak or share scam accusation about their site until it is proven guilty, especially when the transactions are suspect. I don't blame the Blizzard staff for deleting the account; after all, it was their breached terms and conditions that caused them to want to discover and remove any problematic accounts. After all, this is not the greatest place to air your grievances; rather, it should be done in the reputation board, where vital information about blizz.io will be disclosed, for better or worse.",
