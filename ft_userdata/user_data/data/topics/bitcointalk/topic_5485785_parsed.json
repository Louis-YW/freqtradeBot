  "content": "source At global monetary value, bitcoin is top 6th using the analysis of market capitalization while comparing to other existing fiat currencies, this is a significant difference that makes bitcoin be among the top rated because of it's unique value and increasing rate of adoption as the market cap continues to surge ahead other long term existing fiat currencies.We had this happening even before the great occasion of the 2024 halving began when bitcoin break the first ever recorded of $1 trillion dollars, while it could be recalled that it was after the previous 2020 halving it marked it's all time market cap high, unlike having the experience right before the halving begun this time, this also shows a significant increase in adoption and how bitcoin have been seen as a preferred digital currency or investment asset globally.Bitcoin has come to stay, invest today and hodl.",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing this and I must say that I am so happy to see this even as this particular statistic can't be a lie for obvious reasons. Initially, it has been the top world countries enjoying everything in life including the payment means. Bitcoin came and put an end to that as everyone has access to it impartially, and anyone can use it as they like. For this, we are the same in the sight of Bitcoin and not the way of disparity among countries simply because they are more advanced. We can own and use Bitcoin as we like without segregation, so I expect nothing less in a view like what I see in the statistic you posted.Merely looking at the countries above Bitcoin on the table has already hinted and speaks volumes about what I was talking about. Bitcoin has given the less privileged countries a better say in the payment industry and the financial system. That alone is enough reason to ever appreciate and praise the asset.",

      "body": "Firstly, thanks for the informationThe significant rise in Bitcoin investments at both the individual and institutional levels has helped Bitcoin see a rise in prices.“After the halving, these requirements will be reduced by half: with only 3,125 BTC mined per block, equivalent to a drop to $7 billion per year, effectively relieving selling pressure.”The price of Bitcoin directly affects the operational costs of the mining community. As a result, Bitcoin miners are anticipating the upcoming halving event, which will halve the mining reward to 3,125 BTC.",

There is good demand for Bitcoin through the recently passed spot Bitcoin ETFs and with halving happening in a few months Bitcoin will easily pass GBP. This is just the beginning and the real competitor of Bitcoin is the USD, it will take many years for Bitcoin to dethrone USD but it will happen for sure. I am happy to see the names of countries below Bitcoin, all of them have good and rising economies. Still, they cannot surpass Bitcoin makes me proud and makes me feel confident about Satoshi's vision for the future. In just 15 years being nothing and then to be compared with global currencies is just amazing to see and they said it was a bubble that will explode. Look where it stands now and how fast it has claimed that position.",

There are still some countries where btc buying selling are not allowed. In next five years I hope analysis will show btc at top 3 in term of adoption. According to coinmarketcap, Bitcoin total marketcap is now 1.02 trillion which is currently no 10 in term of assets. Gold is on the top with 13 trillion marketcap. BTC is close to surpass Meta(Facebook) and Silver which could be happened after halving (maybe thos Year or next). It is big victory for Bitcoin lovers who are supporting from the start.",

I now know what to show people who do not believe in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a real currency and it has great value. Just like you said, bitcoin has already reached top 6 even before the halving this year what more can bitcoin achieve after the halving?With that said, I do wonder how do the other fiat money feel about this. Will these governments try to restrain the use of bitcoin or just try to accept it and join the development of cryptocurrencies? Will there come a time that Bitcoin is the Number 1 currency in the world? Lots of possibilities and I am so grateful to have been part of something historical!",

Bitcoin is making itself unstoppable day by day and the halving event is very close so wait for the time when it will make more hype in the market. I have seen it crossing many big institutions, organizations, and big companies Tesla is one of them which is the first electric car company Bitcan has surpassed its market cap also.According to the chart you shared bitcoin will surpass the UK pound very soon and it is very surprising that bitcoin is surpassing strong countries currencies market cap. Hopefully, it will break the silver market cap very soon which is $1.29 trillion bull run on the way haha it will achieve a lot and break alot of things market cap. All this money entering into the market is a pre-bull run amount so you can have an idea of when we will close to the bull run and how much money will enter into the market which will make Bitcoin sky rocking.",

Because it is the leading currency worldwide. More investors more rank, more people hold the more valuable it becomes so bitcoin has come to stay and nothing can stop it.",

Many governments already restrain people to use Bitcoin as currency, but they mostly allow people to invest in Bitcoin because they can tax it. Bitcoin become number 1 currency in the world is still long to go... but I'm sure it will happen.",

Being under the United States, Eurozone Nations, China, Japan and the United Kingdom as global currencies further clarifies Bitcoin's position as a currency. For those who question whether Bitcoin will become a global currency, indirectly by showing this table the answer can be obtained.We can be sure that from the 6th position there will be changes that will increase again from the current position if people look at Bitcoin in terms of its value and other advantages of Bitcoin.In simple terms, Bitcoin can shift the position of several other currencies at any time based on people's awareness.",

Currently, Bitcoin has a market cap of $1,007,344,339,159 which supercedes other currencies that have existed for close to a century. In a few years, Bitcoin might take the number one spot because more investors are attracted to put in more money. A few years ago Bitcoin was castigated and seen as a currency that would not stand the test of time. But this perception has changed and even the banks and government that constantly attacked it now want to benefit from it. To avoid regrets in the future, we need to keep accumulating as much as we can.",
