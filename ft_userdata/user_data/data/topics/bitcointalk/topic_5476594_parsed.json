The issue with unnecessary link this season na because of the free money wey Tinubu send and if any free money come again na so link go still dey fly everywhere.I believe say people no suppose fall mugu for link matter this season because any person wey really work hard for this hard time no suppose play with money the person suppose get sense say free money no dey anywhere even if free money dey do you think the link will get to you.Concerning the Facebook and whatsapp hack na that one be the main issue now, I no know if for your area na the same thing dey happen but my area I don too hear whatsapp hack and the hacker will use your number to beg your friends for money, in most cases people don send money go unknownly to them so we should be careful because na our friends go suffer am no be us.",

      "body": "Op thank you for this piece, to be frank this is a right information at the right period and at the right place. And I'll like to extend my thoughts from where op stopped. For the past days I have been receiving similar links in my WhatsApp from my WhatsApp contacts in respect to the purported #25k that the FGN reported to share among millions of Nigerian households, although from what I heard some persons have received theirs recently even a close friend of mine received his last week.But that is not the concern, my concern is how these fraudsters and scammers are taking a drastic advantage of the news to create fake sites where people are required to fill in sensitive data about them such as NIN, phone number, email address and password, after which they will ask you to refer the site link to other social groups/platforms as part of the registration eligibility process.It's quite unfortunate that people still fall for this infantry pattern of scam because they act greedy and also fail to do research about the integrity and genuineness of any link and forms they see online before taking further action on it. All this naw we go direct am to the hunger for the land abi?Let beware, avoid link and online forms you don't know and sure of.",

Nobody sabi the means or approach wey these hackers go use, Dem fit use means wey seem very very promising and just random but e dey always dey cunning if we look deep, but we no go too sabi based on say na something wey dey normally do.   Everybody just gats dey up to date to the fact say people dey use the slightest of means to gain access to our personals. We see instance of links from Whatsapp, addition to unknown groups, and even sms of downloading a file. Any mistake to opening those links are just gateways to our files and documents being exposed to those bad people. The world dey evolve and so different means to causing harms to people's privates just dey emanate and one just has to be cautious in whatever they're doing so as not to get hooked up in the dangers that would arise once the threat becomes an attack.",
