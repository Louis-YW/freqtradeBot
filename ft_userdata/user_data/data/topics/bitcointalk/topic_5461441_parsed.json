Just email them or if there’s other means to contact them do so. I.e if I understood what you wrote correctly.",

If those stuff don't work then try contacting support and detail to them what you've done already so they can skip over those steps.

When you enable 2FA on any platform, you will be given secret code, which you can backup and always use to recover your account.@AriaryantoCoin_trader is correct, if you connected the authenticator to your Gmail, only what you need is to download the authenticator. It will automatically synchronize with your email if you have it on the device before. Or click at the top right corner icon to see your email and click on it to get your authenticator. With how I explained how google authenticator works, if you save the passwords of the accounts like exchanges that you use with the Google 2FA on your Gmail, everything an enemy like hackers need is to have access to your email to compromise your accounts and steal your coinsFor security and safety, the best is offline backup. I will recommend you Aegis (Android) or Tofu (iOS). Make sure you do the offline backup of the secret codes.",

If you have an antifreeze app, launch it, scroll to your where your Google authenticator is and have it unfreeze. If it is completely uninstalled, download GA and enter the setup key of the account from where you wrote it down. If you don't have the setup key, then try reaching out to support for help. But the easiest way to recover your accounts is through the Google account synchronization connected to your email address as explained by coin_trader.",

If you only use your trading account as an investment account, I don't think you need the Google key. Simply enter your exchange with the confirmation code sent to the email you used when you registered with the exchange you have chosen.Well, the story is if the code is lost and you forget to copy it in notepad or something else. contact your cs exchange and follow the steps and after that's done you can immediately log back in and reset everything needed and don't forget to note down the new code and enter/paste the code on your cellphone again.",

I think you aren't conscious about your security if you don't have it. Anyway as others said you have to make a support ticket to get help from certain platforms to disable your 2FA but you have to submit again your KYC documents for verification if it's either you or not. Then they might disable it. To avoid these types of situation I will suggest to use Twilio Authy Authenticator Application than using Google Authenticator  Because this app will help you to recover your every codes by adding another leyar security with phone number. If you find your phone number then you can access it from everywhere or any devices. Just you need to login with that number. Here are the link of this Application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy",

What you want to use your account for is another issue but I disagree if you say 2FA is needed for trading account, not not needed if you use your account as investment storage wallet.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsQuoteWell, the story is if the code is lost and you forget to copy it in notepad or something else. contact your cs exchange and follow the steps and after that's done you can immediately log back in and reset everything needed and don't forget to note down the new code and enter/paste the code on your cellphone again.It will take a few hours, 24 hours or longer.

Hope someone knows about all this, thanks.There is an option that allows the exchange not to require 2FA to log in to an account because there is another option, namely via a text message sent to the number we use or there is an option to get a code via an active email that we used when registering for the exchange.2FA is necessary for your security reasons as the owner of the exchange account and do not attempt to disable it. If the exchange you use has several types to increase account security, use all of them.I've never lost access to google authenticator because the code when I activated it I saved fine offline.Beyond that, don't store assets on an exchange because it won't be safe.",

Although, before you add Google Authenticator to any account, either you scan the QR code or you will be given a code that contains about 20+ combinations of numbers and letters. If you have that code, then you can just redownload the G-authenticator and reenter the code, and you may be able to access your account again.Another alternative is that, depending on how fast and reliable the customer support of the platform you are using is, if you send them an email or contact support through their provided means, they will be able to deactivate the Google authenticator on your account. I think I had those issues with one CEX in the past. I contacted support through mail, and I was required to pass some KYC, after which the authenticator was removed.",

Once i lost Phone number to my CEXs account made in spain by my friend and i have made 3 login here in my Local Country. Due to which they restricted my account by assuming my login as spam so when i tried to logged in again they asked for otp and when i called my friend in spain to give me OTP. He said, i am on plane back to Local Country. I was like ok then, i think i should have to wait for him to go back as the sim he has with him. IDK if there was any other way to get OTP on that SIM. but i contacted the exchange and they have already full guides of how can i recover my account back. Without that number, by providing my KYC details again. And i am sure you will also find a way to log into your account again by providing some KYC.",

This is your way to get in without the authenticator, The other way is to send support they will request proof of ownership, and will have to prove that you own that account by sending them all the documents that they will request to prove you are the rightful owner.After they grant you your request you can then disable the authenticator on the security page of your account.",

I mean I wasn't sure yet if it is already like that because I didn't try to do recovery yet but on the application, it says \"Your codes are saved to your Google Account\".",
