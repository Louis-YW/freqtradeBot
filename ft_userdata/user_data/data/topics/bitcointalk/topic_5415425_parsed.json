  "content": "This has been a disturbing factor for me for a long time, but I dont know how to express it but the thing is getting out of hand it is obvious that I cant control the instincts again so I have to express it. I do not met it to hurt anyone but to express my feeling on a disturbing issue. I believed this has been on ground since the day, the platform was created or it was later the habits were executed by \"hunters\", I call them hunters because they are jumping from one campaign. I dont know why people would join today then tomorrow when another campaign came up they would apply again, if another one came up they would apply again. It is that they are here only for campaigns? Or the pay of the campaign that accepted them is too small? If they know that the pay is too small, for the first sight, they should not apply for it and they should be patient for next one. You join a campaign yesterday and you were accepted, today another campaign came you apply and accepted, you have disorganized the former manager's plan. I like some users in the forum, since when I came to the forum, they are stick to their campaigns. For those who cross carpet should stay in their newly accepted campaigns for a while before leaving.why do you join the campaign and leave within 24hrs?#donotbetheharlotintheforum",

      "body": "This is capitalism for you, and it isn't exclusive to signature campaigns. People do this in the real world too. We're constantly pushed into looking for the best paying jobs, whether that's through political or domestic pressure. People literally make a career for themselves by job hopping. I've known a few that have had multiple jobs in a course of a two month period. It's just easier to do it for signature campaigns. I guess the question is, should we really be judging those that are trying to make the best living for themselves? I don't know exactly how I feel about the practice, since this happens everywhere. I'm sure it's quite annoying to signature campaign managers, but it's also not written into their contract or application process that they have to stay for a minimum term. They're simply signing up to earn money per post. If they don't make any posts or are below the minimum, and then leave to join another, they aren't doing anything, but potentially wasting the time of the signature campaign manager.",

      "body": "Pretty normal for any kind of people either irl or online. Most people will jump to another if the work has better manager, rates, rules, estimated uptime of the campaign and etc. disregarding the time of when they applied. In short a job with better benefits.QuoteIf they know that the pay is too small, for the first sight, they should not apply for it and they should be patient for next oneThe question is when it will be the next one, better to apply on the existing while you are waiting for better one, isn't it?Quote...you have disorganized the former manager's planI don't think so, i bet it's it's easy for them to clear and update the sheet.",

      "body": "I've seen quite a few users apply for every campaign in a short space of time and I don't think it harms anyone unless you're referring to it being done a lot and continuously by the same person. At that I'd ask if you had noticed there are some campaigns that only run for a few weeks, I think that's worse than the people jumping from campaign to campaign.Most managers seem to update their spreadsheets every week and do most of the admin work on that day (with some exceptions) so it'd make sense some users might hop between 3 campaigns if one they prefer adds you on each of those days.I've worked with a lot of people who chase startup work and you can find even more brutal (/fast paced) relationships there.",

Some might chose to move to a campaign where the have higher trust, some because of good pay others for personal reasons.",
