  "content": "7,500 BTC are forever locked with a key that is now unrecoverable in a dumpster in the UK as the judge decided that the hard drive is now property of the city council after it was dumped in the landfill.Now worth around $750 million, the key to these Bitcoins were saved in a hard drive that was accidentally thrown into the dumpster in 2013.During more than a decade, James Howells has been trying to contact everyone in the UK to try to recover his hard drive, but recently a judge decided that it would be a waste of time, and that actually the hard drive is owned by the council.Honestly, I don't think it would be even possible to recover the keys from that dumpster after all this time.sources:https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-mans-bitcoin-treasure-worth-750-million-lost-forever-after-court-rejects-his-bid-to-recover-it-7458237https://www.msn.com/en-au/money/markets/judge-halts-attempt-to-retrieve-hard-drive-with-nearly-750-million-in-bitcoin-on-it-from-landfill/ar-BB1rePar",

According to his claims, he was among the first ten people who mined BTC, and he also claims that the HDD contains the IP address of Satoshi.Besides, JH didn't literally throw that HDD in the trash, his girlfriend did it - but she shouldn't be blamed too much for that either, because if the HDD had been in some hidden place and not in a drawer without a key, then it wouldn't have ended up in the trash. The fact is that at that time that HDD was not of any value to JH, and if he knew exactly what he had in his possession, this story would never have happened.The judge is right in any case, that HDD ceased to be his property the moment it ended up in the trash.",

To be honest, I cannot help but feel bad for that man, he probably cannot longer live a normal life and be okey with himself because all the time and energy he has invested and all the money he (or his gf) literally threw in the trash can. Also, that ruling implies anything in the land-fill of the city is not longer of the property of their original owner? In my country, of someone seee something useful or something or value in their trash, one first needs to ask for permission before going for it and take it.",

I don't know if it help him to put him out of his misery, but after more than ten years thinking that you are close to get from somehow financially covered - 300k is still a really big amount, to filthy rich has to be psychologically devastating to know that it was no more than a dream you definitely know that will never come true (not to talk about his relatives, friends, etc. who will always know him as the man who dumped millions by mistake).",

The city council's position on 'ownership' certainly brings up ethical and legal dilemmas. If the council is meant to represent the public, shouldn't there be some level of public discussion regarding such an important discovery? The comparison to pet ownership is striking—responsibility doesn't just disappear when something is thrown away, and it complicates the straightforward nature of the ownership argument.",
