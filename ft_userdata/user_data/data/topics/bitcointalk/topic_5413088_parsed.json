For the love of God, do not invest all of your money in bitcoin, it is too risky to do, invest what you can afford to lose or your spare money, it is a long term investment and your profit will probably come in the long term, so it is unwise to invest with a lump sum, you either use your spare money or you buy with dollar cost averaging.",

A real asset is an asset whose value appreciate with time, of which a good example of a real asset is land, real estate and precious metals like gold, silver e.t.cSo Bitcoin can be classified as a real asset because it's value appreciate with time, which is why most people choose it as a store of value for long term investment",

A few centralized organizations mentioned Bitcoin is an asset that is a virtual asset. Investing in Bitcoin means you are holding this currency or assets that don't give any guarantee of return. Holding value would decrease or increase. Like if you hold fiat (USD), it's the price would up against your local fiat or would decrease as well. So it depends on you how will you welcome Bitcoin. Investing in crypto always remains risky. So you have to decide yourself what you have to do.",

I think OP didn't read that well. Financial advisor's do, telling folks and Peep's to buy $10 worth Bitcoin every week if they can. At least, it's a better decision to take than to buy the latest iphones which won't be useful in the future.Real Life Shit: My mate ( Secondary school mate ) got one of the iPhone's ( worth some big amounts in naira ) only to get bursted by the Fed's and had his iPhone seized till date. If half of that fund's was used to get $100 worth BTC wouldn't that be a crazy peng Idea ?Like I read in the forum, teach people about BTCbut don't force em to invest...... If I had told him, I doubt if he was gon buy the idea.But yeah, Rich Dad Poor Dad is a must read for all, The world's changed already but education and money haven't already or haven't been part of it, why ? Load's of people are not Financially Educated and Financially Intelligent, cause they don't teach bout money in schools.",

There's nothing wrong with that if you're willing to take risks and plan your life for the long term without those assets. All investments are risky, so no matter what you invest in, don't put all your assets in one basket, should diversify and always have a backup plan for the worst case scenario.",

He even have some experiments early in his career wherein he buy a property without shelling out money, i.e he uses his credit card, a amount of $2k just to move one and then he loan the remaining like $16k-$20k if I'm not mistaken.It's just a different approach when you invest in crypto, because unlike real property asset, it has a lots of up and down, but the end result will be the same, it can give you profits in the long run. Also you will hear Robert talks about crypto in general, so I will assume that he also consider it a real asset.",
