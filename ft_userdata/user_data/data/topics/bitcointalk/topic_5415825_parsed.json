If you are only using it for small amounts then it's safe enough. If you're storing high values of many tokens it would be safer to have multiple hardware wallets with different wallets/passphrases to ensure you won't get scammed when signing erc20 transactions and similar. If you're working with a few altcoins but they're of lower value, using a mix of trusted wallets is probably the most secure way (and perhaps a hardware wallet for things you're less likely to spend or for coins you need larger amounts of - for fees - like bitcoin or ethereum).",

That's because trustwallet is close-source and we don't know how the keys have been generated and whether they are stored on their server or not.

Asides the danger of online hackers and cyber criminals there is also the danger of offline criminals who may be disguised as friends and you maybe may become very unsuspecting towards. Trust less and make a conscious effort to protect any device housing any of your wallet from plenty hands. Tell less persons about your involvement in crypto unless on rare occasions and when it is completely important, because mentioning that you are into crypto to some individuals is often misinterpreted to mean that you have so much money.",

How to protect my trustwallet account?Thanks in advance ♡@Charles-Tim, @Z-tight and some others already suggested that you should consider getting hardware wallet or offline storage wallet.But since you asked about Trust Wallet  I will share with you some tricks and precautions that's might reduce the risk of your trust wallet getting hack. If you're the lazy and greedy type then the chance of your account getting hacked is high. Because scammers tend to get some users by enticing them with some too good to be true offers. Let's say you participated in an airdrop and after some time you received and email or a notification asking you to claim some additional token worth more than $500 and it gives you a convincing writeup as to why you were selected, during the process of claiming the token you were asked to connect your wallet by inserting your secret phrases what will you do? ye! I know the story is unrealistic but let's just assume something like this ever happens what will you do?I know you might be tempted to just insert it and claim your free tokens but in the process your secret might get stolen. Here are some useful tips:I know you might heard it a thousand times Never expose your secret phrases no matter what. just as the name implies secret phrase should be kept private. If you ever want to participate in any airdrop whatsoever make sure you create a new account. though it's not advisable since you tend to get token with close to zero value.Here's a trick that could help you keep your Wallet safe even more. I read about it some time ago and I've been applying it ever since. I'll share my pattern with you but you'll have to figure out any pattern that works well for you.Trust wallet always have 12 secret phrases and we all have the habit of always writing them out and storing them in their correct arrangements, which means if a scammer even get his hands on them it will be easy for them to get access to your wallet. instead of storing the phrases in their correct arrangements why don't you do some rearrangement before you store them? you could take the last 6 words and place them at the first position and place them in the first position while the first six will be at the last postion, you could also arrange them to your taste. here what I mean; let's assume the following phrases belongs to an account:Car  Father  Tower  Curtain  Bitcoin  Smile  Touch  Elbow  Blanket  Window  School  Rainbow instead of storing in the above format you could swap some words before you store them. like this. Elbow  Blanket  Window  School  Rainbow Car  Father  Tower  Curtain  Bitcoin  Smile  Touch(I moved the last six words to the front while the first six to the back)or this  swapping two closest words. Father Car  Curtain  Tower  Smile  Bitcoin Elbow  Touch    Window Blanket  Rainbow  SchoolIf it's 12 phrases rearranging it means that out of 479,001,600 only 1 is the correct combination while if it's 24 only 1 out of 620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000 Is your combination. but you have to remember your pattern so that you won't have to try 479,001,600 different times. Just be careful how you use your wallet.",

You should never try to invent your own \"encryption\" mechanism because most of the times they don't provide you with any meaningful security and you would be running the risk of not being able to recover your keys ever again.
