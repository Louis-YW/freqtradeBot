If there is little or no activity on social media, which is an vital aspect of communicating with customers.An inactive social profile could mean no progress going on behind the scenes as projects are meant to announce milestones and achievements on the road map. It could also mean that you would not get prompt help if you have some issues which customer service should help with",

When the company does not have active account for easy contact or to show customers they are always available,this might bring in poor progress in the business since customers will see them as scam.Customer loves satisfaction and when such is not achieved the customer will complain, when the company can not be contacted on their social media site it make customer loose hope in that company because it shows that the company is not reliable enough. If it is weekly updates the company should do that in other to show their availability and consistency.",

Depends.Not all projects use the social media actively but no matter how good the project is, if the management/devs can't spread the word out then it is no good for the investors. So, eventually the project will need to promote their project on the social media, hire shills, do giveaways, create sig camps etc. If they don't do that, the project will die off. There are so many good ideas wasted away like this. Even bitcoin wasn't so popular during its first years.",

Yes, that's a red flag. How they can't be active on their social media channels if they're working on a project to at least give their investors an update on what happens to the project?I wouldn't invest in those projects that no longer converse with their community. Well, some may say that bitcoin doesn't have official and actual control over its social media and it doesn't have it. Well, it's a different and special case for everybody.",

Social media becomes a bridge between project owners and investors, the less interaction it will raise big questions about their seriousness in working on the project. We have seen a lot that a successful project cannot be separated from the community that is built, the bigger the community, the higher the success rate of the project. If the owner rarely or never makes announcements or anything like that about the project they are working on then it indicates that they are not serious about building it.So the conclusion is that it is a yellow light for us to be more careful or even shy away from the project.",

Honestly, no matter how good the project idea is, if they don't have any social media updates, especially Twitter, I'll tend to ignore them.You are right that social media is a medium for both parties to interact. And usually successful projects also do the same thing, which is a lot of announcements or other things on their social media, either twitter, telegram or others. The more communication the better and it will create a solid community. I've come across projects that aren't really active on their social media and I decided to leave the project. And from that experience, I was saved several times because when I came back, it turned out that the project was really a scam.",

Yes, it's already a red flag, for me the people behind have abandoned the project already. CEO or whoever in charge of the project should really communicate with their investors, if not then how are this people going to invest their money on a project that has no response?So it's very important for incoming project to be very active not just from behind, but in front as well. In their social media's, it is very major that everyone is in the loop, road maps and everything and it is being discussed by their CEO to everyone.",

If I notice that they are not active enough on their social media accounts after putting together some bad data, I can make my final decision more easily because the public communication level of a project should always be at the best level. From this point of view, we can say that it is an important issue... Also, one of the reasons why Binance delists projects is that the public communication level of the delisted projects is not good enough.

Those projects that are no longer active on their social media accounts are likely have left it and abandoned it.They're done and the project's done so don't burn your money buying the project they've got or tokens that it has got. You're just close to losing your money immediately if you're not careful with those. Just leave them quickly and don't give your time to them if you haven't invested yet to it.",
