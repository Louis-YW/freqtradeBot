  "content": "Privacy is the most precious thing in this world. Not just in our day-to-day lives but also in crypto. So, whenever we surf the internet, go through different websites, use a cyber cafe, or use other laptops or computers, we tend to maintain extreme privacy. But still, there are many ways our privacy gets exposed. As in data leaks, breaches, key logging, malicious software, viruses, and other means.To fix this problem and ensure privacy in its highest form, \"tailsOS\" comes with the solution.So what is this tailsOS, how does it work, and what's so special about it?TailsOS is basically a portable operating system that can run on a USB flash drive. The main purpose of tailsOS is to ensure total privacy. So what does it mean? It means that whenever you turn off your computer or reboot, everything you did and everything that was stored in the RAM basically gets lost. In simple terms, everything is erased or vanished, every single piece of data, the moment you turn off your tailsOS. The next moment you turn on your computer again (of course, through tailsOS), you'll get a fresh OS. To make things easier, there is dedicated persistent storage where you can save your private documents, wifi passwords, browser bookmarks, and other important stuff. Well, it's not a mandatory thing; you can always choose to skip this. This dedicated persistent storage also comes with data encryption. There is no way for others to see the content of this storage unless they know the password. And there is no other way to bypass this, either. Another thing I really like about tailsOS is that TOR is preinstalled in this OS. So everything you do on the internet leaves no trace of it. You guys already know how TOR works, right?! TailsOS comes with a variety of privacy based applications. You can share your files using onionshare, exchange your bitcoins using Electrum, and so on.Why did I choose to write about it?Basically, I use this myself, and I found it very helpful. So I thought of sharing it with others. As a busy guy, I have to go to different places for work, family, or other personal matters. And I can't always bring my laptop to every one of these occasions. So whenever I'm in need of going online or, let's just say, logging into my Bitcointalk account, I use Tails. The OS itself is very stable; I never found any security issues or any kind of bug.How do I install this?The installation process for tailsOS is quite easy. You just need a USB flash drive with 8GB of storage, the ISO file of tailsOS and a working laptop (of course, lol). The software to flash the ISO is also provided by Tails. So don't worry about that.One thing I forgot to include is that Mac is not supported by tails. So bad luck for Apple users. And you'll need a modern laptop or computer. At least 10 years; below that, it probably won't run or boot.If anyone has used this amazing operating system before or has any suggestions, feel free to comment.Reference used:Tails Official Website: https://tails.net/Detailed documentation: https://tails.net/doc/index.en.htmlPDF Documents: https://davidbombal.wiki/tailsprivacyYoutube Video: https://youtu.be/gO9fTnMxwYw?si=wk-3bBXO4WgZH9UB",

Just be always careful and remember that there isn't such thing as \"total privacy\"You are always being tracked,  and even bitcoin transactions may expose a lot of your past.Tail is amazing and you won't leave tracks there , but you might leave tracks somewhere else when using it.[/list]",
