  "content": "Tiffany & Co. was founded on 1837 and has become one of the oldest companies in America. These necklaces based on Cryptopunks NFT they have created appears to be confirming the suggestion that the concept of NFTs will never die, very much similar to the concept of cryptocurrencies. NFT has, also similar to cryptocurrencies, become a part of our culture.Using that as an argument, bitcointalk.org has welcomed altcoins and created subforums for them for everyone to discuss, speculate and for people to help each other. Can the forum also welcome NFTs and also create subforums for NFT discussion, speculation and information sharing?The company is selling 250 customized, diamond-encrusted pendant necklaces for 30 ETH (around $50,000) a pop to holders of the famed collection. Each necklace will include a combination of 30 diamonds and gemstones, according to Tiffany’s website.neThe necklaces will go on sale Aug. 5 and are only available for CryptoPunk holders to purchase in the form of NFTs redeemable for the physical necklaces. Tiffany’s will net over $12 million from the sale’s sellout, standing to make even more profit from resale royalties.Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/01/jewelry-brand-tiffany-and-co-unveils-50k-cryptopunk-necklaces/",

I think he isn't interested.Also, if you are going to get sub board for nft, I think sub board for Lightning Network is also necessary and must be first priority which still isn't added in the forum.",

Whether we like it or not, new crypto users mainly invest in altcoins (NFT included) before they start looking at bitcoin (usually after getting rekt) and by getting them here there is a good chance that instead of wasting their time and money on shitcoins, they start using bitcoin instead.

It's not like Bitcointalk has anything to lose by adding a subforum.Agreed and it might also bring more people in the forum. New people will certainly also bring new ideas, new knowledge and new opporunities. If it helps for the growth of our community in bitcointalk.org, we should try it. It also appears that much of us might be underestimating NFTs for the adoption of the cryptospace, however, in 4 years the rate of growth for NFTs might be faster than bitcoin's rate of growth. NFT trading might become the no.1 form of introduction to the cryptospace for new users.",

About merit source, maybe theymos still see merit distribution to be sufficient enough and see no need for new merit sources, but some of those that applied and some other people that can do the work would be made merit sources if the merit distribution is declining and as more people are registering on this forum if they are good posters.",

I said so because since I joined this forum(about 1yr and 2 months) and has been seeing suggestions and requests, I haven't seen anyone granted. That made me feel that theymos doesn't want to  bother this present software much anymore because a new one might be on the way.While we wait and make suggestions, I am of the opinion that some of these suggestions should be channelled to the board for the new forum software. By doing so, the board would be busy, and each time a suggestion is made there, it would be a reminder to theymos that we are waiting for it.",
