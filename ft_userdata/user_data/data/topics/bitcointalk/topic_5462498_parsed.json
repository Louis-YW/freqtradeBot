There will be no splits or whispers of neighbors.In this thread, I can conclude, even though we here are required to post on the gambling thread, but putting the gambling discussion in its place, it will all focus on the subject matter, so that we can understand the essence of the conversation, of course I don't blame the discussion, because if we study the discussion about gambling there are thousands that we can discuss, but the water is still put in the bucket, planting corn must be in the land/rice fields.Quote from: yahoo62278 on August 08, 2023, 10:31:38 AMI could go on and on, but I think you guys get my point.

Hyip, pyramid scheme and other bullshit ideas is still allowed to post here without any penalty from the mods. Only the DT strictly discouraged therefore they are tag with negative trust.It’s not that they are tag that’s why hyip already stop coming here but rather no one is already interested on this obvious scam scheme. I think most of this scammer already change field like IDO, scam meme coin and DeFi.  I always use the report to moderator button on this case.",

I may have been guilty a few times myself until I was reading one of the campaign rules from one manager and saw a rule that said they wanted posters who will frequent more the gambling board than gambling discussion board. That was when I understood the difference between the two boards because I used to think that they were the same and wonder the need for the gambling discussion sub board under gambling.",
