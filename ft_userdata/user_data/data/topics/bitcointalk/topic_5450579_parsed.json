The hacker made it suspicious that the other victim from one end will think it's another victim who attacks him, when it's just the hacker trying to send a gas fee from one of the victims addresses to another, which could be used for token swap in any of the victims wallets that hold a swappable token on them.According to the link dropped by the OP, the author herself still doesn't know where those leaks are from, and they did not just start last week; they have been happening since sometime last year. And those leaks are not just on trust wallet extensions or Metamask; some hardware wallets are also affected, which means those hardware wallets were connected to an already infected device.It's just advisable for us to have a completely separate gadget for all crypto transactions and another device for daily use. If possible, to be on the safe side, we should have multiple wallets, even if they're hardware wallets. We should have more than just one and split assets between them so that if one wallet is affected, your entire fortune won't be completely lost.",

One thing is for sure, hardware wallets should indeed not directly expose their key to the device it connected to, if it does, the HW mechanism is faulty and simply not how it is supposed to work essentially. Due to a lot of variables inherently contained within the wallet drains operation, this kind of issue is tricky since many users have different digital security behaviour or in general how they do with anything related to crypto usage, though it is assumed that's a user-related problem. It is also worth noting that software/wallet-related problem is also a possibility.",

All those things that happened in the last week are just another proving again, why the cryptomarket is still kind of a niche market in comparison to traditional financial markets, even though the growth of the crypto space in the last few years was very fast and the adoption is also increasing.Still somehow it feels like you are only really 100% safe if you have your tokens on a hardware wallet, that was never really connected to a browser wallet or something like that. If you have your projects on a exchange, then you have the risk of losing all of it because the exchange gets hacked, goes out of service or was just a scam to begin with.",
