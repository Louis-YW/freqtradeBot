There could be confusion as to what CMC is referring to. They must have abandoned the token and proceeded to just develop the casino. Quite odd that they are not updating the Ann thread anymore and then suddenly emerge right now in time while the market is ripe.",

So, I was just curious, then searched the last review about them, and find a bad review about the fund. So if you have an account there and still have a balance in past, better to check it again, maybe you can check if this is true, if the casino confiscates money from dormant accounts.",
