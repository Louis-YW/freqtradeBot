Another thing is that exchanges like Binance has a requirement that a token or coin must meet to remain in the exchange, if your total daily volume doesn't exceed $3M, they have the right to delist such coin from the exchange. Maybe another bullrun will activated back some of the volumes but I believe some of them are as good as dead.You may refer to frequently asked questions on why tokens are been delisted from exchange",

But as these coins are not worth anything or not popular or as the marketcap is not high, hence these coins are not traded in good volume. Hence these coins are getting delisted from the exchanges. Exchanges have already many coins and trading pairs, so they are removing not so popular coins.",

There may be significant outflows, but the amount that remains will be concentrated in the remaining cryptocurrencies.Well, this may be due to the influence of increasingly stringent global regulations to the point that several exchanges have delisted certain coins which in fact have low volume, could it be said that there is a lack of interest in spot trading in these coins?Maybe there is a lack of development and the coin is not very popular, because what I see is that the coins that are delisted are mostly coins that I don't recognize, maybe I think it is their lack of liquidity in the market so the exchange is considering delisting from trading.",

Exchange consider the community power of token before they list to avoid dead coin being list. So they are simply useless which doesn’t affect the crypto market.There’s a lot of pairs being listed in regular basis which replace this delisted token. Delisting is natural process of exchange to balance the token they are offering. I believe the OP will be interesting if you will include the graph of the token being list on exchange to see the difference.",

They can't live up to what they have said. This is the reason why people stop interacting with those coins. And if there is no interaction then it will have no value. So keeping them on the trading platform means no profit for them. They will simply just delist it. Only the strong stand still in the end. Those that are weak will fall and never stand up. But the market will still flood with more shit coins as we move forward to the future. It is important for us to identify which one is going to stay and which one is going to fall. Nowadays, it is so hard to do that. But without any risks we can't make any profit. It is a necessary evil that we have to deal with because we have no other choice. There are other option that has fewer risks but if we focus on profits then we should not be limited by only those.",

Honestly I don't see any reason why you need to use new coins pairs to trade.This is such a sad reality. Unfortunately there are way too many people who invest into new tokens because they think if they invest on early days, like even before it's released, at launchpad funding period, they could sell it for a lot higher later on. 99% of those projects go down as soon as they get released, either the creator sells all the tokens left on their hands on top of the funding they got, or they end up with a situation where they just can't make it work.I believe that the best thing to do right now would be making sure that you are ahead of everyone else, and you could do a greater return of it when the time comes. I get that it may not be all that simple, but we could reach to that point if we are smart. Just avoid all the new ones, pick the big names and keep on accumulating more and more of those.This would get you two things that are important, first of all it would be safe because the yare already too huge and not a single person could drop it, maybe as a market we could drop the price, but no whale could come in and screw it up, secondly it would guarantee previous success, so it is not like it's an unknown situation where you have no idea how it is going to go, you already saw it do fine.",

We know that frequency of listing on coins is much more higher compared into those previous years and since this market is flooded out with tons of coins then you would expect that delisted coins would be increasing too.",

They operate with specific goals in mind, such as meeting profit targets on a timely basis; if a coin already listed has little trading volume, it means that people have stopped trading the coin, which means the exchange is not benefiting from it; keeping such coins is not a good idea for business reasons, so they delist such coins and list new ones to keep their business running.",

We just have to keep an eye out for the good ones and ride the market. That's true; I keep seeing new tokens popping up every single day. Many might get delisted, but hundreds, if not thousands, are being founded every single day. Even though their delisting isn't necessarily an unpleasant thing—perhaps quite the opposite—because the majority of these coins are either failed memes, scams, poorly developed, or zero-purpose coins, my best guess is pump-and-dump ones with no actual volatility, which are a plague for altcoin reputation. However, it's not like we're seeing major altcoins being delisted from reputable exchanges or CoinMarketCap; we probably haven't even heard of most of them. So personally, I don't see how someone can be affected by that unless he has invested in one of those coins himself.The SEC lawsuit against Binance didn't help either, as it had to delist some pairs that involved USD, and if I'm not mistaken, some more EUR pairs were also removed a few weeks ago due to low trading volume, not really an issue if you ask me, since you can still use USDT or any other major stablecoin.",
