If this is what you are looking for then no, there is no such service or project. Rather you can encrypt your private keys with a password during create a paper wallet that I always discourage to use. Better use a hardware wallet that allows you to store your passwords like a password manager.",

I've never heard of such I am just curious and thinking about a possibility.What exactly is user passwords?If you are talking about password login details for websites, than this is possible with some hardware wallets but if you lose that wallet or it gets broken, you will lose access to your websites.You can even use Fido 2FA with Trezor and ledger hardware wallets, but again if you lose wallet you lose access, so it's better to have backup device.For password managers I would suggest using something like opensource KeePass software, instead of using hardware wallets.If you want you can generate 12 seed words offline and use them as password for KeePass.Quote from: jackg on September 03, 2022, 06:35:30 PMI've heard of using hardware wallets before: https://trezor.io/passwords/I never tried it because you must install their extension to use it, and it only works for Chrome browser I think",

I've never heard of such I am just curious and thinking about a possibility.You can use bitaddress.org on an airgapped device. You can use this guide:How To Run The Bitaddress.org Tool In A Secure Offline TAILS Temporary Live Boot SessionTo generate the encrypted private key while using bitaddress html fileClick on paper wallet, input the randoms characters until it is 100%, click on paper wallet again, check BIP38, input the passphrase and generate. The private key would be encrypted and it stars from 6P.But I will advice you to just use a seed phrase wallet instead, like electrum. You will run electrum on airgapped device, add passphrase while generating the seed phrase. Adding passphrase is known as salting, not encryption, but it is good as encryption.You can also use iancoleman.io/bip39/ html file (https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases/latest/) on an airgapped device, you have to include the passphrase, esle it will only generate normal wallet for you. Or you can use any other reputed seed phrase wallet.",

Trying to give it a generous reading, and flipping your question around, it seems like you're asking: \"Can a private key be derived from a password?\"If that's your question, then the answer is yes and the term you're looking for is \"brain\" wallet. One obvious technique (there are many) is to simply hash the password to derive the private key (e.g. SHA256(\"ChosenPassword\")). Any sequence of steps that results in an integer > 0 and < N (the group order of secp256k1) will work.Don't go rushing off and using this however, because the security of any such scheme is limited by the password, and people tend to pick rubbish (low entropy) passwords. Only risk funds on addresses generated this way if you really know what you're doing.",

Why not use a tool called OpenSSL? This is usually used for encrypting or decrypting private key files(with your private key).You can encrypt it with aes256 and there is a guide on the youtube how to do it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij4hagieFjc",

I've never heard of such I am just curious and thinking about a possibility.A private key is supposed to be generated using cryptographically secure PRNG to make it impossible to guess or reproduce by an unfortunate accident. In most cases, the passwords that users generate for different websites aren't as secure as a random 256-bit number, which means encrypting them into a private key only makes your coins vulnerable to a hacker's attack because low entropy takes little time to reproduce in case specialized software is employed. When dealing with cryptographic keys, avoid human brain-generated data at all costs because such a practice doesn't allow cryptography to reach its full potential in protecting sensitive data. Any cryptocurrency project that promises you to make a secure wallet using \"convenient\" data is likely lying and probably wants to steal your crypto because cryptography is not about convenience and making everything human-readable, it is all about security and robustness. Don't fall into the scams like that, follow standards instead because they were thoroughly tested and proved their reliability.",
