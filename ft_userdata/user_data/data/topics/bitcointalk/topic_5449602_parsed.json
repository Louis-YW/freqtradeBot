  "content": "I discovered a love playing pool games since I had the opportunity of visiting the centres where these kind of games is played. I went with a friend and had to watch and learn from them as they played strategy against strategy. I have thought of ways I could link this game to Bitcoin inorder to sooth the demand of those who love the game and want to play non stop by not being disturbed by fiat payment systems and other fiat rules while playing. One way to link the game of pool with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is to however become an entrepreneur and hereby incorporate a cryptocurrency payment system into the pool game.Am not talking of online playing, but offline, with the real board and sticks used. Here are some steps one could take to set up a cryptocurrency payment system for your pool game, incase one has an interest in such kind of business endeavour:1. A cryptocurrency payment processor system that fits this kind of need may include selecting between several companies that offer this kind of cryptocurrency payment processing service. Some are CoinPayments, BitPay, and Coinbase Commerce. 2. A payment button or QR code would also need to be added to the game interface so that the system of payment can be functional.3.  A cryptocurrency wallet to receive payments from players would also need to be setup. This can be a software or hardware wallet, depending on your preferences.4. By publicizing the availability of cryptocurrency payments, players or users will be in the know of successful use such a system, and this should be done by paid adverts or free(if any) by word of mouth or any other means one knows best.One important thing to note is the volatility of the crypto market. Where this is taken into consideration, the option to set up price alerts notification, using a stablecoin like Bitcoin, or better still converting cryptocurrency payments to fiat currency immediately upon payment might have to suffice.Any thoughts?",

For a pool game, I am unsure it is necessary.Quote3.  A cryptocurrency wallet to receive payments from players would also need to be setup. This can be a software or hardware wallet, depending on your preferences.I am not sure if you already use Payment processor service and you will have to use their given wallet for your account or have to connect supported wallet to their processor service.Quoteusing a stablecoin like Bitcoin, or better still converting cryptocurrency payments to fiat currency immediately upon payment might have to suffice.

      "body": "Almost pool game is one of the most famous individual games in the world, and therefore there are a lot of billiards games, and then all the ideas that you use is that you will add a way to make payments or profits for users and not add to the game.The same idea is one where you will have a payments system that checks for coins.Once those coins are verified it updates the database for the user with the requested rate.The opposite is true when you withdraw your coins as the debited balance will be checked.All in-game operations will be centralized and not related to Bitcoin.",

I use it often and have never had a reason to fear market volatility affecting my coins in total. However most persons are used to BTC and others, hence why I had to dwell on btc to buttress my points.",
