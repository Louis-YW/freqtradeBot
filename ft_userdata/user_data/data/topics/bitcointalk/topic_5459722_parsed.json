How about people who borrow money from you and never return it or even show any effort to make payment back to you, how did you go about the situation?It depends on the part of the world you are from because 80%+ of the population of a developed country are financially sufficient and do not border others and if anyone is looking to get a loan then he can visit the bank and pay some interest but for personal loans, I think that is near zero chances. But that doesn't eliminate the place of gifting others if you have and you really know their in need of that money also instead of borrowing from people,  only gift them what you can afford to let go that way you won't be hurt if they never pay back the loan because most people won't pay back such loans.",

For the case of family members or very close friends, I give them without expecting it back.If I feel like I can't afford to lend out the money I have, i just simply tell them that I don't have anything I can lend out at that moment. If they offer any form of tangible collateral, then well and good.",

I understand that you may want to assist them and that them asking you is putting you in a difficult position, but it's not you who is going to solve their financial issues. I've also lent money to a few people in the past or done similar favors for them, such as ordering them something from the internet, without having received the money beforehand. The latter got me in trouble twice, but I learned my lesson. I had a so-called close friend who took over a year to repay me. I still had the goods he ordered, but they were worthless to me. The only people I've borrowed money from were in my immediate environment and couldn't avoid me forever if they had such intentions. You shouldn't be ashamed to say no; you're not to be taken advantage of. Help only those that you trust; if you're having second thoughts about someone, just say deny. You're also working your money; it didn't grow on trees.",

And there isn't that big circle of people that I would lend money and have my trust. You know, when things comes to money, people often change into bad side. And if I would get request to borrow really significant amount of money, something like $5000 - $10 000, then I would suggest him to go to bank.So, usually I get requests from friends to borrow something like $1 or $2 when they don't have cash and want to take coffee from vending machine .",

I provide for my kids but that's it, even they aren't demanding money from me. My friends can be broke but they don't accept charity or debt. I might offer them drinks etc but giving too much is embarassing for everyone. And i totally understand why it's hard to accept even free given money. It leaves this feeling of debt. And after that every time we see they would need an excuse why they haven't paid, so they will start to avoid me.Debt has ruined friendships, just like hiring your friends and being their boss. It ruines a balance of equality. It shouldn't but it easily does.",

It is not possible to help everyone, so how do you handle it and make sure that giving and trying to help people do not turn into a problem for you. If they're asking for a certain amount of money, give at least 1/8 or 1/4 of it or any amount that you think is fine for you. In that case, you're able to get rid of them and they won't come to you asking money again. That's going to save you a lot of money and stress from them when they're trying to poke you that you've got money and you're not allowing them to borrow. And the money you'll give to them is no longer a loan but a willing give so they won't approach again in the future.

They think that they're able to escape from asking them for a payment but I am thinking that they will never get close to me ever again.",

Perhaps you need to consider restricting the amount progressively so they understand that it will eventually dry-out so they start looking for alternativess.",

If you want to give everybody that ask, you will end up in debt. It is good to help those that are in need but you should do so based on your capacity. You should have a budget of how much you can give out to relatives and friends. Do not exceed the budget because you need to save for your future. If you spend all your money on people, you might not get the same financial help when you need it. Politely tell them you don't have and inform them when you can afford to help.

You can ask for collateral if the person is not trustworthy. Borrowing is also like gambling, only lend what you can afford to lose.
