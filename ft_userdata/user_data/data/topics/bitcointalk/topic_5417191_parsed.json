I'd have about 4 drinks and go home... I wanted to do better things with my time. Next week I had three, next week two, next week one then just spent the time in the gym. Kind of let me say goodbye to it and do something else. There isn't no right answer just what is going to reasonably work for you. Anticipate setback and keep trucking forward.Good luck!",

But had to make a conscious effort to stop by trying to keep where I left.",

      "body": "My bad habit is always lazy to do something sometimes. To force it is full of obstacles. Why am I lazy, because I always think negatively about an uncertain future. But after much thought, I always advise myself that laziness will only lead to badness. When other people work hard, I get lazy. Therefore I advise myself and impose my laziness.I think to get rid of bad habits and the way to deal with them is to force yourself. Also always advise yourself. Will those bad habits make you worse in the future? If yes, then leave.But from my experience, pushing myself but the body is tired. I think you should rest first. If you continue it will make your mood will be restless. Unless you enjoy it.",

Since they need their daily (quality) walk to be fit and healthy and there's no other option but walking with them, it has proven to be the best way for me to remain healthy. Taking good care of others always provides some perspective about our own health. I think that taking diary walks improve your life in every possible way and playing with your dogs, spending time outdoors with them, taking care of their nutrition, will help you gain some consciousness about your own. Of course, it only works if you take care of your dog properly, hehe.",

      "body": "Good and bad habit lies on your self-concept, its like the processor of the human body and it controls how we think and behave. The things we say to ourselves records on the subconscious mind and as well affects our habits. If you think about good habits or repeat this to yourself \" I won't eat junks again\"  4-5 times everyday. It'll trigger your self concept through the subconscious mind to stay conscious of eating Junks. In the past, I had an addiction on women, I fought that bad habit for months to no avail. But, after spending a month with friends that rarely discuss women or indulge in sexual activities the urge in me stopped and for 3 months now I've never felt like going back to that habit. Same thing applies to everyother habit you may be fighting. Get closer to people who are not in the same condition with you and soon your self-concept will change towards the way those people think.",

You must join the good habit people as soon as you've made the decision to develop excellent habits. The individuals we live with always create these behaviors into us, as we can all witness. Therefore, no matter how someone was raised with excellent habits, if people surrounded you are with bad habits, their habits will undoubtedly change you, so your habits depend on the kind of people you surrounded your. You will benefit by altering the group of individuals you were previously with.i had a friend doing my college days which was not that good in academic do to he don't t like reading and all is  his were same type but when his parents discovered that, they changed his school and took to him another school  hostel, so he can stop living with those set of friends at home. when he got to the hostel he make friends with new set of people and it was lucky that he make friends with serious students and this studends like reading and that is how  my friend started abiding to the new  friends habits by then, before he finished  college his performance change seriously, in fact it was among the five best in the college.",

Trust me, it really works if you have a strong willpower. But let me dig this topic deeper, I think the most effective way to \"execute\" what you plan to do is to empty your mind. Too many people are reluctant to do things because they are lazy and lack of motivation. If you empty your mind and do things like a ritual, without thinking about \"the thing\" itself, it will be much easier to perform any task well. Take me as an example, when I was a little boy, my older brother used to teach me how to exercise like push-ups, sit-ups, punches etc. I was not very willing to do that at the time but did most. A few years later, I was so used to doing exercise and began to see it as a everyday ritual. Even to this day, 30 something years later, I still do push-up or sit-ups before bed every night. Do I feel anything when I exercise ? Nope. My mind is always empty and my body just flows with rythme. Hope you'll understand.",

To be honest, giving up alcohol is not difficult because at first I was just a social drinker or drank with friends or on certain events, but getting rid of porn requires a lot of effort, but masturbation is different, subconsciously it's human nature to get the sensation of pleasure in an orgasm. himself and if done in the \"right\" levels it is very, very useful for the body.Bad habits that are ingrained are very, very difficult to get rid of, especially if it's been a long time, we must have commitment and a sense of fighting negative feelings. Using the 1 percent principle, we can change ourselves slowly from small every day, the results will get bigger.what I do when I get rid of bad habits:1. Self-reflectionCheck which things you already need to stop running and stop getting used to.2. Get out of your comfort zoneStart something new..3. Self-controlMust know to stop against bad things.",
