Exchange back then is not yet requiring KYC verification on there account while most of the exchange on that era was already closed and only few that still operating. This case is very hard to do solo and probably the Bitcoin is already spent since its already 7 years if the date on his post was legit.@OP, you need chain analysis service and cooperation with your local authority to make this witch hunt possible because the transaction is not fresh anymore. This is huge amount so I guess the authorities will entertain you.",

      "body": "1. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, as long as they are confirmed. And yours are confirmed for years.2. Your story doesn't add up, that wallet has many transactions, last one is not 800 BTC3. If your \"wallet\" has a name, instead of a proper backup and/or private keys maybe it's an account somewhere? Then you better discuss with that platform support, although since so much time has passed, I don't think that they can help.3.1. If your wallet was on blockchain.info/blockain.com, you may have been victim of phishing and then your account was emptied, although that would be done in one transaction, not more.3.2. If your wallet was on blockchain.info/blockain.com, you may ask separately support in the forum to recover it. Some can try to help, although it has 0 BTC on it. I don't know if the changed password is because of the hack or because things have changed at blockchain.com in the past years.4. You come with a lot of altcoins in the discussion - BTC, XRP - you are in bitcoin discussion here, you may want to ask about the altcoins in altcoin discussion, although if all those are on the same platform.. I don't know what chances you have.5. You cannot expect us dox anybody. That's against forum rules. That's police's work or maybe detectives'.",

Why would he only realise now that 800BTC has been moved from a supposed address controlled by him?I’ve seen it all before on this forum, I call BS.",

      "body": "IMO you kept too many shitcoins along with your bitcoins. You had BTC, XRP, BTS... all under a single password? I've never used a BTS wallet so I don't know the details of how it works, but there are some important rules you should follow with your money and you haven't done that. Maybe people who are reading it will see this story as a warning, because we won't be able to help you much.If any of you hold significant amount of bitcoins, make sure they aren't all stored in a single wallet and a single address. Divide them between multiple addresses and possible more than one machine to eliminate a single source of failure. A good advice is also to spend 1% of the money you're holding on security. In your case that would be as much as 8BTC, but I doubt OP spent 1. More likely it was 0.1.I can tell you what I'd do if I had the money OP held.1. Get myself an air gapped laptop with a physical hard drive, not SSD as they're much more difficult to recover. 2. Get a legit, clean copy of an OS, not something from a torrent3. Get a hardware wallet , the most basic trezor or ledger and put it in a waterproof casing.4. Get a fireproof safe with 3h rating or better. That's gonna cost you over 5k, but hey, you are holding millions. 5. I'd pick an empty room in my house, install a security system and put the safe inside with no furniture that can burn, only walls, floors and the safe bolted to the floor for maximum fire protection. 6. I'd never invite people to show them the room, never install any software on the laptop, never use any of the devices for any altcoins or to browse the internet. The whole setup wouldn't even cost me 1 BTC and would offer decent protection from all possible points of attack.If you hold more than 100BTC, don't be lazy and secure your wealth. It's possible that what you're holding is going to be worth more than 10 million dollars in a few years.",

      "body": "After going through OP, it's almost pointless going through any form of verification  on the addresses nor take steps to pin down this hacker as its almost impossible. Anonymity is oneod the ways od cryptocurrency and it goes both ends. As one can't tell who you are by just getting to know your address, most of all, an address and transaction from a time when bitcoin was extremely privacy concerned and your coming to investigate just now. I don't know how it works but, am seeing very little or zero possibility to the situation.Quote from: casinotester0001 on October 21, 2022, 09:10:23 AMQuote from: pmm9999 on October 21, 2022, 06:19:46 AMmy  bitcoin address is :  1Jk7GXyun2Cadvn2XfsBdSfPToa3KmZaeKIf you posted a signed message with that Bitcoin address, that would help you to find more people to get your BTC back.  Signed message doesn't help anything here aside from proving ownership. As it is, those whom are ready to do some diggings would but, there would be a dead-end. Besides, it's over 8years ago!",

You can directly try to contact some legal help department offering them this reward and they can take some action against hacker but why are you telling this after so many years? Sorry to say but in my opinion it's hard near to impossible.",
