I just realised he was right, just few days of implementing the idea, I have seen upto 3 topics pointing to it and not even by the newbies but established members.I do not see any problem with the \"OP\" implementation, whether on mobile or laptop. Even if you are too tired to check out the meaning of \"OP\" in the net, with a keen observation, you should be able to know what \"OP\" stands for, because throughout the discussion in any thread, only one user will have the \"OP\" inscription.",
