I mean before you calculate your stop loss / take profit one or two another min passes and very often your calculations become more or less irrelevant already. Tools like Tradingvierw's 'Long Position' and 'Short Position' would let me visually select levels but there is no like 'copy to order' what I've set in the tool. Or am I missing something ?ThanksMike",

Dear friend this is scalping and 1m time frame is very dangerous for inexperienced traders because the volatility is higher as price moves faster than your brains can calculate. Setting stop loss/ take profits require cross checking to ensure the prediction are right and 1m interval won't guarantee you that.",

If you do not see it on some exchanges, you have to go to settings to enable it.It will take some secons, less than a minute to also set the stop loss or take profit price after you have opened a position. Probably you are a newbie and not yet use to it.",

      "body": "Quote from: Zilon on May 24, 2023, 01:44:30 PMI understand the point Op is trying to ask not really about scalping techniques. I think he is trying to ask how to use stop loss or take profit immediately or simultaneously as the order is being queued in without either the stop loss or take profit being hit just as the order is activated. Well if my explanation is what is really in his mind, then I think I was feeling that way too in the past, maybe I searched for assistant on that through different means and trading platforms but as time went on I realized that the stop loss or take profit is being hit as fast as the order is taken because they are very close to the entry points. So what I do is to set them far from the entry point and afterwards I adjust them manually to the points I want it but I think this technique may not work well for a low time trader like scalper of 1 minutes or five because he may not meet up to the adjustment. You can set your stop loss or take profit at same time with your order but you can increase the space away from entry point and afterwards adjust to the point you desire.",

However just asked the question this way as this would be functionality that could be beneficial on any time intervals. Just set your strategy more in visual way, and then boom click 'copy to bet'. Â Thanks again for quick response.",

I believe that if you're going to trade even 1m timeframe you have to analyze the market. That's the reason to use tradingview and use the \"long position and short position tool so that you can measure price of your entry, stop loss, and your target profit. I have been doing that for a while now everytime I trade. And I'm sure that with the help of this method you can place order quickly in Binance.",

With very low time frame, sometimes you will not be able to set up your orders as you want. Even if you use a trading bot, sometimes there are problems from your bot or the exchange and lag will appear to make your wanted order won't be setup at a right time.Trading with too low time frame is more risky and if it is used with leverage, it will cause big loss.",

Dear friend this is scalping and 1m time frame is very dangerous for inexperienced traders because the volatility is higher as price moves faster than your brains can calculate. Setting stop loss/ take profits require cross checking to ensure the prediction are right and 1m interval won't guarantee you that. I agree that 1 minute time frame is dangerous but not impossible in the world of crypto-trading. The volatility can be your friend if you master it because it can give you enough profit in 1 min time frame. I have seen people who do trading based on 1 min time frame and they have been earning a lot of profits with that approach. The time-frame is not an issue the traders strategy is the main thing, if it's good then even 1 min time frame can be profitable.On the other hand there are people who do trading with only time frame that's over 4 hours and unfortunately most of them have to hold the trade for long time even with that duration. The trader who knows the secrets of the market and has mastered the volatility can earn so much from crypto trading. The thing is that such expert level traders won't teach others the way to master the volatility because in order to do that they have gone thorough many losses.If you closely analyze the market, you'll see many instances where a coin has been pumped and then that coin had given up many profitable trades even at 1 min time frame. But, sometimes there have been coins that got pumped and still they haven't shown many good profitable trades even of 5 min time frame. That's why it's an essential thing to master the volatility if you want to delve into risky trades, otherwise it isn't recommended to trade with 1 min time frame.To @OP like others have suggested it's very easy to set the stop loss/ and take profit with 1 min interval. I think it's possible to do such thing with Binance grid bot trading, but the thing is very risky and if you do it with 1 min interval then the chance of loss is very high. You should learn it first and do it at your own risk.",
