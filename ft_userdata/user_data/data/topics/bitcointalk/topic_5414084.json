I was wondering why the banner you've included on the thread seems to be familiar looking and it was because it's the banner being shown on the forum itself. Anyways, since you're already a copper member why not add some pictures and illustrations of your gambling platform on your thread to attract more users to the forum. I suggest that you change the title of your ANN Thread with something like \"ðŸ¥¥ BetCoCo ðŸ¥¥ -ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Bonus upto 0.5BTC a month ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ \" rather than the current title you have right now. Also, you can try to maximize your advertisement on the forum by starting a 'Signature Campaign' just like what I have below in my reply here. Again, Welcome to the forum and I hope your gambling platform to success. Cheers!",
