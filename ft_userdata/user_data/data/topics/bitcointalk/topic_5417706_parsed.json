  "content": "Really, it was way past time before it even started. What is the US doing over there, dupporting a nations just as crazy as Russia? As we stock Nato nations with arms, and then plunge them into poverty, and even take the American people along... why is the Ukraine so valuable except that they are a nation through which money is laundered... laundered to Biden, some Dem leaders, and big corporations.It's Time To Cut Zelensky and Ing-wen From the US DoleQuote from: http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2022/october/19/it-s-time-to-cut-zelensky-and-ing-wen-from-the-us-dole/To date, Washington elites and their politicians have been happy to provide – at public expense – lining their own pockets in the process.As of this writing, US aid for Ukraine has reached approximately $67.5 billion, a figure greater than Russia's entire 2021 military budget. According to the State Department, this support includes $15.2 billion in direct military assistance. The support comes although 60-70 percent of lethal aid never reaches the front lines, according to a now-redacted CBS interview with on-the-ground activists.Not only is the American taxpayer supporting much of the Ukrainian military, it is also supporting the Ukrainian government. The same working class Americans who were deemed \"nonessential\" in 2020 – who saw their businesses shuttered and burned down – now have to pay entitlement programs both at home and in Ukraine.As of September 30, 2022, the US has provided $13 billion in \"direct budget support,\" which is ostensibly used;…to pay government salaries, meet pension obligations, maintain hospitals and schools, and protect critical infrastructure[,] support continuity operations at the national, regional, and local levels, support for [sic] the health sector, agricultural production, civil society, [and enable] programs to hold Russia and its forces accountable for their actions in Ukraine....",

America only protects its interest. There must be something it is benefiting from Ukraine to want to defend it and make it go into senseless war with Russia. Mr Putin is crazy and can do anything to humiliate anyone who dares him. Zelensky should have known that bombing the bridge would provoke Putin more and it is the consequence of that action that we see now. Innocent people are dying, families are getting shattered just for those two unreasonable men.",

These are the same people who lied when they invade Iraq and now they also want to invade Russia but cannot do the same because they are against a superpower nation. There is obviously more to this war that we don't know about, it's safe to say that we don't need to take everything the mainstream media feed us.",

There is obviously more to this war that we don't know about, it's safe to say that we don't need to take everything the mainstream media feed us.In addition to what you say, America only protecting its interests that Maestro75 talks about, is really US government and big money attacking and conquering nations around the world, to grab their raw materials and make more money. Many of these nations are benefited from US aggression like that, but often many people have to die first. The US conquers nations through police actions and banking methods, rather than formal, direct war.The Ukraine war started because the US did a coup in the Ukraine elections in 2014. Since then, the US has been directing its puppet, Ukraine government leaders to start literally fighting Russian people in Ukraine, in the Donbas areas especially... killing and harming Ukrainian people, in that area, at the same time. The only reason why we know about the war is because US media has been telling us that Ukraine is good and Russia is bad. Russia's attack in February, was only a way to stop the war that Ukraine started in 2014.",

It is not only what am saying, it is a common knowledge discussion with most people. Those of us in Africa see whatever grant or aid the US sends to Africa as something that benefits the US more. America does not do anything for free. It is a country with trade by barter philosophy. Do for me and I will do for you. It first look at what it will benefit before doing it. May be it treats its own citizens differently, and outsiders differently.",

And the US is doing it all over the world.",
