Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersUsually, you ask these questions before investing and not the other way round, I have never heard of this TON project before now, and since you already invested I guess there is nothing more anyone can say, between I see about 3 projects with a similar ticker on coingecko so it is kinda hard to know which among them you are referring to. You should do your research more about the project before putting more funds, you know alts are risky investments.",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersThere is no need to invest more money, you need to make a percentage of the investment in altcoins or other forms of coins, because under certain conditions you can get out of the market chaos that affects any of the coins you own, therefore there is no need to invest a high percentage other than in potential coins, moreover coin growth has different levels and times, if we only focus on one coin, then the investment will not be maximized",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersWhy so many newbies often find coins very strange and they are not talked about much by other investors. They are looking for something that can make them rich fast, but do they think about the risks they are taking ? I'm completely unfamiliar with the coin you're referring to, I advise you not to invest in it if it is not top coin.Quote from: Anonylz on July 20, 2022, 03:34:46 PMI see about 3 projects with a similar ticker on coingecko so it is kinda hard to know which among them you are referring to. You should do your research more about the project before putting more funds, you know alts are risky investments. When I search on CMC, I see only 2 TON tokens, so I don't know which one the OP is referring to. However, the overall potential of 2 tokens is zero.",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersI'm not sure if this is what you mean, https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toncoin/Well, I'd never see its huge market potential and it was a risky investment (new project). And since you already have some, just keep it but never think to add more and also think it gives you a good profit. Before investing, tried to look at the performance of the project in 1 month and 1week, at least you have some idea of what possibly it happens next. Don't rely on the news as likey they are just FUDs and manipulated.",

Just wanna see whether people are still interesting with this project. The project is so bad for me now. People already forgotten it.

Anyway, this project, in my opinion, is not gaining enough popularity, and I thought it was over until the time I read the comments here, and it seems that there are still those who support it. Personally, I would not encourage investing in it at this particular time because no one knows how long this stagnation will last.",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersI'm confused about which TON project you invest, in because as far as I know, the original TON project that represented the Telegram Open Network (TON) was already canceled due to legal reasons so in that case, I am pretty sure that the TON project you mentioned is not the TON of Telegram, thats why I don't think it will be a big prospect since the investors interest is not that big compared to the previous Telegram TON project.",

TON is not getting hyped again. The trading volume from both were decreasing a lot that means if people didn't interested anymore to bought the projects that didn't even have promising future. You must be careful when trying to buy some coins like TON coins. Both were not even reliable to be called as a blockchain coin. The mechanism is very complicated for adopters to use it. Both were failed blockchains.",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersTo find out the potential price of a crypto asset, we must first know its utility and use-case. After seeing the explanation about Toncoin from the official website, I got several conclusions, such as Toncoin is better than Ethereum 2.0 and also Solana in terms of Blockchain analysis.In addition, these Toncoins also already have their own ecosystem which we can see in its entirety on this page. IMO, this Toncoin is quite promising to invest because in addition to the many utilities and use-cases, this Toncoin is also the native token of the Telegram application.References:[1] https://ton.org/[2] https://ton.app/",

Besides, many projects on Telegram have tipping bots, like 0xMR, so TON integration is not as important as it sounds. I think the end goal is to make Telegram a crypto wallet.",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersIf you asking for Toncoin (TON). then i will advise you do not invest much money on there. TON token already listed on FTX, GATE IO, OKK and more good exchange. But its demand in the market is very low.  Despite being listed on good exchanges, its trade volume is relatively low. So you shouldn’t invest your big fund here. You can bought TON for small amount if you are interested on it. but do a better research before investment",

Really want to hear the opinion of some more experienced tradersThere are a lot of coins that calls themselves TON. Not sure which you are talking about.The original and popular project from Telegram founder called TON (Telegram open network) was abandoned after lack of progress and it's initial investors were refunded. There's no more TON tokens from telegram. That is why, investing in any coin called TON looks like \"just giving\" your money to dubious individuals who are trying to use this name for their own selfish purposes. As already mentioned, project from telegram TON is officially closed, which means that any project using a similar name should be avoided. Of course, if you are not ready to give away your money to everyone without the hope of getting it back. I would not recommend that you invest any more money in this and would try to get rid of this dubious asset. Whether to listen to my words or not is up to you.",
