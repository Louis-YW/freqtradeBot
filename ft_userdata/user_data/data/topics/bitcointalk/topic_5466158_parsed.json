      "body": "If it's easy to make $1k a day with whatever bot you're discussing through that bot then I have to agree with SSNPVA of doing that to yourself first. And when you're able to earn as much as that amount on a stable basis then that's when you can share or much better to keep that to yourself and work silently until you become tired and a millionaire.Most rich people does have a thing to share but they don't really share the trade secrets that they've discovered. Well, I don't wanna read an article like that so it's just based on my perspective about these people sharing how much exactly can one earn through this and that method.",
