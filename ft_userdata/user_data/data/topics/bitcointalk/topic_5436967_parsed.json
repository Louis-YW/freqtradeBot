But from the past sequence we should understand how it works even though we don't have to trust it with 100 percent but at least 75 percent of bitcoin history shows to be true about it price movement. We should always understand the types of investment we are making, those who chooses short time may sell of their assets within their predetermined date likewise to those with long time investment, but due to fear they sells without waiting for the maturity period or time.",

Yes.. That's the concept many new crypto investors faces, that' is, investing an amount you can't afford to let go for a long while, or quickly rushing to sell your BTC due to fear of the volatile market nature. Because one thing about crypto (and most especially Bitcoin investment) is that it's best for long term investment. Because imagine you had bought 1 Bitcoin on 1st January 2023 at $16,556, by today you should be boosting of a whooping sum of $22,900 (I.e profit of $6,344).",

In most cases it is a good idea to sell your altcoins even at a loss because they are not known to go back up again specially when they are coming down from a big pump. But when it comes to bitcoin, the selling part even at a loss is not the problem. The biggest mistake people make is not buying back when they see the trend reversal like these days.",

There are people who, in the very beginning, made some quite normal transactions related to Bitcoin, and today they do not seem very logical because the value of BTC has changed - so that famous pizza was paid as much as 10 000 BTC, which seems incredible from today's perspective.The fears that people have are sometimes justified, but the news that the price of BTC will fall to zero or something similar should never be considered as something that affects our decisions, because it turned out to be only a good tactic to scare weak hands. Sometimes it's good to trust your instincts and not rely on various unreliable news, 90% of which is usually garbage that attracts you with some clickbait headline.",

Yes, the price varies and the price could have been better if I didn't sell at all. But we do have different situations to face and circumstances that we need to solve. And even if we want to know and sell at the top, there's no way that we will accurately know that the price of bitcoin or any altcoin you have is already at the peak or top.",

But in the case of Bitcoin there are reasons why a hodler might decide to sell his/her coins despite the fact that market is going pretty well most of the reasons have already been listed in Op while another that I have experienced is because of some personal issue. Although one shouldn't regret when he/she sells off his holdings too early, they should just take it as a sign that it wasn't their time to make profit from the market. Recently, I have seen most persons selling off their holdings just because they believe that the price of Bitcoin is still going to drop back to $15,000 or even lower so for them not to miss the opportunity to buy more they're already selling.",

They've got the right to sell or hold. Assume bitcoin was centralized such that when it gets bearish nobody is allowed to sell. Nobody would have loved bitcoin, but the profit rate would be higher than what we have now. Hence, bitcoin is not designed this way, and nobody should regret for not being able to control themselves. I mean after different experiences of how the market works. And, I don't see why people are afraid of watching the market, such people indeed don't want a return for their money. So, when they see their wallet or assets going down, its simpler for them not to hold, because they've not read about the market. Instead of profiting they lose out money, as they'll buy more bitcoin at higher rates.",

There are some coins that their price can become zero and the coin become a dead coin. Some coins even do not need its price to go to zero before investors will lose all their money, there are digits that are lesser than 1 like 0.00001 which can make the coin become useless as people dump the coin.",

I try to hold as much as possible but the price won’t stop dumping while I really need the money as soon as possible. Good thing that there’s lending section in this forum that helps me to get emergency fund through the loan and makes my coin as collateral. This way I can still hold my position even when the price still dumping while I got the funds I needed for my emergency.In the end I manage to repaid the loan and get my collateral which already pump since I just hold during the dip. I bought it on the dip but the price still dipping that’s why I’m confident that it will recover later on. @Darkstar helps me a lot for continuously providing a loan in times like what I experienced.",

Yes because just a few hours after I sold that asset, the price went up 20% more. I felt disappointed and asking myself \"What if I waited a few more hours before selling it? Then I can get 20% more than what I got when I sold it.\" Some questions are on my mind at that time. I felt regret, but what I'm only thinking at that time is that \"I regretted it, but there's nothing that I can do about it and after all, I can't predict the future and I didn't know that the price of that asset will go up even more.\" Currently, I'm ok now and I don't feel regret anymore and that 20% more profit? I will just get it thru dividends on the stock that I've bought.Overall, we've all experienced that scenario especially when the time has come for us to sell our assets for whatever reason it is. My advice for those who want to sell is that, if you want to sell your asset, don't look at the crypto market for around 3 days to 1 week.",

However, regret can also occur when we sell at a price we value quite high, but it turns out that the price does not return to fall and instead continues to increase. and when that happens of course we will regret having sold it. But still we shouldn't panic in a rush to buy back when the price has gotten too high (FOMO). usually actions that cause us to regret are actions taken without careful analysis. that's what I experienced at the beginning. that's where the importance of studying technical and fundamental analysis simultaneously. and we also need to master our own emotional management. so that we can control fear and greed well. Fear and Greed are the most difficult emotions to overcome in crypto trading or investing.",

I say almost because if we had a big worldwide collapse of governments and currencies and countries falling into chaos, things like that could happen, but still it wouldn't be a literal 0, but low numbers, maybe only triple digits, like in 2015.
