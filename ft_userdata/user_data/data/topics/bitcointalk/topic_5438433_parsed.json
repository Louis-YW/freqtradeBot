I described this scenario in the thread where the whole loan action took place:Quote from: MuffinMaster on February 07, 2023, 01:34:43 AMThe only reason I can think of is that he wanted to start creating a positive credit history for the @goku88 account. Probably after 2-3 \"repaid\" fake loans, there would be an attempt to take a real loan from someone without collateral, because \"saiyan people have word of a stone.\"   , but of course he would simply disappear with the borrowed money.He got a lesson and learned not to make stupid mistakes. He will for sure try again, so this is example why everyone should be wary of loans without collateral.I think that's the most likely thing what Mr. Fraudster wanted to do.",

What if he used an alt account to negotiate via PM and then used this account to login and finalize the transaction?  I am trying to defend this hopeless high IQ dude who is lost in a world full of brainless attackers!  I mean, we just don't get him perhaps?
