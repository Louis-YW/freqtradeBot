At the moment, Turkey needs nothing but help from the world. The people of Turkey need help from the people of the world, be it financially, with medicine, with medical equipment. Meanwhile, various local leaders, including the Turkish president and prime minister, have requested assistance. We, the people of the world, should stand by the Turkish people as much as we can. Always remember that man has appeared on earth to help man. Great sages have said that serving people is the ultimate religion.",

May we sympathize with human suffering. I have not created this post for merit, but as a Muslim, I have made this post to convey the suffering of my Turkish Muslim brothers/sisters to everyone in the forum. If there is any objection to this post, I will delete it very soon.",
