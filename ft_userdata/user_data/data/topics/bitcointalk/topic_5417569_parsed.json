Also, Bitcoinbloem reports that they will soon launch another product that will use the heat from Bitcoin miners. If promote bitcoin adoption, then would like more of these methods. Great example.One mistake that individuals and governments always make is they run away from challenges. Bitcoinbloem has decided to be an example of what creative thinking can produce. They have converted people's fears into uncommon opportunities. This project also helps to purify the environment because these plants would produce oxygen which is essential to life. This firm is also helping to put smiles on the face of sick children and the elderly by raising funds to finance the kind gestures of sending some of these flowers to them. This firm has proved beyond doubt that Bitcoin can touch people's life not only financially but socially and emotionally. Most governments that are anti-Bitcoin are closed-minded, therefore they are unable to see the beauty and opportunity in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Heating with miners is the idea almost as old as mining itself. People tried to heat homes, greenhouses warehouses and workshops and so on. In 2020 there was an article about a mining operation in Sweden that partnered with some vegetable growers to heat their operation. It's great that they're popularizing bitcoin among small business owners because they could be growing flowers with mining heat and not be this vocal about it but they're trying to make people familiar with mining.",

BitcoinBloem is an example of a great bitcoin adoption where, due to rising gas prices for heating greenhouses, an economical business plan was developed in which greenhouse heating was provided with the help of bitcoin minersThis is in Netherlands so I guess this is why they use it for flowers like tulips I guess that instead of flowers they could also grow food like fruits and vegetables, and this could be done in especially in cold regions.Mini greenhouse heated by bitcoin miner could easily feed a family, all they would need is reliable power source and they would get double benefit.",

      "body": "The future of the project is bright because Bitcoinbloem has managed to test and prove that Bitcoin mining does not have to be wasteful for energy consumption and that different industries can join together and complement each other. It will continue to receive international advertisement and attention as time moves on. The project may also be scaled up to produce various other products, such as vegetables. It could also be used to grow other plants that require special care and attention, such as medicinal herbs. The project will continue to grow and expand, as more people become aware of the benefits of using the technology. This means that Bitcoinbloem is not just a one-time project, but something that can become a long-term contribution to the crypto community and society in general. I wish them all the luck and success they deserve.",

It must have been inflation that gave rise to this useful discovery as the rise in gas price  keeps soaring. Another experimentation is the use of the same heat from bitcoin mining to generate artificial heating reptile farming specifically snakes has they need heat to survive.  Basically it is an essential care procedure for snake pets as they tend to pass away if they get too cold because the stop eating in the process.",

Further the heat released out of mining into the process of growing flowers  is good. This techniques were already implemented, here everything is done with perfection. Accepting donations for elderly, ill kids in the form of bitcoin is another thing appreciable. This means they care for the environment as well as for the society.",

To be honest, if this kind of mining farms increases then the Bitcoin heater's mouth will be shut down. Because the major blame regarding energy consumption for Bitcoin mining. But they are using renewable energy to mine Bitcoin and flower gardens helping nature & climates. This is the best example even which would adapt Bitcoin worldwide. If I had the ability to visit their farms then I would love to do so. Hope more crypto entrepreneurs would be interested in mine Bitcoin this way.",

The Netherlands is a cold place and it's perfect for crypto mining because you don't need cooling ventilation there's no waste energy there because the heat of mining equipment can be used in flower gardens which is people love flowers which makes them happy.  It seems this is very useful because from this month until January next year will start the coldest month, AFAIK, January is the coldest month which is approximately 35°F and a high of 40°F.It's true there's a greenBitcoin.",

      "body": "I'm going to burst some bubbles This looks more like they're using Bitcoin as PR than anything else. First, they sell 21 Lalibela tulip bulps for €41. I checked another website, and for the same price I can buy 6 times more bulbs (including shipping). So that's a massive profit margin.Allow me to share some history: Dutch greenhouses are quite famous, also international, and most of them are concentrated in Westland. The reason they grow fruit, vegetables and flowers in greenhouses is of course because it's very profitable. It's a massive industry, and they got quite wealthy out of it. The main reason: very cheap natural gas! They used to burn the gas just for CO2 and heat, while getting electricity for grow lights from the grid.Later, more and more of them switched to Combined Heat and Power (CHP), producing their own electricity: they burn the gas in gas turbines that power generators, create electricity, sell part of it back to the grid, and still get the same amount of CO2 (and a slightly lower amount of heat). Apart from being less polluting, the main reason was of course increased profitability. They basically became power companies.Nowadays, there's a CO2 pipeline from the Botlek industrial area, \"feeding\" plants in Westland greenhouses. They turn waste CO2 into food, which is a further efficiency improvement.Now back to BitcoinBloem:Quote from: https://www.bitcoinbloem.com/about-usGrown with miner heat, using electricity instead of natural gas.In januari 2022 a greenhouse saw natural gas prices explode. Trying to heat the greenhouse with conventional spiral heaters a more efficient and cost effective plan was proposed.I'm not buying it. From an energy perspective, a Bitcoin miner is nothing more than resistor heating. Even though 100% efficiency sounds like a lot, it's not. It turns high quality power into low quality heat, at a Coefficient of Performance (CoP) of 1. A heat pump could do about 4 times better, and basically any other heat source would be more efficient too.If they would use the electricity in a grow lamp instead of a Bitcoin miner, they'd get the exact same amount of heat. But the light would also grow crops. And as much as I like Bitcoin, it sounds much less good when you say you use electricity that could have been used to grow food to mine Bitcoins.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 18, 2022, 07:09:44 PMThis is in Netherlands so I guess this is why they use it for flowers like tulips I guess that instead of flowers they could also grow food like fruits and vegetables, and this could be done in especially in cold regions.Even better: it can be done in warm regions, using natural solar light and heat instead of consuming fossil energy.",
