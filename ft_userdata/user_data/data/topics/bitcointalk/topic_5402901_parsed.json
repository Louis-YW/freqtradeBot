Please, you must have a line of sincerity regarding what you intend, you want to develop it, you want to sell it or you simply want to find unsuspecting people who leave some type of information, I have seen your attempt to sell it in another thread.On the other hand, the security is crap, the links don't work but what does work is the deposit button:Quote\"Pix deposit require confirmation(s) before being credited to account! support: ....@gmail.com\"Capture text:site luckyplayer.io________Domain:luckyplayers.ioRegistrar:NameCheap, Inc.Registered On:2021-08-23Expires On:2022-08-23Updated On:2021-12-04https://www.whois.com/whois/luckyplayers.ioPerhaps selling the domain would make more sense than trying to sell \"it\"/script/game",

No TOS and privacy policy page, this two pages are one of the most important thing of a gambling website, many got so many issues, get \"scammed\" because of not reading what is in the TOS.",

If you mean improvements relating to the game, you should hire someone familiar with the game code to check on the code. But if you mean about the improvement of the casino, you can hire someone who can rebuild your site from scratch into a new gambling game that will be different from the site now. Add more games to make it looks attractive and can invite more gamblers.",

What I mean is the background is not just plain black but a background that there's poker chips scattered around, a dice, a coin, a card or anything that are gambling related to make it look good instead of using black background. Make sure that the deposit and withdrawal are working with no issues or problems and 24/7 customer support or a Live Support would be good too. There should be a page in your site for Terms and Conditions, Terms of Service, FAQ, About or Rules and Regulations. Don't know if what I stated is in your site since I can't access your website even though I also use different browser and restart my internet connection yet I still can't access the site and this appears \"The site can't be reached\". Maybe you can start from that and does your site have license, if yes then is there a list of restricted countries in your site?",

Bright colors are a bad idea for casino webpages, since most gamblers are gambling online late at night.I prefer clean casino webpages, rather than flashy and full with images. Buying a casino script has it's pros and cons. The lack of uniqueness and originality can be seen as a flaw. I would remove the chat feature, since I hate using chat when I'm gambling, but that's just me.",
