  "content": "I was a professor. The college I taught at promoted violence against me. The college refuses to apologize for promoting violence against me. Colleges refuse to acknowledge that anyone other than me has done anything wrong (and no, I have not done anything wrong for looking out for my own safety). This is because colleges are evil, and everyone who has a college degree is a deplorable Nazi who just promotes violence as much as possible and needs to be locked up.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
