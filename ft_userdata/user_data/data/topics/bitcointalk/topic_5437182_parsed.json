      "body": "Any kind of stable coins are stick with fiat value e.g. USD, Euro, Yuan etc and it doesn't make sense to hold for long term amount because fiat is inflationary asset. If you hold any stable coins e.g. BUSD, USDT, real USD, real EURO etc the price is always $1 but every year the value will keep decrease since $1 right now is worth for 10 candies but the next 2 years your $1 is only worth for $7 candies.If you have purpose to convert your domestic fiat to USD or EURO because your domestic fiat's inflation is really high, it's better for you to convert it to gold. Gold is a store of value and it doesn't make you rich, but it can secure your wealth. But I hold Bitcoin because it's really safe and secure, also it's really have a bright future.",

Such coins have 2 problems:1. They are just as much eroded by inflation like the normal USD2. They are issued by private companies and this sector is not properly regulated; so you have to trust those companies they'll keep their word. As bitcoiner I was taught to not trust individuals / companies (plus the fact you keep your coins in centralized exchanges' pockets poses another risk).So you are under even higher risk than holding USD and also have your money eroded by (USD's) inflation. Not a good deal imho.What I suggest? Especially since you don't want to invest into Bitcoin I have no suggestion for you. But no matter, I don't like to tell people where to spend their money, they have to decide for themselves.If the money you're talking about is a lot, then usually a mixed bucket of investment vehicles is the key - bitcoin, real estate, gold, stocks, bonds - to allow your money grow (what you lose from one going down you may gain from another one going up). But if you have that much money you better hire somebody handle all this instead of asking from random people over the internet.",

So I already invested btc. What i meant is that currently the btc price is went up. So I dont want to purchase btc from higher prices. What Im trying to do is making a balance between volatile and stable coins to protect my assets. But I scare of the usd inflation bcz of long term. Maybe I have to wait BTC to goes down again and buy or withdraw my tether to bank account and purchase gold or stocks etc...",

If you want to save coins, you should use a noncustodial wallet. Always know how to differentiate between wallet and exchanges and know what custodial wallets are too, only use the ones you can control your coins which are the noncustodial wallets, use only the trustworthy noncustodial wallet because some can be for scammers.",

Clearly one of us is wrong, time will tell which one of us.Imho the price didn't go up that much.I understand that you are scared of inflation. But you're also afraid to take risks in investing. This being said, you're in a deadlock/no-go situation. I mean that there are 2 possible directions and you don't want neither of them. So.. I am not sure what you are expecting to find out...Do you want us tell you \"buy bitcoin, it will certainly go up from now on\"? We cannot do that, we don't have crystal globes. Our expectations is one thing, reality may or may not go accordingly.",

Unforeseen expenses may arise anytime. Apart from that, it's also better to have a standby amount for dips and corrections. 2. Depending on your savings amount, you could actually use a portion of it to buy more Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still cheap today. 3. Why don't you diversify your investment portfolio and buy other financial or even real assets aside from Bitcoin? You can also invest in gold, stocks, bonds, treasuries, real estate, and others. 4. You could use it for a business of your liking.",

But this is not means that it wont be devalued at the end of the year. There are some banks which gives interest rates for usd. Why there is no interest option for stablecoins like tether and busd?https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm 2000$ January 2022 is became 2111$ at the end of 2022 bcz of inflation.Maybe im gonna decide this: lets say i have 3000$ on busd and tether, i will wait for bitcoin dips and purchase by half of it. Other half will be withdrawn to bank account and purchase stocks or gold with them.",

Volatility hurts short-term planning, if Bitcoin crashes but you need to convert it to fiat, you could be forced to take a loss. Long term is also a problem, no one has any idea how much Bitcoin would be worth. All the models have proven to be wildly inaccurate. Price predictions from \"exprts\" are just baseless speculation and hopium.This is not to say that these two options have no place in anyone's portfolio. But portfolio should be diverse, so if one your assets fails, you are not completely ruined, as opposed to owning one type of asset. So things like gold, real estate, commodities should also be considered.But there are also differences between managing a $1,000,000 portfolio and $1,000. If it's $1,000 there's obviously going to be no real estate or gold, just keep it in some proportion of USD and BTC that you are comfortable with.",

The value of your stablecoin will be based on the value of USD which inflated in the long run. You can always sort out or figure out to put that money into bitcoin which has a fighting chance to increase its value. Im not saying its gonna be boom or 10x its price but a volatile asset which has a fixed supply would definitely be worth it in the long run.",

Buy a hardware wallet, like Ledger Nano X, and keep your Bitcoins and any other cryptocurrencies that you might buy for the long term in that wallet. Keep your private keys somewhere very safe and forget about that. With the remaining money, cash it out and buy some gold, and keep that somewhere safe as well. Gold will definitely be worth way more, than it is today, in the long run, and that will save your money from getting devalued due to inflation.",
