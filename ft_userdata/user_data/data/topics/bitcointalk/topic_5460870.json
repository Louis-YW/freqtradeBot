  "content": "Hello and Good MorningI've not been as active on here as I was a few weeks back, due to a couple of issues which are Bitcoin related.I'll cut to the case, I have been trying for ages to top up my Bitcoins by £60 (0.0026 BTC) and though I've passed respective KYC's for certain websites my payment keeps being declined (I have a VISA Debit card with enough money to pay for this transaction).My Bank (Co-Operative) are apparently okay with people buying Bitcoins, and have said it must be an issue with the people selling the Bitcoin (Simplex) and to try another vendor.  I tried Mercury.io and Moonpay - the same result, the former have said 'issue with card - payment unsuccessful' whilst Moonpay state 'we don't take VISA cards.'The Co-Operative are adamant that there's no issue with my card, and it didn't flag up as a payment which would concern them unduly.Whilst the people at Simplex and Mercury.io have been very good, caring and understanding, it is deeply annoying to know that despite me playing the KYC game I can't get the Bitcoins which I want and it's been several weeks of back and fore.I don't like to ask people for things (pride and all that, I prefer to help people out where and when I can - I even had a message recently politely telling me off for trying to help a user out on Skype as I felt sorry for him) but if I could be helped out with a one time AND ONE TIME ONLY handout of 0.00261 BTC then I would be elated.  My terms would be:0.00261 BTC sent to my Electrum Wallet I will then pay back double (£120 or 0.00521 BTC) within 48 hours - please send me a Wallet address and I will ensure that you are paid back.This may sound strange, but there is a 'certain' website which sells old Wallets and with it old private keys - I would purchase one, empty it out and then pass £120 worth to the person who helps me out (I have an Electrum Wallet, by the way, therefore I hope your Wallet can accept payment from this Wallet).I appreciate that trust is often in short supply in this world, but what I have said is upfront and the whole shebang - if I could buy Bitcoins without hassle then I wouldn't be posting this, but every time I have tried to buy them there's always an issue and I don't like it, I'm tired of fighting the fates and I need help getting over this obstacle.  Once I'm over it, I will pay back double (and you can post in this thread to prove that I kept my word) and this will be the last time *TOUCH WOOD* that I ever need to ask for such a favour.  I hate asking for help, but I have no choice if I wish to get Bitcoins.  £60 or 0.00261 - that is the final figure I'd like (and indeed I need)£120 or 0.00521 is what I pay you back within 48 hours once I have 'swept' Bitcoins to that amount into my Electrum Wallet.Please help me if you can, if more than one person wishes to help then I'll pay them back in the same fashion.My Electrum Wallet address is: bc1q7837z8q9xkrushhm0azvlqlwu7ej8msts2jpx3Many ThanksGH2022",

      "body": "A very fair comment, one which I expected to come up, and it's up to the individual to say yes or no.I'm not going to plead, demand or beg and I respect the rights of people to say no.However, if I may ask, put yourself in my position:I have tried to be fair and played fair with Simplex and Mercuryo - I conformed to what they required, but they both let me down.I asked my bank if there was an issue - they've said 'there is no issue' but they are not prepared to talk with Simplex and Mercuryo and vice versa.  It is so stressful and is impacting my mental health detrimentally.I more than get the point 'well why should strangers trust you if you don't trust Paxful or Symlix etc.' but I have been honest about not wanting to be scammed there and I simply do not wish to lose money - yes it scares me, I'll admit it.By the same point, somebody might say 'well how can I be sure that you'll pay me back?'  I 100% get and respect that, and saying 'because I will' means little and the fact that I'm relatively new here does me no favours even though we were all newbies once.It's up to people to help (or not) and I can't do or say any more than what I have - some people may say 'ah but you didn't say this or that...' I won't make an issue of it other than say I am mentally stressed and angry at the moment with the situation and I can't see any other way than asking for help here and saying to whoever does help me to post proof in the future that I did indeed pay them back what I said I would.If you felt checkmated, you'd ask for help - that's all I'm doing and I wouldn't ask for anything again.  I've tried to help people on here when they've reached out, and now it's my turn - I hate asking but this is how it is.",

      "body": "Thanks for that, Timelord2067, and it's only fair that people should ask questions.I accept the scepticism, and look forward to proving that I keep my word if given chance.If people wish to ask questions then my DM's are open or I'm happy to reply below.It's a shame I have to ask - some people have replied with other on-ramp suggestions and the problem is still there... I've contacted VISA and their attitude is 'well if it works for normal purchases, there isn't a problem...'Like I said, well and truly checkmated:VISA - not interestedOn-Ramps - 'we're sorry but ho hum what can we do?'Bank - 'it's not our issue, you're okay to buy Crypto though...'Exchanges - no guarantee of trade and like others I too dislike scammers.Some People Here - 'Hmmmm....'I didn't come down in the last shower (it was the one before that) and I well understand people's safety concerns and truth be told I'd be saying exactly the same thing if the tables were turned.All I would say is judge me as a Human Being first - I am aware that others have lied, cheated etc. and some have gotten away with it which makes people sceptical and less likely to help.  I would prefer to help a person rather than hinder them, but yes I wouldn't like my generosity to be taken for granted.  I don't believe in judging people until I've got to know them and maybe one day I can return the favour.If there was another way (and it's quite plain now that there isn't) I would have followed that way.  I'm frustrated at the scenario and wish there was a way out of it, but unless I can get help I am well and truly stuck.",
