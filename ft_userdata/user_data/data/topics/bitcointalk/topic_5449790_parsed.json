Education is the search for knowledge, a colleagues defined it to me. He couldn't expatiate.

All laws of nature have similar results, and have been built into the various systems of the world, and are independent of each other. For example, the digestive tract operates in a unidirectional movement and it's true in animals. All animals passes feaces through an anus. This law is built into the physiology of the GIT, and so, sustains it. Laws such as Newton's laws of motion, Hooke's law of elasticity, and those in chemistry are all well established. Without these principles, all structures and systems will collapse instantly. And our success is dependent on our abilities to obey these laws. In short, nature examines us based on our knowledge of them. King David once said\" Because I know Thine laws, I am wiser than my teachers, and I have more understanding than elders\" (Ps. 119:99-100). The knowledge of laws actually makes you wise, wiser than your teachers.The rise and fall of currencies are dependent on financial laws, and I'm not talking about policies. Even in institutions, examinations are made to assess students on their knowledge of laws pertaining subject areas. And because natural laws are universal, an external examiner will also assess students based on the laws that were taught the students.",

Laws ensure every event can be replicated if all conditions are met, in any field. Being educated is a priceless gift that everyone desires. Many people may not place as much emphasis on education as they should since they believe they can get by without it. Being educated extends beyond the four walls of a classroom and into the real world. People acquire knowledge about something without ever entering a place of learning to learn. An illiterate nation breeds weak communication and development skills. No nation on the planet can exist without learning about the chronicle books of life. I'll state that education is a fundamental guide to success; without it, success is difficult to obtain. It is possible to become bored when learning and gaining information, but remember that only those who are knowledgeable have their opinions and sayings accepted in society and are in a position to make a difference and provide value.",

      "body": "Quote from: Jamala on April 22, 2023, 03:11:11 PM~Life is a never-ending education process; we always learn something new voluntarily or involuntarily. The only difference is that if we decide to voluntarily look for more knowledge to acquire, we tend to gain more and excel more than others that don't. The laws of this world, this universe and our entire existence in my opinion have invisible threads that binds them to each other creating an unending system/process that is still incomprehensible for the human mind. Although there are some that we may not have been able to discover yet and others that we already have a glimpse in but still have flaws in terms of theory and application, I believe that all of them are very significant for every living being and the progress of humankind. And for a single person, simply being aware or knowing about these laws won't suffice if that person is chasing for success or improving one's way of life. The thing that a person also needs and is vital to one's betterment which is often disregarded or ignored is the acquisition of wisdom which is the ability to discern the proper way to use all the knowledge that one has. Being knowledgeable about all of these laws but not being able to properly utilize them to one's advantage is the same as having no knowledge about all of these at all.And which better way is there to acquire wisdom than having tons of trial and errors then experiencing the success and failures firsthand?There is no better teacher than life itself, and educators should always follow its example; to not just focus on feeding their students/apprentices knowledge but also impart wisdom on them. And to a person seeking to excel in one's chosen fields of interests and endeavors, one should not be satisfied with the things being spoon-fed but instead strive for more to get the most out of one's efforts in life.- What a nice topic to ponder and discuss about.",

But no less important component are the laws of society. And it is this goal that seems to me to be more important for development in the modern world. A modern person can do without active knowledge of the physiology of the GIT, especially given that this information can be found and studied at any time. But without theoretical and practical knowledge of how society and individual communities function, change, and adapt, life is difficult.Knowledge of social patterns helps people understand how the world did and does function and what rules and principles control various aspects of life. It enables people to better understand and use the resources at their disposal and helps them make better choices and make informed decisions in various areas of life, from personal financial planning to civic participation and activity.",

The knowledge of laws actually makes you wise, wiser than your teachers.I have also gone through formal education and find it interesting and expository. Education exposes you to many fields that can expand your views and perception about life. But when education becomes just a pathway to gain a certificate to acquire a job, it losses its taste and goal. I have seen many educated people fail to practice what they have been taught in school. In my country citizenship education is compulsory. It is a subject that exposes educands to patriotism, diligence, honesty, and faithfulness. But it is quite disappointing to see that after this enlightenment professors are the main election riggers and graduate because of few dollars sell their conscience. Regardless of the technological, political, economically, advancement of education, if it doesn't lead to a just, safe, trusted, and egalitarian society (social development), it is a waste of time and resources.",

Observation states that the place of education can not be undermined in any form since education is the bedrock of human civilization and this has been reflected in the quality of life the individuals leave to a great extent, humans' productivity has depended so much on the level of their education. Must works of life have been categorized based on the educational qualification of the individuals and that determines how much they earn as annual income from jobs even on this forum there is what we call rank which almost equals the level of education of the members is the same as the outside world.
