Import these data in a excel sheet and filter them as your need.Transaction count cannot be used as reliable indicable how full is a block. Theorically 10 ordinal transaction (each with size almost 400.000 weight unit) could fill whole block. As for block size data, unfortunately it can't be used either (for this case) since it use byte unit, not weight unit.",

I only found about 40 blocks that were not full / 99% full in the past week.But, there are not 1440 blocks per week. There should be about 2016 blocks every 2 weeks (per difficulty adjustment) so every week you get in the range of 1008.So looking back from now till last Thursday, may be giving me a different number then you if you went back 10 days (about 144 blocks per day)-Dave",

For example setting the date to be in the past 1 day (27 and 28 of April) would show 163 blocks (10 showed + 153 more rows) and all of them seem to have near 4 MB weight which you can see by changing the sort based on Weight[1].You can change the date to a different period, for example if you set it to start from first day of April you can see there has been 3 empty blocks (with only 1 tx)[2] and by playing with the weight threshold you can filter the results even more[3].[1] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=time(2023-04-27..2023-04-28)#f=id,time,weight[2] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?s=weight(asc)&q=time(2023-04-01..2023-04-28)#f=id,time,weight,transaction_count[3] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?s=weight(asc)&q=time(2023-04-01..2023-04-28),weight(0..2000)#f=id,time,weight,transaction_count",
