  "content": "First I would say \"human needs are insatiable.\" Upon attending to some current needs, definitely others will arise. So, even if you spend all your earnings trying to solve every of your needs, that doesn't mean that other needs might not arise. Often times it's good to remind ourselves that we are still in the real world and have to come out of the world of fantasy.This is mostly concerned with people who have not really gained a strong grasp on wealth and finance, i.e., those who are not really financially stable. Although it concerns all, but mostly those who are less financially stable. Bitcoin investment doesn't require a pocket full of money before you can invest, but it's something you can do with in a peaceful mind and with no minimum or maximum amount. It also doesn't put restrictions on the amount of Bitcoin people want to buy or hold, so it's better to invest than to wait until you have finished satisfying all your needs before you think of investing in Bitcoin.I am not saying that personal needs, some challenges, and problems should not be attended to, but there are some secondary and tertiary needs that can be attended to later. Some people are earning well, but they want to settle all their needs before investing in Bitcoin or into something that will be profitable to them in the future. But even the needs they are trying to solve are unending, because the more needs they solve, the more they others evolve in a short time. For example, even if someone has $10, 000 in their account and they decide to spend all that money on the current problem or financial needs that they are faced with at that moment, the next moment they will still have some new needs and desire evolving, which also require attention, and by then they will still need more money to tackle whatever issue it is.So, folks, I wish to remind us to always keep to your budget, still hold on to your savings, and invest for the future. Don't always think you can use your entire savings to solve today's problem, forgetting that tomorrow's needs, desires, and problems are going to evolve.I shared this based on some mistakes I made a few months ago when I took a lot of responsibility on my shoulder and took out a whole deal out of my savings to solve some problems, with the hope that I would start saving again to cover what I had taken out, but... more needs even arise.",

      "body": "You have pointed out a good discussion. And you have made valid points too. I have a small example which will elaborate it more and it will be easy for many people to understand. You must have seen one or two topics related to above image in which OPs were saying that BTC is a great hedge against inflation and some were emphasizing that, investment is better then filling all wishes. This same example fits right in your topic too. Because one if have Iphone 14 pro max then he /she must think to buy Iphone 15 pro max while thia is just a wish not some need. But still people prefer to buy it instead they would have bought 0.03+ BTC. And that would increased their portfolio. The point is, one would say, he have saved enough now he wanted to fulfil his wishes but he might be wrong too. Because world has unexpected events for you which might become expensive so it is better to save funds and invest them so that they would not lose value over time due to inflation.",

When our problems are solved you are free from every mental stress and thinking, otherwise we need to introduced some saving methods whereby whenever your salary/salaries comes you should know how to handle it in order to be able to see your needs and wants when time comes, you might not channel all your income into investment because there are unforeseen needs and wants, that may arise and this are always crucial to be attended to.Though for bitcoin investment we may start involving ourselves with DCA, it can be as little as you can be  it $10 or $30, the thing is we should make sure that something very positive towards your investment are actually going underway by then you wouldn't know when you might have arrived at high place (succeeding have sufficient amount in your saving plan) that may be there for future preservation and to attends to your needs when the times.",

Using all the funds that you have today without investing it shows how shallow your financial mentality is because what has been spent can't be retrieved. This is why as long as you are earning, you should try and invest some fraction into bitcoin so that you don't misuse that money for irrelevant or unnnecessary things that will depreciate with time.",

But don't you think that they might have some other big-time project they wish to have launched, but because the total value of capital they need is not yet ready, they decided to still (keep it pending) make due with what they have archived so far, but they are still gathering more funds to pioneer a new project that can earn them more money?For example, I think Elon Musk has a project with Mars that is still in progress. It could be a desire that he wishes to archive, if everything is really in his power financially and otherwise, he could have just archive it overnight.",

We cannot be too confident in luck and just let the wave us wherever because we gave everything to the needs, wants, and problems of today.

It also doesn't put restrictions on the amount of Bitcoin people want to buy or hold, so it's better to invest than to wait until you have finished satisfying all your needs before you think of investing in Bitcoin.Needs and wants are different. Needs are basic supplies that are essential to survive while wants are usually acquired for pleasure. You don't need to starve or push away responsibilities because you want to save and invest. I know we need to make some sacrifices to help us save but if your income cannot cover your needs, don't even think of investing.  What you need to do is to seek other means to increase your income.

We can do without wants but we would barely survive without meeting our needs. There is also the ranking of needs to be met in the order of highest to lowest priority. In the OP situation we encounter dire conditions whereby it is only our savings that saves us. And this is usually the last resort. There will always be a problem to solve, a pressing need to be met to be able to escape the issue mentioned by the OP, we need to look towards multiple sources of income.
