Having said that, Ethereum has been the best altcoin for quite a long time now, with many Eth killers coming and failing, i have to select Ethereum as one of the best altcoins an investor can invest in; and if you are to choose Ethereum, then you don't have to buy any other coins because you think you want to diversify, you are only trying so hard to lose money, if you choose one coin, and you want to diversify, then you look outside of the crypto market for another investment.",

I don't know much about Apecoin, I only know it as it become the token of those that have made BAYC.Solana was like an Ethereum-like project but I see some flaws on it based on the news that I've read before.",

That's why I don't take risks and prefer Ethereum. It's the Bitcoin of Altcoins. Also, if I was too indecisive, maybe I would invest in other coins on the list, but I definitely wouldn't invest in coins like ApeCoin, Tron, and Shiba Inu.",

In addition, shiba and ape are 2 meme coins you should leave below and limit investing too much in them, prioritizing projects with more utilities.",

      "body": "Good choice of solid altcoins that has the potential of a good return. You can never go wrong with Ethereum. If went below $100 during the bear market in 2018 and look at how it goes up in the bull run in 2020-2021. Same with Cardano as well, it was just worth a cent that time and then suddenly exploded to more than $2.00.So I won't argue with your coins of crypto to hold and buy in this bear market. And I think that's about it, 10 solid coins and no more. Because it you added some, it might complicate things for you. Hopefully you also have BTC in your portfolio, as majority of us here hold mostly like 60% of it and then the rest was spread across solid altcoins that in your list.",

As for me, I would pick Ethereum because next to Bitcoin, it has shown huge potential for years. It has passed lots of tests over time so I believe that there are still lots of promising milestones that it could reach. It has a strong foundation so I trust it over other altcoins. Every altcoin mentioned in the list is really promising and assure with long term profiting. Among the list we've seen good growth with majority of the coins when calculated against price and the ROI. For now Tron is the only coin that is not moving big, but it have got its market capital and stay on the top. A break from tron is being much expected. For now my choice among those mentioned will be ethereum and Cardano.",

I just wanna to tell you now if you must aware the potential investment was a thing that is still undervalued or having low marketcap. If there was a coin that worth a very high marketcap and it's not worth to invest anymore yet we are in the crypto market. So, all of coins in your list have potential to increase even more since the bearish market have made them all to go down to the bottom. The only question is whether people aware about that or not if low cap gives more chance for your to make decent money. Putting majority of your stakes in solana or ape are good but solana was over valued on its marketcap",

But another alternative is cardano, their ecosystem and network will be upgraded, maybe by the end of this month if I'm not mistaken around in 22nd. Possibility, growth will continue to increase in the next year, because In August it was noted that projects built on this network experienced an increase.",

From your list, my first choice would be Ethereum its a must have altcoin, I held polygon, bought it when the Opensea and NFT hype, but I sold it a couple months ago. I never hold Solana but I use some of their dApp so I guess Solana is quite good, I would buy small amount later if I sold some of my asset. I am still holding small amount of Cardano, and it has give me a good amount of profit.  Never hold the other coins, I don't even know what is ApeCoin and Cosmos.",

Once the sharding upgrade is updated, there will be expanded, it will have no competitors, ethereum's previous competitors will be left behind.
