If they use it to gain support to people who use crypto then I guess yes, they take advantage on situation since they know that this is the weak point of their opponent since lots of people got angry on Biden crypto crackdown policy. And that's what Republican maybe want to change to gain peoples support.",

But between someone who openly supports crypto and someone who is trying to suppress crypto, who should we support since we don't have a third option? I'm also not an American citizen and someone becoming president wouldn't affect me at all. But if someone is a cryptocurrency investor and also an American citizen, I think they will know who to choose to give that politician a chance as well as give themselves a chance to have a better future. To vote for them, we need to evaluate many different factors, but if we ignore all of those factors and just look at the cryptocurrency aspect, there is no reason not to vote for Mr. Trump.",

It seems nothing will be changed for 2024 Election but hopefully next 4 years, the nation will find two better candidates for the 2028 Election.It's unimaginable that a big country like this, with many talented people (I believe so), have to rely on and look at two old politicians to fight each other for the Presidency.Quote from: acroman08 on July 09, 2024, 12:12:09 PMI am not American and I could really care less what their politics is like or who wins but I am pretty sure the mention of crypto and their plans to \"defend\" it are just a way to gain support from crypto enthusiasts. politicians love to say almost everything to gain support from the people and when they are finally voted into a seat they love to ignore what they promised.They will try to say many things, make many promises before the Election, but we know that politicians usually don't keep up their promises after they get elected. Both Biden and Trump will have a maximum 4 more years as a President and they no longer have to care what will happen after next 4 years. At least no second presidency after 2028 for them to think of.If their propaganda for 2024 Election can help Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, it's good but else, I am not surprised.Quote from: avikz on July 09, 2024, 03:39:20 PMTrusting a politician or trusting their election manifesto, is the biggest mistake you can make in your life.So true!",

US is a superpower country, whatever discussion there is will be a discussion for the world, so I think we need to pay attention to this, this narrative can bring the crypto market and Bitcoin to a better side.

An example is the fall of FTX and the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF, which had an adverse and favorable impact on the global crypto industry. So every crypto fan should be concerned about the US election and its implications. Quote from: cryptomaniac_xxx on July 09, 2024, 11:23:36 AMSo are you willing to \"Make America Great again\"?With the way Republicans are coming up with crypto-friendly manifestos, they might gain the support of the community. Trump had promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht and promote Bitcoin mining. I don't trust politicians so I see it as a means of gaining the support of the young crypto population and also getting donations from crypto companies. Argentine President Javier Milei made so many promises during his campaign, but we have seen fewer actions after he won the elections.",

It's laughable when I see Republicans will support the Americans to have the right to self-custody of their digital assets. Soon they might say that privacy is a right and mixers should be legal without KYC but that will change of course, this statement that's written in this PDF is a lure to my mind to get votes to win the election.",

If you look, Donald Trump said some time ago, in 2021, that this Bitcoin is a useless and a scam that affects the value of dollars, and now that the time for the election has come, now he has made cryptocurrency a topic to get his vote among the people. Like trying to do that means making false promises to please these people that I will do this and that for Americans, and so on and so forth. I am 100% sure that he will not fulfill his promises as president, he is talking in favor of Bitcoin just to get votes. Please guide me if I am wrong.",

Why do people continue fitting into this ridiculous dirty role of politician's sockpuppet? Is it an emotional deficiency? A necessity of belonging to a group to raise personal self-esteem? It's actually shameful for a crypto enthusiast to donate money to Trump or even cheer about this \"endorsement\" his campaign is displaying towards Bitcoin after he called Bitcoin a scam, just because he saw it as a threat against his beloved Dollar currency.There is no honor, no dignity.

      "body": "So basically they are promising to maintain the status quo under President Biden.This is very smart, since Bitcoin went up 500% under president Biden.What they don't tell you in the platform is that Trump represents a massive risk to the market:1. He has promised to deport 5% of the US workforce immediately, which will severely disrupt the US economy and send investments like Bitcoin into the toilet.2. He is promising to make abortion illegal nationwide (by default, for instance, in failing to defend against all of the frivolous lawsuits brought by the forced-birth faction). This will require a new police state like the US has not seen since the Prohibition (the Prohibition is the thing that created the FBI, for instance). Millions of women in the US get abortions every year and Republicans have vowed to stop every one of these \"murders\" as they have called them for decades, which of course means cracking down on the \"murderers\".  New Police State = Crackdown on Crypto because anything that allows people to make payments while evading the government will be a target for such a police state.3. Donald Trump is a convicted criminal with a decades-long history of prioritizing absolutely nothing but his own wealth accumulation. He presents a huge risk to Bitcoin since he could very easily make Bitcoin effectively illegal in the USA and substitute his own coin that he fully owns, yielding him billions. He could do this without Congress by simply directing some of his agencies to change the rules. 4. Donald Trump has a history of using his presidential pardoning power to free criminals who give him money. He pardoned Steven Bannon, who was convicted of ripping off Trump's own supporters, so Trump doesn't care what the criminal's crime is as long as they pay. That means Trump could be expected to free people like SBF if he's elected since he would surely have lots of money to give him. If the average retail investor gets wind that criminals are now free to rip them off, it will tank the price of Bitcoin because millions will flee the investment.Bitcoin is under extreme risk if they Republicans win in November. The safe bet here is to stick with what has worked extremely well for the market in the last four years.",
