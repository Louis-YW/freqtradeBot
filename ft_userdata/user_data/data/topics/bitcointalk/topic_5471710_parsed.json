The story in quote ..QuoteMy fiancee and I have been making arrangements for wedding, we are both contributing (saving) money because i know about his financial condition, in fact, i will say that i have contributed to about 60% of the total money in our savings, just for him to use nearly all the 5 million naira (approximately $5000) we saved to play betting and when i asked him about it, he said he was trying not to put all the wedding burden on me, that he thought he would be able to double the money.I am really speechless and confused, and i think it's best for me to call the wedding off, what will i even tell people that already know about our wedding plans? this is the most disgraceful thing that has ever happened to me. Even though i don't know this young lady in question personally, i felt true pity for her after coming across and reading her confession, i know how important weddings are to women and for the fact that she herself joined the man in saving, and even contributed about 60% of the entire funds they managed to save, shows or showed how committed she was to see that their wedding takes place, but unfortunately, the man gambled the money away, what could be more heart breaking than this?",

Gamble with your what belongs to you and don't gamble with other people's funds just because you feel you can double the money as gambling is an uncertainty. You may win or you may not win therefore focusing all energy is gambling is a bad habit. Now look at the shame this man has brought to himself all because of reckless decision.Gambling, though we gamble in other to make positive results (win) but more also we shouldn't take it as a habit like our life is dependent on it. It should be for fun even while we seek to win.",

It's better not to tell it to other family member until she had a serious conversation with her fiancé. I highly suggest her to hold off the wedding until they get these issues sorted out because This is a huge red flag.",

And maybe look for other guy and reset everything. But the emotional damage that has put a toll on her and the guy. I don't want to be in her shoe right now.

But it's not obvious what he's doing wrong when it's his girlfriend, and moreover this was money saved up for a big event, but he destroyed everything. Anyway, I feel sorry for both of them, one person suffers from the pain caused by another person and the other person turns himself into a person who brings pain.",

Very thoughtful, and i also did think about this as well, but in all honestly, we can't really blame the lady, we all as human beings think differently, there are people who just love starting something all at once after having spent years saving for it, it's just like a friend of mine over here who said he would not start building his own house until he has managed to save up to 10 million naira in his account, and i have on several occasions advised him to start with whatever amount of money he has at hand, but he is still adamant about it.So, there are people like that, not the lady's fault if you ask me, the man as well should have allowed the lady to keep the money if he knew that he would do such a thing, it's really heart recking and i can't just imagine the kind of trauma this act will through the lady into, for these days, it's kind of hard to find such ladies who trust their boyfriend good enough to save money with him, it's very rare, but all the same, i just hope she gets over it regardless of whether she continue with the man or not.",

Since this is already happened maybe its better for girl to decide to end up their relationship since that action is very irresponsible and he might do this again especially if the girl tolerate what the guy did. And he should not supposed to use that money since that is intended for important event in their life, but the guy decide to gamble all so I guess that tells all that he can't handle his self very well and might the girl will suffer from his wrong decisions in life in future.",

There are so many stories about someone whose family had to be destroyed where the child became the victim of a divorce caused by reckless and irresponsible gambling carried out by the head of the family. And now there is a story of someone who failed to continue their marriage and this was again caused by reckless and irresponsible gambling.. STUPID.. how is it possible that in such an urgent situation they still think that by gambling they can double their money.Heyy, marriage is simple, it's just that our egos are too high, which makes us like those who, when we want to have a wedding, have to have a lot of money so we can hold a luxurious wedding party because we have friends we invite, so if we don't have a party, it becomes embarrassing. What we need to think about is not about the wedding party but about life after marriage where we as men must have a steady income that can be relied upon to meet the needs of the family. It's ridiculous, we struggle to hold a wedding but after getting married we become confused because we run out of money. LOL.",
