  "content": "As I've seen the news[1] about Ash Ketchum(main character) of Pokemon became the very best. All of those folks that have watched the series when they're young understands the first lyrics of its intro song. \"I wanna be the very best\". So, it was after 25 years when he became a Pokemon World Champion. Little did I know, when I've watched the highlight[2] of the final battle of Ash. The video's subtitle was on and to my surprise Ash was called \"Satoshi\" by his opponent. Seriously, for that long, I didn't know that Ash = Satoshi in the original language of the series. Yes, I've got no idea for the whole existence of this anime until I've read that subtitle. So, in theory, is it possible that Satoshi Nakamoto got the alias from Ash Ketchum in original japanese name of the protagonist and watched the series and derived that first name and just added the surname Nakamoto from somewhere else as reference too? This could be a kiddy stuff for most but what do you think?Quote from: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ash_KetchumAsh Ketchum (Japanese: サトシ Satoshi) is the main character of the Pokémon anime. He is also the main character of various manga based on the anime, including The Electric Tale of Pikachu, Ash & Pikachu, and Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl.He is a Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town whose goal is to become a Pokémon Master.References:[1] After 25 Years, Ash Ketchum Finally Becomes Pokemon World Champion      https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ash_KetchumImage source:[2] Ash VS Leon Final Battle - Pokemon World Championship Eng Sub",

Now, that's probably not the case since humans of creatures of habit, and we usually has a bias when choosing names, passwords, and all that. So, quite possibly it was to do with Pokemon, but just because there's somewhat of a correlation, doesn't mean that's the case. I'm not familiar with Pokemon enough to verify your claims, but if that is the case I imagine that \"Satoshi\" is quite a popular name in Japan. Since, Ashley is a fairly popular name. Also, I think Pokemon probably has more adult followers than kids these days due to its age.",

      "body": "Well, in the world of many twists and turns, the possibility that the name Satoshi can be derived from Pokemon can really be there. Having said that, I think this is just another theory among many candidates and nobody can be sure which is the fact unless the real Satoshi Nakamoto will surface and will shed light to everything related to him, the blockchain and Bitcoin. For entertainment purposes though to pique our interest, maybe this pass well. Now, let's assume that the name was taken from Pokemon character...so what's next?",

Each possibility has some chance of being correct, although in many discussions it has already been concluded that the name Satoshi is very common in Japan, and once in some reports from the Second World War I found a person whose name was exactly that.Very interesting conspiracy theories can be constructed from some of the meanings of those words.Quote from: https://www.publish0x.com/cryptonators-airdrop-hunt/satoshi-nakamoto-is-the-bitcoin-founder-just-a-cia-invention-xjwvkrThe Japanese term satoshi has many meanings. Among some other things, Satoshi means \"enlightened\", \"wise\" or \"intelligent\". And last, but not least, Nakamoto means something like \"middle\", \"base\", \"root\" or \"central\". This would make Satoshi Nakamoto the “Central Intelligence”",
