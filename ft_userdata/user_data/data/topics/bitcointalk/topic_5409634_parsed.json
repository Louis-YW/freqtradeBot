Do not buy video cards now. The price of ethereum has risen and the prices of video cards are not falling. Start monitoring the markets after September 20, when the profit in mining on video cards will be minimal and there will be many interesting offers on the market.",

I think they will be mining hotter than the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, with cooler versions going on sale in Q1 2023. During that time, the overstocking issue will be resolved",

Wrong, RTX 3060Ti using 140watt is exaggerated, upon all the 3060Ti ive used to built rigs for myself and friends I haven't seen one taking more than 115watts, I have heard the rumour of 120watt on Hynix memory but I still believe the owners aren't finding the right OC combination.",

In Ebay you can get them brand new less than 500 right now and there are a lot of them,you can also find them there with a very good price pre owned,I don't know if they have been used for mining but judging that they were removed from Dell or HP computers I highly doubt these used cards have been used for mining and the used price is 300 dollars and in a very few cases you can even find it for less.I don't know what is your import duties but right now seem that there are a lot of these cards available and at their power consumption they for me can be considered a very good deal at these prices.",
