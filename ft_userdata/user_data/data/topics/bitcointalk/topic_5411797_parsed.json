From what I see you seem to have misunderstood/mixed up what blockchain explorer means, what a DEX is and how OTC works and want to invent something that is either already existing, either cannot be done in the way you're imagining it (i.e. I think that the trades will be either P2P, either OTC, but not both).",

I'm pretty sure you have no idea what you're talking about nor do you have any programming skills or experience. So you need a full stack developer, and such things cost money. To motivate someone to invest their expertise and time in your project, you need to offer something in return. What are you offering?",

I don't see how this will help the traders, a site with a P2P exchange is not a block explorer, that's an exchange, so, it's confusing.
