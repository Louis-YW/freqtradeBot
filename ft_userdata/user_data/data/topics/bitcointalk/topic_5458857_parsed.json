  "content": "Dexpool Autonomous Cross-Chain Liquidity ProtocolHello Everyone!I want to share Liquidity Providers site known as Dexpool and this is a liquidity pool that provides services to decentralized exchanges as an autonomous cross chain liquidity protocol and I collect those information you can see below from this site https://dexpool.io/The main reasons for being cross chain is that it can provide liquidity to multiple chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Usdt etc and they accommodating the various dexs present on those chains.Users can apply to become market makers on Dexpool. It means that they can provide liquidity on those chains which will then be utilized across different dexs. Any profits generated from this liquidity provision will be shared with the market maker allowing them to benefit financially.There are some interesting featurs:Dexpool operates as a centralized platform.The profit potential appears to be quite promising. Welcome Bonus When someone login then website will give to 100 XRP you can provide liquidity and check out its liquidity service How to provide Liquidity?First you can click on \"Add Liquidity\" button and then users can see various validator on which they can provide liquidity and get profits.For example, if we consider Ethereum adding liquidity to Ethereum validator and they have resulted in a profit of 0.1131 % over an 8 hour period and min amount 0.000521 eth. This indicates a favorable profit margin.Furthermore, if someone want to invest or provide $10,000 worth of liquidity in Usdt pool then they can earn a profit of 10 dollar every 8 hours and also which amounts 30 dollar per day (but its APY % is not fixed). This can be considered a substantial profit within a 24 hour period.Note: Please keep in mind that I don't want to force someone to invest in this site and aslo I  provide this information just for reference  and purposes only. Consider it as a financial resource and alway first your research on and before making any investment decisions. Also I just share this site from here just for your opinion. This information also share on Local language community for further opinion on them.",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing this information, but these bridges have proven to be weak and hackers can break through, so it is better to focus on protecting funds more than APY%.The minimum limits they have are good and the percentage of rewards: 0.1202% every 8 hours* for ETH, for example, it looks good, but I am not convinced that such services will grow and continue, especially with their claim that there is about half a million dollars in their bridge.Also, I see that they are a company registered in Tokyo, Japan[1], and I do not know about the legal status there, and whether their registration is correct or not.[1] https://dexpool.io/contacts",

      "body": "I do not know why this post still exist in economics section because this does not related to economy. I hope dear OP you will not be offended. Moving on to your posts, you have made it very easy for anyone to provide liquidity but in my POV, this is not a right thing to do as a religious person. I know, many people used to say we should not compare crypto with religion but it have my opinions on it so I hope op you will bear it with me. Or I could gain some knowledge from here too. Like the features you mentioned are declaring that the apy is fixed which means either the company make lost of profit you are going to get your 100$ (I know there is no company but only tokens but the point is it's just took as an example). Well, a fixed apy is not a fair.I centralized dex pool is not the best sphere to put your money in because you are just handing over your money to centralized authorities then which is highly risky when it comes to Halting of them.",

      "body": "I am seeing this project for the first time which is a surprise to me because the amount of the fund on the protocol more than $450 million are being used to provide liquidity on the exchange  (can someone help me to proof if the figure is correct)and I read somewhere that the bridge is susceptible to hacks can easily be compromised it, this is a surprise to me, who are those people putting that huge amount of funds on untested exchanges, even the developers need to look into this and scale down for now and stop exposing their users to a big risk of being hacked, safety first guys",
