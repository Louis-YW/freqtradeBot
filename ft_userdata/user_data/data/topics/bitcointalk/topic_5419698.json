      "body": "I have encountered two types of scams in trading with P2P in Binance.1. One was with Bitcoin and the other was with USDT , the senario was when I wanted to liquidity some of my Bitcoin for fiat , I placed an order to sell, then when I proceed to input my bank details, I discovered that the amount to be received is different from the initial price when I placed the order, Therefore I went back to actually verify the price of Bitcoin again and I realized that there was some kind of cheat in the system with that order and I immediately reported the scamer. I could have lost hundreds of thousands in my local fiat currency to this scammer as a result of this, if I had not being that observant. Therefore People should be very careful when trading on P2P because you barely notice it, especially with Bitcoin.",

Many might not appreciate it but I do, and it would go a long way in reminding people or even educating the newbies about the susceptibility of the internet and their crypto assets. I was a victim some years ago, if I had read a thing like this, perhaps it would have helped me to decide better then. And more reason why I appreciate this is that recently, just last month, my gut feeling pushed me to open a third-party link which is against my usual practice. But thank God it's not harmful.This reminder boosts my ability to resist such temptation. We are all human beings and our weaknesses could strike at any time.",

The buyer kept urging me to click confirm but my account remained blank and I ignored him, I filed a complaint shortly after.These forms of fraud are not too difficult to recognize, as long as we are careful, we will immediately detect them.

Know someone who fall for a scam when scammer swear by the name of god. This can not be called a romance one but it can be called faith scam i think. Victim was a religious person so he believed scammers promises when he swear by the name of the god that he will not scam him. Anyone else face something like this. I do not know but this is strange that how people can be that much emotional when doing business.",

I do not remember many times in my life when I sent someone money just directly, it is very unlikely that I will do that too. Yes, there were a few times when I did it with small amounts, like 20-30 dollars or so but that really doesn't bother too many people in a world where billions are scammed each year.So, maybe fix the problem from the bottom and just do not give people your money directly? If you do not do that, if you don't deal p2p, then it means you can't be scammed, it’s a guaranteed solution for what you have and it will definitely help you in the long run.",

Honestly I once fell for this trap of the middleman being used as an escrow in a fake Binance P2P telegram coordinated by ring of scammers then I was a newbie, those scammers work hand in hand to scam unsuspecting crypto buyers or sellers once they suceeded in their fraudulent act they block the buyer or seller without any trace, of course they played their trick in subtle way in such a way that a newbie will also fall for their scam by a way of selling or buying cryptos in a cheap price for buyers and high price for sellers, the OP revealed some salient points in avoiding such scammers.",

Our emotions are so powerful. It can make or break us and even in trading and investing, we are also advised to not be too emotional if we want to be successful. Anyway, a p2p platform should put an indication for the real middle man like having a little check mark beside their names or profile picture. Same on what we see on social media sites but this shouldn't be limited to this. They need to add more like adding a score/star and feedback rating. I guess that shouldn't be tampered easily compared to the first one that I suggested earlier.",

My friend transferred the amount through Binance, but by urgency or error he pressed the button to complete the transaction before he got $ 7000 from the buyer.
