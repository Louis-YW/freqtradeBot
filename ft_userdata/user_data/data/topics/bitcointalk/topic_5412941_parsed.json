Do you initially deposit in the casino and still they didn’t allow you to withdraw? And if it’s came from the bonus then can you provide the ToS for the specific bonus that you claim. It’s very unfair to accused the unknown casino for being a scam without proof rather than your words since most of the user here will be easily jump into conclusion because the casino in question is not reputable here. Provide proof for you claim to be fair and move this on scam accusation board.",

But it is true that scammers can be lazy and prefer to go for such option too, but that does not mean a gambling site is a scam only due to that reason. We need more evidence.I do not recommend any new casino sites that do not have active official thread on this forum, BIT555[dot]IO is not on this forum, I checked and I haven't seen any trace about the gambling site on this forum before. The gambling site was created few months ago, not up to a year, not on this forum, such gambling site should not be used in my opinion. They blocked you? Do the casino site request for KYC? Do they request for anything in order for you to be unblocked?",

This is awkward but common in the gambling space, it is the players that will be careful and use only the ones they can trust not minding high/attractive offers. This is why I don't bother to play with the new casinos, who knows what they could do with your money? But at times, the scheme might still be planned by the BC.Game itself, you might not know. A lot is happenings in the gambling and betting space where even a legit site will have other sites they dedicate to scamming people.",

Withdraw what? As others have suggested, please fill us more in about more proof or information, you're likely lacking all of it. Have you been already a victim of it or you're just posting this on behalf of someone else? I often wonder why people didn't do much research first before they interact with a site, especially if it involves their money. I mean not being techy is quite difficult, fraud do exists, but we have options like doing your research and the web is there to help you. There are basically lot of trusted website but people still want new and underrated sites, it's not wrong but for the sake of experience then it's perfectly good.",

It's called BIT555.IO It is a clone of BC.Game.They require you to deposit a minimum of $10 in order to withdraw.However, if you start too much, they block you claiming that you violated the site's rules.If I would asked you, how were you being scammed?What shows your evidence or claims that they are scammer or asking for $10 additional fees to make withdrawal from their website.Lastly it would be of a great stupidity for someone to make deposit before withdrawing funds from such site. Back then at my early stage here, someone sent me a site to make an account, which I did as he said after which he said to help him make withdrawal from that site that he would send in 6 BT C to site I should withdraw and take commission of 2 BTC and send him the remaining 4 BTC his address he sent me.First I was like asking myself a question, why would he sent me 6 btc and I should take 2 btc as a commission. I gat to chat him up and asked him ' why can't you do the withdrawal by yourself instead asking me to withdraw for you', and he then said \" We restricted from making withdrawal from my country and secondly he is an agent so if he made a withdrawal he might likely be suspected and suspended\". At this point I was a bit confused, and I said okay, so I make the account back then and he sent 6 btc to the site but before making the account, I created a new mail and use and random password to create everything with him. Since I was already thought about security so I was very vigilant about being hacked or compromise my password.So I make all details as requested by him, and I sent him the mail and he sent the BTC though me already have started sensing unusual activity, after he sent he then asked me to withdraw out 6 btc and keep 2 for my service charge.Guess what?When I tried to make withdrawal I was asked to make deposit of 1 BTC to enable me withdrawal 6 BTC at this point I concluded it was a scam and I chatted him up and why did they asked me to send 1 btc for withdrawal fee he said I should do it that after I withdraw I can take 3 btc and send him 3. Well I smile and laugh loud saying 'you cheap scammer wanna scam me'?So I forwarded him the email and password, login details to login and make the withdrawal himself so I won't be accused for stealing his money. He pleaded for me to make deposit and withdraw the btc, I said now you already have login details why you make it yourself and paying the withdrawal fee of 1 btc.It was then I totally understand he is a scammer.Be warned as they used many ways to trapped in people.",
