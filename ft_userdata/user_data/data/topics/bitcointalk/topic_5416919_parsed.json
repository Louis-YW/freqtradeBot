  "content": "QuoteA telemarketer who was fired after refusing to keep his webcam on while working had his rights breached, a Dutch court has ruled.The employee of US-based IT company Chetu was awarded approximately 75,000 euro (£65,700) by the court.In August, the man, in the Netherlands, was told to share his screen and leave his camera on while working.After he declined, he was fired for \"refusal to work\" and \"insubordination\".Chetu did not provide a statement to the court, nor did the company appear at the court hearing, the judgement says.The court ruled on the case in September, but its findings were published this month and reported by the Netherlands Times.The BBC has approached Florida-based Chetu, which has a branch in the Netherlands, for comment.Increased monitoringEarlier this year, the TUC, which represents unions in England and Wales, warned use of workplace surveillance tech - including the use of AI to monitor workers - had taken off during the pandemic and was \"spiralling out of control\".Methods included monitoring emails and files, webcams on work computers, tracking when and how much a worker is typing, calls made and movements made by the worker, through use of CCTV and trackable devices.It called for stronger regulation to protect workers.Max Winthrop, a partner at law firm Sintons LLP, said surveillance of employees had increased massively as the necessary tech became more accessible and as employers sought to keep tabs on employees working from home.But he said there was not a simple answer to whether any particular monitoring infringed on an employee's privacy in the UK.\"It depends. A legitimate reason to monitor, such as the prevention of theft, or physical harm to employees, is likely to be considered favourably by a court or tribunal,\" said Mr Winthrop, a member of the Law Society's Employment Law Committee.\"Merely imposing an intrusive monitoring regime for no good reason, especially if monitoring takes place in areas or the workspace where employees could have a reasonable expectation of privacy, is not\".'I don't feel comfortable'The employee in the case in the Netherlands had been working for Chetu since 2019, when in August he was asked to participate in a \"Corrective Action Program (\"CAP\") - Virtual Classroom\" during which his webcam was to be kept on.According to the court record the employee refused, saying: \"I don't feel comfortable being monitored for nine hours a day by a camera. This is an invasion of my privacy and makes me feel really uncomfortable. That is the reason why my camera is not on. You can already monitor all activities on my laptop and I am sharing my screen.\"In response to the employee's objections, Chetu argued that this was no different from an employee being observed in an office environment.But the court disagreed, citing a European Court of Human Rights ruling which, it said, stated that, \"video surveillance of an employee in the workplace, be it covert or not, must be considered as a considerable intrusion into the employee's private life\".The court found that the there was no sufficient justification for the monitoring by Chetu, and it had therefore violated the employee's privacy rights.https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63203945....Interesting:QuoteIn response to the employee's objections, Chetu argued that this was no different from an employee being observed in an office environment.But the court disagreed, citing a European Court of Human Rights ruling which, it said, stated that, \"video surveillance of an employee in the workplace, be it covert or not, must be considered as a considerable intrusion into the employee's private life\".So it seems europeans have laws against intrusion on personal privacy, which are currently being upheld in court. Could this turn into a landmark court case defining the future precedence for similar legal action in the future.Or will it be overturned as Roe vs Wade recently was by the US supreme court.Remote work appears to be a quickly growing market. And preferred standard of working by many. Countries like spain and portugal are currently rolling out support catering to digital nomads who earn revenue working from home on the internet. On the opposite end of the spectrum we have the recent gamestop legal case which imposed fines for investment firms not doing enough to monitor employee actions. At a certain point these two trends will definitely clash. And who knows what the outcome of it might be.",

There are multiple and better ways to monitor the performance of an employee. I know some companies are using software's like prohence which is another tool for monitoring an employee and another ridiculous thing. Companies which are using such methods to monitor an employee, should not be allowed to do business. A company is paying for the skills and time of an employee. But asking them to put their camera on for the entire duration of the shift is non sense.",

It is great that the court have the right judgement stating that there is no justification on getting into employees private life. The employee too cleared his decision to off the webcam. His emails, web, screen, everything is shared. Beyond that he doesn't want him monitored 9hours a day.The court have provided compensation for the employee who hadn't agreed to switch on the webcam, more employees will be experiencing the same suffering. Some monitoring authorities should make inspections to keep work life away from private life.",

If you have a retail company, it might be acceptable if you place CCTV on the teller and also in the shop to prevent theft. 2. If you have a high security area, where you need to monitor for security (Prisons) ..then 24/7 security measures must be allowed. The problem come in when you might be working from home and your employer wants you to have your webcam enabled while you work from home. (There are other people living in the same house and you might be invading their privacy) So, it is difficult..... but it must be done on merit.. based on the specific circumstances.",

As long as the employees meet their quota or KPI, who gives the fuck what they've done for the rest of the day? Poor work culture, lack of definition of the bonus, or maybe just poor wages. Those make the employees just do enough and not push themselves which in turn, corpo to want to have privacy-invasive software and method to monitor their employees. The shit is bleak.",

This case is a landmark one setting record that people privacy is important. To work in office is even different than also expect employees on webcam all day at home is slavery, a modern type of it. Work or office environment is different from home. The worker should have time to work and also maybe to visit the children and wife affair (lol) since at home while getting, just kidding   but serious privacy is important just like we having financial freedom from blockchain.Quote from: The Pharmacist on October 14, 2022, 01:07:53 AMAt the end of the day, the employer should be able to tell who's goofing off at home (assuming those workers have quotas to reach or something similar to measure how much work they've put in).Yeah as least they write report at the end of the week or daily and send to management. I know of many workers during covid-19 pandemic people that work through their houses and have a central monitoring team that collect reports send by employees and they do verification of work done and not necessary to ask workers to on cameras and install cameras on them like bots. That is against privacy I agree with you.QuoteAccording to the court record the employee refused, saying: \"I don't feel comfortable being monitored for nine hours a day by a camera. This is an invasion of my privacy and makes me feel really uncomfortable. That is the reason why my camera is not on.

This case is really to be use as example in court when matters of this come again not only in Netherlands but in other countries to respect the privacy of people and employees.",

Also, they are working in their own homes which is the reason why it was considered an invasion of privacy. Why should you be monitored in your own home if your work is already monitored from your computer?",

Theory X workers are assumed to be lazy and hate working, hence they should be closely monitored to ensure they are productive. While Theory Y workers are hardworking self-motivated individuals that need no supervision to do their job. Some worker if not monitored would abandon their task. The monitoring gives them the consciousness that even if they are at home, the environment is still a formal one. This is important, especially for workers that need supervision to perform their functions. Don't forget that the company's reputation and name is at stake, hence the employee's behavior at work should be monitored closely to curb costly misbehavior. If someone is hired as an online examination invigilator and the students observe that the invigilator is now watching a movie and has no interest in supervising the online examination. The student would be given the opportunity to engage in malpractice which would affect the goodwill of the firm negatively.   Another important consideration is the contract of employment. If the document states that the webcam should be on at all times, then the company has done nothing wrong. As long as the employee is satisfied with the terms of the contract, he lacks the right to protest except if it is contrary to existing labor laws.   Working at home is very tasking especially if you have little children and less house space. But if you have spare rooms or space, it would be better to have a home office that doesn't reveal or expose any personal or private aspects of the worker.  But the companies should not go beyond their boundaries to monitor email, movements, calls, and others. This would make the worker a modern slave that lacks fundamental rights.",

      "body": "In fact, such manifestations appear due to distrust, or the desire to control \"all processes\". The growth of the problem coincided with Covid-19, when many people switched to remote work, i.e. outside the office, where \"you can see how they all work.\" This actually characterizes the business badly and speaks of a poor level of personnel management. In our country, also in many companies, they believe that \"to work is to sit in the office from 9-00 to 18-00\". I adhere to a different idea - evaluating a person's work not by sitting time, or fatigue - but by the result, by meeting deadlines for completing tasks and maintaining quality. Now in one company I work as a hired CIO, I have about 20 IT specialists, most of them are developers. After the next round of the terrorist war unleashed by Russia in our country, many people found themselves far from their places of residence. But they didn’t stop working, I brought to the attention of the owners that the remote format of work would not only not reduce the quality of work, but would also be some additional motivation for employees. Office work is 2-4 hours of travel every day, in the morning and in the evening. The employee can use this time more efficiently, plus, understanding the trust, he will try not to let the manager down. In a word, it works and is quite effective, the only question is how to properly organize and present it.",

If need be afaik there should be methods of surveillance where they watch the pc instead of the webcam of the user themselves. Specially if we consider how companies are hiring employees for the quality of their work, and not on the amount of time they spend on their work, so really, it doesn't make sense to monitor an employee for the entire duration of their work hours.",

One of the most common thing where these employers do really mind off if their workers are really that slacking off on the time of work but to think and mind off sensibly that as long they do pass out on those tasks and whats needed then i dont see any issues if ever they would really be turning off their cams but it turns out that some had really be that too strict on implying this rule.Well, i cant blame them though and since you are paying someone then you could really demand on what rules should really be followed.If the worker had just agreed into thoseterms then he doesnt have the right to complain.There are some exemptions though which is understandable but on the time span of office or work hours then everything would really be just like the same when you are working on physical.",

We all are trying to make our rules while working from home which is a big hassle for the management itself Even if that's the case, I'd still feel uncomfortable knowing that a camera is watching me throughout my shift. It sounds too much. On top of that, not everyone has the ability to actually have a separate space for work. My apartment is approximately 35-40 sqm at most. The kitchen, living room, and dining area are one undivided room, while the bedroom doesn't have enough space for a desk. Thus, unless I settle by laying on the bed, there's physically no way I could have my own space to work in.",
