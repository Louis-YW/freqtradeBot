What would you suggest to me?  ~Looks like you have got some homework to do before buying a Bitcoin mining rig! Asking these questions is like trying to bake a cake without knowing the ingredients. Trust me, you do not want to bite into that!  My advice is to do your research and make sure you fully understand what you are getting into. Mining Bitcoin has its ups and downs, and it is important to know all the ins and outs, including how it works, what kind of hardware you need, and what kind of returns you can expect. And don't just rely on advice from unverified sources, such as random individuals on online forums – take your time and gather all the facts before diving in.",

Last time back in ~2019. I came to a conclusion that it would be more profitable to just invest in Bitcoin. You need to run a really big operation, preferably solar powered to at least break even. Geographical location is also extremely important. Cold climate lets you save on cooling (Iceland, Siberia), electricity prices can also differ by a lot. With every halving you need a bigger farm to remain sustainable. The times of a solo miner ir your basement are long over.",

Even if you use Antminer S19 XP Hyd (255Th) which have best energy efficiency[1], your profit is very small[2] and you'll not reach break even before more efficient ASIC comes out.18 cents per kWh is a way to lose money for sure, you will never break even, it's barely profitable in cents a day compared to cost now, and with difficulty may be going up again I'm not sure even the most efficient miner will be able to mine and not be in red, and the S19XP Hyd is on preorder so you might get it when the difficulty is already 20% up if not more.Even if we assume sky-high bitcoin prices in the future will make it profitable, at current rates it mines 0.00080579 BTC a day, you could simply spend those $8000 to buy 0.35 BTC now, more than the miner will bring you in 440 days without extra cost, so clearly it's way better to just buy the coins directly and not buy an overpriced piece of equipment that earns pennies and might break even before that.OP, stick to buying bitcoins and be careful of cloud mining scams, don't fall those as you seek to enter mining.",

But here at nicehash, It seems to be okay and I got interested in this matter. And I think the NVIDIA Tesla A100 mining hardware is the best based on my review on the website you provided.I hope you've read the disclaimer which state you actually don't mine Bitcoin. Additionally the article is slighty outdated since newer GPU type (such as RTX 4000 series) exist. Quote from: bettercrypto on February 07, 2023, 02:56:32 PMQuoteCheck electricity price on your area and reserve location (e.g. your basement) to host your miningI have a small stock room and I will put an aircon before I begin to host mining here.Sounds good. Many miner use such room. I hope your electricity price is rather low ($0.06/kWh or lower).Do you think 0.18$ kWh will be good to say that I can break even for this things If ever I begin to mine Bitcoin?     Honestly, this is what I consume here in my home according to per hour based on kWh. So I think, I supposed to expect a high cost for the electricity for the first month I guess. But I will observe it for the first trial as of the moment. If the price of electricity is more than 10 cents, then it is better not to start mining. And do not forget that there will be a halving soon, and the cost of mining will increase greatly, and if the price of bitcoin is cheaper than $30,000, then you will not pay back the equipment.",
