      "body": "Hi! Just a tip I could gave you. Instead of open a new thread for every loan, just keep in the same thread, since you can updating the Subject. Then just make it looks as easy in the thread, like when you repaid the last loan make a post like this -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------New Loan-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This for sure could be done 1000 times easier then my suggestion, but just a idea instead of open a new thread all time.And I think it would be easy to manage and find out the right loan, and everything. I don't think it would be that confusing.Anyway, good luck whatever you feels for go with, you sure know more then me here, but what I learned is that less is more.

I can totally have misunderstood this, but why do you loan money to make a trade, instead of using your own money?I mean however the trade goes, you still have to pay a interest fee to the lender, like 10%... and $700 loan. it's $70 and that's only one loan.Is it not A LOT cheaper to use your own money to avoid pay interest fee's all the time? This maybe is not possible so that's why I ask. This is not my hometown so I am not good at this things, that's why I ask.-BabyBandit-",
