If what happened to USDC happened to USDT, it would have been deppeged by now too.Quote from: Pmalek on March 11, 2023, 02:36:30 PMI haven't checked (nor do I care to be honest) what USDC's relationship to DAI is and why DAI is losing its peg as well.This answers it:Quote from: https://thedefiant.io/what-is-dai#:~:text=How%20Is%20DAI%20Backed%3F,and%20dozens%20of%20other%20cryptocurrencies.How Is DAI Backed? DAI is unique in that it is collateralized by multiple stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.

Do not fall for such call as newbies in order not to get liquidated of your hard earned funds. Be warned,Take caution, and Trade responsibly.FYI, your asset will not get liquidated when you are just holding stablecoins like USDC even if it’s depegging. The scenario of USDC to UST is far different because the current depegging due to panic sell alone but it stops immediately on 0.88$ level which is a clear sign that the sell off is already over. The best decision for newbie if they are already on stablecoins that dumped is just hold on it because the price will start pegging again once those investors that panic sold will buy back again when the smoke clear on the circle.",

They have changed their story so many times and no one really knows how and if they are backed and with what. They used to claim that every USDT is backed by $1 of fiat. This definition then changed to partial fiat backing. Then there was talk about other financial instruments, precious metals and whatnot. Their explanations became more and more vague and according to Google, they now claim they are backed by \"Tether's reserves\".     Quote from: https://thedefiant.io/what-is-dai#:~:text=How%20Is%20DAI%20Backed%3F,and%20dozens%20of%20other%20cryptocurrencies.How Is DAI Backed?
