In the wake of its disappointing performance and the shocking events of the last few days, Shiba Inu has lost its status as the most sought-after cryptocurrency among the Ethereum whales.Despite Shiba Inu’s poor price prediction and performance, Ethereum whales have not given up on the meme coin. Shiba Inu’s price is falling, while the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio of the token is rising.QuoteSome investors anticipate the coin to grow in the upcoming month. If SHIB price ends its trade for 2022 on a bullish note and carries forward its legacy. With further impetus from initiatives such as DAO, Shiba Inu game, and NFTs, the Shiba INU Price Prediction according to Coinpedia could breach the target of $0.00002962.What is your price prediction for end of 2022 and whales loading up Shiba INU will make its price surge?",

      "body": "The news about whales load shiba inu already published even since first quarter of this year but nothing happened. People were just so stupid to believe any news without doing any research. Shiba didn't have real utility usage and all products already developed related to the shiba inu was BS. I think that people know that so well if shiba inu was just a meme token and this would be a meme token forever even when new defi for shiba being created. I have ever tried the shiba game but to be honest that's really crap game. That's just like 90's game for sure. I think that the whales were just wanna triggering shiba believers by creating that news.",

According to many metrics we have hit the bottom and even if not, smar money is pouring in while fud has already done worst that it can.As we can't predict the absolute bottom, i think i am starting to accumulate altcoins too. Even Shiba INU, while i don't like it many people do and those many people are driving force behind pumping it.",
