  "content": "Health is perhaps the most precious thing that you can possess. You must remember that your mental and emotional health is just as important as your physical health. If someone is involved in a heavy car accident, people tend to focus on their broken bones and ignore the trauma they went through. Surgery and time will mend the broken bones, while an animal can help with trauma. Dogs and cats make the perfect ESAs and you should read the complete article to know why.Animals for Emotional supportMental illnesses like social anxiety, depression, PTSD, and OCD, etc. can worsen with time. Staying alone in your home constantly thinking about a past event can emotionally drain the life out of you. Bottling up these feelings is very harmful to your health. An emotional support animal letter is a document by which you can get an ESA. This letter will allow you to keep animals in your apartment even if your landlord has a strict &lsquo;No Pets Policy&rsquo;.How do ESAs help?When your arm is injured, the doctor may recommend multiple treatment methods, e.g. applying medicine, drinking painkillers, and physiotherapy. The same principle can be applied to mental health treatment as well. Taking medicine alone may prove to be unfruitful. You can get an emotional support animal to cuddle, feed, and groom. Having a constant companion by your side can help you start your journey towards self-recovery.ESA limitations - Is it worth it?According to the latest law, airlines have the right to reject your ESA from boarding a plane with you. Additionally, restaurants and other private areas may disallow your ESA to accompany you. Critics often claim that ESAs are useless since they are restricted to your apartment only. You must always remember that most of your emotional vulnerability is at home. Having a furry little companion by your side is an excellent way to release your bottled-up emotions.ESA TypesWhat type of ESA suits you best? Well, the most common types are cats and dogs so you should choose one of them. However, if you are an unconventional fellow, you can go for a hedgehog, pig, pony, parrot, hamster, or rabbit. It is highly recommended that you get either a cat or a dog because they have countless benefits. Some of these benefits will be provided later.ESA Cat AdvantageAdorableThis is a little subjective but cats are known for their cuteness. Hearing them purr when you massage them can quickly minimize your anxiety. Cats are also known for their curiosity and silly actions. By simply observing them move around your apartment, you will begin to feel your mental health recovery.Wide rangeAfter applying for your ESA letter for housing, you may want to start considering which cat breed will make the perfect companion for you. With so many breeds of cats to choose from, it can be overwhelming to make a decision. However, some cat breeds are particularly well-suited for emotional support animals due to their friendly behavior and trainability. Consider breeds such as Siberian or Siamese cats, which are known for their social and affectionate nature. Ragdolls, Maine Coons, and Russian Blue cats are also great choices for ESAs.

If you have a busy working schedule, you should go for a cat. You simply need to feed, love, and groom them and they will remain happy. You don&rsquo;t need to make sure they get exercise or take them out for walks. While cats are known for their bad attitude, you shouldn&rsquo;t forget that they are not attention seekers, making them ideal companions.ESA Dog AdvantagesAffectionateThe purpose of all ESAs is to provide emotional support and love. Dogs are known for their affection and display of love. After a long and hard day of work, a cat might ignore you at home but a dog will wag its tail and run around you to get your attention. The mutual love that your dog displays can significantly improve your mental health.They require more attentionThis may seem like a disadvantage at first but think about it. Your mental health problems elevate when you have nothing to do. A dog will keep you very busy because they require loads and loads of attention. Being there for them will help you forget your misery.ExerciseUnlike other ESAs, you will probably have to take your dog on regular walks. This is a great chance for you to go out and do physical exercise. Being physically active can automatically decrease your anxiety levels. Additionally, if you suffer from social anxiety, taking your dog out for a walk and interacting with strangers can help you overcome this fear.What to do now?If you are suffering from any mental illness, you should contact a licensed mental health caregiver and ask them questions related to ESAs. They will first diagnose your mental health and then decide whether or not an ESA can help you. If they agree, they will almost immediately send you an realesaletter at your doorstep. In the meantime, you need to decide what animal to get and what breed suits you. If you are having doubts, consult online forums and discuss your concerns with ESA ownersConclusionIn conclusion, getting an ESA can help you deal with the symptoms of mental illnesses. There are too many types of animals to choose from but it is wise to get either a cat or a dog. If you have a busy working schedule, get a cat, and if not, get a dog. Consult your mental health caregiver immediately and discuss this issue.

      "body": "A pet can be a member of the family, they can show love & affection towards you & make you happy. Dogs especially are so loyal & loving, you are their entire world. All they want from you is your love & attention.A dog will always be by your side & won’t betray you like a human can.Cats are nice pets but they are more independent than dogs & aren’t quite as affectionate. They require less attention from you though so that can be a positive. It depends what you want from a pet. You can leave cats & go out for half a day. You can’t really do that to dogs though.",

      "body": "Dogs and Cats are really great emotional support animals, I strongly believe this because when I return home from a long day of work. I feel I am stressed out and mad from dealing with traffic and bad drivers on the freeway. But as soon as I open my door, my dog greets me with so much unconditional love and excitement. On the other hand, my cat is calm and relaxed almost like smooth jazz. It's weird but I feel most balanced when I am with my pets, I feel like they understand my emotions even when I am sad, angry, happy, or glad. If you do not already have a pet, I recommend that you adopt a pet. You will also feel good and have a rewarding feeling of being able to rescue a pet that will be good for emotional support.",
