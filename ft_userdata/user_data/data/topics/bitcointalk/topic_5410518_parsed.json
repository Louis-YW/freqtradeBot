  "content": "Shiba Inu was also in the red again on Friday after three days of consecutive losses. The loss followed profit-taking by large SHIB token holders, as the crypto market turned risk-off.According to on-chain data, several wallets with significant holdings have been reducing their SHIB positions recently, possibly due to profit-taking. The main culprits here seem to be the \"investors,\" who, according to IntoTheBlock, are addresses that own between 0.1% and 1% of the SHIB circulating supply. The Shiba Inu circulating supply is around 549 billion. This metric indicates addresses that hold a reasonably large position in this crypto.Source U.Today https://u.today/shiba-inu-retail-holders-buying-up-recent-shib-price-drop-data-shows",

This kind of thing can be predicted, because it is only for take profit, not for long-term investment, because it is very risky.because it's a game of whales, we can go to Shiba, but we also have to remember, how the cycle of a memecoin",

They’re just simply taking the opportunity to buy low and sell high, but not holding it for long term.Ain’t a fan of SHIB here, so I don’t buy it for either short or long term profits.",

If you are a part of it, then I hope it is profitable.Instead of investing in Shitcoin, I think the whales still make Bitcoin their main source of support.",

Hopefully the holders who hold Shiba INU in large numbers don't sell their tokens continuously.",

Profit taking on meme token in the future will continue again, I won't be surprised anymore at meme token even the decline can be steeper than any popular coins.",

There's really no purpose on shiba and it will always be the meme kind of coin that we all know.

Maybe it's not a long term investment but a momentary investment and once the price increases, they will sell it all at once. You can also follow them, but you need to remember that we don't know when the Shiba market will pick up again and how long you have to hold on to Shiba. If you are okay with that, you can buy it when the market is trending down and place several buy orders until they are filled.",
