Are you telling me no one from the victim is not in the mood to create the flag?Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on February 12, 2023, 02:20:17 PMBut still I think anyone from the victim should create a type 3 flag or at least type 2 so that the red warning shows clearly on his profile. Cunt deserves more that this though. It sounds like screaming and I think not enough people are noticing my screaming on the other thread but to be honest I don't understand why still there are no type 3 or even type 2 flag against Yogg. There are many victims from his scam but no one is creating any of the above flags. Feels like something is missing. If indeed there is something that I missed then someone please educate me.Quote from: Timelord2067 on February 11, 2023, 02:05:46 PMVery few are supporting the flags on the two known alts of Yogg.Quote from: Timelord2067 on January 18, 2023, 10:21:10 PM3 Accounts Connected:yogg , yogg_alt , Coldkey Not receiving enough tag and flag to his alt accounts also caught my eyes earlier. Thanks Timelord2067.Please take 5 minutes and paint the walls.",

I have a gold AP halving set that I won't be able to physically access for a while. I'd assume it's almost certainly been sweeped, but it does look like there are 3 halving addresses still intact right now.Quote from: Kryptowerk on January 14, 2023, 02:31:21 PM- loans that should have been returned long time ago (to Mopar, Polymerbit, Agrawas and possibly others)He also borrowed money from me, and still owes me $1500 (+ interest). I had no idea he borrowed money from so many different people.I'm sure there is also some inertia involved, it's not like he is coming back, and it's not like anyone is going to trust him again, so there is probably a bit of the 'I'll get to it, when I get to it' attitude. It's not going to change anything.Probably should be a different post. But I keep going around and around in my head. Was this a long con, or was he troubled and struggling for years and then something finally pushed him over the edge?We have what he told others, about the gambling and drugs and such, but we really don't know the truth just what he told them. In the end it probably does not matter. -Dave",
