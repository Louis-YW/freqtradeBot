Hum you might be right but we cannot take any kind of risks that could be the dangerous for us. Now a days Btc in Bear market and anything could happen like Terra Luna crash and also FTX Collapse and I think in near future Ethereum Or BNB might Crash to take down whole Market and it will be disaster. Luna or FTX crash doesn't mean ETH or BNB will crash, they are entirely different. In this case, it should also be taken into account that BTC will crash, as there is no guarantee that bitcoin will never crash. The 36k target is extremely high expectations for bitcoin before the end of the year. I don't predict what bitcoin will look like this December as the market situation is not getting any better. We just took one small step forward and this also happened in November, we had a great start to November but everything after that...",

That's why it's hard to predict how much bitcoin can raise this whole December dude.We know Bitcoin many times that it suddenly moves unexpectedly that we are suddenly happy because of its kicking and suddenly the value falls which also causes others to worry to sell because of fear, these are the scenario that we always face with every movement of bitcoin because of its volatility that is always shown in the market.",

And even if it were so(which it’s not), we shouldn’t predict the market on past behaviors as it is unpredictable as well as volatile. While I’m being optimistic about the rise of the price of bitcoin as it’s now gradually rising, I’m also being realistic knowing that there could be a change at any moment. Hopefully, we’ll continue to see the upward trend in the movement of the price of bitcoin as adoption rate increases.",

I would say just small rally, specially weeks before Christmas, maybe it's because people are buying as they are getting their bonus check. Or just pure manipulation from behind because after a spike, the price will go down again specially in the bear market.But right now, the surge could have been due to Jerome Powell who spoke from Washington regarding Fed's next plan, a self-imposed blackout period starting December 3.You can reach his speech here.https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm",

I've always been amused by these coffee-ground predictions, trying to find connections where there aren't any. At the moment, the entire crypto industry is experiencing very tense moments in connection with the history in the FTX. It is naive to believe that after a short period of time, after these events, the industry will recover and show growth. This December will definitely not fall into the Good Month.",
