      "body": "Yes, you can use the testnet instead of the mainnet. I suggest going with a lightweight wallet like Electrum. Here's a guide on how to do it[1], you can ignore the steps after the screenshot.You can use the testnet faucets at the bottom of the article to claim some free (testnet) bitcoin to play around with.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5393289.0",

Thank you Yes many Bitcoin wallets have testnet mode and you can use them perfectly fine with testnet coins.Some of the wallets I know have testnet option are Electrum, Blockstream, Coinomi, Wasabi, and even hardware wallets like Trezor and ledger have this.Note that testnet coins have no value and you can get them with faucets if you want to test how everything works.",

In case you want to move on mainnet, which is real money, do me a favor and avoid Coinomi. It's not open-source, nor private, neither even secure. Its developers must have been one of the worst and shadiest teams of the crypto space. This is an incident of a Coinomi user who lost their life savings: WARNING - Coinomi Wallet CRITICAL Vulnerability Made Me Lose My Life Savings.Replace it with reputable open-source wallet software such as Electrum and Sparrow. Also, if you're left with no tBTC, you can request more here: [Merit] [Faucet] Hey Bitcoiners! Wanna try out the lightning network?.",

Thank you Demo wallet? How? If there is anything like demo wallet what  of BTC, is there any demo BTC?  I believe you use demo wallet when there is demo BTC. Demo is not a real thing or account but a practice account which one uses to learn how to use that particular platform but since when I know or become a bitcoiner I have not seen such that there is a practice or demo BTC. I know of trading view where you can learn how to trade with a demo account and the money used in trading is not yours. I saw someone even mentioned Electrum. Does Electrum support demo?But experts have provided testnet for you to test run  your demo wallet account. But when using it be careful .  As it was said, coinomi is not good to use because it is not open-source.",

That's exactly what the OP was asking for. A practice or testing environment where he can carry out a few transactions to understand how Bitcoin works. The actual terminology doesn't matter, and it's obvious that OP is relatively new to all this. Demo means demonstration. A testnet is a demo - a demonstration that shows what are the capabilities of Bitcoin and a particular wallet used for that testing purpose.",
