How successful it will be is anyone‚Äôs guess. Exactly. This answer is likely the key to all possibilities. What Elon has been doing about Twitter is absolutely radical. On one hand, he is lavishly firing staff, trying to reduce costs and make sure Twitter survives. Membership that will have to be paid $8/month is touching the serves of many users. I may not like this but it is fully understandable from the point of managing a business. On the other hand, all the new features /modifications & rules on Twitter have transformed it into a new machine that users have to learn to control. I share the open views of all possibilities. Only one concern from now: consistency. No matter how good Twitter may become, please at least maintain all the good things at core. Otherwise even loyal fans will walk away.Quote from: Gyfts on November 16, 2022, 04:40:57 PMIf it's true Elon's losing 4M USD a day, he might file for bankruptcy and the company will collapse within itself soon enough.

That is to say, twitter is doomed.If Twitter were only dependent on Twitter blue revenue, it would be still unstable in the long term and of course it's doomed. What if Elon brings more revenue channels and makes the revenues continuous ? It seems like he is doing some experiment on Twitter and we'll have to wait for the final result.

Basically what happened in the few weeks signals a new era in Twitter's history. All the negative things are like a big blood loss for the body and Elon is trying to infuse new blood in time. The body itself is not dead, the only question is whether the new blood is going to work soon. If the transition period is safe to pass, Twitter will be thriving like its prime. If not, tragedy may happen.Quote from: Queentoshi on November 16, 2022, 07:56:44 PMQuote from: Findingnemo on November 16, 2022, 07:30:58 PM... users may increase.May shows that there is no assurance of that.

I guess changing staff is normal and layoff 50% is the point why so many people are offended and irritated. Charging blue tick membership is no big deal but for most people, they'd rather throw 5 or 10 dollars for a cup of coffee than spend $8/month for social media membership.I just don't get it. Too bad that their advertisement system failed so Twitter has to be where it is now. If Elon could not save Twitter in the near future, everything would be going to collapse.",

Someone buys the company and can do what they want, but the methods they use are far from what could be called humane, and I personally do not support that, nor do the hundreds of thousands who have already left the platform within just a few days of the takeover. And no, it is not the only social network of this type, there are dozens of alternatives that you can find using any search engine.Quote from: https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/08/mit-report-twitter-elon-musk-users-lost/8300611001/In the week after Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, the social media platform lost more than 1.3 million users.MIT Technology Review reported¬†the firm Bot Sentinel, which tracks¬†behavior on Twitter by analyzing more than 3.1 million accounts and their daily activity,¬†‚Äúbelieves that around 877,000 accounts were deactivated and a further 497,000 were suspended between Oct. 27 and Nov. 1.\"In summary, Twitter is not a platform that practices freedom of speech and all new changes will make things worse. Perhaps there is one more issue we may think about: if Twitter or any other social media won't be an embodiment of freedom of speech or anything, just a digital platform where you can only socailize with people, no advertisement, no political talks, no hatred speech, will things get better ? When we need fire to keep warm, it's better to keep this in mind that we may get burned by it.",

His bold moves of firing a big portion of staff, changing major Twitter features and making more modifications are spurring waves of controversy. His supporters and adversaries are quite in fights. Where will Elon Musk lead Twitter ? Is Twitter heading to a wrong direction ?What is happening at Twitter now is expected. You do not expect someone like Elon Musk to spend such a huge amount of cash on an app and not dictate what will happen there or fire some people, especially those who he felt prevented free press. Twitter will be in a better position with Elon running its control than it was. More changes are expected in time to come too.",

The social media is not too pleasing to deal with present and I have not been on it for long now and there are two things involved either he faces to lose more users everyday by day or he also sells back to the previous owner due to mismanagement and poor planning coupled with sacking the previous staffs.",

Charging blue tick membership is no big deal but for most people, they'd rather throw 5 or 10 dollars for a cup of coffee than spend $8/month for social media membership.I just don't get it. Too bad that their advertisement system failed so Twitter has to be where it is now. If Elon could not save Twitter in the near future, everything would be going to collapse.Elon already withdrew that idea, because of all the fake accounts. It was stupid idea for many reasons but mainly for that. Others would be: It was free, there would be opening tor competition that would take the users in for free, one that wouldn't have draconian corporate culture, and one that people and advertisers would happily support. If facebook suddenly turned to paid version, there's no way people would use that anymore. Users rather create telegram/discord groups and chat there. I personally wish that people would just use Reddit instead.But i believe this won't end, Elon is just acting so erratic that he could just cut his losses, and as he won't be getting back advertisements under his command he could even sell twitter forward or something.Anyway, this train wreck has been hilarious to watch:Latest tweet probably sums up how this will go:",
