I've sold few lands and I've made back my money already, thanks to Bitcoin, many said it was a bad idea but things went fine for me, I entered at the 17k bottom in 2022, the best decision of my life, if I can I would again, mind you, I have more than the two lands I sold, this might not be a good idea for someone who have one.Just like my parents used to say \"At times, having one thing is like not having at all\". 3. Mining alternative coins and converting back into BTC, I have separate mining rigs channeled towards other coins and I convert them all to Bitcoin.4. Improving my contributions on the forum and getting paid via sig campaign, equals to more BTC.Things I would never do to acquire Bitcoin.1. Been jobless and start planning to buy some Bitcoin, with what money?2. Borrow money from someone or a loan shark to invest in Bitcoin, what is my worth? How will I pay back when I have nothing? Debt is best for someone who has collateral, just in case, or let me say maybe I am not just good at using debt? Still I believe it is a bad idea using debt to acquire something like BTC.3. Collect money from friends and family with the hope to help them trade Bitcoin and me making few percent out of it, sorry I have seen more than two people who did this, trust me, it doesn't end well.4. Blindly invest in Bitcoin Asic miners when I don't even know how much my electricity tariff plan is, the cheapest the better, Bitcoin mining isn't for everyone, even some small-time companies can't even keep up, anything after 5cent/ KWh is bad news.I hope this gets to someone out there, beginners to be precise, do not start what you can't finish, you have no success chance investing in Bitcoin without a job or solid source of income, hunger will strike, bills will strike and your BTC will be the only option left, start with a solid foundation aka ( a source of income ).",

The summary of it all is to work hard and work smart. And both are possible. One of the smart ways to work to earn bitcoin is to get a skill and get your clients to pay via bitcoin. If they are concerned about the transaction fee they can make in a stable coin and then you convert it to bitcoin. These clients may not even be people from your country. And one can find them on remote job sites. They are everywhere. It will take a while but if you can persistent you can have you first client and recurrent clients.",

Bitcoin is not the way out of making ends meet everyday. It can only be the way out if you already have a lot of money. There's inflation, money in the bank is not productive, etc. All of this could be fixed by Bitcoin. But to those who don't have the money, they cannot seek refuge in Bitcoin.

There's a reason diversification exists It helps mitigate risks Now say for example rather than rising from $17K it fell to $12KWould you still be holding? I doubt because going all in makes one emotional and we tend not to make the best decision when tensed. In regards to option 2, I guess land isn't as profitable as it is in my country. It's normal for a land to rise more than 100% here in a year and I have not(though exist) seen a land in my country whose value devalue in any period. Once it goes up It comes down not. What am insinuating is always diversify and land personally based on my environment (personal bias) is a good option. Diversification is Good if your portfolio is filled with great assets. Holding a shitcoin with Bitcoin isn't diversification.",

I wouldn’t question your decision of selling your lands and going for bitcoin investment because it is truly a personal decision, but my advice will be learn to diversify and real estate is one of those investment diversification strategies although you need to be well equipped with what are you getting into first before investing. If you have real estate knowledge i will say you should go for them, take out some profits and invest into other businesses and leave the rest bitcoin to go to moon. I know you will be anticipating the upcoming bull run and might want to leave everything till then which is also a personal decision but considering this is your total investment funds I will still advice you to diversify with some funds now as the future of every investment isn’t perfectly predictable. Invest into a less volatile asset to avoid potential losses or minimize risks",

I mean someone can take a little risk in investing in bitcoin but not by borrowing money from other parties. But someone can do DCA efforts as a step to make investment prospects even better. Money is indeed the main problem in running an investment besides the support of knowledge which is quite important but people need to have a plan so that they can get freedom in running investments.There are no loans and there is no term of forcing investment because it must be done responsibly to meet the right criteria. If today there is no pattern that can be done then don't expect people to get better financial freedom. Sometimes taking a little risk is not a problem as long as people understand how to resolve and minimize each decision made.",

He said of having sold about few plots of lands, though he has made the gain since he sold them and so far he has about 17k worth of investment as at 2022, I believe by now that figure might have gone up. My major point is that, diversification can only come in when you have enough capital you can use to pull through into some other investment, because if you look at the storyline, the whole idea of diversification wouldn't have come in if there was no enough capital, so the first step he took has paved way for him to venture into something else if he so wishes.",

If Bitcoin reachs 100K, I'll be able to get back my camera and the same amount of money back.Quote from: Z390 on September 12, 2024, 12:16:53 PM3. Mining alternative coins and converting back into BTC, I have separate mining rigs channeled towards other coins and I convert them all to Bitcoin.I think, it worth the risk to hold some altcoins, especially if they aren't in a quantity that will make their loss unaffordable. Many altcoins have a space for big rise, which is unlikely to happen in Bitcoin's case because it's already very high.Quote from: Z390 on September 12, 2024, 12:16:53 PMStill I believe it is a bad idea using debt to acquire something like BTC.That's the worst idea. No one knows certainly if Bitcoin will rise and fall but when you take a loan, you are forced to pay it back or you won't end up well. It's stupid when some people take huge loans, make bad trading decisions and then they have to work the rest of their life to pay debt.Quote from: Z390 on September 12, 2024, 12:16:53 PM4.

Investing in bitcoin isn't something one does with funds they hurriedly want to make profits off because they are very likely to get disappointed as its not a get rich quick scheme as some may want to misinterpret and would want to take such risk until they eventually see their mistakes which sometimes may turn out fatal on them. Your does and don'ts are not a bad idea actually because honestly they are the basics for investing in bitcoin at most point if you are a beginner and most importantly the truth remains the simple basics have always been the best strategies that will actually keep you long in the investment but sometimes other investors who try to feel too experienced would be soothing after the most complex strategies that will end up causing them making some mistakes that will get them to regretting.",
