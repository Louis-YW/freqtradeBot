  "content": "Hello,1. Question:I have installed a simple bitcoin Wallet on my Android phone.It generates a bitcoin address for me that looks like this:bc1qjn...4pt (total 41 characters)When I type this address into a blockchain manager it does not find this address. Why? What kind of address is this?But when I type into the same blockchain explorer one of my old address that looks like this:372YbM...De5 (total 34 characters)it finds the address.2. Question:Can I send BTC from an address like 372YbM...De5 to an address that looks like bc1qjn...4pt ? Or would this lead into problems?Would appreciate some answers. Thank you.",

It is all valid.",

It's not a new update anymore, it's about 5 years old.Addresses are compatible, 1 type, 3 type and bc1 type addresses can all send and receive funds from each other.3 prefixed addresses are nested segwit as they're designed to look like legacy multisig addresses so they'll validate in any checker that a multisig address would (likely programmed into the block explorer).",

Only Blockchain.com wallet was late to support native segwit, but now also supporting it. That does not mean I can use the wallet, because it is a web wallet. Or am I getting something wrong?",

I'm just not sure / can't guarantee that every wallet has this ironed out.",
