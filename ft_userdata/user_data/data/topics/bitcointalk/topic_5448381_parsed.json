  "content": "Hii:) I have electricity for 0.02 USD Kwh. So basically any mining i do is very likely to be profitable at any scale.  I have access to a smaller industrial facility with 50 amps, 240 volt breakers (Plentiful) with 0.02 USD/Kwh in a crypto friendly region in my country(Norway) with excess electricity in the power grid. Space would be enough for hosting up to 400 machines. If needed I can upgrade the breakers and electric system to handle the load needed if it exceeds the current one. I am also open to hosting older mining equipment that no longer is profitable in other areas in the world due to rising electricity costs as well. So if you have some, for example L3+ antminers or other inefficient miners, im open to hosting it for you. Loan amount: 1-2 BTCPurpose of loan: purchase of 10 s19 xp hydro ASIC miners + hydro container (210 unit size) and tariffs for importing to Norway (Currently at 25%) (I will use my own money too in this venture, Im aware that 1-2 BTC doesnt cut it for the purchase of this equipment. But im putting in my own savings as well)Collateral: Equipment itself will be collateral (40 000 USD worth) With a rather high and stable second hand value. I have a smaller online business (Would evaluate it to about 100k USD worth, www adress and revenue details will be provided upon request, about 4000 frequent customer base) I have 3 laptops + Imac rather new (3500 USD worth) car (4000 USD worth) Instagram account 90k followers (Not sure about evaluation, but maybe worth 2000 USD?) ASIC mining rig since before (3000 USD worth) iphone 8, 2 Huawei P30 pro, one new Galaxy 23S Ultra 512 gb - all in decent shape without damages (About 1000 USD worth total propably)15 000 USD in outstanding loans (Debt that im owed from others, that im actively collecting on monthly) Not really collateral but useful: Can provide tax return statements from 2022(60k USD) and 2021(40k USD) (Yeah, I dont declare most of my online income to avoid taxes)Can print full statements from my 2 main bank accounts (Show about 100k usd in transactions last 1-2 years) Also not really collateral, but can ofcourse show passport, driving license, electric bills (as proof of residence) income stream 1: 1800 USD/monthIncome stream 2: 800 USD/monthIncome stream 3: 2800 USD/monthIncome stream 4: 1500 USD/monthFor those interested, these are my own calculations which might differ 5k +- from reality and based on current mining difficulty and BTC evaluation with the combined hash power the data center I want to establish : Gross mining revenue + 6000 USD/monthElectric cost - 1500 USD/monthSafe industrial facility - 500 USD/monthAbout 4000 USD profit monthly (In Norway you dont pay taxes unless you sell bitcoin for fiat currency) Repayment plan: My initial offer is 2000 USD/month. 40% interest rate on total amount borrowed (is negotiable)Im aware of the rather long repayment plan, which is maybe not that interesting for everyone here. Realistically, with a 2 BTC loan we are looking at about a 3 years repayment plan and with a 1 BTC loan we are looking at a repayment plan exceeding one year somewhat.  Also very interested in someone willing to partner and become a co owner together with me and sees potential in establishing a mining farm in a stable 0.02 USD/kwh location. Example:1 BTC borrowed, 1,4 returned. 2 BTC borrowed, 2,8 BTC returned. I'm newly registered, but have been lurking for some time. I will be as transparent as need be. Will provide all documentation on request in PM. Best regards, Carl",

Because another user says im lying. When a quick google search will show you that there are numerous places in the world with around 2-4 cent per kwh, and I happen to live in such a place. Its not unrealistic at all and its ignorant to say that Im lying without checking ur facts. As an example in a neighbouring village from where I live, all the residents were offered 1 cent per kwh until 2030 If the village council approves the building of a 500 MW windfarm next to the village. And its not only in my country this happens. Im here to do business, so it is what it is.",

      "body": "Quote from: builderium on April 12, 2023, 03:51:20 PMWhere do you live please?I live in the north of norway where our hydro electric dams are. Think - Tromsø, Kirkenes, Alta. This is north of Norway. I think in 2021 our kwh price was 0.002 usd/kwh in summer about 4 months straight. The prices are also decided by if you are a \"Vertekommune\" or not. Vertekommune gets much better kwh prices due to their proximity to hydro electric dams. Some \"Same\" (Indigenous people)  communities has nearly free electricity in return of letting big international companies build wind farms on their lands. Some smaller coastal villages has wind farms with very good kwh prices for letting the big companies build their wind farms along the protected coastline. Norway isnt as centralized as other countries. So its pretty much up to each kommune how they choose to use its resources. So many smaller kommunes take these deals, of cheap electric prices in return for giving the wind farm companies favorable conditions. Although with all that being said, in 2022 we saw quite significant increases in electric costs all over norway including the north. But kwh prices has stayed below 0.05 usd/kwh consistently throughout the year (And now im talking total prices. Including tax, distribution fees etc) But its believed that from summer 2023 onwards kwh prices will normalize to how they were before.",
