  "content": "HelloI believe that I have an algorithm to mine bitcoin quickly and efficiently.I studied a bit the asicboost process (https://blog.bitmex.com/an-overview-of-the-covert-asicboost-allegation) : I think my algorithm could be more efficient and could therefore be used to build a new generation of ASICs.I would like to write some CPU mining software. Of course, in reality this software won't mine any blocks and I won't get any rewards. My aim is to compare it with other similar software (CPU mining), and to see if my algorithm reduces the work to be done and therefore can be used to design new more efficient ASICs.I would like to proceed like this.- download bitcoin core and put it to use- download a bitcoin miner software (https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/mining.html) in which it is possible to use the CPU- modify that mining software with my algorithm to see if it -works betterI found these three bitcoin node implementations:- python: https://pypi.org/project/bitcoinlib/- golang: https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd- rust: https://github.com/jrawsthorne/rust-bitcoin-nodeI don't take into consideration the classic implementation in c/c++ because I know almost nothing about C++ and nothing about C, and in any case these two languages don't interest me (actually, I don't even know rust or golang yet, but I'm interested in learning about them one, especially rust, and this could be a good occasion)My questions are:- are these three implementations (python/go/rust) all equally stable?- Is there any mining software written in python/go/rust for use with these implementations that, starting with an RPC getblocktemplate call, starts mining with the CPU? (my job will be: modify this software)- with a bitcoin node + mining software (if it exists) would I have everything I need to start mining with the CPU or do I need something else?thank you for accepting me in this forum, for your attention and  for your help",

Then, if I am extremely lucky, my algorithm is really good as i now believe it is.for this reason, I don’t want to play with FPGAs: I am not interested in this field of technical knowledge, and I am not so crazy (or too old) to learn it only for this dream.to be honest, I am not fully convinced that doing a proof of work in  python/go/rust will be without value. But i will investigare more. Thanks for now!!",

It does not make sense. ASICs are designed specifically for a certain task and are hard to beat, so if you want to compete with them, you really need to test your algorithm on an FPGA.Another option would be to collaborate with someone who has expertise in FPGAs and can help you with the testing process. That way, you don't have to learn everything from scratch, but still get the benefits of using an FPGA.",

QuoteThe problem is: faster than what? Faster than the current boolean logic process used by all implementations of the sha256 decryption equation. The actual gate logic making up each core IS out there, just not easy to search for & find. wikipedia or http://bitcoin.wiki has entries covering the boolean logic used to translate the sha256 equation into code and physical logic gates such as and/nand, or/nor, their various Xxx versions etc. The ASICboost whitepaper also covers it very well. There is also the Intel patent for their hardware implementation of it.Going through miner code such as cgminer (most recent version here) and the others mentioned should give a good feel for preparing and presenting the shares to the ASIC chips and handling the results from the chips. That said, be aware that once data is being presented to/received from the chips it has to pass through a chip-specific driver. Along with the chip layout that driver is the one other bit that is usually closed source.Thing is, cgminer has open source drivers for scads of chips though the most recent is for the S17 chip (and written by Kano) used in Sidehack's Compac-F stick miner.",

The manufacturers created driver code so cgminer and their chips can talk to each other. Problem is - none of the manufacturers have published their code as the GPL requires. Even bigger issue is that several people/companies have taken the manufacturers code and further modified it and sell it to give the user better control over speed of the miners and the power used: This is the 3rd party code.  Because they also refuse to publish their modified code as the original open source GPL requires AND adding insult to injury are selling their modified firmware, Kano is pissed about it. (remember, most miner manufacturers are Chinese so filing lawsuits against the OEM's like Bitmain, Innosilicon, etc. would be very problematic) Quote Kano and ck have their own mining pool. Correct. Kano's pool is https://kano.is-ck's pool is http://solo.ckpool.orgQuoteCk has no problems with any software on participating asics, but kano also accepts somewhat modified versions of cgminer.Correct. -ck is a medical doctor - not a programmer. To him programming is a hobby and he stopped supporting cgminer many years ago. He runs his pool 'for fun' and does not care about the GPL violations.Kano however is a programmer, it is his job. To run his pool he may have to accept the fact all OEM miners violate the GPL but he does NOT have to allow the far smaller numbers of miners running 3rd party code to run on his pool so his pool software automatically blocks them.",

At least I have already successfully mined with „forbidden“ software at Kano pool.You can just simply ask Kano or ck here on the forum if you are interested in the details. Most pools do not care and therefore do not check what the firmware is other than if it supports ASICboost and in the case of Braiins and a couple others does it support the xnsub (extra nonce) switch. At least 2 pools - Kano's and Braiins (Slush) do check deeper. Kano does it to block 3rd party hacked cgminer firmware, Braiins does it to set what their pool fee is and/or control the DevFee function built into their Braiins miner firmware.When a miner 1st connects with a pool the miner firmware *does* have a fingerprint that can be used to tell what it is.As for QuoteAt least I have already successfully mined with „forbidden“ software at Kano pool. I have to assume you used Braiins? If so, Braiins is not hacked cgminer, it is clean code. Kano initially only allowed it on the Solo until he verified that it can return expected high diff shares. Once that was verified Braiins is now allowed on the main pool as well. As for the hacked cgminer ones AFAIK his pool code is very very good at spotting it  Also, getting waaayyy off topic here...",
