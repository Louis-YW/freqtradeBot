      "body": "I think I read in some years ago that some coins like monero is ASIC resistant. I do not know if this is still true as of now. If People can use less expensive devices like GPU or CPU and nothing like ASIC, there will be more decentralization in mining. But this should be in a way that the computational power should not be more than certain power for each devices used for it, but if it is not like that and which I do not know if it is possible, it might be possible that such coin blockchain may not be resistant to 51% attack.",

For CPU mining algorithms, large data centers or cloud computing vendors can easily launch 51% attacks. Do you think anti-ASIC is necessary?1) Full ASIC-resistance is a myth.2) The belief that ASIC-resistance might improve decentralisation is another myth.3) Alternative utility for mining equipment reduces the cost of the 51% attack. So it simplifies 51% attacks. Is ASIC-resistance necessary? It depends on what is your goal.",

      "body": "It's like choosing between a tailored suit or a DIY outfit for your mining endeavors. Some argue that anti-ASIC measures ensure a fair and decentralized network, while others believe that ASICs provide the necessary muscle to fend off potential attacks. It's like a never-ending game of rock-paper-scissors, where each move has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.",

For CPU mining algorithms, large data centers or cloud computing vendors can easily launch 51% attacks. Do you think anti-ASIC is necessary?I honestly think anti-ASIC will make mining cheaper and accessible for all. That's true decentralisation. Currently Bitcoin cannot be mined by any average Joe because of its entry barrier. But anyone can mine XMR as it a CPU mining coin. So this makes mining more decentralised and accessible to all. But it comes with a certain amount of risk as you have correctly pointer out. So in that case, I find POS is a viable alternative for mining as it's safer for the environment.",

Do you think anti-ASIC is necessary?Think there is no real answer.  Some ASICS tend to be expensive so being truly available to any and everyone isn't really achievable which is why some people are against ASICS.  I don't think asic/gpu/could mining one vs the other is more 51% attack preventable.  It relies on how much hashpower is being thrown at a particular chain.",

Do you think anti-ASIC is necessary? the decision to implement anti-ASIC measures in a PoW cryptocurrency is not universally applicable. It depends on the project's specific goals, values, and considerations. Some projects prioritize decentralization and accessibility, while others emphasize security and efficiency. It's essential for cryptocurrency projects to carefully consider their unique circumstances and consult with their community and stakeholders before making a decision on whether to support or restrict ASIC mining. Ultimately, there is no definitive answer, and different projects may find different approaches suitable for their needs.",

      "body": "I don't think it would matter much for a 51% attack whether it is ASIC mineable or not as there are currently many large players involved in industrial grade mining. Though I always support a mining thats as decentralized as possible as they would be distributed to a larger mass of people and would be more legit way of distribution.Many coins are already doing steps to counter development of ASIC grade mining device for the Algo and they are much popular to individual miners.",
