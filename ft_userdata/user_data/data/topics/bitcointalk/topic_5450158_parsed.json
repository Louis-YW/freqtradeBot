  "content": "I had written down and saved my seed phrase before now. But after I asked questions about SegWit wallet and knew its importance. I decided to practice it. Little Mouse and o_e_l_e_o guided me. Although I didn't do it excellently but I'll get it well when I'm with both of my devices.But after setting up electrum on both my devices, including the trust wallet phrase I had already,  I now have 3 different key phrases to safely guide. It is now a burden to me to write the three down and keep all in the same place. What if there is a problem with one, all would also be affected.Then, I came up with this weird idea of teaching kids around me a song that they will sing. I am a friend to many kids. They come around and read their poems for me and lots more.How about if I form a song with my seed phrase and teach them to learn it and sing always. That could solve my problem. The kids surely don't know about seed phrases And the people around wouldn't have a clue of what is happening. This could be a good way to save my seed phrase since it is not advisable to memorise it. Besides, all the kids memories cannot fail simultaneously. Example of seed phrase: Empty Damage Second Fault Vibrant Find Food Joy Ocean Name Nature Noodles Example of Seed phrase song. With the seed phrase words repeated twice x2 in the song to emphasis them.An  empty  brain will  damage  your thinking faculty in a  second.    Fault no man, be  vibrant  and  find  good  food. Your  joy  will flow like the  ocean and your   name  will sound like  nature when you eat  noodles .Happy read and how is the idea, weird I think??",

Easy for them to mix up a few words and then you've lost access. Also, what will you do when the children stop visiting?Secondly, you have no idea just how many people will hear them repeat the song. They might go around singing it in public, on a bus, on the street, etc. Simply hoping that no one realizes it is a seed phrase is a recipe for disaster.You should write them down and find three different secure places to hide them. Even if you hide all three together, this will still be significantly more secure than teaching your seed phrases to a bunch of children.",

Regardless it’s wrong using children that way especially when they aren’t yours.",

This could be a good way to save my seed phrase since it is not advisable to memorise it. Besides, all the kids memories cannot fail simultaneously. Why do you want to make things complicated when you can just write your seed phrases on a piece of paper and save two or more copies of it at different places?When you memorize children with your seed phrases, you never know if those kids will reproduce that song to their friends and to the general public. For sure someone may be clever to find a certain pattern on the poem and try their luck.Do not trust your own memory or anyone's memory on seed phrases. One thing which you MUST understand about memory is that the memory to remember certain words only remain intact if you repeat them daily. If you stop respecting those seed phrases daily, the memory will start to fade out and eventually you will forget the phrases.",

Perhaps it would be effective if you manage to make your song a classic, which I honestly doubt. Just write them down clearly. Keep several copies. Hide them in different inconspicuous locations.

Can.Just look at how a busker on the bus suddenly went viral because of a song he was singing with the aim of entertaining passengers.To me that's not a great idea.We also have to think about our memory, which will start to decrease in memory every time we get older or at some point without us wanting an accident to occur which makes it difficult for us to remember something.But I appreciate that you have been as creative as possible in trying to secure the seed phrases.Just keep it in metal that has passed its trial period in the event of a fire instead of having the firefighters arrive late on site.",
