  "content": "The film \"Navalny\" won an OscarAlik BakhshiNavalny is a test for the people       Poisoned by the President of Russia, but resurrected Navalny, which is a miracle in itself, showed real courage by returning to the hands of his killer. Navalny was allowed to cross the border, but only in handcuffs. The cowardly dictator cannot allow contact with the people by a person who remained alive against his will, the only person in the whole country who openly called Putin a liar and the main thief of Russia. Moreover, he proved with the facts that Putin is a murderer and the head of an organized criminal group, whose tentacles have entangled all of Russia, and possibly other countries. From this point of view, the reaction of the Russian people is amazing, they silently endure all the impudent tricks of Putin. It is hard to imagine that, for example, the president of America could order at the last moment to land a private company's aircraft at another airfield, just because among the passengers there is not some terrorist, but an ordinary person, risking the lives of hundreds of people. Such an order would not only not be carried out, but it would be the last for the president. In Russia, this is accepted as the norm. If Putin allows himself to violate the Constitution, which he himself rewrote more than once, then all his other criminal violations of the law are mere trifles. I had a friend in whose toilet, instead of toilet paper, which was in short supply in those distant times, there was a book called Scientific Communism. So today the Constitution of Russia can be used for the same purpose.     The Russian people don’t care about everything that happens in the country, and the proof of this is those few dozens who came to meet Navalny at Vnukovo. It has been 200 years since Lermontov wrote:          Farewell unwashed Russia,          Country of slaves, country of masters,          And you, blue uniforms,          And you, their devoted people.     However, nothing has changed in Russia. And what is happening in Russia is not Putin's fault, but the Russian people's. After the collapse of Communism, the Russian people had a chance for transformation, but due to their mentality and imperial Great Russian worldview, they abandoned democracy and chose the path back to the empire in the person of Putin (1,2). Democratic forces in Russia, represented by Jews, are not popular among the people. Moreover, the Democratic leaders were not united. In competition with each other, they were engaged in verbiage, they were not up to the people. I want to note that Navalny never experienced any support from them. In this regard, the comment of Putin's former rival, oligarch Khodorkovsky, who, using the situation in the country created by Navalny, offered himself as a future president, is interesting. I do not think that Khodorkovsky will be very upset if Putin hides Navalny in prison for a long time or even, in the end, physically eliminates him, as he did with Nemtsov.          Navalny Russian, he has a better chance of becoming president than the Khodorkovskys and Kasparovs, which causes Putin and his bandit friends an animal fear, because the loss of power for them is tantamount to death. They will have nowhere to hide from the people's wrath.       Today, in the person of Navalny, the Russian people are given a second chance for a civilized change of power. (True, I personally doubt that the people have changed in 200 years and will agree to democratic reforms, abandon the empire, because empire and democracy are incompatible things). Otherwise, a revolt in Russia is inevitable. Driven to poverty and despair, the people will crucify the dictator and his confidants, along with the fools at the gates of the Kremlin.1.
