This will be seen as an obvious marketing and endorsement of the project by the admin here, which they will not do without a proper motive and after doing their research.The current system is not terrible, just needs a few fixes.- Jay -",

Why use something that virtually no one uses? Chances are, results aren't good. Not to mention that it seems like this platform is just another attempt of unnecessarily trying to use blockchain for everything. Or maybe try to convince us why you think this is a decent platform?",

So I will use ninjastic.space from now on.Anyway, what the OP was proposing didn't make much sense in itself, and with this option, even less so.",

Ninjastic is advance search engine, equipped with many filter and features which are unavailable in other search engines. For example its allow to  check words in particular thread/board ,address check/how many times used and how many accounts used it, check for deleted or edit message.so I don't think there any possibility of preseach  replacing with Google search engine.",

In terms of using search function here in the forum, as already mentioned by other users “ninjastic.space” and “loyce.club” rocks but if we’re to search outside the forum or search for anything that’s not related to Bitcointalk then I’d still choose google over presearch.io because of the results I got.",

I don't really like such search engines and even they do the job in the best way still they are not worth it. The members of the forum have already made their search engines which work best for the forum but to be honest I really don't use any of those myself. I basically use Google search engine to find the threads that I can't find with the native search engine of the forum. But, I can someone like PowerGlove can do something great to improve the search engine of the forum. In fact I believe that he can do a really great job to fix the internal search engine of the forum. The guy has contributed some amazing patches for the forum and if he finds this posts then I'm quite sure he'll make up a patch that may make the internal search function of the forum useful for the members.",
