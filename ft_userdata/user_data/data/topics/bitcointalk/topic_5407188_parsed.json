And \"tournament poker player\" aka \"professional player\" is taking a proper approach to the poker: he has a different strategies, he can bluff (not ALL-in with 66 on your hands), know basic math and probability theory - so, in sum this is a guy who looking to the poker as to it's work. There no any other difference.",

Maybe you're confused because the minimum bet is different at each table, it's also the same in physical casino at there are different tables too. Regarding tournaments, there is no difference in online/not online poker, but the difference between tournaments and not that is clearly different, you can come back anytime on anytable, but not when you to join on a tournament.",

Poker tournament player instead is especialized in get some placement as more near as the 1st place, and strategy is different (he can turn to be from aggressive to tight during the tournament phase)",

Ordinary poker players usually prefer to play cash table where they can start and stop anytime they wish while tournament poker players prefer to play tournament where they need to play against so many players to win the top places as per its rules. In tournament, you need to spend a lot of time unless you are knocked down by other player quickly.

The other difference is about the satisfaction and the thrills that may affect your strategy.

So I believe that with all this topic people are creating some of us who feel low tint into poker gambling we now make up time to check the difference between poker game and the other gambling games like casino because it's not everybody who is in gambling section who knows what gambling is all about.",

They are being paid or sponsored to play on a big tournament where a huge stake is involved.A normal poker player are contented on their skill and only plays mainly to get entertained and also to earn some profit. The difference between the online poker and the physical ones is that you can't see your opponent online which makes it hard to predict their next moves but there are still advantage like you can play almost anywhere.",
