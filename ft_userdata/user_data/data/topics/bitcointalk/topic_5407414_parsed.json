There's no way for them to have spare money to invest, it's not about they're didn't try enough, they're already try as much as they can, but they're not lucky enough.Middle class: Even they're have enough money to buy foods and have spare money, but foods price always increase and they're need to spend more money than their last year, even though their income are same. Some people jealous and want to have expensive thing, so they're taking a debt which is bad decision.Upper class: There's some people who invest their money and there's some people who bought many expensive thing to satisfy them, in this class they're lack of financial management.",

Someone is used to that investment is important, they will avoid transactions with excessive fees. It is a form of indirect investment. Otherwise, those who are accustomed to their consumptive behavior will only use the remaining money for other unnecessary purchases.",

I prefer the latter, but you can also do a combination of both.

Some people go to the pub every night after the duty and pay much more for the same bottle of beer they could purchase at supermarket to drink at home.

I totally agree with this very statement of yours, that wealth isn't created by having multiple streams of income, but it is by using those multiple streams of income to earn more money for you, while cutting edge from spending on things that doesn't really matters. Because this book titled \"Rich Dad poor Dad\" written by Robert Kiyosaki, is a book that will help you understand how to create wealth, how money works and financial education in general.

You can increase your wealth more efficiently by not frittering away those earnings on frivolous or unnecessary things, this becomes part of good financial management. I'll definitely agree that large parts of society are caught up in the must-have-now and throwaway consumerist culture, which we may all have been guilty of at some time in life. There is a lot of unnecessary junk out there for sale, which in some cases are only used a few times before being discarded and was not worth the initial investment - impulse type purchases. It's a good idea to really think about every purchase, even down to cups of coffee - make it at home instead of spending 5 bucks at starbucks.",

Everyone who does it knows that it is almost impossible to avoid buying things that we don't need at all, but desire is sometimes much stronger than common sense.It's hard to change when you're constantly under the influence of advertisements, whether it's on TV, the Internet, or the radio, to buy this or that. So watch less commercials and think more for yourself, and you will certainly save money. I can only say that I saved a considerable amount of money when I got rid of harmful habits like cigarettes or junk food, and that is something that anyone can do - better health and more money, two birds with one stone",

I mean if you keep on saving money and do not spend your own instead of finding more and more income, then you are going to lose your moneys value against inflation. This is why I think we should be focusing a bit more on the income side and that is why we should be making more and more money. I am not saying that is a bad idea but saving money would not help you with anything and it would just cause you to make a bit more situation where it would lose you \"value\" over long period of time. Hence, just ignore all of that and focus on making more income.",

Not forgetting that they’re are some very low income earners that live hand to mouth and can’t afford to have anything saved. It’s always wise to have a budget and to live within your means. Differentiate between your wants and your needs. You could also draw up a scale of preference and go about completing it from the most important. That way you would end up getting what’s most important first.   Some people spend more than they earn and that alone drains you financially.",

My take on this is not about getting more money/ income ( Yes it's good ) But how do you get more income and money ? You have to look out for your surroundings and solve a problem make money work for you. You shouldn't work all your life, you should bear it in mind that you'll get retired some years ahead, how do you now make more money and income when you have no strength to hustle ? Advice : Don't work all your life, Employ smart and intelligent people these are what the rich and billionaires do!Like someone said above, life is too short, spend your energy and strength chasing goal while you have them, have fun travel around the world, see new cultures, eat new meal's.My take about working for people will remain the same. Take your time to study accounting, law and investment proper guide for anyone looking for financial freedom. Liabilities don't give you assets. So, spend your money to get assets.Really interested into Agriculture, as humans will continuously eat for the next ten years ( Forever ).
