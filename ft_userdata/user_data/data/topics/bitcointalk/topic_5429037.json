The main reason is probably because i am not active in the bitcoin section because i don't own any bitcoin myself. I agree though that a more technical and sophisticated area would be nice for the altcoins too.",

Very normal discussion when it comes to price speculation and prediction which it would really be just normal that people would be saying up their speculations towards price.Im much aware with that Bitcoin dev and tech discussion, for some people who do have indepth understanding on technical aspects would find out for this place to be  that relevant and interestingwhich majority of people arent really that knowledgeable on that part.As far as i know there's no such thing about those kind of board but rather these things are mostly been discussed on projects ANN thread when it comes to this aspect.Im not sure if there are existing ones or doesnt really have.",

The purpose of altcoin projects is also to find a way to increase the price of their tokens, so it really doesn't make any sense to just talk about the technologies or solutions that the project offers while the value of their tokens does not increase. We are in an investment forum so it is normal to talk about price, if not about price and value, it is no longer a financial forum. I think OP could also create a thread that only discusses the technology of that project without discussing the price, but whether anyone is willing to join you is the issue.",
