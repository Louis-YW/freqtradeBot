Apparently I'll be the same?

This is certainly strange. But still, I don’t think I’ll get my winnings. login: altynmaupd: 18.18.2023 Quote from: altynsang on October 18, 2023, 10:12:52 AMhttps://imgur.com/a/4sWirNV I'm just shocked, look what they said. This is certainly crazy. Apparently they just don’t want to give away the winnings, it would be interesting to know why they did this, I didn’t violate anything, but they did it.",

The fact that the casino asked you for KYC after 5 withdrawals shows that they suspected the way you use their platform. Somehow it seems to me that you haven't told us all the details about your gambling here, I also doubt that you are just an ordinary user who's found this casino.",

And judging by other topics on their forum, this is usually the case for themI understand that your KYC request is still under review and not marked as passed yet? On that case, they're not delaying your withdrawal, I am somewhat sure that if you did nothing wrong and your KYC passed their verification, you'll get your withdrawal processed. In the mean time, please have a little bit more patience.Edit: re-uploading OP's image through talkimg.Quote from: altynsang on October 17, 2023, 10:51:02 AMProof of Payment: https://imgur.com/a/YO8RcN4 PM/Chat Logs: https://imgur.com/a/72VJ5kD  Additional Notes: https://imgur.com/a/aBS6V2x",

Apparently I'll be the same?It’s case to case basis and KYC usually took more than a week to be approved. The duration of approval will rely on what’s they are currently looking to your account. You can expect less time of approval if your account doesn’t have any violation in the ToS but expect worst if you share IP with other user that playing on same casino because your funds will surely freeze.If you are confident that you don’t violate their terms then just give them a couple of days and weeks to verify your KYC. Asking the live support for update won’t speed up the process since there’s a different department handling verification. This issue still doesn’t categorized scam accusation since casino terms stated that ToS is required in the future so this is standard procedure which you agree upon registration unless it’s more than a week without any replies.",
