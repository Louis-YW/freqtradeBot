It would be a very similar situation as this Argentinian hacker where he had no choice but to return the most of the stolen coins because he cannot send them anywhere without exposing himself.Jaime confirmed he gave most of the money back, but said on March 17 that he unwittingly sent $200,000 in Ether to Lazarus Group — a state-sponsored North Korean crime syndicate sanctioned by the US Treasury.Source https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/argentinian-euler-hacker-explains-exploit-from-a-paris-jail/",

One such incident happened where more than $100m were transferred out of the Multichain Bridge in FTM chain and funnily the CEO held the keys and he was probably running a rug pull all the time since the beginning scamming the users of the bridge  .The incident unfolded back in May when the CEO was arrested under some some circumstances by Chinese officials and his servers were locked out. Eventually till July, the Multichain team was hiding this information and they were running the bridge as usual and on July, user assets (primarily native stablecoins) which were bridged were transferred to unknown anonymous addresses thereby making the USDC & DAI to depeg on the FTM chain. As majority of us know that, Circle issues USDC only on a handful of L1 chains natively and in the rest of the chains such as BSC or FTM in this particular case are bridged with equivalent amounts. Shockingly, Multichain bridge was a major issuer of Bridged_USDC on the FTM chain and their rug pull has squeezed the volume on FTM altogether to new lows.Hence, in such a case even if the code of the smart contract is good and un-hackable the company or entity behind the contract should be trusted which brings down the whole vision of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, we can never be sure of BSC bridged assets as well since Binance being a centralized company can go down anytime taking down the BSC assets along with them. Instant settlement features such as Swaps can always be a good option rather than holding money onto third party bridges in my opinion.P.S : Full scam announcement from Multichain can be viewed in this Twitter Thread",
