And I know people are really getting interested when my gardener starts talking about Bitcoin!This one right here is the biggest one for me. When random people all of a sudden start talking about investing in Bitcoin (or often in other crypto, because, you know, Bitcoin is too expensive), then you know we either reached the peak or are about to.Another metric is the growing popularity of Bitcoin trading apps on Google Play or in Apple Appstore. I started a similar topic a long time ago and somebody pointed out there was a correlation between the Coinbase app being ranked 1 in Appstore and Bitcoin's price reaching the peak.",

I see people make this sort of claim all the time. A single person talking about Bitcoin means nothing. People all the time are finding out about Bitcoin and getting into it. People always make this claim: as soon as a person I know in real life mentions Bitcoin I know the market has peaked and its time to sell. lol. That is horrendously anecdotal and means nothing. A gardener, or taxi driver, or dentist, or whoever, is just as likely to get into Bitcoin as anyone else. Having a single person mention Bitcoin to you in real life says nothing about the state of the market.If it was like all sorts of people you know from different walks of life are suddenly all talking about Bitcoin, then that would likely signal a retail frenzy is going on and the top could be coming in days/weeks/months. That's very different than \"a single person I know mentioned Bitcoin\" lol. I always cringe when I hear this sort of claim.End of rant.",
