      "body": "Hey all thanks for the responses and questions.As far as offering additional services we do offer the option to buy and sell crypto with a bank card. Cross chain swaps ect. We are aware there are other services that are similar. I think its also cool how we syndicate news around the crypto sphere. Additionally we would like to offer other services and maybe our own personal open source wallet eventually. As far as marketing I have a company in the final stages of a press release that will be syndicated across a huge variety of major outlets. The site and business are still in its infancy stages. Also open to marketing and other collaborations within the community here.In response to the other question about safety and KYC. The KYC is more so for fraud and buying with a credit or debit card. Obviously this could be considered a high risk transaction for obvious reasons. Crypto to crypto swaps rarely get triggered and is more so looking to check if funds are stolen or tied to cyber-crime such as ransomware.The Terms of Service still needs to be added. I probably should have waited before posting the site. Was just curious to get some feedback from the forum here. Also the Login/Sign Up button on the header has been removed. That was part of the wordpress template we used and forgot to disable. Thank you for bringing that to my attention.\"You might want to consider moving out the refund wallet option from advanced settings \" This is for certain circumstances where a transaction fails and can be returned to sender. We are not handling any transactions manually or on our own. They are all routed to 3rd party providers through APIs. This is for liquidity and so cross chain swaps can occur. Working with exchanges like binance, kucoin, pancakeswap and Uniswap.I think I touched on everyones comments and concerns. Again thanks for the feedback and constructive criticism.",
