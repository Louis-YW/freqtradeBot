Also, I would like to request suchmoon that you can enable this option in the next update of your bpip extension. 😉I think it would be better to show the output here And besides, you can give where you think it will be good.  I just gave an example to illustrate. - I hope this will also work for others users.-------------Thanks in advance ----------------note: editedHere is the output:Thanks to hatshepsut93 Quote from: hatshepsut93 on August 25, 2019, 04:41:15 PMCode:// ==UserScript==// @name     Bitcointalk Post Merit Sum// @version  1.0// @grant    none// @include        https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=*// @run-at         document-end// ==/UserScript==;[...document.querySelectorAll(\".td_headerandpost\")].forEach(post => {    try {        let sum = [...post.querySelectorAll(\".smalltext i > a\")]            .map(e => {                return parseInt(e.nextSibling.textContent.match(/\\((.*)\\)/)[1])            })            .reduce((acc, e) => acc + e, 0)        if (sum > 0) {            let sumElement = document.createElement(\"span\")            sumElement.textContent = `Total merit: ${sum} | `            post.querySelector(\".smalltext i\").prepend(sumElement)        }    } catch (e) {        console.error(e)    }})",

I guess that's how the list of the most merited posts is made. Manual counting will consume a lot of time. Just like if I want to make a count on the total number of merits that I have received on my previous or active thread, I count them one after the other to get an accurate number.I believe a lot of people might have the same thought, but the forum administrator might have better things on his primary to-do list than this.But it will also be nice, just as you have suggested, for such an upgrade to be added to BPIP extensions, if there will be any sooner or later.Or such tools could also be added to ninjastic space by TryNinja since it's also a tool used to check users merit.",

It depends on how much you care about your post and judge yourself. Sometimes people assume their post quality by the number of merits they received. Of course, good posts get more merits than generic posts. Everyone doesn't need to use such a script. If you think you don't want it, ignore it. Other members may find it interesting. Take me, for example. I don't create many threads. But, Whenever I see others write good posts, it's fun to see how many merits they got.

Even for things where there's a good amount of overlap between stock SMF and theymos' version, my patches are still pretty \"impressionistic\" (i.e. the line numbers don't match at all, so theymos has to read my diffs and then carefully splice the changes in on his end).In terms of this particular idea (I personally don't see much value, other than maybe satisfying curiosity), I think the way I would implement it is as a tooltip on the word \"Merited\" [1]:(That's a very well-written post; makes me a bit embarrassed to see that I only parted with one measly merit. I'll sprinkle it with more when I'm wadded again.)
