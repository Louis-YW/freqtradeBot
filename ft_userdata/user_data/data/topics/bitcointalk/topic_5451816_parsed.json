  "content": "I have notice that the world is changing gradually into the era of AI,where so many things are done with AI. A lot of human jobs will be replaced by AI by 2033. From my understanding the US has grown faster in this technology that any part of the world,followed by China.The only thing that I know AI can't do is to think like human in reason and on decision making. Very soon we with start hearing statements like AI wants to predict the future because I have read post about AI predicting matches and the rest. My question is this,can AI be used to fight war ? If yes don't you think that the country with the higher knowledge on AI will always win the war or is there a possible way that the war can be manipulated.What is the possibility that the country with low knowledge in AI will win the war ?",

Let's all heal from this as, its in a way taken a page on us all especially the people of both nations.",

Let's all heal from this as, its in a way taken a page on us all especially the people of both nations.If anything, I would like Artificial intelligence to be used as a tool to end wars and reach mutual concensus between factions. While I agree than this topic is rather uncalled for, we should not ignore those questions OP is making, just because war is horrible, it does not mean we are supposed to ignore it's existence or the implications of it. Nobody likes to think about illness, but we do not ignore it when there is a chance we suffer from one.I think that considering how fast things are going with AI, it would be just matter of time before some general starts to ask advice to a machine. From there, the scenario would become more and more dangerous as governments give AIs more freedom over human troops or even war machines.",

Therefore, the good thing to do is learn a lot about AI or just basic things about it because once they gonna get to your job, you know what to do next and you will gonna have some extra knowledge that will make you advance from the others regarding these new changes.",
