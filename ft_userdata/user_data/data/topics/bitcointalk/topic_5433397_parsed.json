House will defeat you in the long run. Unfortunately, that's it.At 50% if it was just math your probability of rolling a win in dice should go up with every loss and after a few thousand rolls you should be at around 50% of wins. That's not the case with online dice though because you're not physically throwing it like in a real casino but you're running the same algorithm along 100  users or more at the same time. The algo is going to be at 50% win but one of you can be getting more wins than the other. It's possible someone who plays at the same time is getting 5 wins and you're getting 5 losses in a row and the total stats of the game remain at 50%. Probably every single person who plays dice had a streak of 10 or more losses in a row at 49% even though in a real game of dice you'd have to try very hard to achieve that.",

Really hard to tell considering in all the experience i do have in dice then it is something would give you those lose streaks that you havent encountered before. Lets just put up some example about using martingaleconsidering that it is really just 2x with <50% chance due to HE but it did still give out that highest so for of 20-26 consecutive loss and that would be depending on your bankroll size.If you do make out some just plain bet without using some strategies then it could be calculated mathematically but just like on the rest been saying thatno one can point out on how long it would be.",

You cannot defeat the house edge and that is the fact in gambling that is based on luck and fighting against the house edge. It should be for fun and not for making money.",

Yes, It is. As I already said in my previous post, everything is possible. With 5x multiplier, the chance of winning a single bet would be around 20%. (Due to the house edge, the chance of winning a single bet would be a bit smaller than 20%).The chance of losing 60 times in a row would be around 0.00015%.With this low probability, you may think that it's almost impossible to have 60 consecutive losses. If so, you should note that with playing more games, the chance of having 60 consecutive losses would increase exponentially. Assuming you need to win 1 million bets to reach your goal, the chance of not having 60 consecutive losses would be only 21%. I know what you are trying to do. Be sure that you will finally lose all your balance.",

You can log all the results and make an analysis off of it, but you'll never really come to a definite answer on the maximum number of losses on such a setup. Each game has its own different identity that does not affect the results of past games. If that's the case, then everyone will be off to crack the algorithm in order to make a lot of money and casinos will not exist in the first place. You can come up with your own conclusions and your own analysis and see whether you'll be able to come close with the actual results of your gambling session, but I'll doubt it'll come close the first try.",

This is because you would need to roll the dice at least 5 times to have the possibility of achieving a streak of 5 wins in a row. If you did not win on any of the first 4 rolls, you would have 4 losing streaks of length 1, but you would still have the possibility of achieving a streak of 5 wins on the fifth roll. If you did not win on the fifth roll either, you would have a losing streak of length 5, but you would still have the possibility of achieving a streak of 5 wins on the sixth roll, and so on.Quotethe maximum number of losing streaks you could have before achieving that number of wins would be one less than the number of wins you are trying to achieve.Theoretically the formula would beN-1=MLS where N =  number of winsMLS = maximum number of losing streaksBut when applied in reality there is no cap on the maximum number of losing streaks because each spin is independent from each other.",

This is often due to a common confusion between the result of a series and the result of an individual roll. This type of player tends to believe that if a certain result has come up 10 times in a row, say heads or tails has come up 10 times in a row, then on the next roll, the probability of heads is much higher. But this is not the case, the probability of each individual spin is still 50% (or in casino games slightly less, due to the HE). The probability of an 11 series of rolls coming up 11 heads is almost 0 (0.0488 %) but the gambler is not betting on a series of 11 rolls, he is betting on each individual roll.",

There are times where we can hit 5x at one or two rolls only and there were also times where we hit it over 20 rolls.
