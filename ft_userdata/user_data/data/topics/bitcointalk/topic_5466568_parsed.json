Why? To launch a token you need to 1. Pay service fee to create the token.2. If you are not a contract developer, you have to pay a contract developer to assist you in modifying the token you have just created3. To launch a token you need social media accounts, social media team, moderators and a marketing budget.4. There are more requirements; and i gladly inform you that there are no guarantees your token can be famous even after investing alot",

This is the reason why projects are launching crowdfunding to fund their platform and create it, At this point in time an idea to materialize needs funding.If you do not have capital and you have a unique concept and idea and you think that it will have good support in the community, you can do private crowdfunding all you have to do is pitch this to investors.",

If it's literally just that, then afaik you can. Just a knowhow of how to code or hire a dev who knows and you should be able to technically create one. If you want to introduce it to investors though, even if the use case isn't something directly related to money, you'd still need capital since just the marketing for it would require a lot of man power which you can't exactly do by yourself since it'd take way too slow. There's probably a lot of other stuff that I don't know that goes on, but those probably require capital as well so yea, without one your project wouldn't really go far (or anywhere really).",

First things first, you need to have initial liquidity to bootstrap the project. Initial liquidity will ensure that users of the token protocol can participate on either side of the market effectively. In addition to this, there are other requirements but having liquidity is one of the top priorities ~ \"Need to have\". Other requirements like:– Creating a secure token using appropriate standards– Marketing, team, operations, etc.Amongst others.",

Though I doubt that you can make it famous without having your marketing funds. It is still doable if you have a very good influence on social media or has a bright strategy to get people attention in checking your token. But yeh it is still unlikely as you aim for he very famous goal, I assume like the top 20 coins level in the market.",

If you don't have money and never think to create your own token. You need gas to make your own token and it requires money. You will never ever able to issue your own token without money. What about marketing, liquidty, etc? If you are willing to issue your own token to be sold for money and then forgot it. People will mark you as scammer. You said that you wanna make your token become famous and money is actually needed in this case. Stop dreaming to create famous token without money. It will never possible this time.",

Everything you still need cash to make is successful, how much more if you wanted in famous. If you are aware of the listing process to big exchanges, you'll be paying them much. In fact, even scammers spend a lot of money in order to fulfill their goal just like creating tokens. Maybe you can create token/s just for you but never think it will gain attention or publicity. If you want to see your project become successful, then expect huge capital as well for this can't be made solely but you need other hands or services to help reach your goal and pay them.",
