      "body": "Congratulations to you mate. I've been very busy lately that I am not able to track these big projects that are expected to release their tokens. $0.03 is indeed a very cheap price although it is limited. At $0.1 per token, it gives Sui a valuation of $1 billion in market cap which is just right. I am not sure about its short-time growth though since it would've been easier for the token to pump if the public sale is below $1 billion. Long term though or let's say next year and 2025 where people are expecting a bull run, $0.2 is very doable. If I were given the chance to buy cheap, I will probably dump half of it at $0.01 or above. I will then observe the market and do some buybacks when it's priced below $0.01, maybe a $0.05 to $0.08 ratio. So no airdrop for SUI mate?",

The initial pump will solely depend on the hype in the community about the token and if the news about its launch spreads pretty well, there might be buying pressure in that case which will surely make the price pump initially, but if there is not much hype and buying pressure after the public listing, there might not be much growth.Long-term growth will totally depend on the developments and the success of the protocol and how widely it's used, if the protocol becomes famous and is used by many projects as their home, the price of the token might increase in the future.",

Bitcoin was going from 16k to the 27.5k. It was a good sign for a project so start their sale. I just saw that if massive ban happened with so many bots who got allowlist. The main points are if sui backed by some big VCs like binance labs and coinbase ventures. This is making the project has ability to perform so well even during the bearish market.

Should i sell all token or hold some for better price just like Aptos? There are many strategies when investing. High marketcap projects are generally safer but will have less upside than microcaps. Some people like to watch new listings on coingecko and invest in those before they are popular. The problem is that 90% or so of altcoin projects fail or the developers exit scam, especially in a bear market so you need to be really careful which investments you choose. One thing that I do is that I invest in a handful of projects that I believe in long term and I don't trade them. I have sell targets set and when the next bull market comes I will take a portion of those long term investments and sell them. I will never sell all of my crypto because with technology, the sky is the limit. My long term bags are XRP, IOTA, HBAR, 0xMR, UTNP. Another thing you can do if you don't have a lot of funds is complete bounty tasks on Zealy io or apply for airdrops. Q Blockchain has been paying out Q rewards weekly and there are other bounties on Zealy like Shardeum, Mantle, zkSYNC, STARKnet, Lamina1, Layer0 and more. These are the next wave of blockchians and they are waiting for the next bull market before listing on exchanges. You can get them for free before they are traded. A lot of people got rich with UNI, APTOS, and ARB airdrops so don't miss out on this free money. SUI should be avoided due to the fact that they said they would give 6% of the supply to the community and turned around and announced that they would sell it all in the ICO and people supporting the network and using the testnet would get nothing.None of this is financial advice, it's just what I do personally.",

A dump in price is normal so project owners must not worry but they can use other tokens to reward their community. That should save their own token from crashing.",

When it comes to listing then it would really be that mostly the case on which the price would make out some correction because there would really be sell off into those people who had bought on presale or private orwhatsoever on which it would be that understandable that they would really be that prioritizing on selling out on securing their profits which is a common approach. If you have bought on cheap price then setting up some TP on higher price is considerable.Also, whether you would be leaving for some moon bag or not or you would really be snipping out with those ups and down. For price predictions then no one really knows on what it would be. Just to tell you that im an airdrop participant for this one but it do ends up that we wont really be recieving something.I dont know on why SUI project didnt really consider out on giving out at least some little allocation for those who had helped out when it comes to marketing and exposure?Sorry not to whine off but i cant really deny that this project is really something that good.
