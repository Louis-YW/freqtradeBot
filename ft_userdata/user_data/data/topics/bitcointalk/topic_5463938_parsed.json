  "content": "If you went to college, you are much more likely to end up burning in HELL for all eternity when you die. And the flames in Hell are 100% fueled by burning college degrees. Why is this? I was a professor, and colleges have promoted violence against me. Colleges have not apologized for promoting violence against me. This means that the other professors and students will be punished in HELL for all eternity. If you love violence that much, then you will experience violence in Hell where you will suffer.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
