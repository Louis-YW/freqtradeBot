Now I understand trading is not all about making money as beginner but one needs knowledge without a rush to get good profits. I lost lot of money as a beginner for not having a good understanding about trading. I'll try to avoid some certain steps and mistakes.",

It was a year of accumulation and learning despite Bitcoin losing more than 65% of its value. 2022 might never repeat itself and if i was to start over again i will just stick taking advantage of the dip no matter how long it takes for the market to recover. Day Trades can be risky for non technical analyst because from years of experience it seems technical analysis control 70% of Day TradesFinding a good mentor can be a bit complicated in the crypto space because everything looks somewhat overhyped. Crypto brokers on the other hand should never be trusted, It's either they are extremely KYC conscious or they will someday crash due to unforeseen circumstances. For crypto trading community steady engagement makes the difference.",

Maybe I have also been part of this as a newbie and with time my orientation and perception changed, after all you can convert whatever financial instruments to cash, be it metal, crude oil, derivatives, gold, silver, crypto and more. At this point of realization, then you will be serious to learn and make profit in whatever line of trading you are because all you need to do is get into the right channel of conversation and through binance etc you can get your fiat",

Day trading is risky as hell unless you are a whale. Not only risky but you are constantly under pressure. There may be times when you have to stay awake for days in a row to not miss a trading opportunity. It gets complicated and absolutely stressful if you use margin trading and bet on pump and dump.I'm not a trading expert, nor experienced into crypto market but I still think that my advice will benefit everyone: You don't need to learn day trading because you are not a whale, you are a fish, in the ocean that's dominated by whales. If you stay in front of whales, you'll always be swallowed. So, don't be that fish whose luckiness ends in some days.",

Trading simulator can help implementing our strategy but it can be never same as trading with our real money no matter what we try and assume it is.2. for crypto trading broker has no job to do.3. Mentor, not really necessary for small scale trader.4. Try to read as much as possible, it will help to predict the market but don't rely on it completely.5.

      "body": "Sometimes when people try to learn to trade, it is because money is tight and urgently needed. There is no time to actually learn some basics of it but went ahead in action. When I tried BTC, its a rush time because the bear market was over and so the people I have heard talking about were rushing to buy. The only time I read the basics is when I'm done buying already and have time to look at how all the blockchain work. The simulator like the demo account works differently than the real account, but Binance mock trading must be useful to those who wanna try. But if I have to go back to relearn, I would just take time to learn the indicators, get used to it well and just follow the bull run cycle. No futures trading but sell during ATH and wait.",

At the beginning of trading, the capital was most important to me and if I were to use it to pay a mentor, my capital amount would decrease. And I'd rather learn by myself by looking for information about how to analyze well and others.",

The points you bring are good, however I will add investing all my free time to learn how to trade as soon as possible, this is because the longer you take to learn how to trade the higher the price of bitcoin will be when you are finally ready, and you will miss some very good opportunities during your learning process, and this is unacceptable as if you miss the bull run then you will need to wait for years for another opportunity like it to present itself.",
