  "content": "Hi my fellow brothers and sisters from another mother, I just think am say, e go good or make sense make we get a thread that will be dedicated to we posting whatever we are celebrating in our individual life or family..Which includes, but not limited to....BirthdaysEngagementsIntroductionsWeddings(Traditional/White)Marriage anniversariesNew Born BabyNew Dream JobNew CarNew HouseChild DedicationWin Lottery or JackpotSuccessfully Japa 😁ETC.We are family here, what ever you want us to celebrate with you, please post it here. Why I Think this Thread is Important For our Local board..         Something worthy of celebrating happened to/in my family, which I thought I should post about here so that ya all, a family I spend some of my time with, can join me in the celebration and thanking God(Christians) Allah(Muslims), I con reason am say when I create a thread about this good news, alot of my fellow brothers and sisters who have one thing or the other to celebrate will be encouraged to post about that too, by creating a new thread again, and before we know it, this entire board will be littered with threads of fellow brothers and sisters celebrating one thing or the other, and this not good for our new and growing board..So I con think am say, e go good make we get all of our good events, worthy of celebration posts in one place, and also the congratulations in one place as well..Now, Na Just Two Rules I want Make We Adhere To.. 1. Create a Heading of what you are celebrating, make it bolded and underlined - Example - I BOUGHT A NEW CAR - WOW😍Then beneath, tell your story.. You can also edit the main Subject of this thread to match with what ever you are celebrating..for example FROM..TORESULT2. No Merit Phishing - Now, I understand say many of us dey like abuse opportunities for our own profiting, i beg or abeg, nobody should come here telling us lies for the sole purpose of earning merits, and on this note - Not just me, but the entire community reserve the right to ask any user for proof of that which they posts about celebrating, this is if it sounds too bogus and unbelievable. - and in a situation the user is not able to provide any form of proof, (which does not require you reveal any of your private information), then that post wil be deleted based on opinion from the community, and such user will be Negatively tagged for lying.Don't say a negative tag for lying is too harsh, rule is rule, to avoid being tagged, obey it..Thank you guys,Let the celebrations begin 🎉🎉🎉🎉",

Because daughters are for the father and the sons go to their mothers that is how God has configured the family to function,  any man that has daughters will leave long because you always have someone looking out for you even when your wife or mother may not be there for you. Knowing the fact that as a man,  life already played you 1:0 so you need all the love and care you can get.",

Speaking of celebrations, I recently bought a new car myself and I was so excited to share the news with everyone here. Thank you for bumping this thread up, great to see you bought your first car, I understand that feelings of excitement riding your first car, just make sure to mentain the car well and always try to get any part that spoilt replaced with a new one, don't allow mechanics to convince you that they can fixed the part because it won't last and they just collect your money. Fivestar4everMVP my man, congratulations once again I saw this thread when it was created but with low activities that got the thread buried until today that it get bumped to the top of the board.",
