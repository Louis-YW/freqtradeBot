Why is it happening? dead volume/low liquidity shitcoin + market manipulation + human greed + short squeezTUSD has actually pumped in the marketcap recently, but in my opinion it is more of a fact that capital is moving from BUSD through the SEC attack than as a BCH pumping machine.Quote from: bbc.reporter on June 30, 2023, 03:51:38 AMI only begun to notice when people in social media were saying to stop shorting it to avoid causing a short squeeze which will only cause it to pump higher.So don't talk about this. The only thing we do right now is giving pump and dump scammers more attention.",

EDX is supported by major players like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel. They have opted to start with a relatively small range of digital assets to offer their users. Just four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/crypto-exchange-backed-by-schwab-and-fidelity-goes-live.htmlBtw, It looks like Litecoin has started pumping as well.",

I will collect more information and share them in this thread. If anyone has news, rumors and speculations on why this is happening, please share them.I'm not sure about BCH but I saw LTC pumping pretty hard just a moment ago, I've been away from the market and charts for a couple of days and just saw that LTC is up about 11% and I was surprised because Bitcoin or the market didn't really move that much, I don't follow development and news about LTC so I'm not really sure what is the reason behind this sudden pump, if anyone has any idea, let me know as well.Generally, altcoins are way more sensitive than Bitcoin when it comes to market movements, when Bitcoins move 1%, altcoins tend to move about 5% to 7% whether it's on the positive side or the negative side, and sometimes, some altcoins move way faster than they usually do, that's why they are more risky as well.",

The ATH is totally far from the current that it has got. And with this EDX listing then there is a possibility that it will pump the volume that shall give the price on it to increase.Quote from: killerfrost on June 30, 2023, 08:40:45 AMAnd I also just saw some information regarding trading activities on Korean exchanges. https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1674614453231562755That's likely a combination of these sets of news that rotates for its pump but whenever bitcoin gets a drop, it's gonna get a bigger drop.",

It's been a long time, so I didn't pay too much attention to this bull event and I don't intend to invest in it. Aside from it getting a big pump, I've also seen some very old altcoins that are similarly getting pumped, possibly a pump reversal from some whale division.",

These two coins are currently pumping because probably it's cheaper than BTC to gamble on.",

Don’t see any updates as well with BCH probably this is just a market sentiment and will fade later on. The market is still doing great and with BCH, I still see a good future for this one despite of some Fud before with BCH, if you are planning to buy better to analyze more and consider the price trend as well.",

People are turning to any altcoin that resembles bitcoin distribution model as they think bitcoin is going to be safe from regulators. And they might be right but i feel like in Bitcoin Cash case it's only speculation and fomo. There's not enough underlying good fundamentals for it to make sense.
