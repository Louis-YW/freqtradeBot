You have to beware that this strategy is not as easy as it sounds because it requires a good understanding of the market and a lot of experience in it so that you can make the best \"bets\" on the price otherwise due to the high risks you could end up buying a shitcoin speculating to be pumped but it gets dumped hard causing you to lose a lot of money.",

You have a lot to learn, like learning how to manage your risk, how to control your emotion and how to never use more than the amount of money that you can afford to lose, people use the amount of money they can afford to lose to trade because if the risks involved.If your purpose is investment, never leave your money on an exchange, all the coins that remain not used on your exchange account should be moved to a noncustodial wallet. But if it is trading that you meant, always know that trading is risky. If not done properly, it can result to money loss just like gambling.",

It looks like a viable strategy if the chart consistently looks choppy like /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ but of course, it's not always the case. You can buy small amounts hoping to sell it above just a few dollars, but you could easily be screwed if it decided to just going down.",

But buying low and trying to sell high with many altcoins so you can make profits immediately is so risky and you might not make any money from it, screwing yourself in the process.",

Th right thing is to invest for a long term and hold it for how many years so that you will see the right profit, it seems like waiting if there is a bull market and no one can tell when it is. So possible you will gain profit with that strategy but your problem now is how to determine the market movement, perhaps, selling your portfolio or something like raising the amount by a dollar.",

Because you can increase profitability if you will use futures trading with low leverage rather than spot trading alone. In traditional way, Spot trading is the perfect choice for buying low and sell high since it doesn’t have liquidation price but since futures trading already introduced, It was good for user that don’t have enough funds to borrow funds for trading in exchange for a certain margin ratio.",

If you're trading such low amounts, even if Bitcoin x10, you might be talking $100, but the risk involved in that provably isn't even worth the reward. It's up to you, but trading requires a lot of luck, I don't care about others say. You need luck, and you need a little bit of wit about you. If you can separate your emotions, great. If not, trading isn't for you. Personally, if you haven't traded before, and are new to Bitcoin, I wouldn't recommend Bitcoin trading at all. Bitcoin is much more volatile than most trading, which means greater risk when you're trading frequently.",

So you have to know how to foresee such cases and have safety nets that allow you continue trading (even with a small loss) if this happens.This is why people tell that trading is not for everybody: it is difficult, no matter how easy it looks for short periods of time.",

Is your only goal in crypto to make money? Then it's just fine and one of the tools that can be used for that purpose. Do you support the concept of crypto at its basis and how it was conceived with BTC? Then it probably isn't because it's a game where people lose their money so that other people could gain money.",

Since for wanting more you might experience a heavy lose due to unforseen circumstances like bag holding some coins because you believe that it will pump. So if you are new be settle with little because from their you can practice more your skills and for sure in future you can earn more with it.",

Using leverage especially for newbies will just speedrun your demise. With spot, you can at least wait till your holdings go back up in price (assuming you didn't buy shitcoins); but with leverage, you can simply get wiped out.",

I'd rather take advantage of the moment, not have to find a low price but find a moment where the price is cheaper and goes up immediately. That's what I prefer. Your principle may be suitable for holders, long-term trading. But I think indeed everyone has different techniques according to their comfort. Maybe if you are curious you better try.",

For me it's very easy to say but in actual investing it's hard do do because we don't know the movement of the market. In long term investing we must discipline our self before we invest.

This is a way to help you hone your trading skills, but spot trading only, no futures or margin trading, it's not suitable for you. The other thing to remember is that trading is not always smooth, so it is a good idea to start with small amounts and take profits every time it is profitable. Trade with discipline, do not be greedy, do not use emotions to trade and the goal is always clear.",

      "body": "There are several reasons why in practice this is difficult to do for new trader.1. PanicA trader who is just starting out, generally panics when seeing their coin drop more than 5%. Because of this they are selling his BTC without waiting the price being recovered. After selling, he did not doing a buy back when the price continued to fall to get additional BTC while drop.2. GreedyAlready getting profit, trying to find more. of course, you can do that. But you have to prepare yourself for a long-term hold, not just to make a profit today. If your goal is trading daily, then hold is not an option. However, most members on this forum will choose to hold BTC until find a good market condition. However, this is also not a suggestion, to do the same thing.3. FomoNext up is FOMO, people are more likely to want to join the \"train\" when they see a coin being pumped. Finally, the buy low strategy is not applied anymore, with a take profit target for the short term. Unfortunately, after entry, it could be time for the price to go down/correction. coz they are buy on the peak, back to points 1, they are panics and sell them all just in few hours after buying, even he is loss more than 50%.So, the conclutions from me, Buy Low Sell High, sometimes not easy like what they said. Do own research, do own analysis, and you can follow your target to buy low sell high.",

Would you be able to describe a low and high price? I know that we can use some patterns like moving averages, golden crosses and such, but I'll give you an example. We were at 30k, after falling from 65k, so over 50% down. Was that a high price? Most traders would tell you that it's more likely a low price than a high one, yet we fell down from it by almost another 50% to 17k. It's a good strategy if you get lucky. Don't think you'll be able to predict the market each time because the market is often manipulated by whales. For instance when we were at 40k LUNA went bankrupt and dumped a billion USD in bitcoin and then Tesla dumped again at 30k that took us down to 20. These aren't things TA will tell you.",

Buying low and selling high. But during the waiting for the price to rise up higher, there will be probably difficult rpocess. You must be ready for long-term investment so that you will not panic every time the price drops. In this case, the price of Bitcoin is not always rising higher, but this also may be dropped very diply. That is why you must understand about this kind of investment. You can get high profits if you are patient, butu you may loose easily if you panic easily",

If yes, then it means your doing okay other wise, your just wasting your whole them time and resources when all you could have done is just buy and hold.I consider holding for long term one of the best way to make the most out of the cryptocurrency market if you are about that and isn't in a hurry too.This would be much easier if you've got another source of income to keep up with while holding so, you don't get tempted to sell and you've got to be a believer enough not to entertain FUD.",
