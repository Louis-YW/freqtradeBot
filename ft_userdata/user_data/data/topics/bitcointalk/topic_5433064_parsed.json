So, let's say I am to create two wallets using the xor scheme and 2/3 multisig respectively.Both setups use a 12-word seed and no passphrase at all.Which one do you like better?1. security (i know even a single sig wallet is already good enough, I am asking which one of these two is better)2. usability (error-prone, convenience)3. attack surface/vector (similar to point 1)4. hww support 5. hidden facts that people don't know about?thanks",

For example if you have a 15-of-15 multi-sig wallet but you store all 15 keys in one place that can be compromised all at once (eg. on your online PC), you don't really have any security. Compare that with a simple single-sig wallet that you keep on an air-gap PC that is encrypted.A single-sig wallet can be safe enough if the user puts a little effort in. A multi-sig setup can provide additional security if the user needs it as long as the keys are created and stored separately and all in secure environments. A 2-of-3 setup is better than 2-of-2 because the third key is used as a failsafe in case any of the first two keys were lost.But when you use muti-sig, you are increasing the size of your transaction hence paying higher fees for each transaction you want to make. Of course you can always use Taproot and pubkey aggregation but there still is not user friendly way of doing that.",

But the real one which you actually want to hide is the one (A) that can only be reconstucted by B,C,D.the xor, i am surprised you haven't heard of that.",

      "body": "I would use multi-sig over XOR for a number of reasons.Firstly, XOR is not widely used. The code provided is not widely audited, and if you do it yourself you are prone to making mistakes. If the code disappears, would you remember how to combine your seed phrases and regenerate your original seed phrase? Seems unlikely to me. Multi-sig is a standardized feature of bitcoin and can be recovered using many different wallets.Further, with a 3-of-3 system like XOR (or any other number) the loss of one share means you have lost everything. A 3-of-5 multi-sig means an attacker still has to compromise the same number of shares to access your coins (3), but you have 2 additional shares to provide redundancy in your system.A XOR system requires all the shares to be brought to one place to be combined in to a single wallet on a single device. That's multiple single points of failure. A multi-sig system can have each wallet remain on entirely separate systems and avoids any single point of failure.The benefit that ColdCard give about each XOR share being a valid seed phrase which can generate a wallet and therefore provide plausible deniability holds equally true for every seed phrase share in a multi-sig set up.",

If one of your seed phrases is compromised in the XOR set up, the attacker can still gain nothing, just as in a multi-sig set up.

Yes, I ofc meant if a share is lost you cannot recover your keys, even if you have a 10-share XOR and still have 9 of them.On a side note: I wonder how many people using paperwallets / other cold storage options actually do multi-sig? Anyone got any numbers?Maybe I'll try creating a poll, but ofc it's gonna be very biased just based on who actually clicks the topic, is active on bitcointalk etc. But still, could be interesting. My guess is, it's not a high percentage at all.",

Anyone got any numbers?It would be impossible to get accurate figures, but I agree the number will be very low.Let's look solely at P2SH outputs as an example: https://txstats.com/dashboard/db/p2sh-repartition-by-typeWe currently have around 4.7 million BTC in P2SH outputs. 3.2 million of those outputs are on addresses which have never been spent from, so we can't say anything about their script. Of the 1.5 million which we do know the scripts, over half are nested segwit scripts, and only about 600k are in multi-sig addresses. However, we also know that there are some major centralized exchanges which hold tens or even hundreds of thousands of bitcoin in multi-sig wallets, meaning that number of 600k becomes significantly smaller when considering coins held in multi-sig set ups by individual users.Now obviously there are P2WSH multi-sigs, there are probably some P2MS outputs still kicking about, there are now P2TR outputs which we don't know if they are multi-sig or not, and there are all the unspent outputs which are in multi-sig set ups that we don't know about yet. But even extrapolating the above numbers out to cover all this, multi-sigs will very much be in the minority for the average user.",

I don't think that means you need to back up electronically, though. You can still write them by hand, provided you take your time, use clear writing, and triple check everything (including checking that you can successfully recover each share before you fund the wallet). There is also less risk involved in printing out xpubs than there is in printing out seed phrases or private keys, for obvious reasons. Provided you have set up your multi-sig properly (e.g. using 3 different and completely separate devices for a 2-of-3 multi-sig), then printing out xpubs from each device presents minimal risk.And of course, you do not need to store every other xpub with every seed phrase, but rather n minus m xpubs with each seed phrase (provided you pick the correct ones, of course). Doing so also brings a privacy benefit since an attacker with access to one back up cannot even view your wallet.",
