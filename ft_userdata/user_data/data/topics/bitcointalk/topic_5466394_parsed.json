  "content": "With the basketball world cup coming to an end I think it's time to make a new general thread for the new upcoming European basketball season.I hope we can stay away from NBA talk in this thread and focus on Europe only.This should cover, but not reduce to, Euroleague, Eurocup and domestic leagues like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Israel, Turkey, Lithuania and more.A lot of recent NBA talent went to Europe this summer so we can all be exited for the upcoming season.What's you pick for the Euroleague? Monaco looks strong after adding Kemba Walker. Their back court with him and Mike James is scary.",

I checked Rollbit's sportsbook and it says there are about 16 teams that would compete here. Can you confirm that? It looks like Real Madrid is the favorite to win this season with odds at 5.50Actually the Euroleague has 18 teams.There are always the usual suspects at the top of the favourites like Real, Barcelona, Fenerbahce but teams like Monaco, Olympiacos and Bayern Munich recently made a good impression and great player additions.Barca and Real had some big signings this offseason so they are always a force in this competition.Quote from: bisdak40 on September 11, 2023, 11:52:50 AMTBH, I've got no knowledge about this Euro league but for sure there are betting odds for this league and I think this thread will be helpful for us that has little or no knowledge of what's going on in Euro basketball.Will closely watch this thread so that I can gain knowledge on whom or where to bet. Do most of those players we have watched on FIBA'23 will play on this tournament?Well from the European teams almost all players that are not in the NBA are playing in Europe. Many of them are playing for the strong teams represented in the Euroleague. But the domestic leagues are also very interesting. Spain has a lot of great teams for example and is definitely the strongest domestic league in Europe. Many other leagues only have a couple of great teams. Like in Italy it's mostly Milano and Virtus Bologna competing for the championship. In France it's Monaco and Lyon, Germany Munich and Berlin ( last season was a big surprise with Ulm winning ) or in Lithuania there is mostly Zalgiris Kaunas winning with Lietuvos Rytas trying to battle them.But in Spain you have Barca, Madrid, Valencia, Saski Baskonia and others playing at a high level.I also like smaller leagues like the Polish league, the Czech league or even the nordic leagues like in Finland an so on.Looking forward for the start of many leagues this month. Finally the summer break is over and the basketball season is making a comeback.",

Little introdution - there is no change in list of participants as Eurocup winners decided not to take part in Euroleague. But there is one big change - Play-in tournament after regular season between 7-10th placed teams.In opening round biggest game will be between Panathinaikos with new manager Ataman and Olympiacos. Though, just week ago Oly completely demolished PAO in Greek Super Cup final.Barca - Efes is another big game, though, Barca now doesn't looks like a force which can fight for the title.Quote from: AHOYBRAUSE on September 11, 2023, 12:47:46 PMI also like smaller leagues like the Polish league, the Czech league or even the nordic leagues like in Finland an so on.Looking forward for the start of many leagues this month. Finally the summer break is over and the basketball season is making a comeback.Damn, seems that you have very good knowledge about European basketball if you follow these leagues. From national leagues I follow our local Lithuanian LKL and then Sapnish, Turkish, German, Italian and French league. And offcourse, Euroleague, Eurocup and Vhampions league as well.What is your favorite team if it's not secret ?",

It's just 18 teams and only 1, max 2, games per week for each team.While in Europe every league finally started and we have way more games to cover.Bayern Munich, which is the HUGE favourite to win the title in Germany this year, already have their first loss in a huge upset in Oldenburg. They have 3 world champions, some solid Euroleague veterans, and for whatever reason recently acquired Serge Ibaka. I'm happy to see them lose nationally, I don't like this project. They have no history in Germany and only bought their way into the league several years back. In France, Monaco still hasn't played Kemba Walker. Slowly rumours coming up their are some issues. Even Mike James mentioned some words about being unhappy they signed him. To be honest, another pointguard was the last thing they needed.You mentioned Partizan, they have a strong team together this year, just as their arch rival red star. I didn't even see they initially signed Kelly Oubre, who now signed with the 76s in the NBA again.Watching their home games is always exiting and I'm eagerly waiting for the Belgrade derby this season!!",

But to be fair, it's not easy to start away and in Tel Aviv.Bayern had a strong 3rd quarter after being down 8 at halftime, damn. I was hoping ALBA could stop them but they totally fell apart in the 3rd.It was a solid gameday and Zalgiris with a big comeback in the forth giving them the only away win of the 5 games.Today we will see the first big derby of the new season with Panathinaikos vs Olympiacos. Kostas Sloukas went from Olymp. to Pana this summer, which is an absolute no go. Let's see how his former team will greet him when they meet.",

They had everything in their hands, but Sloukas made offensive foul, then there was Lessort mistake. In overtime only one team played - Olympiacos made amazing run 12:0.Baskonia - Real and Fenerbahche - Milan were great with winner decided in final seconds. Yesterday Barca looked much better than I expected and won against Efes quite confident. While Partizan disappointed me - they were soft and didn't remind previous season team.

I just saw a youtube video on the eurobasket channel and must have understood wrong then.Anyway, the arena is huge, great venue.Bayern is also building a new arena, construction will be finished so they can play there next season. It also looks really nice and is a good experience for euroleague basketball. Maybe they will get a final 4 or something to play there soon I think, totally worth it.The Israel situation is really bad, I thought this might have an influence on their basketball teams.And about Madrid vs Dalles, I think it's NBA rules because it's still the \"NBA global games\". And they play 12 minute quarters so the rest should be NBA as well. Hopefully Madrid can put up a good fight and represent Europe in a good manner.",

Bigger arenas will help clubs to get more revenue from tickets and will make better image for Euroleague. Now I only can't understand how Barcelona, club with A license can play their games in arena that don't meet even minimal Euroleague requirements.Real - Mavs game wasn't most competetive as Mavs were without Irving, Doncic played just 5 minutes and there was plenty of players with two-way contracts playing big minutes. Real made nice comeback in 4th quarter and laugh of Doncic after Campazzo 3-pointer was moment of game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRfDgzQu8gU. Meanwhile I checked other results and saw that clubs from Australia and New Zealand got destroyed by 40-60 points by NBA clubs, damn, such huge gap of level.Real have much more important game in Euroleague less than 48 hours later against Efes in Istanbul. Another very interesting game in 2nd round will be between Olympiacos and Barcelona/",
