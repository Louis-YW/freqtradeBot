      "body": "Op I will like to know what ONI.exchange is a Decentralized Exchange. And the why you want to sell the \"DEX ONI.exchange\" after you have passed through a rigorous process to develop the site. I checked the website and the site looks good. But two things come to my mind which I saw in the site. The first thing is exchange which is the core mandate of the site while the second is the casinos. There are different casino games in the site and with the casino games I saw, how do we believed that the site is DEX? But aside that the site looks beautiful and if anyone is interested can contact the op but be careful with the business transaction.",
