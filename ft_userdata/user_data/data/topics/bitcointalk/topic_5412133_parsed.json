Bear market is just a price fluctuations, that is being made when the demand for the coin decreases. This leads to price drop of the coin and again people start buying it in cheap price for which the demand gets increased, and the price also sky rocket.So yes Bear market is very common and a part of the Bitcoins and crypto. According to me it is not affecting the cryptos in any aspects. Rather it’s giving opportunity to all the investors who have missed to buy the coin and are waiting for it to buy in cheaper price.",

Like any other asset, bitcoin too has its own bull and bear cycle. So when people aren't complaining about the bull cycle, they should keep their mouths shut during bear cycle as well. A lot of investors don't understand that bitcoin is available at a discounted cost now, so they should be buying more. But instead gets panicked during such bear cycle. Weak hearted people should not join the bitcoin race at the first place.",

Not really something I'd suggest doing. This could be a good move assuming the people you convince will actually hold the bitcoin for years and years for multiple cycles; because chances are — especially those who don't know anything about investing in general, they'll mostly simply just sell at a loss.",

For a business, you need:- a business plan (what's it going to be? where and how?);- initial investment;- licensing, contracts, most likely employees;- keeping track of your spendings and profits, hoping that after a few years you start getting to a zero balance and then profit.For crypto investment, you need to download Electrum and write down your passphrase to a safe place, go on an exchange and purchase Bitcoin with the money you're willing to dedicate to it, withdraw Bitcoin into your Electrum wallet, hodl. Maybe you'll need to pay taxes, but that depends on a country and it's up to you. You hodl and wait for Bitcoin to reach your target price. With business, you also need to run it, so you're investing a lot of your own time into it.I think that realizing that investing requires a way lower effort might inspire more people to do it.",

If no one would believe that btc could be a million worth then I'll stop believing too but for sure not only me (assuming it will happen in thr future - no dates and years) All crypto holders and buyers have different perspectives on how they can make a profit with Bitcoin or crypto holding is one of the best to do since we see every blockhalving the price of Bitcoin increase including altcoins. Since blockhalving is reducing the block rewards if the demand is the same the price of Bitcoin will continue to increase. However, to those who know about blockhalving more people come to buy more Bitcoin because they know the price would increase which leads to demand increase that is why the price of Bitcoin after blockhalving skyrockets. If you know the history of Bitcoin as you can see it's a cycle and I believe it will happen again but no one knows exactly what will happen to Bitcoin in the future. It might be different however, there is still a big chance that it will happen again and reach the new ATH. The dates and years should start after block halving based on my own analysis.",

But we are talking about bitcoin here decades of exposure and continuous building and development on the network.Simply put, there's no need to have convincing. if whoever that someone needs convincing to invest in bitcoin, he/she shouldn't invest in bitcoin. Because if you understand it enough you'd invest in it yourself without other people convincing you to.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on September 02, 2022, 03:27:31 PMIf no one would believe that btc could be a million worth then I'll stop believing too but for sure not only me (assuming it will happen in thr future - no dates and years) Well, that's what mostly happens in bear markets — most(obviously not all) stop believing.

This period isn't the first time the market is experiencing such tough times of a drastic fall in the price of Bitcoin and later went back to normal after months of price fluotuation, which is actually what will still happen. So the best decision now will be to acquire as much Bitcoin as you can if you have the funds. But always remember to invest an amount you can afford to lose incase the price prediction doesn't go as planned",

I never experienced Bitcoin is stable because it never peg its price on a certain price point but since you already brought up Bitcoin currency, Bitcoin is really hard to become a currency because it need to always tie up the value in fiat just to determine it’s price. People need to check the conversion rate first before they assign the item value or transaction amount in BTC to determine the right fiat value since it’s value has no determine price point.",
