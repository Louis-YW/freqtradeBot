Cost only around $2000 and give you best returns in longterm mining - my opinion and my conclusion after 7 years mining.I had a couple of different ASIC Miners in the past and the BTC miners were the best in money return. Scrypt Miner is also a good choice - but too expensive and the revenue depends too much with the doge price.",

I know there are very few places where electricity is not expensive. Now what if OP is not from such an area, what advice do you give him?I was only giving him an alternative and it's surely not bad.well this is a very interesting question about dreaming to make 3k into 6k via mining.I purchased 10 l3+ for 1000 usd in december 2022. they use 7kwatts an hour or 170kwatts a day100or 5100 kwatts a month they are about 5gh and earn 15 a day that is 450 usd earned and in my home it would be 700 power cost.  but at my mine 225 power cost.so I got back 675 in profit.now back to if i had them at home i would have burned 2100 in power save 300 on heat.net 1800 to run them earned 1350 in coin.so 1800-1350= 450 loss and they cost 1000 so 1450 out of pocket.but they are selling for about 200-250 so 10 x 200= 2000-1450= 550 profit in three months if i kept them at home.L3+ are not very loud and they are very reliable.",
