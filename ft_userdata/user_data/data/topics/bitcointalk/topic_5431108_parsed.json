And please don't say that you don't have Telegram account, cause i think it's highly unlikely that someone in the crypto space doesn't have a Telegram account, LOL.How to use this bot?1. Visit the link that I have provided above, or you can click the link here, LOL.2. Click \"Start\", and you will get a display like the image below.3. After that, fill in the message with your Bitcointalk username & UID, also, don't forget to always answer \"Yes\" to every message you send (If successful, it will look like the image below).4. Based on the image above, if you want to follow a topic, you can easily do it by clicking \"Tracked Topics\" => \"Add new\" then paste the topic link, example for this topic is \" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5431108.0 \". That's it, as simple as that",

Link here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5331343Thanks for adding another alternative, mate. I think with more alternatives, @Eternalman can more wisely choose which one he wants to use. But we have to remember that this topic is not a specific topic to discuss about @Eternalman's question, so I think it's enough to talk about this here.",
