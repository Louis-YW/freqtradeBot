But if you want to know more of the strategies, coming from basic to advanced. Here's an article[1] that could give you the idea about it.[1] https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-trading-strategies",

Thanks.Go here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4846473.0But as a complete newbie the best thing you can do is start trading with minimal possible bet. Its like 10$ for binance. Do not make it bigger unless you will end whole year on profit. That way you will make year learning as cheap as possible because 90% of new traders wipe out their savings very fast.",

As they say one man's food may be turned to poison to the other man, meaning work your strategy out using what you have read or watched. You can't be better if you don't practice yourself. Don't always blame yourself on your loses but concentrate on what gives you profit. Good luck.",

Thanks.@To.Nick, crypto trading is very risky, you can't just rely on the discussion of the topics, as well as the instructions in other topics, if you want to trade crypto, you must be escorted and accompanied by crypto trading experts, it is very important to prevent you from experiencing big losses.My experience:I used to trade only based on articles and readings, I thought it was easy enough to make a profit, I wasn't wrong, after I suffered a loss, finally I decided to learn crypto trading for real to the experts, not articles or google, one year I was engaged in trading directly to the experts, the end of the second-third year story and so far I have done it myself, as a result I was able to get a decent profit in crypto trading, I hope what I say, I hope you understand.",

Yes there is risk involved while we use stable coins because it can reach zero at anytime but for someone to begin trading they should try short ti mid term trades with BTC/USDT and scalpe the profits from time to time is more efficient way to grow the portfolio value with less risk comparing with highly volatile shitcoins.",

      "body": "If you've got enough fund in your wallet and a decent investment already to risk only a few percent, you could try making calls on whether you think something will go up or down. Look at how others have traded based on technical analysis, learn how support and resistance works and look at learning how to spot technical patterns yourself (this should take a few months to learn if done right). You can only trade these certain strategies at specific times so it's best to come up with rules at points (ie, one loss makes you stop trading for the day, three days of losses means you take some time to do something else - you could switch to forex or stocks or just give up and find some reading or research to do and return a week or two later to see if the uncertainty has left).If you don't have a solid investment you can borrow funds from, focus on building that and keeping it. You can add some of the strategies mentioned above to it but you should decide whether you want to focus on accumulation and only buy supports or whether you should sell resistances too (you can do this with a few % and just keep buying if we go lower after reaching a new higher price). DCA can turn out to be more profitible than this, your chances of that being more profitible than this is generally based on the market and fairly random but it can teach you a skill.",

If you don't have enough knowledge, I suggest you not continue trading because it will probably be the reason why your fund will easily wipe out. So don't trade if your lack knowledge, holding is suitable for newbies as they said above. Investing in a DCA way would be the best way for those newbies who did not know how to deal with the market situation. However for newbies, try your luck on copy trading for practice and gain experience, but don't expect too much profit from this instead, the experience will give you a benefit to learn and give a better strategy and a path to become a good trader.",

If you do not really know anything about the markets in general then it is better that you take your time and begin to learn for at least a few months, if you do not do this then I can guarantee you that regardless of the trading pair that you select you are not going to make any profits in this market no matter how hard you may try.",

But before picking such trading pairs, you need to know first if this is applicable to an exchange that you use because sometimes trading pairs vary on an exchange that you have used.

You're spot on on that. OP should start with simple pairs like that. Don't cut in more. Grow from one or two pairs. I would specifically suggest BTC/USDT or BTC/BUSD pair. Sticking to a single pair makes it easier to monitor the movement and being able to make evaluation in such a way that picking entries wouldn't be much of a burden. So many traders think that trading many pairs is a recipe for profitability. That's false. There are those who trade single pairs and are profitable doing that.",

You have to find your own trading strategy and can't use someone else's strategy because we have a different points of view about strategy and I'm afraid that if you use or learn strategy from someone else, you will find it difficult to make a profit.

Buying at intervals an abbreviation for Dollar Cost Averaging. Using strategy outside this will require mastering them and testing them on demo accounts but for DCA there is no much analysis done all the buyer needs to do is wait for price to fall then they buy.A newbie that has done alot of demo can go on to try real trade by trading gradually on low volume coins so that volatility is reduced. Using low leverage too and the use of proper money management will help such trader not to really feel much difference with demo and real trading but increasing of risk appetite without enough experience is risky. However, DCA is not really trading and also not free from risk because accumulation of coins without profit can be frustrating.",
