  "content": "Hello I'm quite new but just have some crazy idea: I want to adapt the Power my A10 is consuming over the day/ night. (the only way to make sure that the battery is not overloaded overnight)I just did some Tests by manualy unplug the power line of one/ two hash boards. -> first power off the complete System and restart it with only 1/2 Boards pluged... It works great  (with one board powered the miner consumes only 350W) So now I want to automate this...question: Can I switch the power from the hash boards while the system/ controller is running ? The first answer I expect: don't do that, you'll destroy everything  But maybe it is possible   Did anybody know more details?  maybe there is an Idle Signal line to the boards ?  -> this could be an elegant alternative  ... Looking forward to your answers Andi",
