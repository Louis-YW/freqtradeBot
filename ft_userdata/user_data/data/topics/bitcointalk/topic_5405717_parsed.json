  "content": "MAXX.Finance is a new high yield staking platform launching in August. It will have a fair launch: the team will only receive 5% of the supply and the project will be managed by the community using a DAO. Plus, the contract will have whale protection to ensure that no entity can dump on investors. Initially, there will be a free claim in which participants that have popular cryptos like Ethereum in their Ethereum wallet for example, can claim MAXX tokens. There will also be a generous referral program. There is currently a free NFT giveaway on their website (click the Get Early Access button) and this NFT will give you an APY bonus of approximately 10%. Unlike other staking platforms, MAXX Finance will also offer a suite of DeFi DApps, will be fully audited, and the team is doxxed. After the free claim, there will be a 60 day amplifier event in which you can swap your crypto for MAXX tokens. This process will also have a referral program.If you have any questions about the project, or need help claiming your free NFT, feel free to drop a message here.",

They should be highly sought after on the secondary market.",
