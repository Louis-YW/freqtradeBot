Or do I need to just wait till the breakout shows in Dot?Personally, I rate Dot as a potential altcoin and worth investing in. If you like Dot, you can also learn more about Avax and Atom, the 3 projects have similarities and have great advantages. Make sure you, do not put all of your assets into one altcoin, you might want to diversify your portfolio in order to limit the chances of unnecessary losses from occurring.",

Not a biased one but there are more evm users or L1 that has been used in the past months compared to dot. Its not that dot isnt great but when they will actually achieve a good mass adoption. In my opinion layer2 is use frequently than parachains. Any thoughts?",

Or do I need to just wait till the breakout shows in Dot?At the moment we are in a bear market and therefore a lot of good, big and already established project has lost significantly in value, which is a bad thing on the one side of course but also a good thing on the other because now people have the chance to invest into good projects for a pretty big discount. I would definitely count Polkadot to one of the biggest and most promising crypto projects out there so i think it is definitely a mistake to buy some DOT now for a long term hold even if the market will go down even further from here on. You will never miss the perfect timing to enter but if you are holding then we should see way higher prices for DOT then now.",

DOT barely in the top 10 right now, sitting at 12, so it's a sign that this coin is still very strong and could have a bright future.So I would say why not? if you really believed on it's parachain and it could really grow massively in the next couple of years then invest on it while the price is still cheap in this bear market. Because once we are again in a bullrun, it could be X amount of returns for your investment.",

DOT is one of a good altcoin and have a good potential to rise again, If I have the extra money I will surely invest on DOT because they continue to grow, and for sure more updates to come especially on their services.",

Always DYOR.Well, all of that require you to understand how crypto works. Yes you should do all of that, but newbies have absolutely no idea what and how those should be done and that is why they have trouble and just listen to others.It would be better if you could check poladot yourself, and understand where it is going. For me personally for example, it is not an exceptional one, and I believe you wouldn't make too much more profit from investing into polkadot compared to ETH for example. This means, why would I want to move away from ETH which I trust, and then I would be at risk with dot instead? Hence, why I try to make it work with the current situation at hand instead and not go for bigger risks.",

So this token could make a good statement in the next bull run. I have allocated a place for DOT in my portfolio for long-term investing. I don't know if it makes sense to speculate and trade this token, but its potential is revealed in long term hold, and there is less risk if you invest in DOT instead of trying to trade it.",

Or do I need to just wait till the breakout shows in Dot?Well, just to know that PolkaDot had existed for quite a long time and it did not belong to shitcoins, it has a market value and seems to have fortune. Adding this to your list is a good idea and likely a good investment as well. DCA is quite suitable when it comes to investing this time. It can't be certain but as these experts say Dot will grow further in the future. Sounds like an encouraging note that investors must consider. However, we still put some limitations on knowing the risk in the market. https://changelly.com/blog/polkadot-price-prediction/#What_Will_Polkadot_Be_Worth_in_5_Years",

With these dumps, expect that the short term is not good for most of the altcoins, especially this Polkadot, there are no excuses for sure.But in long term, I want to see Polkadot excel, especially in DeFi, there are already operating platforms under Polkadot in terms of DeFi and it is a good start.",

It's clear that if you do DCA that is a lower risk and lower reward thing, whereas if you start to trade that is a bigger risk and bigger reward. Of course I can't guarantee anything but that seems like the most logical thing right now, higher risk and higher reward is based on your talent, lower risk and lower reward is based on the market.If you are buying it, and accumulating even more, that means that it's going to be based on the market and what it does. But, if you are trading, then you are not basing it off the market, it's about how good you are, because even while going down you may make profit, or even when it's going up, you may lose money all based on your talent.",
