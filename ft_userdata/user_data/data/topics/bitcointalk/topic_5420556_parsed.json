  "content": "Good dayWould anybody be so kind as to guide me on how to reconnect my node to my electrum wallet. It was working before; I was connected to my personal node only, and was validating only my transactions. I have redownloaded and verified electrum and reflashed the sdcard with the myNode image but to no avail. On the myNode interface my electrum server keeps saying \"compressing\".Thank you for your time",

I'm not familiar with running electrum servers but it might help someone who is if you have any extra information. Is your node fully synced with the blockchain too? I cleared my electrum wallet certificates and it worked. I had tried this before and it didn't fix the problem, but this time around it did the job.Thank you",
