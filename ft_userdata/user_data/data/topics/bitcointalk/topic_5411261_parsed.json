'The Dark Knight' is a great choice if you like thriller with action, but if you prefer psychological thrillers more than 'Joker' might be a better choose for you. Here is IMDB for both of themhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=chttp_t_1 -- The Dark Knight (2008)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/?ref_=chttp_t_19 -- Joker (2019)",
