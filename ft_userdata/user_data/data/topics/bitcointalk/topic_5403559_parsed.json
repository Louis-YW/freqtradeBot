Just my speculation though. I could be wrong",

I could be wrong And the dip will continue if BTC decides to lose its cool one more time, I think this recovery is just temporary, BTC can't bottom at 20000$ there will be more devaluation as we enter deep into this bear market, as for altcoins people will be shocked because they will lose more value.",
