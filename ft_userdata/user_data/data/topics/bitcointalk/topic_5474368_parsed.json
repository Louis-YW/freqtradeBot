  "content": "I came across an advert from the office of the minister of the Federal Ministry of Communication, innovation, and Digital Technology regarding the 3MTT. (3 million technical talent program ) a program that is designed to train 3 million Nigerians on key technological skills including1. Software development 2. UI/UX design 3. Data analysis and visualization 4. Quality assurance 5. Product Management 6. Data science 7. Animation 8. AI/ machine learning. 8. Cyber security. 9. Game development 10. Cloud Computing 11. Devs ops.I picked a lot of interest in it because I feel that if this is genuinely carried out, it would go a long way in increasing the employability of the average Nigerian youth that will benefit from the program and this led me to follow up on the ministry activity on YouTube and from the analysis on how the program is structured, it appears to me as one that will be very feasible. Here is the link to the YouTube briefing by the minister. https://www.youtube.com/live/yFmPeZKKj38?si=uyrhZHKUQb63NN5N  I had to go up to their site and was amazed at how innovative the plan of the minister had been coupled with the fact that in May of this year, the ministry brought out a policy that is aimed at getting blockchain technology accepted in the country and the document contains reasons why the blockchain technology should be accepted in Nigeria. Maybe you should check it out. https://www.commtech.gov.ng/Doc/National_Blockchain_Policy_Final.pdf. Here is my take on this, Dr Bosun Tojani is a youth that is into the technological sector and has a lot of passion for the blockchain technology and this is what led him to creating the 3MTT program and also came up with the national blockchain technology. No matter the success or failure rate of this projects, If we have like minded individuals like bosun tojani in key political position both at the state and federal level, it won't take time before the technically innovative part of our country will spring up tall to the peak and it will become easier for bitcoin and the blockchain technology to be adopted in Nigeria.",

But programs like this that is aimed at giving the Nigerian youth an avenue to be independent is something that many youth have overlooked for a very long time.Having to learn a skill is a good way to break from poverty, the truth is that the government can not quickly make life good for everyone but being good in any of thisQuote1.

If our government can really put efforts in this and make this thing work I think this government is has gotten one thing right. It is better invest in people so that they can give back to the society. Imagine how this country will be if this 3 million successfully complete this program and decide to train 5 persons under them each. Also many people will gain remote jobs outside the country.",

Federal Government 3 Million Technical Talent Programme for Young Nigerians  thanks for pointing out the fact that someone had already created a similar topic as this, to be honest, I wasn't careful enough to check out for a possibility of it being posted before, maybe it's because of the excitement of seeing the minister advocating for the national blockchain policy. When I listened to the thorough analysis on how the program will be structured, I just couldn't hold it but had to share it with ourocak board members to get there input on this.",
