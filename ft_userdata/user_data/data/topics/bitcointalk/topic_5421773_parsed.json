I'm curious as to how long they are going to continue buying 1 BTC/day or at least the dedicated budget (it would take 62 days to invest $1 million assuming fixed price).",

He bought when the price was at $50K+, it shouldn't be surprising for Nayib to be more bullish. It's a good time for DCAing even if the price is dumped to $13k, there were users who said we're up to go bull run after 5-6 months. But he will have the last laugh when the bull run comes very early.",

Even now the tweet has spread to almost all crypto telegram channels. And it seems that Nayib bukele is not the only one who will buy 1 bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. because I saw Justin sun replying to Nayib's tweet. and Justin sun also said he would do the same thing. i.e. buy 1 bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. I think this is still included in the DCA category.and the conversation around El salvador and Nayib bukele actually continues on the topic El Salvador has become the first country to make #Bitcoin legal tender! ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡».",

Honestly, I remember the Terra foundation as they were the other ones that have said that they're investing in bitcoin and buying it everyday.But the difference is that, they're a project and Nayib Bukele is a president that has no foundation and it's just going to be held as an investment for the future.",

El Salvador is a country that is not in the best economic condition, but I don't think that this way of investing will bring them any benefits - because buying 30 BTC today or doing it for a period of 30 days will not make a big difference, unless another crash happens.Quote from: Accardo on November 17, 2022, 08:19:47 AMDespite losing $70million, according to the article, he didn't relelent.

And this is a bold move from El Salvador, who will start buying one Bitcoin daily. They will benefit when the bitcoin price starts to climb and others will not be able to catch up with El Salvador. This news will spread widely and people will see it as a step to keep investing in bitcoin even though the market conditions are declining. But this is a good strategy for investing in bitcoins because they don't need to spend a lot of money to buy one bitcoin.",

It's a very logical move to buy 1 BTC every day instead of making bulk purchases at certain times. Thus, it can adjust its average better and not be affected by the drops much. Buying regularly is a strategy that I also use, of course, I can't buy it every day. But I'm trying to buy weekly. If you think that this is done nationwide, it would be a very good investment plan in the long run. I congratulate Bukele for the right choice.",

What confuses me is whether El Salvador buys bitcoins to trade, or just to hold long-term assets. Because if the purchase is for storage, it is not necessarily a value recovery scheme that can be achieved in the near future.Regardless of why Nayib bukele bought bitcoin, I think he understands the concept of a state using a currency that has no impact on inflation. The real formulation of the state is only to protect, be it human resources or to keep the economy more stable.",
