  "content": "Before we begin, let's try to understand what bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that can be transferred on the peer_to_peer bitcoin network. First emerging in 2009, bitcoin is currently one of the world's largest digital asset. For potential investors and traders, if you want to succeed in the bitcoin community, here are a few things you should know;(1) First of as a beginner it's advisable when choosing a wallet that you go for a hot wallet like metamask, coinbase etc over cold wallets. Though overall cold wallets are better than hot wallets as they are not internet based, making them less vulnerable to online hacks. So if later on you decide to diversify your assets, you can use the both hot and cold wallets. But if you're just starting, hot wallets would be advisable I'd recommend coinbase.(2) Next you have to get yourself a reliable and reputable source for bitcoin and crypto related news. They are and they will always be opposing opinions about bitcoin, alot of negative feedbacks and they'll try to dissuade you telling you that you'll only be disappointed if you venture into Bitcoin. That's why as a beginner you need to stick to a reliable source that'll only give you solid facts. These sources might be crypto blogs, a twitter page, podcast or even a friend.(3) This I'd say is the most important. Always bear in mind that bitcoin is unpredictable and not as stable compared to other standard currencies. Don't expect it to be all fun and smiles all through. Some times you'll win, some times you'll lose its inevitable.Just look back at the 2018 crypto crash where the price of bitcoin fell by almost 65%. That's where most people get their negative experience from.This has nothing to do with being a beginner even crypto gurus are still yet to master the trends of virtual coin.(4) I know I made this thread specifically for bitcoin but how can you be a good investor if you don't expand your horizon. It's advisable to try out other Altcoins I'd recommend ethereum or ripple. Don't put all your eggs in one basket always research to see which coins are thriving well, check out their past and possible future, ask questions  this is where  those your sources come in.  In other words just try and choose your assets wisely.(5) Last but definitely not the least , always be vigilant, always check on your sources from time to time. Make research on any terminologies you do not understand. And always be prepared to take risk at any time .Like any other skill, you can't learn crypto in a day or two. Sometimes is takes months sometimes year before you can learn crypto to a certain point. As I said earlier, we can never truly master the trends of virtual coins. Even I myself I'm still a learner I learn everyday through research, personal experience and my sources example this forum.As a beginner research is imperative you always try to ask questions, it's important. I will accommodate questions under this thread. Below are some links if you still which to research more.https://coingeek.com/bitcoin101/https://www.fastcompany.com/90285052/beyond-the-bubble-what-happened-to-bitcoin-in-2018https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/amp",

Electrum is the most popular non custodial wallet that is perfect for newbie. The hot wallet example that you choose is just not good since they are all custodial wallet which doesn’t have privacy or full control to the wallet. I agree that cold storage is too expensive for beginners but it is good to invest first on the safety of there storage before they start buying there first Bitcoin.Quote from: Pillsike on November 30, 2022, 07:35:54 AMNow from your second reply I can see you're against the Altcoin idea.

Adding altcoin will just add risk to newbie due to its worst volatility that might cause heavy loss to them.

We're still recovering from the previous \"not your keys, not your coins\" disaster (FTX?) so i wonder why anybody would still think it's a good idear to promote online wallets while there are perfectly fine free open source desktop wallets available.Oh, and 300-350 dollars seems a bit steep... A trezor model one costs $70... Not 100% \"cold storage\", but in terms of safety it comes pretty close to real cold storage (and it's much easyer to setup and use, i tought my daughter how to use one when she was only 10 years old)...",

Because it's close source and we don't know how the keys are generated and whether they have the access to the keys or not. To OP:I recommend you to avoid any close-source wallet.As already suggested above, for your bitcoin, you can use electrum. It's open-source and gives you full access to your fund.",

It's better to learn things properly from the start to minimize situations that could lead to the loss of coins. Quote from: Pillsike on November 30, 2022, 07:10:19 AM(2) Next you have to get yourself a reliable and reputable source for bitcoin and crypto related news. That depends if you are talking about educational content that teaches you about bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem or regular news sites pumping out articles for clicks. I appreciate any quality educational content, but I don't read any hyped crypto news sites.Quote from: Pillsike on November 30, 2022, 07:10:19 AMIt's advisable to try out other Altcoins I'd recommend ethereum or ripple. I never understood what people see in this centralized pre-mined banking coin. People also mistaken Ripple for XRP. You aren't investing in Ripple, you are investing in XRP, a coin that was issued by the Ripple company. Ripple is both a company and also a protocol and intermediary used in traditional finance. XRP is a coin owned almost entirely by the development team that created it and the Ripple company. Like I mentioned earlier, all of it was pre-mined at the start and transferred to the controlling parties. It doesn't follow any of the standards that Bitcoin established and takes different route altogether.",

In addition, today anyone can buy a fully functional hardware wallet for less than $100, or turn an old computer into cold storage practically for free.To some extent, I understand the logic that goes in the direction that online wallets are a very easy way of storage, and they are also free - and maybe in some way they provide greater security in the sense that the user does not download a fake desktop/mobile wallet - even though phishing is not something that should be completely ignored.Simply put, if you don't know what you're doing, it's not a question of whether you'll run into a fake wallet, phishing link or clipboard malware first, it's just a matter of time when it will happen.",

I understand that when you say \"unpredictable\" and \"not as stable,\" you mean bitcoin is highly volatile, especially when compared with national \"stable\" currencies that are being managed by the country's central banks. But the price of money is not the only metric to assess their stability. If you think about it, bitcoin is the most stable and most predictable currency humanity has ever witnessed. Bitcoin is a programmable money in which it is algorithmically determined how money should behave both in times of stability and economic prosperity and in times of depression and crisis. Bitcoin has a predictable monetary policy - far more predictable than gold or national currencies. Bitcoin issuance halves every 210000 blocks and you know precisely when miners will stop producing fresh bitcoins. You know that blocks are being produced every 10 minutes on average. You know on which principles these mechanisms are based because you can always inspect the source code. Bitcoin is the most predictable money out there.",

They are and they will always be opposing opinions about bitcoin, alot of negative feedbacks and they'll try to dissuade you telling you that you'll only be disappointed if you venture into Bitcoin. That's why as a beginner you need to stick to a reliable source that'll only give you solid facts. These sources might be crypto blogs, a twitter page, podcast or even a friend.The internet now is free so you can search immediately what is the current update of the cryptocurrency world but again don't rely in just resources only there's some incomplete information given in the different blogs and article so make yourself knowledgeable more in different source of information, once you gather an information filter out it and called as Data to build a concrete understanding if the information is true or just a fake news.",
