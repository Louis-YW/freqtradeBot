  "content": "I just dont get it why people are so surprised.Economy is down in many places but why surprised?Good times cant last forever also what goes up will come down.For example look the coin what making the rally then you know it will come down at some point.Let's do the quick analysis over UK economics.For this we should think of the country as it's crypto currency.If UK would be the crypto currency then we should think about utility of the country.The Simple analysis show's that productivity and export is way lower then debt and total money supply.So we see a lot bubble and speculation and hype.UK in comparsion with coins.... not btc not eth but more likely LUNA or other \"too big to fall\" \"super hyped up\" coin.If we look at the USA we can see it's one of the top coins becouse of utility. I always had doubts and smarter people about UK it has no utility for other world but the economic wealth numbers and debt are so high and reputation \"royal\" Also alot private depts in UK Even from foreign companies but no liability for them all debt just Has been transfered to public treasury. We can see UK is the LUNA and Luna crash.If we look at the world countries who will be like btc then it could be russia or china or usa.But dont be surprised of falling becouse it's your duty to collect wealth when country doing good so you are prepared when everything falling so u don't Care.The best utility and stability Has USDT USDC so wich one it could be ? Many will argue but If the europe would be coin then it would be USDC,USDT Stable coin.China Will be more likely btc and russia maybe like eth who try to build satellite countries like ukraine to be owned so russia is main blockchain ETH and small eastern Europe countries like eth defi coins but as we know defi has many flaws.Everything in the universe works the same way there is no difference in structures only objectives.Govermemts works same ways as markets Mafia works same way like all the successfully functioning organizations. the banks the family the corporations everthing are same.If you know the first knowledge \"so as above so Below\" like Bible said..you can analyse everything successfully.",

I doubt that people in UK even care about this.Also people take 30 year mortgages contracts but economy Has 30 years circle.Soon they gona find out that their margin downpayment ammount are enough to buy property.But the economy is one BIG fomo and fud many people like to get in late so they fomo.Off course the next ones will be new generation but it's unlikely they fall in the same trap as their parents.Anyways lessons learned and education is not for Free your losses are your teacher.The next generation will not go along with this old fiat debt system they see allready how their parents did ended up.The only way world can go from here is crypto the new generation will accept crypto very well.UK all ready creating USDT based GBP coin , here is another thing people waiting for some magical CBDC but it ain't not going to happening the way most people think it will happening.It will work that way, the goverment will approve one of the most existing blockchain and crypto currency as CBDC winners off course are those who got this cryptocurrency allready early off course that Will make many people to go against govermemts and riots( they see this like not fair that someone get in early and goverment will make it AS legal CBDC LATER)but they Will only fool themselfes becouse it's their own problem If they don't want to learn how the world works where they living in.Govermemts can deal easy with those people the army can calm down every riots it's easy so those people gona just fool themselfes.Anyways cash will not disapeare they just make cash to be exanglble with USDT and Stable coins instantly by using ATM machines.Untfortunately many Banks Will close their doors If new Crisis or war dont start soon.",

The UK has about a 9 year cycle (3 years of growth, 3 years of falls and 3 years of stagnation - not unlike the rest of Europe and particularly countries like Sweden). There's a potential for 70 year cycles (1850, 1920, 1970) but those have been met with immediate innovation and a new economic revolution. Most countries are now developed compared to 18th and 19th century Britain, we're not seeing a revolution every 70 years, we're seeing one every 5-20...The housing market probably won't follow that because a lot of demand comes from foreign investors or large capital firms like hedge funds. Property prices will probably fall in the UK but it'll be most likely caused by a declining population over anything particularly economic.European bonds have a lower interest rate than US ones at the moment too - is this because of everyone's tremendous confidence in the US? A third of the US economy is domestic healthcare too... If every country became tokenised, the ones \"worth the most\" would probably surprise all of us and if ownership of a token changed hands based off citizenship, countries would probably move a lot over the long term.",
