  "content": "I was think about storing emergency supplies for 2 people.How affordable is it to store enough food and water for myself and my wife.A few years ago hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey hard and the shelfs were bare.Pandemic came and lots of shortages.So could I reasonable store 30 days of food and water for my wife and I.How much space? How much food ? how much water?propane?I am a diabetic so I use high protein and fat low carb diet.30 days means 30 cans of chicken10 cans of tomatoes 10 cans of chickpeas10 cans of cannaelli beans10 pounds of roasted peanuts 5 pounds of walnuts5 pounds of almondsa bottle of multi vitaminsand 100 ½ liter bottles of watera dozen cans of peachesa dozen cans of pearssome parmalot as it keeps some cerealThe above should do the trick for my wife and I. For maybe 45 days.I can afford to have the above list I am thinking a lot of people can’t.So how exposed are people to a solid disaster.No fresh meatNo dairy since refrigerated goods may be gone.I would think most of the world is a short time away from real food issues if food shopping is shut down.your thoughts and ideas are welcome.",

Where we could have unlimited fish to catch. And if in case there really is a war coming. Really worried if all these will escalate to a level where there is no U turn. You never know how long it will take.Don't you think a water purifier will give you more advantage than keeping 100liters?  I'm thinking of putting all the stored food inside a van where you can travel with you wife because this is what I have in mind.The more you could store I think if you go for dried food vs canned goods. I tried some in a vacuumed plastic and put them all storage box, this will keep you more than 30 days.  But of course you  still need some canned goods. First aid kit and medicines like antibiotic and for flu. I could be overthinking this already but its best to prepare.",

      "body": "The space could be variable. In disaster scenarios, you'd want to maintain materials that could keep warmth. Dealing with summer heat isn't as difficult. Water is more important than food for immediate survival, and you need at least half a liter of water per day minimum (factoring in no perspiration from the temperature which is unrealistic). I'd imagine the space you would occupy wouldn't have long lasting generators for AC, so you'd need to increase the water intake. I'd say 90 liters per person minimum a month. Ideally, you'd probably want 120 liters. Most people need anywhere from 1k-1.2k kcals minimum to survive, so the most space efficient way to get those calories would be high caloric carbohydrates and fatty foods. Lean proteins won't give you enough calories if you're just looking to survive.",

It is more difficult to foresee the option if you have to do without going to the grocery store for say a year or two, for example, in the event that the entire civilian infrastructure is destroyed by a nuclear strike. A few years ago, I experimented with making universal dry food for people and created my own recipe for granola - baked oatmeal in honey with the addition of nuts and dried fruits. When vacuumized, granola retains its taste and nutritional properties without noticeable degradation for at least six months (this is from what I personally checked, I think that it is possible with some stretch to extrapolate the result obtained for 25 years, because there is nothing special to spoil there). After creating such a stock of dry food with a long shelf life, you only need to take care of a water disinfection device and iodine tablets in order to have a chance to survive the apocalypse of any complexity. Hopefully I won't need this skill, but I'm glad I have it.",

The people in Ukraine hardly have that luxury of storing food that long because any thing is possible to happen with the attacks. In a peaceful situation, of course you can store for more than a month and beyond. Being a diabetic patient, you need high protein foods and they are really expensive with the level of inflation. You need such storage because you don't have to eat anyhow any more, depending on your space in your apartment, you can get some large containers where you can load food not easily perishing.",

Its easy over the summer to grow but during the winter a bit more difficult.So what extra could I add to philipma1957's list?Cheese as it potentially has an extended shelf live if refridgeratedNuts and Seeds as these have a long shelf life and are high in protein ad nutrients and energyProtein bars although expensive for their size they have a long shelf life and are high in . . .

      "body": "If this is what you need and you will use to anticipate certain storms or crises in life. So I can suggest just two things from some of the foods that are already on your list.First, for water storage problems, you can use other alternatives such as digging a borehole near your house or in your yard. That way you will always have water and will never be cut off from water forever and you can use it anytime without having to spend money again like buying. But before drinking it, it's a good idea to take the water for cooking first.The second for storing chickens, you can use other alternatives by buying chickens that are a little big and then keeping them at home for a few days. But you need to prepare the bait for the chicken for a few days as well before you cut it to eat.Those are the only two things that I can recommend and for the others I think it is very suitable for you to save for 45 days with the aim of anticipating certain storms or crises that can occur at any time in any country.",

Red Cross packages are similar and even more robust.One such reference: https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000104979/download/That's the famous RUSF but many adult versions can be made locally in most countries. They taste like shit but in severe conditions you'll be reasonably healthy just living on these for months. Some refugees spend their entire childhood eating mostly food like this.Almost certain you can locate manufacturers.I read (so should not be taken seriously) some doomsday movements or the preppers mentioned above in US also stock and sell all kinds of survival packages, think they tin most of their stuff though. Don't know if these are proven as the more scientific methods of WFP.For water, I also looked into fog catchers. Those things just condensate water from the air, so it's drinkable, even your waste can be used. Problem they haven't solved I think is a contraption that doesn't need electricity.Now if only there were people selling all these for BTC eh?",

So they should buy more and collect everything in their homes because of the crisis. At the same time, this will increase the demand and create a hostile atmosphere and other people will also try to do the same thing and this will increase the price and worst, also since we should pay attention to how long you can save the foods, I'm sure that's not a long time, regardless of that in my idea the root of the food crisis is partly because of the war between Russia and Ukraine and another part can be related to the crisis of water.",

It basically sad to have 20 litres of water and 14 kilo of food per person to last 10 days without leaving the house. In crisis times these supplies could also be stretched to 20 days, but it still doesn't seem a lot to me. I am trying now to store provision for a longer period of time. Your 45 days approach seems like a good start. I like your variety of canned goods to not be forced to eat the same thing every day. Canned goods are good if you have space to store, if you are limited on space I would recommend different food. Take a look at the army or mountaineer rations, they very lightly packed because they don't contain any water. Like that they last forever and you can pack a lot of them on each other. The only problem is you need a lot of more water to prepare the meals. One solution can be a water purification system at home that cleans public water. Another thing I would add is vitamin supplements and medicine to make sure we don't get sick.",

      "body": "Having a supply of food for 3 weeks is normally enough for most emergencies. If you realize that it will be longer, you can usually ration the 3-week supply for longer. My changes are based on observations related to the war (Ukraine) and how people were surviving in cases where you really couldn't buy food. Meat and nuts aren't a priority because you can survive without both and food supplies are for survival purposes. Same goes for cans of peaches and pears (unless it's a diabetic thing because you need to ensure you aren't low on sugar, but even for that you should probably store something smaller and more reliable). Water is a must if there is a risk there won't be any or it will be very unsafe to get any, but again, in case of emergency, you can survive on less water than you might normally drink, not to mention all the fluids on the cans themselves. So having 50 litres of water is probably enough. Cans with beans are good, but I'd also add rice, pasta, wheat or something like that because these can make other things last much longer (for example, you can ear chickpeas with rice), and it's more filling. If you are out of electricity, you might have gas. If you're out of gas, you can probably cook on fire. If you're a diabetic and you need meds or there's a chance you'll need them when a diet changes, you must store a healthy supply of meds as well.",

I certainly agree with the suggestion that you gave. The pandemic situation also trained me to stock and store foods that could last for a longer period. When buying, always check the expiration date for your safety and assurance. More than anything else, store rice and secure gas as well as clean water. Don't focus on junk foods and those that won't make you full. You also need to store medicine and vitamins. I guess, if we've been through lockdowns during the worse pandemic situation, we've all learned our lesson when it comes to storing and stocking important supplies.",

The first weeks after the new terrorist attack of the Kremlin bastards (I live in Kiev, the attack began on February 24, 2022), the prospects were not very positive, and we came to the conclusion that we should probably prepare.We prepared a little in advance (by the way, I also recommend it if there are risks of global problems)1. Having a home, tactical backpacks. Pre-assembled and stocked. What do we still have in our backpacks?- hygiene products: soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, sets of wet wipes 10 packs * 50 pcs., antiseptic (in 25 ml spray bottles, 5 pcs.), 5 packets of \"dry shower\", comb- underwear: underwear, T-shirts, socks. All cotton (reduces hygiene issues). Warm socks.- 2 liters of plain water, in a container of 250-400 ml, preferably with the addition of silver (a simple way to disinfect water and increase the shelf life, but it must be changed at least once every 2 months!).- Cereal bread. 5-6 packs, divided into daily sets.- Dark chocolate. The most pure and the most containing cocoa. 2 tiles- Snickers bars 5 pcs. Yes, not the most useful product, especially for those who have problems like diabetes, but very effective.- Canned food - lard twisted with parsley, garlic and black pepper. An extremely satisfying dish, with a minimum volume. It is completely absorbed by the body and does not give side effects. in vacuum bags of 100 grams, 1 kg total.- scissors, multi-tool, knife- Fleece jacket. Tactical hat (convenient and comfortable). Tactical gloves. Spare belt.- Money (in local currency and dollars, the total equivalent for each is approximately 3000-4000 dollars)- Documents and copies of documents that may be with you.- Powerbank, one for 20000, the other compact for 10000. 2x universal type-c cables, with Mini-Usb + type-C termination- Compass- Tourist flashlight- The simplest mobile phone, with maximum autonomy, charged.- Medications: adhesive plaster (packaging), stopping tourniquet, painkiller, antidiarrheal, bandage, anti-inflammatory, antihistamine, drugs to stabilize the intestines and stomach, activated charcoal, potassium permanganate. Well, who needs special preparations - them, depending on the degree of significance. Also multivitamins, divided into 10-20 pieces per sachet, 90 pieces (for 3 months of daily intake)In the remaining place - whoever wishes from the personal This is the first part !The second part. Stocks of food. What is good for us is that in the complex where I have an apartment, in the basement equipped as a bomb shelter (but not originally intended for this), storage rooms were also sold. From 4 to 15 meters. We bought 15 meters.There, 2-3 weeks after the start of the terrorist attack on Kyiv and the region, they collected the following:- drinking water, mineralized, about 12 packs (6 bottles * 1.5 liters, per pack)- canned food (stewed pork, as the most nutritious and satisfying product, although perhaps not the most useful ). It was difficult to buy, but they were periodically imported, but they gave me and my son as rations (we serve in the territorial defense units of Kyiv). Total collected about 40 cans (450 grams)- Crackers and bread. Packs 30-40.- Again, canned twisted lard (lard, garlic, parsley, dill, black pepper). in jars of 200 g, sterile closed, 2 kg.- Chocolate, protein bars, dried berries, raisins, nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, cashews)- Inflatable mattresses - 4 pcs. Fleece covers 4 pcs. inflatable pillows, 4 pcs.- Dog food After the russian terrorists were destroyed in Kyiv and the Kyiv region, most of the stocks were donated to charity, and the longest stored was left in the basement, just in case.Oh yes, and most importantly - I wish you that this will never come in handy for you!",
