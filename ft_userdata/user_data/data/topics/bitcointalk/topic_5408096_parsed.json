Obviously, they are buying in exchanges, but maybe they will immediately withdraw it to a wallet that they have total control of, have the private keys and mnemonic phrase as they don't want to take the risk on putting it in an exchange wherein it could be hack or they bitcoin might be confiscated by exchanges without warning.",

A whale sending in and sending out his millions worth of bitcoin would cost him only under $50. Also, it should also be known where those coins were sent and held. Were they sent to a personal wallet? Were they sent to a cryptolending platform similar to Voyager, Celsius, Babylon Finance?The market will also not pump by itself. Leverage was much of the central cause on why bitcoin pumped from $3k to $60k. I mentioned before that if we do not know how mucn leverage was used to pump the market, we should be careful in thinking that all time high was caused by adoption because it was not. I also asked where the coins were sent and held because of this news. Babel Finance, the troubled Asian crypto lender that abruptly halted client withdrawals last month, suffered heavy losses due to proprietary trading with customer funds, according to its restructuring proposal deck obtained by The Block.The deck, dated July 2022, reveals that Babel Finance lost more than $280 million in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) due to its proprietary trading failure. Specifically, it lost around 8,000 BTC and 56,000 ETH in June after facing liquidation due to a significant market downturn.Source https://www.theblock.co/post/160230/babel-finance-crypto-lost-280-million-proprietary-trading-restructuring",

I'm not convinced this is specifically the case. This only means that less users are holding their coins on exchanges, not directly that they are less likely to sell them. 6 months ago I used to believe this theory, but in that time exchange supply has decreased along with price. This therefore only means that less Bitcoiners are holding coins on exchanges these days, not much else, probably as overall they are getting a bit smarter.Quote from: _act_ on July 29, 2022, 10:18:29 PMThe increase may not be that significant to get bitcoin to all-time-high but an opportunity for people to hold at low price and make passive income. I think the overall result will be slightly less selling when a relief rally / trend reversal begins, as more coins off exchanges means they are less likely to be sold (even if the last 6 months has sort of disproven this theory). But clearly the idea that more holders are holding for the long-term is yet to be proven, until we see how much supply is re-introduced (increased into exchanges) when prices bounce back.Baring in mind the number of exchanges/services/platforms that have been hacked over the years, become insolvent, etc, etc, means users are finally holding more coins themselves, rather than relying on third party services. This doesn't mean they won't immediately send these coins back to these exchanges and services when price increases however. As I said, time will tell.",

Maybe someone will disagree, but such a quantity available for sale has a great influence on the price regardless of the max supply, if we add to the fact that a little less than 2 million BTC is available for mining and about 1.7 million BTC will enter circulation in less than 10 years then we can conclude that the supply is still much higher than the demand.",

There's also a possibility that they are buying more on the exchanges and that's the cause of the decline in btc supply. I think this was mostly a good news and not a bad news just because the supply of btc in exchanges is declining, as the price can skyrocket anytime soon.In the event that a lot of people are going to sell, the stock of btc in the exchanges are going to be refilled again so there is no need to worry. People are always going to do that as it doesn't make sense to just hold and buy btc for nothing or only because they do it for display purposes. If that is what they want then they better go on those nft's.",
