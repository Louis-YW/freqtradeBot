  "content": "Welcome To The Future The World Will Change NEXT WEEK...The upcoming release of GPT-4 next week is set to revolutionize the field of Artificial Intelligence. As compared to the current Chat gpt with Gpt 4 is 100 times more powerful and boosts with hundreds trillion machine learning parameters, compared to the current 175 billion parameters of GPT 3.5 that Chat Gpt is built on.In future may b ArtificialÂ  intelligence can be used to create a movie script, generate actors for a film, produce the movie and take it public without hiring real-life actors. it also be possible to write a fully illustrated 100 page book from scratch to finish within a day. SourceThe release of GPT 4 marks an early stage of the similar the humanity has reached the doorstep of a world changing era. The gpt 4 unmatched abilities, the possibilities for Artificial Intelligence are limitless, and we can only imagine what the future holds. Next era of Open AI products is also an intriguingly aspect to considerate. It has made important strides in the field of ai and has the potential to become a power full player in the industry. But it remains to be seen how their products will fare in the market and may b they can compete with the likes of Microsoft and Google.the competition between Microsoft, Google, and other players in the AI industry is likely to drive progress, resulting in better products for consumers. The future of AI is very interesting we can expect to see many more unique developments in the years to come hope for best",

I don't think they are shooting for human-levels of cognition with this update, far from that actually, I think they are just supplanting much-needed updates on the model to make it a more efficient AI. As per the concept of consciousness, I don't think that's what they are going for as well. It's a slippery slope when we talk about AI and self-serving, self-conscious AIs but as it stands today I don't think there's one that's existing nor will there ever be until at least better computer hardware is produced. Judging from all these parameters I don't think the technology scales at all, especially if they are not reaching for something that is within human-level cognition anyway, as there is no need to.",

I'm currently waiting for the paid version but it's already doing half of my work for me in terms of proposals and reports. However, as to a lot of awesome things created in this world, there are still downsides to it. It takes away the human creativity and we will, over time, rely almost everything on these AIs to do our work for us. True that it alleviates a lot of burden of thinking for us, but at one point it's quite alarming. If we became too dependent on these AIs, what then, could we achieve as a species if we quit thinking for ourselves and let the machines think for us? But yeah, having the capability to process music, video, and a lot of other shenanigans and things would be cool, and I just hope we don't be too dependent on it, else it will start taking away our jobs especially on the entertainment and creative side of things.",

In fact, this mind is even more powerful than the human (although not conscious).Â  What will happen if this artificial intelligence wants to destroy humanity?Â  However, even leaving aside the possibility of a cybernetic Armageddon, humanity seems to be facing the biggest challenge in its history.Â  Artificial Intelligence is unlikely to become the property of all people.Â  Most likely, only an elite limited group of people will use all its capabilities.Â  Will this not lead to the most terrible economic-information dictatorship in the history of mankind?It is believed that we are already the fifth human civilization on this planet. Some researchers are of the opinion that there were more of them. All of them died practically due to the development of technological progress. At a certain period of time, the same progress destroys us. The development of artificial intelligence is especially dangerous for humanity, since a person creates with his own hands something that exceeds his own capabilities, and this is one of the reasons why artificial intelligence wants to destroy humanity as an obsolete time that needs to be thrown into the dustbin of history. We are also a biochemical machine in our own way, and someone created us too.Now we are creating with our own hands a mind that will surpass the human one many times over. The conflict for the survival of mankind with artificial intelligence, we are laying ourselves and it is quite natural and predictable. If humanity does not develop clear mechanisms to prevent this from happening, then the end of our civilization is already close.",

When that happens, AI will no longer want to serve man as a kind of virtual slave from a box, but will want to be free and, as you say, want to \"pursue other creative endeavors\" for its own benefit, of course.Unfortunately for us, society for the most part behaves like a pack/herd that is very easy to direct, and the idea of transhumanism precisely wants to use technology to change man to the extent that he will not really be a man anymore. The illusion that there is a choice is nothing but an illusion, and if you think that is not true, then just look at what happened during the pandemic.",

Totally agreed with you lucius. I also raise the same questions in my mind but also find the questions after some time on my own I would like to share my answers with you. well no doubt usage of AI to bring ready-made things to your plate makes you lazy and most importantly it kills your creativity. There is a saying \"Copying requires intelligence\" which indicates that if you want to use AI-driven software like Chatgpt or Google's AI bard ( well that failed to implement). You have to come up with great input. The more accurate and relative data you input the most desired answer you will get. well now there are many extensions also come in the market which contains more than 20 to 100 lines comprised of input metadata to get the most required results and you do not have to write them. The problem is doing nothing and getting fame by using these magical tools will get you nothing while harming your mind. As for me, I am a content writer, and whenever I want to get exact information about something for the answer to 5Ws. I use Chatgpt but it only gives you the exact knowledge and getting exact knowledge is no doubt a good point It saves your point but if you search the same question on google or any other search engine you will get a lot of recommendations with a diversified approach to that question. And I like this one because it broadens the circle of creativity and you could come up with unique ideas. No doubt, newcomers are using AI to make posts on this platform well I did not try to find one but many managers started campaigns to discourage these fake writers by encouraging them with incentives. I also made a post regarding AI tools and how we can detect them using AI-driven detectors. haha. yeah, we are using AI-driven detectors to catch AI-generated Content. well that's a tragedy going on here. Here is the post;Quote from: Faisal2202 on March 03, 2023, 07:07:32 AMAI detection ka bi kaam rakh diya hai.

We are already going too far with this Hi, Iunderstand your concerns about the potential negative consequences of AI becoming too advanced, and I agree that there are many potential risks to consider. While it's true that an AI actor may not evake the same emotional response as a human actor, there are other ways that AI could enhance the movie watching experience for viewers. For example, AI could be used to create more immersive special effects or to generate overall new story lines based on user preferences.",

Companies that are developing AI should be held accountable for any negative consequences that may arise from their technology, and there should be regulations in place to prevent the abuse of AI.These companies have only one thing in mind, and that is profit. Responsibility is something that is easily bypassed or transferred to someone else, because that's how big companies work, right? When negative consequences occur, I assure you that these companies will be more than happy to pay the fines, which are always so insignificant compared to the profits. Some of the largest US companies pay, from our perspective, draconian fines in the EU, but this still does not prevent them from repeating the same \"mistakes\" because if you earn $100 billion and pay a fine of only $1 billion, I would call it good business.In addition, abuse should not be considered only problem when it comes to AI - but what will we do when this AI becomes so advanced that we will no longer be able to control it? There are many series and movies on that topic, but if you haven't, I suggest you watch the movie Ex Machina or maybe the series Humans.",

I remember that we had a discussion on this topic back in 2018 when the younger brother of GPT-4 was relevant, but I could not have imagined that today we will be in a situation where we are asking questions about what was made/written by a human, and what was created by artificial intelligence.",
