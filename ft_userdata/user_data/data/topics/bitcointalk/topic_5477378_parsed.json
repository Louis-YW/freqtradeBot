  "content": "With the coming improvements to the market, I have managed to save a healthy sum inorder to have my dream of a crypto exchange come to life. I’ve done all the back work which includes, registering, applying and working towards a license, creating a team, hiring the right officers, marketing expenses. No expense has been spared with establishing myself in the market. I’d like to introduce you to the culprit: Crypto2cloud, a service run by Azbit Exchange. I was attracted to this exchange because Azbit is in the top 40 exchanges, I’m not sure how they run this exchange. If it’s any reflection of what I’ve experienced then I pity their customers. Allow me to take you through the experience that I’ve had and dismantle the delivery product to what is advertised piece by piece so no one has to ever go through this ever again; On initial contact, you’ll deal with Andrew Akulenko (not doxing, you can find it on their website), you’ll have a phone call and get promised the world and be sent a PDF with their different packages. I’ll show you the package I’ve picked:https://imgur.com/a/bpZrhfJI picked the pro package. The third package, second place from the best package offered. I did not choose the blockchains. There are 3 working blockchains and a TRX blockchain which I’ve been instructed not to use. There is no futures option, promised on a future date as it’s not availableThere is no copy trading platform, this is also promised on a future dateLiquidity does not work properly for new tokens added on to the exchange. Tech support is very high at $1700 a month but with what was promised at the time and the reputation and ranking of the exchange. I figured I would pay this given the exceptional service I would receive. The features that I have been provided are the same as one package down which costs $5000 less. Now lets take a look at this website page: You can find the website by going to azbit.com and clicking the tab on the left or crypto2cloud.com.https://imgur.com/Maf3ImAAs previously indicated, there is no copy trading, forex, stocks, derivatives or margin trading. Only spot trading. https://imgur.com/Maf3ImAWe will skip the first 2 and go to business licensing services. I’ve asked for this before I found my consulting firm and no option was provided. There is no fiat currency processing option available. Promised at a later dateThere are no Payment solutions provided. Promised at a later datehttps://imgur.com/FHYY3c9This is the part I have the biggest issue with. The delivery time. It says 72 hours, I was told that is for the basic exchange. They promised me 10 days. Actual delivery time: 3 months. You will keep getting delayed, excuse after excuse. No further support is being provided, answers have been delayed right after the payment was demanded.Here is an example of an exchange they will show you that they’ve done for a customer: https://hachikoexchange.com/Beautiful right? Expecting your exchange to look similar would be reasonable. The finished product is far off from your expectations. I’ve invested in the exchange itself which is not complete and lacks features, my marketing ads are not converting as people think the exchange looks off, front end not completed, backend issues as well. I can get the issues fixed as I have experienced devs hired and on payroll but they wont let me access myself to do the updates. I’ve asked to purchase the source code so that I may do further development myself, this was ignored and no answer given. What I believe is that by delivering a subpar product they expect monthly payments to drain you. Not making a profit, I’m sure many have quit, thinking it was their own wrong doing or inexperience. I hope no one has to go through this. This is a cry for help and so buyers are aware of what they will experience dealing with this company. As per proof, I have all chat logs, payment address, personal experiences (in person) as well but I have chosen not to share this as it’s defamation of their character.",

If not, you should consider their offer to be just bullshit or otherwise you can imagine what the platform will be like. So, have they completed the exchange you ordered?And it's good that you shared this bad experience. From the community's own assessment, Azbit is unfortunately not a recommended exchange. He has proven to have had some problems in the past with project clients and their users.",

If not, you should consider their offer to be just bullshit or otherwise you can imagine what the platform will be like. So, have they completed the exchange you ordered?I was told that they have a template and a back end system that was plug and play. The only things that have to be added is images on the front end, content and API keys in the back end. All of which happens once the platform has been deployed. The exchange is 60% complete. The support system and the admins are not responding. I've delayed for 2 weeks by the sales person. It used to be a telegram account(which I dont have access to) that was used for developers, now it's a ticket system that they havent responded to.

I wasnt aware of this thread and it didnt come up when I googled the service.Quote from: holydarkness on December 11, 2023, 06:30:39 PMI think I didn't grasp your story quite perfectly, you save some money to build your dream, you have a team, hiring officers, etc. but you're still using their service to build your website and other things? Which require more funds while you already have a team that can do it for you on their payroll? Why?I have team in place to work the platform. Azbit and crypto2cloud will build the platform that will be what the team works around. The only thing I required was a platform and this seemed at the time to be the best option instead of building one from scratch and using an API for the backend. Direction was ideally what I was looking for when coming on board to their service as they're the experts in this industry and well established.The funds that they require you can see in the first imgur picture upload is the payment per month for maintenance, updates and support of the platform. I hope this helps clarify things.Quote from: sujonali1819 on December 11, 2023, 02:14:47 PMQuote from: Cryptouser999 on December 11, 2023, 03:13:08 AMI’ve invested in the exchange itself which is not complete and lacks features, my marketing ads are not converting as people think the exchange looks off, front end not completed, backend issues as well.

In the end, would you run an exchange that was provided by a group of scammers that have wasted so much of your time? It is possible that they could add a backdoor to gain access to the exchange or furthermore something on the lines of malicious code to steal crypto.Running an exchange is not easy, getting an off-the-shelf exchange does not mean much if you cannot monitor it. There are many things to think about such as background systems which make the exchange servers operate. Can you elaborate about how many team members are with you and how you intended to run the exchange?Quote from: Cryptouser999 on December 11, 2023, 03:13:08 AMThis is the part I have the biggest issue with.

Thank you for this, you understood what my message is Umm... yeah, I understand this, what I am failed to understand is the logic behind it. I can understand if OP tried to cut some corners if he's limited by some resources [fund, builder, marketing staffs, etc.], but given he got all that he needs, and since it's his dream business, I think it will be better to build everything by himself, both for security reason as JG said [the backdoor and malicious code] or from the creative side of the design itself [template given by them are likely similar to other site, thus raise less confidence in customers.Sorry OP, didn't try to be rude, or to pour any salt [and rubbing alcohol] to your wound, just... speaking my mind.Anyway, do you mind presenting the evidence and, perhaps, edit the opening post with the format as the bottom of this post, so we can start taking proper action? You can move the current opening post into the \"additional notes\" section.Code:[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b][b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]",

It seems that (like it or not) you have to recruit them as a core team if you want to continue with their product, you're constantly made to complain about the code they keep for themselves so you have to extend the monthly support fee for it. Maybe this is just my opinion but who knows. At this point, your own team won't even touch front-end development or just handle customer issues.",
