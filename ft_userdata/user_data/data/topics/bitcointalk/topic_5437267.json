What I mean is a distro that comes with preinstalled software that you would need for any Bitcoin related business (full node software like Core, another lightweight software like Electrum, all libraries pre-installed, Tor, some other useful tools and everything else declutted)I ask this because if you were to for instance land in another country, and you needed to install everything from scratch, it would take a ton of time. If you could have everything in an .iso more or less ready to run, you would just get your laptop (which you wiped before crossing any borders) and install your linux Bitcoin distro, and leave it there installing everything while you chill on your hotel's swimming pool or something. After a while everything is ready so you just enter your passphrase or recover your wallet.dat which you temporarily left somewhere in the cloud encrypted and get your coins ready.I know Tails has Electrum but it doesn't have Bitcoin Core. It also has a ton of stuff I don't need and Electrum is always outdated.The idea would be a minimalist setup, with some sort of system that automatically downloads, verifies and compiles the required software and libraries during the installation process.",

However, it is common for many systems to have outdated or missing software and libraries that are needed to run applications and perform certain tasks. To ensure that the system is up-to-date and functioning optimally, it is important to perform software updates regularly.No distribution, as far as I know, carries out software updates during the installation process. Instead, the updates are done after the installation is complete. This is often done through a prompt or a notification from the operating system, inviting the user to update the installed software.",

Trusting an unknown ISO could potentially lead to disastrous consequences. Taking the time to install Electrum or Bitcoin Core may take a few minutes, but it's worth it to have full control over your funds and the security of knowing that you're not relying on an unknown source. Better safe than sorry!",

For example Electrum only requires python 3 which comes pre-installed with most Linux distros already. So there isn't much time to be spent installing these.The time consuming part is verifying the authenticity of these which is best done by yourself instead of trusting a distro that won't be popular or reviewed enough. Besides, if you do it a couple of times you should become fast in doing the verification since it is really easy.",

If you want to hide the fact that you are taking bitcoin across a border, then using a hardware wallet and simply hoping no one recognizes it is not a good plan. There are plenty of better ways to hide a seed phrase, which is all you actually need to carry across a border, and you can download all the necessary software once you reach your destination.Quote from: NeuroticFish on January 31, 2023, 08:02:26 AMArguably even Tor you may not need since you're not from home, since you don't necessarily need to hide your IP.Using Tor in this scenario also prevents the hotel (or whoever owns the WiFi you are using) from seeing which websites you are connecting to.

How would you be hiding the wallet on it? And what are you going to say under a targeted search when they ask you why you have an airgapped phone with no SIM card in it?The seed phrase can be easily obfuscated in a stack of academic/professional/employment related documents, notes, books, etc. Alternatively, it is easy to hide in a hidden volume on your laptop, which you could decrypt to show copies of sensitive documents such as your passport or travel insurance. Impossible to prove the hidden volume even exists.But yes, I would just use Electrum and point it at my own server which is running at home.",
