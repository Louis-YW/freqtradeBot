There is no special app that would help your security other than the antivirus, they have more functions than what their name \"antivirus\" denotes. Go for the big names with a good reputation.The best I've used is Norton, they have different plans which include Antivirus Plus, Standard, Deluxe and Select+ Lifelock. I don't think there is any internet security service you desire on your gadget that the Select+ Lifelock package can't provide.",

If you intend to be using it frequently then transfer the amount you need to your other device and follow the suggestion of the post above mine i.e use AdBlock, don't download file from unknown source and even when it's from the original source make sure you verify it if I deed it's the genuine one.The safety of your coins depends majorly on the way you handle your device, the more careless you are with your device the probability of your device getting hacked also increases exponentially.",

      "body": "You are not 100% safe if you can not prevent malware with knowledge and experience. The way devices are infected is common, it can be through the download of a torrent file, ads (including link ads) and many others. Some malware can be through social app like Telegram if you put it on automatic download. Making sure the sites you visit are legit and not just the one from google search engine. Making sure your device download and app installation should be manually and not automatically. I have heard before that some people that also got malware from porn site they visit. If you have your bank app, online wallet and exchange accounts on a device, it is good to avoid what I listed above. If your ad blocker is not effective enough, you can download ublock origin browser extension which is still one of the best and performing its work effectively. On such device, use a privacy browser like Tor, Firefox and Duckduckgo (Duckduckgo for Windows and MaxOS are beta and not recommended, but good for Android and iOS). Also privacy search engine like Duckduckgo is better.If you have large amount of coins, do not use online wallet, use cold wallets like paper wallet or wallet on an airgapped device if you are savvy enough that you know you are doing it correctly. Paper wallets are offline if created on an airgapped device too which makes it secure, generating it online means it is an online wallet. If you are not savvy enough about wallets, you can buy a hardware wallet like Passport for bitcoin which is the best that I can recommend, or Trezor for multicoins.On online devices, there are still safer approaches like Electrum 2FA wallet and multisig wallet. Your 2FA device should not be on the device that you have the wallet.",

That's why if you've got already an anti-virus and the typical apps that you need to have for your work or wallets, there's no need to download a lot.What you need to do is to work on yourself and be vigilant with the browsing activity that you've been doing with your device. And avoid downloading unusual wallets and those that have description to protect, only your way of browsing and your usage of your device will protect you the most.",

Just use a good wallet and get your seedohrasr backed up and that just do the tricks rather than wanting to install  any app for that as we can't  even trust those apps.",

With good apps and a poor behavior or attitude to your security, those apps will not still be enough to save you from theft. As you look for apps to help your security improve, also seek knowledge that will improve your consciousness on security, so that when you get apps, you will be assured of more security. Also many people have downloaded the wrong thing that caused problem for them while they were looking to download good apps that are useful, download any app suggested to you from the appropriate source, so you do not download problem.",

If my assumption is correct and, in addition,  you are technically savvy guy, then OSArmor may help you to achieve better security, It is capable to  \"monitor and block suspicious processes behaviors to prevent infections by malware, ransomware, and other threats.\"But to use OSArmor successfully you really need to have a good knowledge on processes lying in the core of OS.

The .APK application is malware that will infect the target cellphone and which aims to steal all data when it is installed. and using disposable emails for random sites seems like a good idea, so that the main email doesn't always receive malicious Spam messages.As well as for wallet applications such as trust wallets, it is better to use a new wallet if you want to connect with new Dapps so the risk of being hacked is very small. make sure the main wallet is not connected to any Dapps, because currently theft is rife with the Drainned and Dusting methods. using an antivirus might help a little, but it's not completely.",
