Afaik, Binance did tell that on their platform since the incident of the hack but I don't really know if it's true since I haven't tried or experienced it. Perhaps, if you put your BTC on the other platform that isn't reputable they might just call it a quits if they were get hacked – because if you think about it.Where would these exchanges take those lost BTC? Of course, they have to buy it or they have to use their saved Bitcoin but it's likely not going to happen. Unlike with the banks that they could just create money out of nowhere that's why inflation is hitting them real hard once there's a bad thing happening to them.Thus, in my conclusion, there's no such thing as Bitcoin insurance.",

I've heard about this before but honestly, I don't have anyone close to being doing this, maybe someone on here insured their Bitcoin or it's just a fad. Yes, it is possible to get insurance for your Bitcoin holdings, but the availability and terms of such insurance can vary depending on the insurer and the specific policy. Some custodial platforms provide insurance coverage for crypto assets in case of a security breach or loss resulting from their failure. The insurance coverage may be complete or partial, depending on the specific platform and the terms of the insurance policy.To learn more about Crypto Insurance, you can check out this Investopedia article: https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-insurance-5441920",

So far I do not think there is a service out there which offers what you want, now in the future banks and exchanges could offer this but only if you give up your coins to them, and if they disappear then any insurance they gave you goes down with them, so it would not be a very good service while the fees you will have to pay for it will be too high, taking this into account I think we should not expect for any kind of reasonable insurance to ever appear.",

I have never heard of something like this, I just did a quick search and found that it actually exist and the service is been offered by even some exchanges like binance, but the insurance offered is not as comprehensive as real insurance. There are many things that can happen to your cryptocurrency, and you have to get an insurance plan for the situations. I know that incidents that lead to loss of cryptocurrency are not always planned and can happen anytime, but you need to personally on your own improve your knowledge on security of your cryptocurrency as the amount of cryptocurrency you have increases. The security plan for when you had $200 has to improve for when what you have has increased to $1000 for example.",

Or you gotta give it up? It's perfectly alright to ask a question here, that's the exact purpose of this forum, not need to be apologetic about it.You are right, insurance cannot cover a decentralized asset like Bitcoin. Insurance comes with regulations and you need to have some sort of control inorder to regulate something.This means that for you to insure your bitcoins in any form, you have to access it on a centralized platform and hand over custody. This is not an ideal option as it involves not being in control of your Bitcoin private keys and hence can be restricted from accessing them at any time.It also presents a privacy risk in registering on such platform and exposing your Bitcoin holdings.",

Or you gotta give it up? Not sure what you mean by insurance since when you have bitcoin, you control of it, as long as you have the private keys and mnemonic phrase, hence the phrase, non-custodial wallet.But if by chance you store your bitcoin to an exchange let's say Binance, they have control of you bitcoin and or crypto. You can also get at least some sort of insurance if Binance gets hacks. But if you yourself was lose it through hacks on your account then you can't get anything from them. Not all crypto exchange though as SAFU.",

But if we talk about possibility here everything is possible and OP needs to handover the information to the company which is not a good thing to do.
