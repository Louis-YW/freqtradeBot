  "content": "This thread will serve as a repository for AI spam references in instances where posts written using AI (ChatGPT) cannot immediately be recognized as so.The thread works like this:When you wish to report a post as being \"AI spam,\" particularly for posts that might not be explicit spam but still generated by AI, you can include a reference link in the report to your own post in this thread, which will contain results from AI detector analyses of the post. When adding an offending account to this thread for the first time, your post should include three or more examples of AI-generated posts by that account. Subsequently, each time the account makes an AI-generated post, those posts can be individually added to this thread, if necessary.Here are the criteria that will be used to determine whether or not a post was either wholly or partially made using AI (as originally referenced in this thread):At least 2 of the 7 AI content detectors mentioned below must give a result of the post having a strong likelihood of containing AI-written material (with \"strong likelihood\" defined for each one):1. GPTZero - 70% probability to contain AI generated text or higher2. Copyleaks AI Content Detector - 70% probability for AI or higher3. Sapling AI Detector - 70% Fake or higher4. Quillbot - 70% of text is likely to come from AI or higher5. Zerogpt - 70% likely to include parts generated by AI/GPT or higher6. StealthWriter - 70% AI probability or higher7. Originality.ai - 70% confident that text is AI generated or higher(Pay-to-use AI detectors have been excluded to keep verification accessible to all).There must be at least 3 posts by the account that meet the requirements specified in A. If its just a one-off or even two-off, the poster may deserve some leniency, but if they make a habit of it, their posts should be reported as \"AI spam.\".Clues to help identify an AI poster before putting their posts through the detection process include:Quote from: nutildah on May 27, 2023, 02:34:56 AM- using perfect English & punctuation when the poster's previous posts did not- writing long texts in rapid succession, when it was unlikely to be possible manually- their posts are frequently riddled with phrases mentioned here.This approach primarily reinforces reports concerning \"AI written\" or \"AI spam\" content. It also serves as a public means to highlight accounts engaging in such behavior, potentially discouraging others from doing so in the future.",

Firstly, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, known as blockchain, which means that it is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. This decentralization provides individuals with greater financial freedom and removes intermediaries from transactions, resulting in lower fees and faster settlement times. Additionally, Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be sent and received globally without the need for traditional banking systems. It enables cross-border transactions with ease, making it a viable option for remittances and international commerce. Moreover, Bitcoin's limited supply, capped at 21 million coins, gives it a deflationary nature, which some see as a hedge against inflation and store of value. These features have contributed to Bitcoin's popularity and position as a unique and innovative form of money.Hivemoderation: 99.9% likely to contain AIWriter: 28% humanPost #2:Quote from: cryptodude on June 06, 2023, 03:35:36 PMPredicting the future of the crypto market is an extremely challenging task. The crypto market is highly volatile and influenced by various factors, including global events, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and investor sentiment. While some analysts and experts may provide insights and opinions on potential market movements, it is important to remember that these predictions are speculative in nature and should be approached with caution. Making investment decisions based solely on predictions can be risky. It is advisable to conduct thorough research, stay informed about the latest news, and consider multiple perspectives before making any financial decisions in the crypto market.Hivemoderation: 99.8% likely to contain AIContentatscale: 28% humanPost #3:Quote from: cryptodude on June 05, 2023, 04:28:57 AMAltcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, have experienced a variety of outcomes over time. Some altcoins have thrived and established themselves as significant players in the cryptocurrency market, gaining popularity and widespread adoption. These altcoins have proven to have unique features, innovative technologies, or specific use cases that differentiate them from Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency. However, other altcoins have struggled to gain traction or maintain their value due to various factors such as lack of utility, poor development, or market volatility. The fate of altcoins largely depends on their ability to solve real-world problems, attract user interest, and adapt to changing market conditions. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, altcoins will continue to face challenges and opportunities, shaping their individual paths in the ever-changing landscape of digital currencies.Hivemoderation: 99.9% likely to contain AIContentatscale: 25% human",

It's crucial for investors and market participants to base their decisions on thorough analysis of economic indicators, government policies, and historical data, rather than being solely influenced by fear and speculation. By maintaining a balanced and informed perspective, one can make more accurate assessments of the market and avoid making decisions solely based on the fear of a U.S. default.Hivemoderation: 89.1% likely to contain AIWriter: 7% humanPost #2:Quote from: Sethrey on April 04, 2023, 10:49:47 AMHowever, it's important to note that the value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, especially during times of economic uncertainty. While some cryptocurrencies may see their value increase during times of war, others may see a decrease in value. Therefore, while cryptocurrencies can be a practical option for some people during times of war, it's important to carefully consider the risks and potential downsides before investing. It's always a good idea to diversify your portfolio and not rely solely on cryptocurrencies as a means of protecting your assets.Hivemoderation: 99.9% likely to contain AIContentatscale: 11% humanWriter: 4% humanPost #3:Quote from: Sethrey on April 11, 2023, 09:49:31 AMWhile high taxes could discourage some individuals from using crypto or investing in blockchain technology, it's important to note that taxes are a necessary component of any economy. It's also possible that governments will implement a flexible tax model that promotes healthy growth of the crypto industry.In any case, it's crucial for the crypto community to work with regulators and policymakers to develop clear tax guidelines that are fair and equitable for all parties involved.

However, all the other AI text analyzers suggest it is human-written, with the exception of GPTZero which says it has a \"moderate likelihood of being written by AI.\"Post #2: Here's another example where both commas and apostrophes ('s) were removed:Quote from: nlovric on June 13, 2023, 02:26:29 PMThough it is normal to worry about a team future it is crucial to keep in mind that Real Madrid is a team with a long history of success and the potential to draw elite players. There will surely be a vacuum left by Karim Benzema departure but that does not mean the squad will not be able to find replacements who are equally as capable. Real Madrid has an extensive network of scouts and an excellent eye for spotting potential players. Martinez and Osimhen are undoubtedly talented young players with promise but it is important to remember that there are other possibilities on the transfer market. Real Madrid will consider all of their choices before making a choice taking into account a player abilities flexibility and general fit with the team playing philosophy. Have faith in the club leadership and their capacity to decide what is best for the team going forward.By itself, hivemoderation.com says it is 99.1% likely to contain AI Generated Text.Post #3: They are also using ChatGPT to re-write quoted posts, which is maddeningly stupid:Quote from: nlovric on June 10, 2023, 11:26:32 AMQuote from: nara1892 on June 10, 2023, 08:04:17 AMNow Madrid also seems to want to strengthen their defense. Fran Garcia was sent home from Vallecano for just 5 million to match his current left-back performance. Even though in this case there are Alaba and Mendy, but with rumors that there are rumors that they will let Mendy go, it seems they want to be prepared at the start, besides that, the names Cancelo and Davies are also still associated with Madrid.As for the current Strikers, they still have to wait for what steps they will take. Many names have been rumored with Madrid this time but all are still at the same stage only around rumors and speculation that cannot be confirmed. Hopefully they are really serious about finding a replacement now.With the recent addition of Fran Garcia from Vallecano for a rumoured sum of only 5 million Madrid commitment on bolstering their defence is clear. Alaba and Mendy are already on the team as left-backs, but rumours of Mendy likely exit suggest the club wants to make sure they have enough backup from the beginning. The expectation surrounding their defensive additions has also been increased by the names Cancelo and Davies being mentioned in connection with a potential transfer to Madrid. Regarding the department that is on strike, Madrid appears to be exercising greater restraint and carefully weighing their choices. Although many names have been linked to the club in different rumours nothing tangible has been done so far. As the suspense grows supporters and onlookers can only hope that Madrid is sincerely committed to finding a good replacement. Madrid must approach their search with seriousness and attention because the transfer market is a place of uncertainty where rumours and speculation rule.Clearly AI didn't know that Strikers was in reference to a football position so it re-wrote the text as \"department that is on strike,\" lol.Post #4: Here's one more example where commas and apostrophes are removed, and he tacked on his own intro sentence at the beginning (hivemoderation.com says the rest of it is 99.9% likely to contain AI written text):Quote from: nlovric on June 13, 2023, 06:23:10 PMYes, Regarding the laws of Bitcoin trade in some countries you raise a crucial point. Before engaging in Bitcoin trading or other cryptocurrency related activities people must be informed of their local laws and prohibitions. Forex and Bitcoin both include money yet they serve different functions and have different properties. In the world of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin functions as a decentralised digital asset with the possibility for transactions and investment. As opposed to this the term Forex refers to the foreign exchange market where conventional fiat currencies are traded. Each offers advantages and downsides of its own such as Bitcoin higher volatility when compared to FX which can lead to higher risks. The decision between the two ultimately comes down to tastes and circumstances. It is also important to note that one can investigate and participate in both Bitcoin and FX as long as they are familiar with the legal and regulatory landscape of their respective jurisdictions.In the original version, GPTZero says its \"likely to be written by a human,\" but after adding in the proper punctuation it goes up to a \"moderate likelihood of being written by AI.\"",

More people are now watching games in the Arab league as a result of increased media coverage. No longer is Ronaldo team the only one vying for elite players other teams are also working to bolster their rosters. While there have been rumours that Neymar wants to return to Barcelona qit seems unlikely that he would be prepared to accept a pay cut that would make that happen. Given his injury history and contentious image in Europe it is possible that Neymar will investigate alternative choices including playing in Saudi Arabia. Undoubtedly, Ronaldo presence in the Arab league has resulted in a number of beneficial developments. Due to his influence the league has attracted more media coverage and fans. Now that other organisations are encouraged to sign top players, healthy competition is promoted. Arab leagues have a chance to entice great players while Neymar's prospective return to Barcelona is questionable. The desire to bolster their lineup is indicated by the rumours that Ronaldo side is interested in Carvalho and Brozovic. A bright and profitable future for Arab teams depends on them continuing to develop a competitive league to draw in and develop talent as Messi departure to the United States offers up new opportunities.Ronaldo participation in the Arab league leads to a number of advantageous developments. His influence has led to more media coverage and increased interest in the league among supporters. In turn this has prompted other groups to go for top players promoting healthy rivalry within the league. Given the uncertain chances of Neymar return to Barcelona Arab teams now have a rare opportunity to attract outstanding players. The rumours that Ronaldo team is interested in signing players like Carvalho and Brozovic add to the evidence that they want to improve their starting lineup. Arab teams set the way for a promising and lucrative future by continuing to build a competitive league that can draw and nurture talent especially when prospects open with Messi move to the United States.Quote from: nlovric on June 22, 2023, 12:19:16 AMQuote from: BitcoinAccepted on June 18, 2023, 09:23:22 PMHamilton has not yet won a single race, but he still speaks of a good season. This is mainly because the performance is now measured against that of last year, and last year was the year in which Mercedes had to close the difference again with RedBull, which did not work at all. But the question we can already ask: What will F1 look like next season? In this way it does not seem that there is only 1 driver who can get close to Verstappen, does it? at least, it seems that way at the moment. And Perez is a nice wingman for Verstappen, I think.Lewis hamilton has not yet achieved victory in a race this year but his confidence comes from the comparison of his present performance to that of the previous year. Mercedes had to work hard to close the gap with Red bull in 2022 which proved to be a challenging feat. But making predictions about the future of Formula 1 can be fascinating. It is unlikely that only one driver will pose a danger to Max verstappen in the upcoming season which bodes both uncertainty and excitement. Due to the dynamic nature of the sport teams can significantly improve over the off season and new contenders can appear. While Sergio perez has been a great colleague for Verstappen changes in driver lineups and team plans could result in the introduction of new dynamics. Consequently the upcoming season could bring surprises and a more competitive field.",

It's also critical to keep up with the newest cryptocurrency news and developments, since they may have a considerable influence on Bitcoin's price swings. Before investing in Bitcoin trading or any other type of speculative investment, it is suggested that you conduct extensive research, exercise risk management strategies, and consider getting guidance from experienced traders or financial experts.hivemoderation: 96.1% likely to contain AI Generated Textcopyleaks: 75.6% probability for AIPost #2:Quote from: wajik-tempe on June 09, 2023, 03:36:56 PMIt is important to note, however, that historical pricing trends do not guarantee future outcomes. While it is possible that Bitcoin may face another bear market in the future, it is hard to predict when or at what price level Bitcoin would reach during such a market decline. Individuals may be able to make better educated judgments about purchasing and keeping Bitcoin if they regard it as a long-term investment and focus on its foundations and potential rather than short-term price swings.hivemoderation: 93.7% likely to contain AI Generated Textcopyleaks: 74.6% probability for AIPost #3:Quote from: wajik-tempe on June 08, 2023, 04:39:59 AMIt is critical to remember that inflation is a complicated economic phenomena that is impacted by a variety of factors. Blaming politicians and central bankers for inflation may oversimplify the situation. Some Bitcoin supporters feel that the cryptocurrency's limited supply, decentralization, and potential as a store of value might provide an alternative to existing fiat currencies while potentially addressing inflation problems. However, Bitcoin is not a cure for all economic problems. It has its own set of difficulties and restrictions. The price volatility of Bitcoin has been a major source of concern, with massive price fluctuations occurring over very short periods of time. hivemoderation: 99.9% likely to contain AI Generated Textcopyleaks: 75.2% probability for AII think this user is already temp banned.
