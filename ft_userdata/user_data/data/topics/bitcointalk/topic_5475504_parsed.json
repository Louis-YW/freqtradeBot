Shebi na oyibo talk say \"a stitch in time save nine\", this one suppose teach person sense na. Just like I said in one comment like that, people dey prefer to learn the hard way wey be to learn from experience. Mean I din advise myself tey tey say na wetin happen to others I go take learn, I no fit shout abeg. The major problem wey some people dey get be say the high transaction fees dey make them fear to use external wallet especially those wey dey trade. If na before wey e never red, to move coin be no dey worry those wey their money no many. But as e be so, e be like say the fee self don pass wetin person wan move and na there wahala dey. So to avoid story that touch, people dey prefer to dey with the exchange dey do all their deals inside there.",

Make we no forget say the issue for FTX still dey fresh, so nobody wan be victim of that kind thing especially now wey money no dey like this.You no go blame them as them dey request to withdraw their money na because as them comot Czech from office like this, people see am say them no dey confortable make there money still dey CEX, because of wetting happen to FTX, mtGox and probably Luna. Czech is the reason behind why many people dey comfortable with binance and dey think anything fishy can happen anymoment from now. This case just be like the case of Elon musk wey buy Twitter with $44b come change the name to space x. due to people's love for the original owner of Twitter, people start to comot body for Twitter sotay space x according to Elon musk don reduce in value to $19b. So wetting I dey try talk be say some people dey behind the reason a project name dey stand firm. To build trust dey take time and if care is not taken this fit be the fall of binance but I no pray so. Sometimes people sopos they reason things before them dey do am. To check if that thing na wetting go dey favourable or not.",

Although e fit just be because of internal and external factors, anyhow na real cause for concern for people wey de run crypto things. Di latest one now wey be binance, wey don build solid reputation, wey people don trust say dem de reliable, come begin get shakeup because CZ, don comot as di CEO. If the new CEO no do something fast to restore di trust of dem customers, di exchange go go down like FTX and odas. As e be now na to only leave small money for transaction purpose inside exchanges, if you no get any transaction for exchange, better to leave all your coins for inside your none custodial wallet.
