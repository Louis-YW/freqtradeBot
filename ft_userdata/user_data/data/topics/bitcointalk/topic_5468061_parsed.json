I mean when a swap may be BNB to get usdt, what happens to the BNB?The simplest but most confusing question, we all newbies have faced, the simplest answer is don't look at the one side of the picture, this means if someone is swapping BNB for USDT then look at the other side of the picture which is there is another person who wishes to swap his USDT for the BNB. But now you will think what if there is no other person at the time of swapping of BNB looking for USDT? Then your BNB will be swapped from the pool of the platform, pools are made for seamless trading without any stop. I hope you understand. If not then don't hesitate to ask again. Quote from: Okwara on September 25, 2023, 02:32:14 PMAnother confusion I have is about BTC. BTC has a total supply of 19,495,156 million. Now the entire 19,495,156 are in circulation which means they are being held by holders/users. But another user can always swap another coin to BTC at anytime and receive the BTC, so where is the BTC coming from since it already in circulation (held by other holders)?BTCs don't have a supply of 19,495,156 million in total, because the total supply is round off to 21 million. The supply you have mentioned is the one which is mined till now and is already in circulation. And the answer to your query is almost the same as the first one. As if one is selling the BTC then there is another person at the other end buying it too or vice versa. And if there is no other entity then the funds will be provided from the pools of the exchange or swap you are using to swap sell or buy the BTC. Let's say you wanted to sell the BTC and wanted to buy USDT in exchange and you have selected the BTC/USDT pair and once you hit the sell button you will quickly get usdt when your selling price will hit. And the USDT will be given to you from the pools of USDT money. And that gap will be covered later once a person looking to sell USDT in exchange of BTC.",

I mean when a swap may be BNB to get usdt, what happens to the BNB?Swapping one cryptocurrency to another one is for decentralized exchanges with smart contracts.It is not directly from a buyer to a seller but from a buyer or seller to a liquidity pool. A bigger a liquidity pool is, a less slippage for a swap with same trading volume in most of cases but it is not always true. Slippage is also set up by developer team of that token that can be low or high, it depends on developers.Because it is related to liquidity pool, if a developer team rug the pull, liquidity pool will become zero, consequently that token will become zero value.What are liquidity pools ?What is a rug pull?",

I mean when a swap may be BNB to get usdt, what happens to the BNB?When you swap/convert from one coin to another in an exchange, the exchange basically takes your coin and adds it to their reserve or pool and they also send you the coin you've swapped to from their reserves as well.Quote from: Okwara on September 25, 2023, 02:32:14 PMBut another user can always swap another coin to BTC at anytime and receive the BTC, so where is the BTC coming from since it already in circulation (held by other holders)?It is simply supply and demand. Exchanges for example hodl quite a lot of Bitcoins that are in circulation, so you can always buy Bitcoins from them, or convert from Bitcoin to other coins. There's also p2p trading, were individuals are ready to sell their Bitcoins to you for fiat, or they could as well want to swap their Bitcoins for the coins that you are offering.",

I mean when a swap may be BNB to get usdt, what happens to the BNB?The person (in case of p2p) or exchange youâ€™re swapping with takes your coin and give you the one which you require to swap to. In this process, no new coins are created or consumed. It's similar to trade by barter. We compare costs and then exchange them since I have what you want and you have what I want. They may be a time when a coin you wish to swap with is not available in an exchange, but since they have listed it, they will never run out of it when their users require it. QuoteBut another user can always swap another coin to BTC at anytime and receive the BTC, so where is the BTC coming from since it already in circulation (held by other holders)?The platform that you're using to do this trade is doing it for profit, so keep in mind that they'll definitely have a lot of it in stock for their customers to always buy from and swap with their currencies. They can always top up when there is a high demand for one that can lead to its exhaustion, allowing them to continue providing their services.",

Every exchange has its own liquidity pools or proof of reserves which shows that they can process big trades easily. For example, if the pool has a limit of 10 BTC then trade with bigger than 10 BTC has to wait. Until the pool size increases or until there come buyers for the deal worth 10 BTC.

With Wrapped Bitcoin tokens, you will need liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges for swapping like other tokens. The red flag is those tokens are not real Bitcoin, they are only tokens on different chains like ERC20, BEP20 and other altcoin blockchains.Those Wrapped tokens can depeg and lose value like stable coins including algorithmic stablecoin like Terra UST fiasco.",

Centralized exchange like Binance? Decentralized Exchange (PancakeSwap, etc.)? or centralized swap platform (Changelly)?The way of how it works is simply like a currency exchange, suppose X, a currency exchange company between EUR and USD. When you handover your money in EUR, in exchange for USD, X give you the money from their own reserves. So they did not magically hand or create the money out of thin air.With that in mind, it also applies to many cryptocurrency swap processes.Quote from: dlightag on September 29, 2023, 09:48:06 AMDon't be confused, everything that happens in the cryptocurrency market is transparent and in time's of swap BTC to USDT is a function of liquidity provided in the exchange platform and is very already program in the crypto exchange platform or Dex platform.Any interaction with a centralized entity is not transparent.",

When you send payment, you can check that address holding all that coin which they offering for swap.Btc answer is also same, Big amount of btc holding by these exchanges. circulation supply also composed of exchange holding. when we swap, we receive btc from these exchanges and at the same times other user sell btc and whole system works in this way.",
