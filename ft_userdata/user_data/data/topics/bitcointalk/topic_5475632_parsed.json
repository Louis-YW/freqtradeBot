While cryptos and other blockchain-related financing garnered the reputation of being volatile and speculative, there is a broad consensus regarding the value of blockchain technology and other forms of distributed ledger technology in finance.What is a Security Token Offering?To better understand STOs and why we need them, we must first understand why ICOs were viewed as a blemish on the blockchain industry's overall image.From 2016 - 2018, ICOs were in demand, — and investors didn't mind pouring their money into this new form of fundraising. In Q1 2018, over $6.3 billion worth of capital was locked into ICOs. The expectation was that these investments would appreciate over time. However, the bubble burst in Q4 of 2018, when the \"market cap\" of all cryptos fell by over $750 billion. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was still shy in implementing regulation around token offerings.Soon after, regulatory bodies began making announcements around the topic of compliance. The most notable from SEC Chief Jayy Clayton: He declared all ICOs securities; Swiss FINMA also issued guidelines that classified tokens, as per the existing legislation, as securities. These and other pronouncements on ICOs led many blockchain founders to protest; they claimed their projects offered utility tokens and were not securities. The regulatory shadow hanging over ICOs pushed entrepreneurs and investors away from the market.Regulators today want token offerings to remain compliant with the existing laws and rules around securities — hence, the Security Token Offering was born. STO is very similar to ICO but is compliant with securities legislation in the location where the token is being offered for investment. As STOs are compliant with related laws and rules, they create additional legal obligations for issuing equities in the company.*The first firm to offer an STO was a US-based Praetorian Group, which registered the platform on 6th March 2018 with the SEC. The platform lists as a crypto real-estate investment platform.JOIN STO NOWhttps://app.u2sto.xyz/referral/580162",
