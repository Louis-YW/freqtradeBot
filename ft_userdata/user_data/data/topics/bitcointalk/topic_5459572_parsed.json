Because it seems you are yet to understand how this forum works, because if you do need a forum poster, then all you will to do is contact any of the campaign managers I will be mentioning, such as Royse777, Hhampus or Cryptopreneurbrainboss to help you manage whatever project you may like to promote on this forum, as long as it's not a scam. So thank you, and I'm wishing you good luck.",

Thanks for the eye opener.I remember commenting on a similar offer, I checked his posts history and found out that it was him also, we don't know his motives but we should doubt if a newbie is posting incomplete details and wants a one on one communication, or if they only want to collect sensitive information, so many of his posts are questionable but we cannot tag him unless someone files a complaint but this account is suspicious I encourage everyone before you take anyone's offer check their trust rating and posts history, from there you will get an idea on their intentions.",

It ain't really certain as to what the job scope is as posting has to be defined. so, until 'the cards come on the table', I think I'll just pass",
