Coinjoin is a protocol for mixing your coins. Trezor have decided to implement a version of coinjoin which censors its users.Quote from: Cz-Silk on April 22, 2023, 11:41:52 PMI wanted to know the impact of this on us who use bitcoinNone at all provided you stay well away from it. If you use it, then you better be happy having blockchain analysis spy on you and censor you.Quote from: Cz-Silk on April 22, 2023, 11:41:52 PMin my thinking it would be something contrary to what bitcoin is.Correct. It is completely contrary to the whole ethos of bitcoin.",

As o_e_l_e_o pointed out this company is against thee ethos of bitcoin",

Is it possible to implement it? ? ?What. Coincoin isn't a new consensus mechanism and is definitely not proof of stake. I'm oversimplifying it, but it's basically just a mixing scheme for people to potentially gain various levels of privacy through obfuscation.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin",

Where did you get it from?Proof of stake is something completely different from coinjoin. And Bitcoin has never used PoS, and it's less likely that it will use that protocolQuote from: monedauno on May 04, 2023, 02:27:25 PMI'm a bit confused about the concept of coinjoin. Is it possible to implement itI suggest you do more reading about coinjoin, proof of work and then proof of stake. Start with the link that has been provided to you in the comment above mine.",

Coinjoin has never been made to work that way it isn't a protocol for PoS (Proof of Stake) thing, but is a tool that works similar to mixers because its main feature is to make the transactions anonymous so no one can track the origin or final destination of a transaction.Its works in way where it combines multiple transactions using a method that turns them into a single transaction. That makes it difficult for others to track the origin and final destination of the transactions which are done through the tool. Its main goal is to enhance privacy and provide anonymity to transactions and nothing else.",
