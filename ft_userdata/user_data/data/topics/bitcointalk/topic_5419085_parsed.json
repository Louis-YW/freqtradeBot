  "content": "hello guys,I have no clue from where  the leak comes from but today I got a call from Alba county from a guy asking me if I am aware about stocks and stocks trading. Conversation was in English, I could hear some oriental music in background. After about 5mins call explaining the guy that I am interested for now in crypto trading only and the only thing I need to know from him was the source from where he got my number, he said that he has connections with financial advisors and cannot tell the source, he has some sort of platform and he'll call me in a week.I am wondering if you had some experience like this so far, the guy called me yesterday too but I was busy and I told him I'll call him back but there was nobody answering.cheers",

That's also a possible reason why the number was not available for calling them back.I was approached many years ago by a \"financial\" company trying to help. Since I didn't refuse them from start, at some point they started spamming me almost daily with phone calls from various \"numbers\" until I learned how to block them, one by one.I would be wary with platforms advertised on the phone, I would check everything on bitcointalk first.",
