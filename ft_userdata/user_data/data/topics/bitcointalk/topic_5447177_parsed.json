For that reason the account was simply locked for the last years and nobody had access to it. Now that I had the time and will to get the account back.This member was active until December 30, 2016 and then didn't post until 4/5/2022 so he must have seen my April fool before since this event started in 2015.In 2016: @hZtiÂ  does not have posts in April.In 2015: @hZtiÂ  contains no posts in the month of April.In 2022: @hZtiÂ  first post was on 4/5, or 3 days after the April fool.So, despite all these years, it is his first time.",
