It represents asset ownership or utility.Token is a word linked more and used generally to refer to some kind of digital asset that needs to exist on an existing blockchain. Bitcoins are not tokens because it has its own blockchain, so token should not be among the listed words related to bitcoins.",

But the point 47, 48, are not used that much, even I was not aware of them before and I came to know them here by your post. I think they are some technical terms used in the architecture of BTC blockchain. If yes, then I hope there must be other lot of terms used in that section that could be wrote here. Besides it, Your post was very informative and despite the fact that there are numerous threads already been made on this thing but all the time I came to know about new terms. But unfortunately, I can not remember all these words. But sometimes, few words came to my mind during a discussion then I don't hesitate to name them. Another confession I wanted to make here, That I have used these terms and other terms which I have learnt from topics like these, to show myself as the most knowledgeable person of BTC among my friends. But sometimes, I got caught but I don't mind that because in friends we used to do that. But this fun must not be go beyond limits that it could hurt someone's reputation or money.",

A great advice from a good adviser. I really like the way you treat newbies and I hope you will do that forever. Op do make a good effort if he really did and searched all these by himself like not ok help from some AI content writer. Because that will not be tolerated. Some terms are new to me and I really like to learn new terms you op have done a good thing by adding a little explanation with these words. Because recently, there was a newbie in the trading discussion, you did not insert a description with the words or terms he wrote there then after some time I think on-demand he inserted some of the explanation with the terms.

Yeah, you are right, but I think there is no way to declare that either OP has copied the data from somewhere or not, because what if he has learned it from the time of him since he is in crypto? Or who knows if he just read some articles comprised of these types of terms and took ideas from there and also wrote from there. But in his own words. Then he should have inserted the source link.",

It is a period when the amount of Bitcoin available in circulation is halved ¬†therefore causing scarcity which leads to increase in price.The amount available in circulation is not halved. Instead, the production is halved. The amount of bitcoins in circulation increases every block until it reaches approximately 21 million.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM10. Exchange - This is a platform where Bitcoin transactions can be carried out.consider it as a market place for crypto currencies.An exchange is a place to buy and sell bitcoins. Trades on an exchange are not recorded in the block chain. Bitcoin transactions occur over the Bitcoin network and are recorded in the block chain.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM16. Wallet Address - this is a ¬†unique alphanumeric code used to send and receive Bitcoin. Consider it as an account number or routing number just like you have with your bank account.A wallet typically has a nearly unlimited supply of addresses, so the term \"wallet address\" is a misnomer. Furthermore, it is a mistake to consider an address as like a bank account number or a routing number because it is typically only used once. It is more like an invoice number.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM19. Hash -This is a fixed alphanumeric string which is generated from transactions carried out on the Bitcoin network. It is stored as data for a transaction.A hash is the result of a specific mathematical process applied to data. It has many uses in Bitcoin and in cryptography in general.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM20. Confirmation - This is a process carried out by miners in verifying a Bitcoin transaction . Confirmation is done through multiple blocks on the blockchain.A transaction is confirmed when it is included in a block. Multiple confirmations occur when additional blocks are added to the block chain because each block confirms the blocks that precede it.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM26. Pump and Dump - This is usually a profit scheme to inflate the price of a cryptocurrency and then sell off quickly.it is most common with altcoins.More precisely, in a pump-and-dump, the scammer buys a worthless asset and then promotes the asset by making fraudulent claims (the \"pump\"). Then, the scammer sells the asset as the price rises (the \"dump\"). The victims of the fraud are left holding the asset as it returns to being worthless again.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM31. Fungibility - This is the term used to describe interchangeability of Bitcoin.this holds due to the fact that all Bitcoins are of equal value.More importantly, fungibility is a property that describes how one bitcoin is indistinguishable from any other.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 15, 2023, 02:38:13 PM40.

I think they are some technical terms used in the architecture of BTC blockchain.The number 47 and 48 you aren‚Äôt aware of is certainly not new to bitcoin and I know you might have seen it somewhere but you just can‚Äôt recall. They are bitcoin address formats which were first used before the new formats we have now and are still been used now The number 47 which is the P2PKH is popular known as legacy address of the bitcoin, it was the first address type and it is started with 1. Base58 is used to encode them and are created by hashing a single public key. number 48 is the P2SH which is also another version of bitcoin address format they are soft fork from the legacy address format but it‚Äôs hashing is a redeem script and not just single public key like the former. It starts its address format with 3 as prefix. The new address formats which are used mostly now is the P2WPKH which is mostly known as the native segwit address (Bech32), from its name it uses the Bech32 encoding. It starts it address with bc1q and are longer than the other two formats explained above. They came as result of a soft fork on the bitcoin blockchain to help create space on the block for more transactions by separating the witness data from it and as such also reduces the transaction fee to pay for transaction compared to the other above formats. The other one is the Pay -2- taproot addresses which is the newest type of bitcoin address formats it also uses Bech32 encoding but the transaction witness stores the signature not the script sig like in P2WPKH. It starts with a prefix of bc1p and provides more privacy than the later. It is still very new and not all wallets supports itThey are still wallets that support even the older bitcoins but the most widely use is the segwit address (bc1q)",

The bolder is the right word to use for Bitcoin in Bitcoin lightning network, as in lightning network but reading through some post, it's annoying when people use the first one from the image which is wrong.I don‚Äôt get the reason why you would get annoyed for such a thing as spelling mistake. This is a large forum that comprises of people from different languages and as such the non English speakers would definitely make mistakes like this. The two words might be different but clear when it used in this forum or related to bitcoin then you certainly should know what the writer means. So if it see any big thing about this",

      "body": "OP, I have seen a lot of topics based on the terminologies from the aspects of Bitcoin, Altcoin, General, and Crypto, and in Trading stock-based trading terminologies, most of them covered the terminologies Only but I had encountered only a few topics covering s descriptive content of that particular terminology to explain its position in a few words. But in beginners & help, there are already many topics just based on the terminologies still you've created a topic for that put effort into it, appreciated. But for the rest, I think you should level up now learn something unique, and bring it here with your unique view to attract others' attention. Rest is OK. Enjoy for now. Read the feedback and adjust your content accordingly to improve the presentation your thoughts and ideas, a couple of other terminologies are mentioned by senior members and some raw facts are also there so don't forget to learn and ask if you want about them.",
