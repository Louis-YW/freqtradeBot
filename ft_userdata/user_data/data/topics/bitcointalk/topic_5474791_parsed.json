Luckily, I won the 2nd prize so hopefully with the 300 free spins prize my bankroll will return. Thanks to Manager Hhampuz and FortuneJack for hosting this nice contest.",

I hope to see you in the next one I congratulate the winners! I’m new to playing slots and didn’t quite understand the meaning of the competition, I thought it was like a lottery, but only then I realized that it was a multiplier competition.Quote231x hit - BitinityWow, that's a pretty serious multiplier! I hope that at that moment you bet at least 1 dollar per spin.Thank you to Hhampuz and Fortune Jack for this competition, we will wait for new ones, and I do not advise the winners to relax next time",

I hope that at that moment you bet at least 1 dollar per spin.  Of course it was not a $1 bet, how could I do such a bet while my fund for the this contest was $50 only. I did not expect that I'd win the 1st place because I thought that 231x is just small number in multiplier contest. I'm not pretty sure why there are 4 participants only, slot multiplier contest in this forum is used to be the best non-free contest with the most participants but this less number of participant is obviously a benefit because we have bigger chance to win",

I hope to see you in the next one With just 25x I surely wasn't expecting to win anything. Well, my expectations were on the low side, let's put it like this.  A pleasant surprise.Thank you, Hhampuz and FortuneJack!",
