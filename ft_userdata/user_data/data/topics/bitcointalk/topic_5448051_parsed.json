      "body": "The continent of Africa has many natural resources, ranging from crude oil to natural stones, but there are no leaders who can demand processing of the majority of the natural resources. Despite the fact that we have fewer natural disasters than the rest of the world, the continent is poor and suffers more of what is naturally available to them. It is my belief that if leaders make intelligent and right demands from developed countries, they gradually begin to develop instructions for the processing of their resources.",

      "body": "Africa's suffering does not stem from the abundance or lack of natural resources, as some argue. Rather, the problem lies in the selfish and greedy leadership of African nations. In the past, these leaders traded human lives for profit, even using mirrors and salt to exchange their own people. Now that valuable resources have been discovered, developed nations covet them for their monetary value. African leaders use forceful measures like guns, security personnel, and militias to maintain control, even under the guise of democracy, and take all profits from these resources for themselves.",

The scrambling and partitioning of Africa by the European powers show how important Africa is to the entire world. But it is unfortunate that since after independence from colonial masters Africa has never been a pride of its occupants. Many Africans are fleeing away from a land that houses some of the world's precious human and natural resources. The majority of illegal migrants that have died because of the risky journey through the sea, desert, or road are Africans. African nations are currently ruled by greedy despots that want to become life presidents and transfer power to their children even when it is clear that they will lead the nation to its doomsday.",

Can you tell me why they choose to go for independence when they are not ready? At least a kid that went to school has to graduate before proceeding to the next level. Let's agree they are not ready but they still choose to do some corrections by learning more about the modern politics from people that colonized them if they want something good for their people not just to steal country money.",

The white men has gone, we're in leadership positions yet we're unable to develop Africa. It's a pity. Shame to Africa leaders who has impoverished us. Resource control is a good political sharing formula for equal rights and harmony. Every party of the county should be able to manage and enjoy what they produce or the natural resources on their land. Then remit some to the centre Government. But Africa the concert is being manipulated. Infact the side of the country that contributed much to the development of the country suffer more, Their resources are being exploited with little token to them. And this has resulted to crisis in Africa. Our leaders keep blaming the colonial masters to cheat us. One day we shall rise. Africa shall be great again.",

Unlike the Middle East, they seem don't to have a just leader who can distribute this wealth to their people rather those appointed leaders are always corrupt and used the earnings of these resources for their own gains only. That's why they cannot get away from poverty and they always portrayed as the poorest people in the entire world but they can change this and will not gonna be like this forever because the chance is right there and they only need is to choose a right leader that will gonna change this for them and most important is, they need to choose a leader that doesn't really care about money.",

I agree with some of the this you stated above but not all of them. Your statement that Africa will always remain underdeveloped is not true. If the impediments that are limiting Africa are removed, the continent will become the envy of many nations. The resources both human and natural are available in the continent that will make it develop. And we can see that the youths of Africa are rising to seek accountability from their leaders. The End SARS protest shocked Nigerian socially and the Labour Party invasion is changing the political and legal sectors of the country.Quotethe major problem in Africa resource control and managementThe main problem with Africa's underdeveloped resources and abuse is majorly a technical problem,  because African countries still depend on European and other Western nations to handle the technicalities that come with the exploration and refining of those resources, this lack of technicality have affected the rate of development in our industries which are dead and now dependant on 100% external forces to get their raw material into finish good. Africa's major problem is corruption. If African nations, fortunately, start having good leaders, the continent's problems are half solved. Another major challenge is Africans. The average common man in Africa can not be trusted. Corrupt government officials come from the society, it's an indication that something is wrong with Nigerian society. Greed and materialism have taken over the African continent. If you uphold truth and unity, you will be hated in Africa because the society is faulty. I will never blame the West or external force for African underdevelopment, Africans are the problem of Africa.",

It appears to be a test for the African continent, and they continue to fail. Their over-dependence on Western nations has made it difficult for them to recognize the strength they have inside themselves to build a strong nation from those riches. Most Africans who travel to western countries for a better pasture have good influences in their places of assignment and contribute more effectively to the country's growth than native nationals. Africans have the resources and the manpower, but they lack the resources to put them to use, which is largely due to the corruption of the leaders.",
