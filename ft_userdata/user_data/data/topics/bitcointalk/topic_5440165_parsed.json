You have mentioned LUNA as a good story about how crypto with big marketcap can go down only in 5 days until it's dead. FTX was another case that is pretty similar to the LUNA. I consider how many users actively used avax. Since there are many first and second layers blockchain being made and the transaction in avax native and c-chain has become less and less. You can even check it by yourself https://snowtrace.io/chartsI suggest you move to the speculation thread if you wanna also discussing the price of avax. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5334304.0",

But from what I see there is always some good news about AVAX every month or so, so it feels like it's moving somewhere. Company to ADA that almost looks dead without any new updates. So I think it's a pretty good sign.Quote from: zasad@ on February 17, 2023, 09:22:19 PMhttps://defillama.com/chain/AvalancheLook at the statistics of popular ecosystems such as Ethereum that are used and compare it with the Avalanche ecosystem that grows only on market pumps.

I think AVAX is also appealing to me because its market cap is pretty low compared to other big alts so it has growth potential.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

So I want to hear your opinion crypto bros, what do you think about investing in AVAX?They have a different approach comparing avax and luna. Plus the devs of avalanche are pretty serious on building ad they have continuously working on development of their platform. Most projects are there to display how succesful they are but seeing the works and codes done, we will see whose doing more for a project. Ive been an avalanche holder since then and I will continue to hold my shares (stake/delegate) for the betterment of this project.",

Now AVAX is almost at the bottom, so you can buy coins at a good discount and count on a good profit by the next bullrun.",

For examplehttps://dropstab.com/coins/avalanche-2/fundraisingthey sold their coins and I don’t know how the regulator will look at it and what fine will be imposed from the SEC. Of course, this project has a great chance to solve all problems with regulators, but you need to understand the risks.",
