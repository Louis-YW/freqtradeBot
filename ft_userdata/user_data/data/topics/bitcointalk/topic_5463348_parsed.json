  "content": "What is a DashboardUsing the dashboard, you can check your wallet through analytical service (Dune, Arkham, etc.), by entering your address and understand in what % of the top wallets you located by or different criteria in this network.Subjectivity of dashboards You need to understand that dashboards were created by people and the criteria for their evaluation, such as the rank of the wallet in general statistics, this is their subjective view and you cannot fully rely on it. Another thing is criteria such as the number of transactions or the volume of your wallet in a particular network, it often shows what % of other wallets you are ahead of, so you yourself can decide what % you beat.Reflected the most popular projects for retrodrops. Each of these dashboards shows either general activity on the network or specific to your wallet. If any of the dashboards does not load, then your hardware may not have enough power to process the request. (try to wait a bit for the loading).P.S. I am not a large multi-water player, I have 5 accounts, thus I have minimal impact on the rewards of other users if the retrodrop takes place. Moreover, I’ll say that I don’t even have time to do everything for these 5 accounts, because. I don't use any software. I think this amount is more or less normal for one person. At the same time, I despise those who make big farms of more than 20, 50, 100 and rake rewards while others dig with a sapper shovel.Dashboards:Code:1.
