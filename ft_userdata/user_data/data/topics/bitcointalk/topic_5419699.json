      "body": "Without investing anything in it? No. You'll either need a start capital or you'll need time, and skills. You aren't going to get anything that's worth anything in this world for free. At least, not a currency, maybe some old furniture. If you want to mine, you need money to invest. If you want to have a job, you'll need to invest your time, and whatever skills might be necessary. If you want to earn Bitcoin passively, then you either mine or you create something which can earn you it passively. None of that comes free. Most users invest a small amount of money, and benefit from it if Bitcoin goes up. However, a lot of users here have invested their time in building up a reputation, and either building a service or advertising. Other than that, the options are limited, but they all require time or money.",

If you cannot earn free paper money without doing anything, you can't earn free BTC without doing anything too. Even with crypto faucets you have to complete some tasks before you are given a little amount of crypto, so it is not entirely free even for the small reward.BTC is a currency, it is money, and if you agree that there is no free money anywhere, there's also no free BTC.",

After all, you also need an internet connection to get bitcoin, it also need money. Even if you get free wifi, then you also need to drink and eat to stay alive so you can earn bitcoin. One thing, bitcoin is money [like fiat], so nothing is really free if you don't invest something.",

There are different ways one can earn BTC. The labourer must have his wage at the end the month. That is one way of earning. Then donations or dash. Someone or a friend can dash/give you BTC just like the normal way they gives the Fiat currency. These are some the ways you can earn Bitcoin but the second option nis not regular probably it might be once and also there are other ways to have BTC.",

Just eliminate the \"investing\" part since you mentioned \"without investing\".If this was an old times then faucets could have been the way for you, but now they are just a waste of time. Not sure if it was still worth it these days with referrals, but I would assume that you are trying to earn one by your own and without of anyone's help.",
