Nearly all the crypto gambling sites of today are centralized. Although some are claiming to be web3 which you can connect your noncustodial wallet to, which are not centralized. But as for centralized gambling sites, we should not think of them as no KYC gambling sites, there are still few that require no KYC though for low amount withdrawal.",

      "body": "While KYC is a massive killer to anonymity in Crypto, it's a much-needed one in my opinion. People have been very lenient and belligerent with how they can get away with stealing and robbing people of their tokens in the past since everything is virtually anonymous and untraceable, at the very least with KYC you now have a lead to where your stolen stuff might lead to. Although i'm a little disappointed at how underutilized this feature is and in most cases casinos only ever use this to verify that you're a real person, sometimes even taking it a step too far and using your info to sell to ad agencies for profit. KYC isn't a bad thing, it's the way that these casinos implemented and imposed it that's putting it in a bad light. Hopefully with the introduction of this anonymous feature we see a new mechanism where KYC can be utilized in its full efficacy.",

Now they mandated every services, like crypto exchanges and gambling platform to have KYC so that they can track everything because they know that crypto can be taken advantage of anyone to hide their identifies and could be used by criminals (which is not always the case, but this the one valid reasons that they always used).",

I think the only decentralized component of gambling platforms today are only the cryptocurrency tokens/coins (BTC/ETH) itself and not the platform. Since most of them have acquired gambling licenses, they are obliged to operate within the fine lines of regulation. This wasn't an issue in the past but regulatory pressure has almost 10x in the last 5-10 years since Crypto became a household name in the finance and industry.Till we have full-fledged gambling platforms running new zero knowledge proof blockchain that comes with added privacy (the platform has to be on chain), anonymity in gambling with crypto is a thing of the pass.If we have a fully decentralized gambling platform that supports privacy and anonymity, how do they get licensed without a centralized gambling license outfit?",

I don't think they should. Licencing means that it is regulated and monitored so requirements have to be set to meet up to the rules and such requirement is request for customer's identify. Unfortunately, gamblers are providing those information and more cex casinos are joining the business. The whole story is that government is putting an eyes on the unmasking of those playing in casinos.",

I think the only reason for this is that, they tend to prevent laundering and in order to do that, they should know their players and that is mandated by the regulations.",

While there are probably still some casinos that initially allow users to gamble without KYC, it is important to recognize that the situation can change quickly if they encounter issues with users' accounts or transactions, or if they face legal pressure to comply with regulations.The licensing and regulation of casinos by governments are becoming more prevalent, and this trend is likely to continue as authorities seek to address potential risks and protect consumers. As a result, the level of anonymity once associated with crypto gambling is diminishing over time just because of legalities many casinos have been successful and faster adoption.",

If the gambling sites are so highly centralized, then it has really created a lot of trouble for crypto users in terms of gambling.

This is why if ever i do make out some KYC then i do always make use of dummy emails because sooner or later i would really be seeing those spam emails that would flooded out my email inbox which its never been new that these information would really be leaked out. I dont have any experience on gamdom but i have able to see its signature campaign on this forum wayback and if they are really that asking no KYC with this then i might reconsider on playing on it.Progress and regulation is something that cant really be stopped and just like with those other comments that as long this one involves huge money then expect that government would really be liking to get involved with.",
