If an idea, a business is 100% ensured for success, no one would share the certain success with the world, if they lack investment, they would seek private sponsors in order to maximize their own profits.So in other words, STO is a platform for quick money grab, as soon as the exchanges open the trade, people would dump for profit while others are buying in hopes of more profit in the future, and what happens if the business owner, company owner decides what he has is enough and turns away from moving forward seriously? Success of a business depends on those conducting it, if they don't really feel the need for succeeding, they won't try to succeed.I wonder, how can I launch my own STO? I have so many ideas. ðŸ˜‰",
