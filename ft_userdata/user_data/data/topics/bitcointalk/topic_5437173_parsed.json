At such times, such tools may come handy. You can always create third wallet then and send there manually without having to rely on such tools.",

It is not exclusive to this tool. Considering the recent attacks don't even need to access the user seeds to transfer tokens, I doubt they will use this just to transfer some tokens. They can easily transfer those as long as the hacked address has enough ETH since they don't need to save fees. Some hackers probably use a bot to do stuff like this. At the end of the day, anything can happen, being cautious is never bad.",

Honestly, I had trouble before transferring my tokens to a new wallet because this requires transferring them one after the other. This tool enables you to transfer all tokens at once.Even in the event of a wallet hack, at least you will be able to survive a large section portion of the tokens before it is stolen, because the hacker will transfer them one by one and pay the Ethereum fee each time. This gives you some extra time before he can transfer everyone, but if the hacker knows the existence of this tool, the exact opposite will happen and the hacker will transfer all the tokens at once.Also wondering if this tool works on the Binance BSC network?",

Thank you, I have a lot of tokens in my Binance wallet so it will be useful for me.But I checked the site and I didn't find Binance Network there in the list:            However, I connected my MetaMask wallet, Binance network was recognized, but it didn't find the tokens automatically, so I have to add them manually.This is a bit annoying so it's a good idea to update the site and add Binance Network to the list and get the tokens recognized automatically.",

Even though they can interact with BSC and other ETH forks, some of their code explicitly use ETH exchange/dex to fetch the name of the token. You can probably modify it and run it locally by modifying this part[1], though I'm not sure if there are other codes that need to be modified to make sure it will automatically fetch your BSC tokens.

This is the same logic with which Bitcoin is fought. Bitcoin is a harmful tool because it is used for suspicious activities. I don't know why the same logic is not applied to fiat money, as surely scammers and hackers use it as well.Personally, I do not prefer to access my Ethereum addresses with any tool, even completely trusted ones. Instead, I prefer to protect my addresses by storing them in a safe place so that I do not need any tool.",
