  "content": "the bitcoin educator and security mentor Arman The Parman today published code for running a full node on a mac.there is also the possibility to interchange your existing umbrel/mynode systems with a permanodehere are the steps you need to follow to get a Bitcoin node running on your mac system:get a mac with 1Tb internal/external driveopen terminalcopy and paste this: curl https://parmanode.com/install.sh | shdouble-click the new desktop icon, run_parmanode to run.e.g. information about how to manually connect different wallets to the node can also be retrieved. It is also possible to have your own parmanode automatically connect to your own wallet in the background.QuoteParmanode is designed for non-technical users giving them the ability to download and verify Bitcoin related software, and sync using an external or internal drive, and also have configuration options presented to them with automation. No manual configuration file editing will be required - Parmanode takes care of all that in the background.https://github.com/ArmanTheParman/Parmanodeall other useful links you will find under the following image:https://parmanode.com/https://parmanode.com/install/",

As always if I ever have some of that thing called free time I might play around with it.Seems to follow a bit with the nodes in a box theory of auto installing all the things without a lot of user intervention.The more setups like this the better since it makes more people likely to run a node.With that being said, unless I missed it, which is possible, not a lot of warnings about security and the environment it's running in. -Dave",

The development platform is just crap, there's no way to install and run Unix programs without using something like Cygwin, MinGW, and nowadays Windows Subsystem for Linux. Though because of the graphical nature of some of these programs, I doubt whether this will work on any of these layers.",

One thing it comes to my mind is, following the politics of Apple in general we have to think in the future some Apple upgrades to deny you use their computers to do this kind of things, you know......

Apple things.That should not be so easy to find out. But the demand or interest seems to be confirmed with this project.I think there will be quite a few Linux nodes. Just think of all the umbrel nodes that use umbrelOS. This includes all the Raspberry Pi's or any Ubuntu system.In contrast of that: the total number of nodes that are accessible in the network can be determined.Bitnodes.io gives a nice overview with some interesting statistics. How the nodes are distributed by country and so on.44817 active nodes are currently available, these statistics are updated every day.",

Personally I don't have any computer available to try this, but it looks super promising and \"elegantly hacky\"",
