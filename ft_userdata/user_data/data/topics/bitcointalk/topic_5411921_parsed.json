Even if they don't offer the possibility to watch them in your country, with a VPN you can do it very easily, and on the Digital goods board some sell a subscription to that service and you can pay with Bitcoin.",

From my experience with previous IPTV services I would advise you to ask for a free trial (most will give you 24 hours for free) just to check the quality.Quote from: Lucius on September 01, 2022, 02:50:53 PMI'll say right away that I'm not a big fan of what you might call illegal IPTV, but not primarily because someone violates copyright (which is of course wrong), but also because such services generally have very poor image quality if compared to legal IPTV or satellite television in combination with today's televisions that have fairly large screens.

There are some services that allow you to charge prepaid cards with bitcoin and I don't think the entertainment services will be strict to ask for verified prepaid cards but you can ask the service provider if the card works on a particular site.Most of the services that accept direct payment are third-party services and may be of poor quality/sportscasters compared to legal channels.",

They only downside is that guy doesn't accept bitcoin (afaik).It is difficult for any IPTV to come close to the quality that can be obtained via a satellite signal, especially some foreign platforms that do not save on the video bitrate, which in combination with top TV really gives a top picture. It's possible that I may know which service you're talking about, because I saw something similar through an app that I didn't even know existed and that uses VPN and has everything arranged very nicely.At the moment I don't need something like that because I have too many sports via satellite, but it's always good to have something as a backup option.",

For example Viaplay which shows EPL and Champions league in my country, their max quality is 720p, delay from real time is about is about 1 minute, that's much more than illegal IPTV's. And they expect that I will pay money for such quality?",

Even when buying premium IPTV (the hardware plus their own dedicated VPN), I find the live streams for sports, football especially as OP would like, is never reliable enough when it comes to the actual game. It's actually much faster to search for an available stream with a web browser than it is on any IPTV app (Yogurt, Kodi, hardware).I've actually had the chance to try them too, often in other countries and even had some brought over to where I live with super good internet. They all fail you on the big games.I doubt OP has Dazn access (I recognise OP's name's meaning). Even with VPN I can't reliably access Dazn (they seem to be really actively good at hunting down VPNs). I've got 2 paid ones and they don't even work at BBC all the time haha.",

And then the owner convinces you that the problem is in your internet, in the device you are watching on or in some mysterious force that disturbs the whole thing.",
