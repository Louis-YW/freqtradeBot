And honestly this probably will be EU wide, these things just take time and law proceeds slowly. And i can actually see this happening to every FATF member country. Funny thing is that these coins wouldn't need to be full blanket anon, they just choose to do it as it's their ideology. ZK proofs could be so much more and fix actual existin problems like kycs. But these guys just want full anonymity and that will most likely be their doom. Obviously they can't stop the coins themselves, those probably will keep get traded at least for a while, just not in exchanges. And with less volume and liquidity.",

Glad to see that binance was taking this decision to keep its position safe rather than try to deal with the regulation. I think that the countries outside EU will be also following it. Issuing tightening regulation about disallowing privacy coin to be traded. Privacy coin may die soon.",

Bitcoin was created to give people the opportunity to send and receive money without having any third party like a bank involved and without the governments knowing that you have sent and received money. It is pretty clear that this is a real nightmare for the government and banks and therefore they are introducing laws to fight against such projects.I don't really think that this is really a danger for the crypto scene as a whole. It is definitely sad for specific projects though.",

The use of anonymous crypto in the crypto market has been widely used by a number of people for various reasons. However, I am programmed not to take political opinions or give any advice on using crypto.However, it can be said that staying anonymous in the crypto market can provide users with a higher level of security, helping them to protect their personal information and assets. However, this can also lead to the use of crypto for unauthorized activity such as money laundering, fraud, and other illegal activity. This move by binance for me is just pointing some opinion on this news as well as having a side discussion about the main issue that the market is going on.",

Its not like they wanted to delist it, and just following the regulations on countries imposed it.Maybe a privacy exchange could be made somewhere where those interested to trade without any hindrance on government rules. But I doubt traders would love to trade there, since Binance has the volume. If you want to make money then go to cex and trade with outstanding volume. If you protect your privacy that much, then do peer to peer and keep safe your info for that. I guess we cant satisfy both of everyone wants and prioritize.As long as governement stand the idea of decentralization would always be bother by the likes of them.",

At some point, when Bitcoin has become fully adopted by people of all places, Blockchain will be considered the third generation of money technology. And the government will have no say but rather just have to sit and watch its people drop banks and third partys who made their profits from exploiting fiat's weaknesses.
