Those who work in government and work for judicial agencies are mostly liars and fraudsters, but by some force, they have become a justice. Given what is happening in the world today, I doubt that good will triumph over evil. But that's not why we have to become bad guys, let's live honestly and always help people, I still believe this world has cause and effect, it's just that it won't come as soon as we expect.",

Because of riches of the evil ones, good people has join them to be evil into go be rich through illegal means. I have always said to myself I rather die as a good poor man than die as evil man.  Ritual and love of money is at very high rate in Africa.

Sometimes, the situation isn't favoring the good. And that's why even if they're the good ones, they're frustrated of the outcome of a situation that they're in. It's because the bad ones are prevailing and taking the favor instead of the good ones.

People intend to pay back good will with evil. It's very annoying when you help or lend someone money and in return their cause problem before paying back. At times the lender arrest them just to get his money back. In such a case is good to do evil. But no matter what always think good and it's benefits before thinking evil. Good deeds pays",

It is written that good name is better than riches, it is good to be good. It feels good when people know one is honest and straight forward in every agreement.  What people who are bad do should not be a reason to turn from being good to be bad . I know bad people always claim to be smart and see others to be less  or not being smart,  but one day they will definitely get consequences of bad deeds .",
