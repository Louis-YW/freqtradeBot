When voltage appears in the mains, your motherboard will start.You can use a smart wi-fi socket and electrical relays.I was going to suggest this very same thing.  Basically, you just need a way to cut off power to the mining rig and then restart it (hence the smart power socket).  Then if you have your miner set with the above mentioned settings, it will automatically turn back on as soon as power is restored from the smart socket.  Then of course you have startup items set so that once your miner reboots, it opens the necessary software and begins mining on it's own.  It's a great solution to an issue that software won't be able to help with (because when your miner freezes, nothing is going to work).",

You can restart or turn off the mining farm if your Hive OS is working and the problem is only in the miner. If your mining farm is not connected to the network, then on ordinary motherboards you will not solve the problem.",
