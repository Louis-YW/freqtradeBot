Unlike most cloud storage, this has end to end encryption.You will always get attacked through the weakest link and it has been well-described how dangerous placing unencrypted wallet backups in the cloud are. It doesn't matter if the service has end-to-end encryption; this only stops the company from accessing your files. Anybody with your pCloud login was able to download your wallet, including possibly a seed phrase if you included that.If you are going to store backups in the cloud you must encrypt the file (or text) with an encryption format yourself - I prefer using GPG with an extremely long diceware passphrase and a 4096-bit RSA key. It doesn't matter if it's Proton Drive or some other end-to-end encrypted cloud service.Your electrum binary is certified to be from ThomasV so that means your Electrum wallet setup was not breached but somebody gained access to your wallet.dat file or seed phrase through some other route.",

The same happens when the wallet is emptied by thieves.Quote from: jackjjohnson on November 02, 2022, 04:43:12 PMDoes anyone have any suggestions on possibly what happened? I waited a few days before reporting in case there was some sort of wide-spead problem, but I do not hear of one.It looks like somebody may have gotten your wallet seed and emptied your wallet.I don't know how this could have been happening, but you should consider at very least that wallet compromised, so you should no longer sweep to there, instead make yourself a new wallet with a new seed.I wrote \"at very least\" the wallet, since I'm a Windows user and I would reinstall everything.How did this happen? No idea. It could be the cloud storage, it could be the HDD backup, it could be something on your PC or it could be something on the routing/transfer to/from cloud (am I too paranoid?). None seem really likely.Lately I use hardware wallet and I keep the seed backup written by hand. Maybe it's also an idea you could use.",

Is that the private key that you sweep or the backup seed?The bad thing is you store your wallet into cloud storage which is not safe and will never be safe.",
