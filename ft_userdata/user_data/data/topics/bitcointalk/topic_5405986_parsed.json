They had always cleaned it and so on so I figured they would be a good place to start.  They offered me about 20% of my purchase price.  Nice!  So I approached a few more shops and they were all in thesame sort of range, I think the high was around 30-35%.  I should have taken the money then and there and bought BTC!     Good luck.  Put in as much detail as you can and you will have better luck!  PS:  Just remembered the 5th C - it is \"certification\" - so you might not have that.  I think I do, there are a few agencies that certify diamonds AFIK and it lends credence to the rock.",
