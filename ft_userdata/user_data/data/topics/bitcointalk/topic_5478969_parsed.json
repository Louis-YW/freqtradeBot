  "content": "Hello everyone,Before I start this message, I first wanted to wish everyone a happy holiday season and a very prosperous New Year in 2024. Ok now that that's out there, I feel that its important that I post related to the ongoing Inscriptions/Ordinals issue that's bloating L1 and, IMO, attacking the social, technical, and financial game theory layers of Bitcoin.As I see things it appears as though they, entities funded and/or focused in TRADFI, are currently pitting miners against many members of the community and the generally accepted ethos of the greater good of bitcoin's independence of the traditional fiat system, and are currently complicit in attempting to fold our BTC freedom money into the fiat system.  These inscriptions and ordinals attacks are trying their very best to create things like \"rare sats\" (which attacks the fungibility of Bitcoin token) while also pushing NFTs onto L1 while simultaneously making every node runner responsible in hosting these potential political attack vectors.  Also not to mention that with the currently (artificially high due to inscriptions IMO) L1 transaction fees, they're making it impractical for many of the lower earners / net worth folks around the world to attain self custody of their sats and thereby making them reliant on third party custody solutions which very much pumps the breaks hard on the self custody revolution that IMO Bitcoin is all about.  I should also mention that with respect to the higher fees over the last few months that I understand that eventually fees will rise on Layer 1 however it's my view that they will only do so in terms of fiat currency, not in sats or Bitcoin as the price of BTC should rise and eventually the large publicly traded miners selling them for fiat will likely be part of team HODL rather than team fiat.Since currently however TRADFI seems to have their tentacles deep into the fiat price of bitcoin and are taking this opportunity (while their political money still has value relative to bitcoin) to try their best to get control of it by all means necessary (look at the current Elizabeth Warren attack on self custody initiated by the CEO of the largest US bank , Mr. Dimon).  To me it comes down to the grass roots community here to try to stave off these attacks as soon as possible.  With all of that said, as a long time node runner in different parts of the world I've been noticing a difference between my node's mempool and what mempool dot space as well as blockstream dot info. After digging into it a bit deeper (with the help of the new goggle tool on mempool dot space), I was able to look at literally dozens of transactions in the mempool labeled inscriptions and then try to pull the same transaction on my nodes running version 20.2 and none of them were visible..that is until they're confirmed by the miners. The point I'm trying to get through however is that if you don't support inscriptions like me, then you might want to consider running an older version of bitcoin core as your node like me as it appears to filter them out of the mempool. Case in point as of now I see about a 1 GB difference between mempool dot space and my node (1.48 GB / 311,000 TXs on their site vs. 564 MB/81,000 TXs on my node).As always, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated...especially relating to the apparent filtering of the inscription transactions on bitcoin core v 20.2.  Thanks in advance and again happy holidays everyone!",

However, this will also [mempool] reject other witness version 1 transactions from regular users that are not malicious.The other downside is that you no longer fully verify blocks you receive either. Since as I said your node doesn't have the code for the full consensus rules to do so. That means you are relying on the rest of the network to verify that part of the blocks and only add them to the chain if they were valid, instead of fully verifying everything yourself which is what Bitcoin stands for.",

ASICS do not select transactions, nor are asics using nodes..  you apply it to node, knowing POOLS use an node as a backbone of transaction selectionalso it can be enforced by mandating POOLS comply by blackmailing them that their blocks will get rejected if they dont comply.. you know exactly how that happened before. so its not a precedent that goes against your moralsthere are many ways to code it.. consensus enforced or just policy followeda. consensus enforced:have a fee formulae that transactions using certain opcodes pay a certain threshold. and if transactions are not in the threshold then the block can be rejected, thus making pools ensure they put certain complying transactions into a block, thus enforcing transactors wanting to use certain opcodes pay the premium to get includedb. just policy followedheck it doesnt need to be enforced by being a consensus rule. simply knowing majority use core as the backbone of the network where pools API call their transaction selections from a core node. just having it as \"policy\" seems to have shown compliance..much like how legacy transactions are seen to be paying more then segwit without any consensus enforcementbut like i said code is great. anything can be coded, so its not impossible. it just needs core dev politics to want to add itas for the fee formulaethe options are limitlessEGif opcode used, the formulae could be:(144/utxo age)*100meaninga 1 confirm spam respend using certain opcode starts 14400 higher then a normal transactionmeanwhile regular bitcoiners using regular opcodes pay the regular rate..thats the beauty of code. devs can code any rules and policy they like.",

Eventually if people are this eager to use pro-censorship software we're going to have people literally blocking other addresses from sending or receiving them money, which in itself has its perks as we can blacklist addresses from suspected hackers and scammers, but at the same time especially with how fast cancelation in the internet works before figuring shit out it might end up just as you said, people just blacklisting other people from sending money. It also poses security and identity risks cause in some way you gotta know the person from a certain level to know for sure that they are the ones you want to blacklist. I think the solution towards ordinals do not lie upon the users or the people in the blockchain. The developers should do something about it besides banning it cause honestly in the future another project will just come out to entice the people again with the concept of \"______ but in bitcoin\" just as what ordinals did. If that happens are they just going to ban every project like so?",

Not a policy. The math Core applies to the client for legacy transactions might or might not be local policy, but that's because a softfork has preceded. - For this measure to be effective, the ordinal byte must take more space than a regular transaction byte, as a legacy takes 4 times the space a segwit does. This could happen by re-writing a new block size policy which treats every non-tapscript transaction as the respective to segwit, but again, that's softfork. I want a non-fork way that cannot be bypassed.",
