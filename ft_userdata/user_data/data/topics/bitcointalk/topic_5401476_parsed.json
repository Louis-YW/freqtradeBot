  "content": "Hi, i wanted to create a passive income with the crypto.com lending. But they changed their terms, so i would need a lot more money to get the same result as before (with my plan i would get since middle 2025 ~a monthly passive income).So now i'm on the search for alternatives. What are your ways to generate a passive income with crypto?I've thought to hodl BTC and ETH. But i could make a passive income with altcoins (doesn't need to be a monthly income every month; but perhaps ~60$/month) with a one time investment. Those earnings i could swap regulary to BTC.This would be my, let's say 'minimum-idea'. The best would be to generate a passive monthly income. If you have some ideas for that where i don't need a million or so dollar to realise it, would be even greater  Thanks,dissi_xD",

Thanks for your answer I've never tried trading becaise of the risk to loose all.But also if i would generate a passive income with crypto i would still going to work since i need some daily routine  But some extra money is never an error",

Lowest risk, I agree but if there is high inflation, you lose money even with interest rate. For earning passive income with altcoins, there are high risk and low risk ways. $60 per month is very easy to achieve and relatively low risk in most exchanges with staking. But if you looking for an alternative, I would recommend trying to learn the basics of future trade. You can hit that amount with 2-5x leverage in a few trades.",

This is the way I think as well, to begin with the options to earn some passive income are always limited since a great deal of them eventually turn into a scam.As an example of this there was a time in which cloud mining was very popular and people promoted this as an option to earn some passive income, and instead the majority lost their investment, and I think something similar about staking, while it may seem without a risk you need to wonder about the very real possibility the coin may collapse, as such it is better to look for ways in which you can earn money by taking the right decisions and actions than to look fir a form of passive income, as the risks of losing all your investment are on the high side.",

These may be investments you have made where you earn money or work you have done in the past that continues to pay dividends even in the present. In short, passive income describes the idea of “making money work for you.”Staking is the one considered passive income where your investment earned an allocated APY.",

This means that you have made plans so that in 2025 (3 years from now) you will start to have passive income, we are talking about that you have put your precious money on a website so that in 3 years from now you will start to have passive income. I honestly find it hard to even read what I'm writing, my question:who guarantee you that in 3 years this site will be working? you can say that before they change their TOS you could have passive income long before 2025, but I think that maybe you will only have that passive income next year, whatever the fact is that the site has an owner and the owner can change the TOS whenever he wants and with that he can make people get hurt, so that's the worst investment anyone could makemy advice:take your money and invest in real world business, at least you will have 100% controlQuote from: dissi_xD on June 05, 2022, 02:58:30 PMSo now i'm on the search for alternatives. What are your ways to generate a passive income with crypto?well when you do research just find sites like the one you were on there is nothing good about these passive income sites",
