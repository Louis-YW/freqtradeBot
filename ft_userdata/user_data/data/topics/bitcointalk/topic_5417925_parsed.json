All I have known is that people that won so big are publicized and people know them from there.That is dangerous, it means no privacy and people that are known to the public can be the victim of robbers and there can be physical attacks from robbers in order to steal from the winner. That is not all, even if there is no physical threat, people like me and some other people on this forum can be afraid, feeling unsafe of attacks. I do not expect gambling sites to be publicising this kind of news. Will gambling site ask for the permission of the winner for the winning to go public? Or the winner can just be anonymous in a way his name will not be mentioned?",

And the last one that I heard that won a raffle here in our community with a Cyber Tesla Truck is SyGambler.",

In land base casino's I don't see names, I just saw that in this day, this x amount of money has been won, no names.For the lottery, we might see the images of individuals claiming the prize money with that huge check with pictorial purposes but their faces are blurred out. But I do agree that the names shouldn't be made public because it is very dangerous for the individual. He/she could be a target for a kidnap for random, so yes, possible of physical harm.",

I don't think so honestly. You can only get in trouble with it. Imagine that you have won 2 million$ and you would appear on the website or in the news with your photo and name, I think that suddenly you suddenly have a lot of friends and your life is no longer safe because people can easily track you down. A gambling site will never do that. Privacy is to important for users.",

Or the winner can just be anonymous in a way his name will not be mentioned? I guess it depends entirely upon what country you are in or what possible terms you agree to when playing in the casino. For example if deep in the text of the freebie membership account that you open allows them to publicize your name in the case of big wins, then that might be fair if they throw some free chips your way to play with at the start. There are also privacy ramifications, which might make this setup hard in places like the EU which have some advanced legal restrictions on what you can do with personal data. Who knows, it's good for the casino to advertise the occasional big win so they might even offer a small premium to go with your prize.",

Asking for some permission or not then it would be definitely be depending on the platform you've been playing.Some might be respecting on their users privacy and some doesnt really care and just simply publicizesince they do know that it would really be a good advertisement for their site which might boost up and make huge interest if people do see that there is someone who do make huge wins on playing on the site.It cant really be that avoided nor be ignored that people do really gets easily hyped and boosted up their feelings and believe that they would really be ending up on the samescenario of someone who do win big which is totally a wrong mindset.",

If I won big, even my family members will not know it because I know it will change our lives and some of them will become more greedy, it’s better to keep it a secret and spend slowly.",

But in most cases, jackpot winners are anonymous.And even if we hide our winnings in public, there will always be a time that it will be revealed soon.

It causes the public to feel like the lottery is more real and less of a scam. Factcheckers can scrutinize winners for connections to lottery organizers to prove its not rigged. It gives people confidence they might someday be a winner. I think statistically more than 80% of lottery winners end up impoverished and in debt without a short timeframe. While we are prone to looking outside of ourselves for biggest dangers and threats. The most likely scenario for failure with winning the lottery is usually our own lack of self control. Lack of discipline. Lack of knowledge for how to cope with and grow wealth. The same precedent could apply to countries nationally. People love movies about alien invasions and a zombie apocalype. But looking around the world today, the biggest dangers appear to be our own mismanagement of money and natural resources.",
