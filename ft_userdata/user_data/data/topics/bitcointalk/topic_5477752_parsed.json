Seems more like a shitcoin money printing event for Cardsmiths Currency.Cardsmiths was a bit sneaky in that they used Series 1 and 2 characters in the holiday release.   This causes the hodlers to want them to complete their sets.  For 1/1s collectors have paid several thousands of dollars.   So a #d/3, they may have no problem shelling out 750+ I'm guessing. One pack already sold for $130+.https://www.ebay.com/itm/225914448857?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=2euQuwRkSCe&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=rqqYryMZRqa&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY",

Heres  the problem with these holiday card prices. I get that these cards are rare, but dont forget they dumped 2100 refractors out in one week. The supply of holiday cards is through the roof. These prices may stick after next summer. Regarding Mr Stacy's deal. I think its a reasonable price. If you were selling individual packs for $100 i might be down, but $3000 at Christmas is too much for me. If no takers, maybe consider selling individually.",
