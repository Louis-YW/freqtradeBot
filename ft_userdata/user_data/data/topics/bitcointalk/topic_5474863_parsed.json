      "body": "Due to the little misunderstanding between you, 1miau and the rest you think they should remove him is this normal?Well this is your own side of view but I will say we all have misunderstanding both in physical word and in forum here, if there is any worries why not go to him and settle than to request for a total removal. Maybe in my opinion I think theymos is the person who him/her a source and when he thinks they are no longer spending their merits wisely or the way it should be then he may disabled anyone that is not fits for it, btw a request from you alone may not have any negative effects if not proven otherwise. It's advise to lock this thread and go settle with him for any reason be it beef and personal case you guys holding for each others.",

      "body": "From opinion conflict to request for removing from DT1 member (Distrust) and now removing from merit source gang.You have to convince theymos to remove 1miau as a merit source with proof of using sourced merit for personal benefits. I did not see reports against 1miau on this issue so your request does not have enough convincing proof to removing him as a merit source.Do you have any clear abuse to report?Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIf they complain about amounts, tell them to complain to me. It's best if sources try to exhaust their source allocations, even if it means giving posts higher amounts than is typical. If you have 150 source merit and you only see 3 merit-worthy posts in a month, then I'd rather you over-give each of them 50 merit than let the merit expire. That way there are more people capable of sending merit, and the \"merit economy\" is less top-down.If a DT member tags you for something stupid involving merit (ie. probably anything less than selling merit), then they're not going to be a DT member for much longer.Aside from that, if people complain about whether things deserve merit at all, then that's something to perhaps think about, but if you conclude that they're wrong, then that's that. You don't need to stress about it or defend yourself constantly. It's conceivable that someday you and I will end up disagreeing too much about this stuff and I'll remove your source status, but it's really not a big deal.The topsendban list is just a first indication of abuse, and many excellent people are on it. Your place on there acts as a sort of benchmark: eg. chandra12 has a similar score there, but whereas you are an extremely active merit-giver with a diverse selection of posts merited (most of which anyone would agree with), chandra12 only has two large merit sends. His behavior in comparison to yours while having a similar topsendban score is what creates a strong abuse impression.I appreciate the work of you and other sources who take it seriously!Quote from: theymos on February 05, 2019, 10:46:22 PMQuote from: suchmoon on February 05, 2019, 07:11:31 PMIs stingers still a merit source?Not anymore. That's clear abuse, awarding merit for political reasons rather than any idea of quality. Only because he was a source, I effectively undid those merit sends. If he had not been a merit source, I still would've blacklisted anyone who got into DT1 through that type of shenanigans.I hadn't read into the thread deeply enough to see that stuff. Those are better arguments against the trustworthiness of H8bussesNbicycles & co., but note that the current negative-trust-ratings were sent long before that. Before February, the thread looks like politics to me.",

I do not think they are more than 20 to 30, out of 109 merit sources.I have just gone through 1miau merit history and he give merits to good posts. So should because he is giving merit to good posts should be the reason he should be removed from merit source?Â  This is my conclusion from what I have analysed about this, the probability that theymos will remove 1miau is less than 1%. Which means that do not expect theymos to remove him because he would not remove him.You do not even know that some people are merit source. You will not even know that some people are existing on this forum despite that they are merit sources.",

I do not actually follow up his activities but I can attest that he is one of those merit sources that give out merits to users. I haven't been a beneficiary and likewise I do not benefit much from any merit source. But then it must not be me, it can be others.There are several merit sources who do not distribute merits but 1miau is among those that distribute merits. I have also seen him advocate for quality posts, this means he will likely send merits to only quality posts.",

      "body": "Looks like the community has already decided that the \"petition\" doesn't has any Merit. And how often digaran wants to prove that he's just here for trolling and fueling any conflict? What an unnecessary drama to spend our time on the forum for. Regarding my distribution of Merit, I'm alwys trying to be fair, to reward quality posts and, of course, to listen to community feedback. As even the OP doesn't provide any post, where I've distributed an unjustified amount of Merit to, I think there's everything said about the credibility of the \"petition\". It's just because digaran wants to continue his trolling. As said by other people in the topic, I'm a Merit source for a long time, I'm trying to reward quality posts, new, interesting and helpful content and members who are trying to show some effort to contribute to the forum. That's deserving Merit in my opinion. Quote from: mole0815 on November 21, 2023, 01:32:38 PM1miau awards merits mostly fairly and the rest is a matter of interpretation. Thanks for your feedback, mole0815 and despite we have some fundamental disagreements, I would say, that you are distributing Merit mostly fairly as well. We might have a different understanding to evaluate a post and I'm more trying to focus on well-thought quality posts, each Merit source is unique, as long as there's no abuse. Quote from: mole0815 on November 21, 2023, 01:32:38 PMAnd before the accusation is made.

We might have disagreements but I trust you here. Thanks for the feedback everyone else here. Â I'll continue to do a good job by rewarding quality posts.",

But thanks to enlightening me with your unbiased opinion. After receiving more than 300 merits from him, your opinion is totally unbiased. Â ðŸ¤¥Isn't it obvious why you created this thread? You already know that you won't be able to convince anyone to agree with you. But you decided to use this thread to ask everyone to review the feedback he left.
