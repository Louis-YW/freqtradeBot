  "content": "You could buy a case from ledger's site but it seems ridiculous as it's overpriced.  There are cheaper ones on amazon that is $20 and less but the issue here is when you buy them, well the 3rd party that is sending it to you assuming it isn't shipped from amazon is going to know you own a hardware wallet.  The other issue is what about the people that are packaging your order at amazon?  Sure they are packaging things as expensive as a laptop and iphone and things like that but if it's a hardware wallet or hardware wallet case, well couldn't that person know you own a hardware wallet?  Then you also have to factor in the carrier who brings your packages since it seems it's mostly UPS that brings amazon packages.  However, they wouldn't have a clue of what it's inside it since well it just shows amazon tape on it which is normal for many packages.Is the only way to order a case safely directly through ledger and overpay for their case?  Or buy an earphone case or some small case and use that for the nano ledger s plus?",

Ledger employees could know, Shopify or (whatever software Ledger uses for their e-commerce platform) could also know.Well I mean a best buy employee would know you have crypto if you buy a hardware wallet at the store if they are the cashier.  I mean that person won't know your name if you pay in cash but you still probably wouldn't want anyone to know you own crypto right?  Imagine that person lives near you or the same area as you which is likely if they work there.When you are buying a nano ledger from ledger, yes ledger knows your name and email address.  The thing here is there are so many people around the world buying these things so unless they do research on a person's name, they can't really know if they have a decent amount of crypto or not.  It could be someone just buying a ledger who has 100 dollars or so.   The other thing is they won't know how that person would look unless they check their facebook or something and do research?  I mean a ledger employee could write down 10 names they packaged the ledger to... but the issue is lot of these people are ordering it internationally.  So if you are from the US...the person who packages your ledger isn't going to look at your address and be familiar with it compared to them shipping it to someone else in the same country as France.  Does that make sense?  So a ledger employee wouldn't really care about someone from say US even probably unless that name is some youtube person maybe?",
