      "body": "Let's return to why the Indian authority were able to freeze those accounts and related bitcoins?Because it belongs to centralized platforms and those guys did not have non-custodial wallets so that they were easily frozen by government. The India government only have to put pressure on the platform team and froze those accounts. They can have solid or not solid reasons with their demand but if you don't store your bitcoins in non custodial wallets, you are very vulnerable to governmental activities.Money laundering is bad and should be handled well, I support it but let's use this news to consider using non custodial wallets.",

The IOUs that the centralized platform (eg. the exchange) promises to convert back to bitcoin if you wanted to  withdraw.",

But from what I got from  news.bitcoin.com; a gaming applications E-nuggets was used to defraud Indians and the proceeds was used to buy bitcoins through Binance. The government had to trace and freeze about 150.22 bitcoins held at Binance that is related to this E-nuggets scam. If E-nuggets was truly a scam application that defrauded the people, then they government acted correctly. But if was another strategy to clampdown on legitimate crypto companies with the aim of controlling or totally destroying them, I would state that the brains behind E-nuggets have learnt their lessons the hard way. They should have known that decentralize wallets is the only option.",

In the same way that a Bitcoin kept in a non-custodial wallet can't also be a victim of an FTX-like scenario. Everybody should now have a lot of reasons to practice self custody.",

The government must have made a proper investigation for them to be able to trace the funds and confirmed that it is in Binance,freezing the account is the best of option for them since I don't think these fraudsters can be caught or punished.E-nugglet kept their funds in a centralized system so it was easy for the government to freeze, FTX crashed and so many person lost their investment all these are happening because this Exchanges are the same with our fiat banks but are in disguise online to be an exchange of crypto currency.",

They can now freeze the BTC? that is a good thing so that scammer cannot escape with the money and it will return back to its rightful owner again. People should be vigilant not to engage in any kind of investment fraud out there because nowadays they cannot run and they will gonna suffer for real if they get caught.",

Good it's fine they got to seize those coin's from fraudulent and illicit acts.Second part I still the warnings are with Binance accounts, those still keeping their coins inside are doing themselves nothing but huge harm honestly. Binance are almost same as FTX and other centralized which the Fed's can put to a complete stop at anytime. Get your coins off listen to the warnings",

Eyes of the government are certainly getting wider and wider and gone can be the days when of the Wild, Wild West for crypto...regulations are coming in and there is nothing that can stop it.
