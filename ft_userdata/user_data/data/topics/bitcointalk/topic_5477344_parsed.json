These are parts of what that have crippled Nigeria into what is happening presently.I can understand you, Obasanjo and Jonathan time were better. Especially Jonathan's time when Nigeria became the highest in GDP in Africa. The GDP increased significantly during Jonathan's time, and it is still higher than our GDP right now. But if not because of corruption and embezzlement, Nigeria would have been better than it was also in Jonathan's time.The problem worsen in Buhari's time. He closed border and inflation started. It still continues this time. I can remember my neighbors were able to put on generator for 3 to 5 hours at night before Tinubu become the president. Either they do not on generator now or they put on the generator for just an hour. It is true that life was better without fuel subsidy removal. But we should still say no to corruption and embezzlement.What valid reason do we have that the present government officials are not corrupt and embezzling money. Or what makes you think that corruption has reduced or that there is no more in Nigeria? Do not let us deceives ourselves.",

Such is a government that imposes and implements the laws and yet they personally breaks the same laws simply because they feels above the laws and the juridical parliament keep to succumbing to the same governments that is juridically supposed to be justified according to its power of lawfulness in the societies. Otherwise, the corrupted governments of every governance are not even worth of sympathy justice because due to their heartlessness and inhumans behaviorals in their rulerships with the societies.Such corruptive governments that has always taken the leads of leadership's and forces in power is definitely leaders of personal interests in governance whom are extortive taskers, embezzlers and rebels.The governments energies of rulerships are self-centered with selfish interests and doesn't care what the masses goes through.That is Nigeria for us all they even if it is not acceptable, you must be forced to as long your voice outs is never recognized neither your existence is recognize but all they cares about is having the masses as a revenue to generating of  incomes of feeding fats of public funds in an obvious manner yet the juridicrions keeps being adamant and ignorant to the nature of the unpleasantary lives we sees on each and every basis even of differential basis of the government. The super governments systems in the country has seemed being a normality while the hardship is on its continuities.",

Do not let us deceives ourselves.Given the opportunity to go back to the so called \"corruption\" regime vs or remain speculated non-corrupt regimes of Buhari and Tinibu, I'd pick the previous rather than the latter. Life was a lot more easier for a lot of families in Jonathan's regime compared to Buhari + Tinibu combined. Yet, we're led to believe that little or no corruptions begets good standard of living but as it turns out, those money saved from subsidiaries are being used to incentivize governments to live luxuriously while citizens strive in extreme povertyNo corruption was stopped - we were only played.",

First I can relate to your church gen going off during service, that one don dey be normal occurrence especially for smaller churches wey go want manage because dem no go fit burn 5k fuel for service.But why dem go give a whole community two bags of rice for fuel subsidy palliative to cushion which side of effect really   And you want blame una chief for safeguarding one for himself and family   Abi you think say una chief dey happy as the palliative no reach anywhere. No doubt worst times are still ahead and na survival of the fittest. Government no dey always send the masses and that is why they won't send cash palliative through bank account via BVN because they are not sincere in all their dealings which is Nigerian politics for you.Instead wey government go do better thing for the generality of the people, dem go carry tax come to collect the one wey dey your hand. Subsidy removal itself na scam because you can't remove subsidy and you still dey refine crude oil for outside the country. Dem no want build refinery because dem get refinery outside wey dey give dem personal rebate.",

Let them eat the money and allow us to buy fuel at a subsidized rate.  Imagine since the inception of this subsidy removal dating from 29th of may 2023, I have been unable to run my power generating set (generator) due to high cost of fueling. I now buy Ice block to cool my drinks since I can't use generator to power my refrigerator In my local grocery store. The one that shock me again is that port Harcourt to owerri I used to pay a total fare #1,500 from my residence to mbaitoli in owerri, I now paid a total amount #11,000. This is disheartening.When I fuel my motorcycle with #1000 just to go and buy something, I can't use that fuel for the next day because I will be having empty tank.

Just the same way he reserved one for himself  I know that is how everybody that had come in contact from that top(federal) had been stealing, hiding and reserving for themselves. What a country.OP, Removal of fuel subsidy was never a bad idea but it was done wrongly, for a government that has blue print, I think the pressing needs of the masses would have been tackle before taking such decision considering it's negative impact on the citizens, The president acted as if the only problem of Nigeria is the subsidy regime and think he got it wrong, up till this very moment the cabals still loot through this process, there are still loopholes which has to be dealt with.Our leaders are very corrupt, if the government of the day want to come clean then the scrutiny has to start from the executive, I have watched closely the major reason for the repair and maintenance of our refineries is not necessarily for the reduction in the price of our petroleum products, they are doing it to either privatize it and make you believe that the are not in charge of fixing the price since it is now been owned by private firm.When you make investigation you will understand that there is slight price drop of pms but it will surprise you that petrol station can not effect the new price because no one is ready to give them a thorough check, this is the country that we found ourselves, But I believe the government can fix things if they want to, it is very disappointing that Nigeria is still facing the same problem of corruption from military regime to this democratic rule as the call it, may God help us to overcome this hard time.",

So let us buckle up for some tough time ahead,  and make chance for new adoption and adjustment,  because I was listening to the president speech last time and he was not ready to go back on his word,  he says and I quotes (just like a woman in labour,  she will go through pains but at the end of the day she will smile when the baby arrived). President Tinubu also said that Nigerai should be ready to bear the pain with promise that things will get better soon,  this is why I have been saying that you as minister and representatives of the people should go back and educate your people about the program and help them prepare the mind. With that, I think we already have all the evidence needed to conclude that,  the President has decided and upon well-informed manner.",

I'm not sure if it was this week when I was watching the Channel TV, the ex central bank governor was interview and to make comments on the current state of the monetary policies of the country and he addressed some issues but there was a question he asked. It was concerning the subsidy funds and where they are going since the removal took place. The government was worried that the subsidy has been the problem because of the massive corruption that is going on and as such, they will stop funding fuel and since then fuel price has skyrocketed but the question is, where are those funds going to now and what are they used for since subsidy was put to a stop.QuoteI think It will be best for Nigerians to have the notion that the current state of our dear country is far from being saved from the bad state of corruption that has eaten deeply into the country.

Our country's economy getting worse day by day without a rescue plan on how to save our economy from the free fall it is to the dollar.Nigeria government will not do anything, know this and have a peace of mind. The government will make promises here and there but guess what, they can't really deliver anything because the government we have is a parallel government. Look at all the arms of the government, is it not the same people that are ruling the country? How do we expect a change when there is no change in the government yet we expect something, the joke is on us.The country is full of clowns and corrupts ecosystem of government, if we want to see real change then we need to weed out some of those guys.",
