      "body": "I am not sure if someone has ever claimed that gold is scarce. Because a huge amount of landmass has still not used for mining discovery. A major portion of Africa is still undiscovered. So gold is not scarce in any way. Also gold is not used as an investment anywhere in the world. Gold is mainly used for capital protection. Historically gold price has always shown a steady increase in price keeping the inflation in mind. That's why Gold is precious but not scarce. On the other hand bitcoin has a limited supply if 21 million. So it is expected that it's price will skyrocket anytime in the future owing to its scarcity. But this feature is only pushing bitcoin out from being a currency system to an investment. So the future is pretty unclear.",

OP made a pretty sound argument about the alteration of gold's supply since the current supply of gold in the planet is scarce and finite and the only logical way it could be supplanted with is through an asteroid impact. That's just stupid and a little cynical in my opinion. And yes that includes the ones that couldn't be mined due to the current limits in technology. In the discussion of immutability however OP, while gold can be made infinite virtually, supply isn't the only thing that makes it valuable. It has aesthetic properties that makes it a must-have by every one on the planet, not to mention its practical applications in technology, business, and other ventures which strays from the argument that gold isn't as great as bitcoin cause I could easily add more gold into the system of supply.",

When the digging operation exceeds the value of gold mined it's pointless to try. What would have to happen for us to increase the supply? One of two things.Either the demand would have to be very high, but for that we'd have to start using much more gold to produce electronics (or go back to using gold coins for payment), that's one, or the cost of deep mining would have to go down so that we could start accessing new deposits.",

There was news about $13T worth of gold in Uganda https://www.mining-technology.com/features/uganda-gold-deposit-investment/which I guess the gold was sort of unattractive but definitely it's still to be extracted from the ground, there is no value to it yet. Gold is useful in making electronic products and it's still rare making gold a sound money still since ancient times. It's the preferred investment as part of diversification.",

Is anyone going to grab the gold from that asteroid? I know you are excited about the Bitcoin future but bro about the gold asteroid theory it's just theory and you can't bring that gold to the economic circle so Unless we get that supply the assumed supply of gold will be considered as a dummy.Gold is currently not scared of the BITCOIN because you can compare it with market capital, yeah yeah I know about future potential but we are in the present so currently Gold is not at all scared. I think most of us have forgotten Ukraine vs Russia's impact on the economic circle so what if WW3 happens I think it will be a nightmare for technology and Bitcoin as well. So enjoy the Journey with Bitcoin in the present.",

Well, I think any body who values gold more than bitcoin does so solely because gold is from ancient times, it's not man made like bitcoin, and it was once a currency and over time, have proven it's legitimacy and worth..Bitcoin on the other hand is still pretty new to many people, alot of persons don't really understand bitcoin yet nor how it work, so they are still skeptical about the legitimacy of bitcoin, Infact, some still see bitcoin as a bubble, for such people, when you ask them to choose between bitcoin and gold, be rest assure they will always choose gold.",

If the news about large quantity of gold in Africa is true and the right technological tools are used to mine more gold, the price might be affected by the supply. Gold has maintained its position as on the reliable store of value but it's unlimited supply might be it's undoing. Bitcoin has advantage over gold because if it's limited supply. Nobody know what the future holds but I am predicting that bitcoin will be more valuable than gold. There are.people that who are  gold maximalists they believe that trading and holding in gold is the only means of investing wisely. But Bitcoin has shown a lot of resilience and consistency in its operations. Gold is generally accepted in every country and it is a well-known commodity. In the future Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold because it might have wider acceptance. we can not predict the limit of gold but the limit of bitcoin is known.",

Scientists can only make estimations but they are not exact numbers and the physical gold human can harvest on Earth will change with technologies we have.The important fact is we can not know the maximum storage of physical gold on Earth. Estimation can not be compared to the exact number of Bitcoin total supply which is 21 millions.Gold total supply can increase in future with more advanced technologies for getting gold on Earth and from the space but total available bitcoin will be less than 21 millions in future because more people will lose their bitcoins. This fact makes Bitcoin is a better investment asset than gold.",

Here it is very clear that standard class cars are seen more on the road, while Lambo or Ferrari are rarely seen on the road. Yes, there are, but the percentage is lower than standard class cars. Almost all people have gold, but if Bitcoin is only spread 21 million pieces and this number might be reduced because the wallet that is stored Bitcoin can no longer be accessed.For ordinary people who are not familiar with Bitcoin, they prefer to play it safe by buying Gold because its liquidity is higher than Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is still determined by the large number of requests and offers on the Crypto market, for Investors who want to make quick profits they prefer Bitcoin over Gold.",

I'm sure that there's plenty of gold underground, we just can't mine it in an efficient way.The same thing partially applies to Bitcoin.
