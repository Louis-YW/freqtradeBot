I would also want to use an escrow service... peace of mind for both of us. Thanks in advance. As always, it would be helpful to know what sort of pricing you had in mind for an item like this.  I've seen these particular coins sell for anywhere between 0.2-0.35 BTC fairly recently, so knowing what sort of price you were looking to pay would be helpful to potential sellers.  Good luck with your purchase and as always I'm available for escrow should it be needed.",

From my perspective, onus is on the seller to name their price. At least that’s how I do business.",

When the product is rare its up to the buyer to entice the seller to bring the product out of hiding.",

I can contact the team directly to try and resolve. Sometimes you have to refresh the page/reconnect your wallet and that fixes things.",
