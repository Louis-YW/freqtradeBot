So no idea what to make of it.Looks like maybe a glitch on how they calculate the mark price or just a low liquidity period where a mid size trader can cause the funding to change this might with a mid sized order.I am pretty sure in 8 hours after this funding it will be back at 0.01 most likely.",

Opinions?You can not use funding rate to determine what the price of bitcoin would be in 2023 first quarter. My advice to people is to just buy more coins.Quote from: adaseb on December 31, 2022, 05:23:34 AMI looked into this and it seems Bybit is the only exchange with funding rates this high. All others are flat at 0.01. Looking at the open interest there is very little change. So no idea what to make of it.I checked Binance, OKX, Huobi and Kucoin, the funding rate is at 0.01% all at the four exchanges.Quote from: adaseb on December 31, 2022, 05:23:34 AMLooks like maybe a glitch on how they calculate the mark price or just a low liquidity period where a mid size trader can cause the funding to change this might with a mid sized order.Probably, but that is too high.",

Opinions?Its not a preparation for 2023 crash nor a trap. Its just an short term inefficiency of bybit marketmakers/arbitrage traders. Maybe created by holiday and end of year parties. You should never make a long term asset price predictions based on holiday behaviour on single exchange. Especially funding rate that change frequently and is not connected to long term trends in any way.",

You would think the open interest had a big change but,https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/usd/bybit/open-interest-chart/btcusd_oi/It seems mostly flat. So I can only assume it was something to do the way they calculated the mark price, maybe used some API quote which stalled. Looks fixed now.",
