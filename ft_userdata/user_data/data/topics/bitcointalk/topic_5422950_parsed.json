Here are some reasons why we consider $HUNNY to be good for referencehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418911.msg61218659#msg61218659https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-hunny-a-good-buy-right-now/However we do not restrict players to only use $HUNNY to play our games. We have integrated 7 different chains and accepting coins such as CAKE, BNB, USDT, BUSD, BABY, XVS, VAI, AVAX, FTM, BOO, USDC, OKT, MATIC, ONE, SOL. We will be accepting BTC and ETH as well in the near future. We are planning to launch our signature campaign for HunnyPlay, it should be ready these few days.

He probably did this in response to all the scam accusations and in an attempt to separate his name and bad reputation from this project.Anyway, here are all the archived PancakeHunny topics started by @coldice last year:„ÄêANN„Äë„ÄêPRESALES„ÄëPancakeHunny.Finance - DeFi Aggregator with Poker & Lottery - [archive]„ÄêPRESALE„ÄëPancakeHunny Launch- DeFi Aggregator with Poker & Lottery ¬†- [archive][AIRDROP] PancakeHunny -üí∞ $3000 Worth of $HUNNY Up for Grab [BIG REWARD]üí∞ - [archive]Fortunately, neither topic attracted significant community attention as the PancakeHunny smart contract was later exploited by a DeFi hack.Quote from: Daltonik on October 18, 2021, 08:24:07 AMPancakeHunny on BSC on October 20 was attacked using a flash loan by a hacker, about $1.9 million was stolen, this is already happening for the second time, the first case of using a flash loan was in the month of June.

We cant compare it to most common deposit bonus where your money is locked until you complete the wagering requirement. I do not mean to defend this new casino, just saying in general about the difference of such deposit bonus.",
