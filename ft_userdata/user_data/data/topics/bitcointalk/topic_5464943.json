      "body": "Today's ETH AI readout:QuoteThe market for Ethereum has shown a declining trend over the past 7 days. The average price has decreased from $1661.44 on 23rd August to $1649.37 by 28th August. The McClellan Oscillator values have moved closer to zero, indicating a weak bearish momentum. The On Balance Volume (OBV) indicates that the volume of Ethereum sold has slightly increased.The relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the market is near a state of overselling, complimenting the bearish sentiment shown by other indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is still below the signal line and its histogram is decreasing, indicating the bearish momentum is not yet over.Stochastic values are moving in the neutral direction, implying a lack of clear buying or selling pressure. The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) values have been increasing over the period, indicating a potentially strong trending market. Interestingly, the Parabolic SAR value is below the recent closing price which may suggest a potential upward trend.The Chaikin AD Oscillator, which is positive, reflects a bullish trend on the accumulation/distribution line. However, the Coppock Indicator is negative, hinting at a possible downward price movement in the coming days.No particular chart pattern from the given indicators like Dragonfly Doji, Evening Star, Hammer, or Hikkake Pattern has been seen in the given data which would have helped further in predicting the market direction.To conclude, the market conditions for Ethereum over the studied period have been quite bearish but some conflicting signals from indicators like Chaikin AD Oscillator and Parabolic SAR suggest there might be a potential for a positive price movement. The upcoming trend will depend on how market participants respond to these signals and their sentiments about future market developments. It is advised to follow these indicators and other relevant news closely.",

I bookmarked the site and will provide more details in upcoming replies.Hi!  Fair questions.Firstly, its important to point out that we are not predicting price, we are predicting a range of volatility, essentially a probability band of where we think the max and min price for the token would be.So, no, we are not claiming to be 98% accurate at predicting the precise price of Ethereum on a particular day.  What we are good at is predicting when we think there is a higher chance that the price range might move.If you hover over the historical chart title it should show you the formula used to plot accuracy.  You might also find the tooltips on the chart to the left useful, it explains how our volatitlity range and relative value indicators are calculated (which is the data behind the historical chart we are discussing).Here's a Medium article that i wrote about how the LSTM forecast model works.  https://medium.com/gnylabs/introducing-fabian-gnys-new-machine-learning-engine-6f3fefd93839",

For example, the Blue and Green for BTC GNY historical accuracy especially at the pints where they meet seem a little tricky to an eye or some of our eyes (Like me who is to some extent Red-Green color-blind)Maybe using primary colors can help like Blue and yellow and the point where the two meet can be a secondary color Green, or you can just let a user choose the color scheme they want.",

Do you feed new data or is there any tweak to the algorithm? I believe some coins are just wildly volatile since their fundamental changes quickly like XRP after the SEC case, so it is not surprising if your current model failed to stay within 90% like other coins. People should be aware that this 'prediction' can't correctly express any change in fundamental values if I get your explanation correctly.",
