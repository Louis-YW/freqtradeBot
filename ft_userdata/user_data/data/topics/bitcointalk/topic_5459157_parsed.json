  "content": "Hi Folks S9i was working fine apart from sometimes it seemed to break and fans would go FULL PELT for no apparent reasonso in my misguided wisdom i decided to flash firmware and i seem to have bricked it and it didnt work so i have tried all sorts of firmware and braiins and im a bit confused and getting nowhere so i want to start again with a clear head ......Anybody prepared to take me through this in baby steps ?",

      "body": "-You will need to remove the Control Board from the miner (remove the fans, and every cable connected)-Once done you need to extract this : https://file12.bitmain.com/shop-product/firmware/t9%2B%20-SD%20Tools.zip on your SD card. After that, of course, you insert the SD card in the control board.-You put the jumper in the good position as per : https://support.bitmain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019493654-S9-series-S9-S9i-S9j-S9-Hydro-Control-Board-Program-Recovery-You put the ethernet cable in the ethernet port of the control board-You put the 6pin cable from your PSU to your control board-The control board will be powered on. You need to wait at least 90 seconds for the files to load automatically. When loaded, the red and green indicator lights on the control board will blink.-Once done, you access the control board through its IP address, and you flash the firmware you want from the Bitmain's interface (in your case, this firmware : https://file12.bitmain.com/shop-product/firmware/fbfdf7bc-ac9c-4049-abd5-92b8c6af22f0/2019/08/08/22/Antminer-S9i-xilinx-201907311618-autofreq-user-Update2UBI-NF-sig.tar.gz)And that's all, you should be fine",

Yeah it could be a fan issue, but I'm not sure. Are you running your S9i in good conditions? Is the room big enough?2). Here's a list of ASIC repair centers: https://www.zeusbtc.com/RepairCenter/I don't think there are any in the UK, but you could send it to France or Germany perhaps.However, I don't know if the profitability of an S9i would justify such costs, I don't know if the repair would be justified.You can always find hashboards on the internet, on ebay for example, but choose your seller extremely carefully if you don't want to receive a dubious hashboard.No, S9 and S9i boards are not the same, and are not interchangeable.",
