It's really helpful as you can ask questions here about problems and issues you having regarding about crypto industry or Bitcoin. To be honest, the first time you have interacted here in bitcointalk it's more like having an informative information with anyone here or even sharing the same interest for example about political issues, your hard times experiences in serious discussion and many more. Since you've mentioned where you can also earn from this forum which very helpful to get hands on to Bitcoin without even needing inserting money. You'll just have to provide the knowledge and be to contribute more in the forum for you to be qualify. And there's also other services here where you can earn you'll just have to explore it for yourself. This forum helped me a lot, you'll just need to be part of the forum with sharing thoughts and experiences, much better with facts.",

What made the most impact to me is probably bitcoin itself and not the forum, bitcoin changed my mindset about money, didn't know that I wanted freedom in my finances although I don't want to be too attached to material stuff anymore. Maybe I am still finding how this forum impacted me because there's still so much to learn.",

Reading real news channel will make you updated rather than relying on the forum since this place is for discussion and you can’t catch on some thread if you didn’t know the reference topic. Forum is very good place to communicate to other people that shares same interests to Bitcoin since there’s only few people that you knew in real life that you can discuss Bitcoin or crypto in general.Quote from: Salahmu on July 23, 2023, 02:27:50 PMI believe that through this forum so many persons has achieved something, please the floor is yours to share your knowledge and experience on how the forum has helped you in one way or the other.

That's why today any newbie or user who takes here for granted always gets me triggered as I believe there are lots of things they need to seat their ass to learn than just sculpin and rigmarole around the forum without knowing their stances over here.

Some have mentioned the Signature campaigns, which are of course a significant part of it, but there are other things. People discuss a lot of interesting questions here, and I regularly learn something new when reading the threads or doing my own research to respond to some questions. It really helps to think about economic matters from various perspectives and learn things that I now believe people should know, but I wouldn't have known without the forum. I also like the general vibe around here. We have people with very different political views, but the posts tend to be written in a respectful manner, providing facts, links, and arguments to support one's position. In my experience, discussions are of a very different kind and quality on many other platforms online.",

I learn a lot from this forum about how to be secured or how to invest potentially and the latest crypto news. In past I was very to make proper decisions in trading. I was a FOMO buyer and had no analysis based skills and I just did trading like gambling. I have learnt why and how to trade properly, research or analysis a cryptocurrency and many more.

That will prevent you from taking worng decisions. There are many usecases which can't be described in a single post.
