Not only the conversion ratio of the US dollar, but other currencies also have similar regulations.    So,The same is true for the unit of Bitcoin:1μBTC=100Satoshi.    1μBTC is equivalent to a unit of 1 USD. 1btc=30079 US dollars, this is not customary to use,       converted to: 1μBTC≈0.03 US dollars,       The same unit, the same habits, but a brighter future！ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Example: A bag of bread in a supermarket is labeled:   A, $2.                                                                                                                                                                B, 0.00006653 BTC.                                                                                                                                                                 C, 66.53 µBTC.        According to the degree to which the currency issued by each country can be continuously decomposed, it is customary to use the third digit from the bottom as the main unit. For example: 1 USD, 1 Euro, 1 Chinese Yuan, etc.One of the prerequisites for the large-scale application of a standard is that the unit should be unified and easy to conform to habits. Because it is necessary to consider the understanding and acceptance level of the vast majority of people, such as the elderly, children, people with low education and so on. Using such a large unit as BTC, it is too troublesome to represent some daily necessities.                 In addition, considering the total amount of Bitcoin issued, the world economy, and the global population, 1µBTC≈3USD in the near future is just a new beginning。                   I believe it...",

In the first place, Bitcoin is a world different from the US Dollar and other fiat currencies, even the antithesis to them, so I guess it is also good that its currency units are done in a different way. What is perhaps most important in this respect is that Bitcoin is divisible, which is very important in a functioning currency. A single BTC could be divided up to the 8th decimal point.",

Even in case of decimal bitcoin everyone keeps calling it bitcoin because that’s what makes it everyone easier to understand. Micro, sats, are just being words these days. May be due to decimal conversions and little difficult understanding of fiat conversion makes it difficult to use word sats. For example, give me $0.0003 in bitcoin?",

It has no central authority controlling it.It has limited supply.It is global.and more.Why shouldn't its unit be any different? Although it is not different  the way you think.

All we need are the typical front-end app wallets(and things like CMC and CoinGecko) to collaborate and switch to sats as default. As Bitcoin Core already uses sats by default on the back-end anyway.If arithmatic is involved anywhere, calculations will already be being done to convert sats to btc, at most it probably means deleting a line of code or removing a symbol (potentially a database reset too but probably not). I think the main problem with doing this would probably be the rivalry it produces over what decimals to use. The lightning network (purely as an example) uses pico, nano, micro and milli in it's specifier. I would assume the satoshi came from the idea of bitcoin having at most 16 digits that way (the <21000000 being the first 8 that could possibly be represented up to). Electrum preinstalls with mbtc seleted, I don't know if that changed but I think we could expect it to become bits and then sats whenever their devs seem it appropriate (bitcoin core comes preloaded in btc still though afaik).",

Bitcoin's default high unit price gets a lot of newbies to buy \"cheaper\" (shit) coins because of the \"bitcoin is too expensive I can never get 1 full bitcoin\" narrative. Using sats as default on almost all platforms fixes this.That, and if we want to put more emphasis on bitcoin as 'money', paying \"17k sats\"(hopefully far lower in number in the future) is far better than paying \"zero point zero zero zero seventeen BTC\" for a cup of coffee. Using decimals is horrendous UX.Obviously it's going to be extremely difficult because it's going to need mass consensus and a lot of organizing, with preferably with most platforms switching to sats at a certain exact day and time. But yea, tbh if I was a famous bitcoin personality(that's rich enough to not need to work a day of my life), I'd spend most of my time pushing this narrative.
