With a population of over 54 nations, many of which are densely populated, Africa is the second most populous continent in the world. It is challenging to determine the accurate population of Africa because each of these nations has its own unique demographics and dynamics.In estimating the African population, there are few reliable statistics. Since many African nations have limited access to data collection and processing methods, the information they do have is frequently stale or lacking crucial information. Secondly, it is challenging to precisely track population migrations, births, and deaths in many African countries due to the lack of accurate demographic records.

This implies that it is challenging to determine accurate population figures for Africa.I have basically 0 knowledge of how they do a census in Africa, or if there's any scientific method at all to learning the population of Africa.  I would however believe that the population numbers are hilariously wrong.  Not just for the challenge of tracking population, but because the birth rates in African countries are as much as 5x higher than birth rates in some Western countries.  I could see scientists not taking this into account and sticking with their estimates as if they were correct using Western standards.  Africa is quite a bit different than the rest of the world and as smart as scientists are, they can be pretty dumb when they all get on the same wavelength.  Look at the vaccine.  Any self thinking individual could tell that was going to backfire, yet plenty of liberal scientists are still saying it's the right thing to do.  These idiots will literally make fun of anti-vaxxers until they fall over and die from their rushed unsafe vaccines.  I doubt they can accurately count a continent they don't even understand or step outside their established population models to think for themselves.",

      "body": "The way I see it, the African population should be estimated first at local level, then nationwide and then it would be matter of adding numbers. Because how things are evolving around the world and the role of Africa as continent, i would not give much attention to general population estimations there, and rather just collect the information necessary to give people of those countries the opportunities they need to work for their motherland and improve the economy. There are other things which are priorities.Also, assuming the African people is wrongly estimated, would not that mean there is people in some countries of Africa with out identification documents or birth certification ?",

This implies that it is challenging to determine accurate population figures for Africa.In my country, the population of various states is politicized. Each state or region always overestimates its population so that it could be used to manipulate electoral results during elections. It is also estimated because it would be used as a strong bargaining tool during revenue allocation. The census results are always manipulated to favor the tribe of either the sitting president's region or that of the governor. Some Africans don't have access to hospitals which has led to many unregistered births and deaths. But many governmental and non-governmental organizations are focused on carrying out reliable analysis, estimation, and prediction of the population of Africa.All these factors have led to inaccurate or lack of data to correctly estimate Africa's population. I am sure Africa's population would keep increasing due to its cultural and religious beliefs.",

This is in addition to the fact that many regions in Africa live in semi-isolated tribes and ethnic groups that are not able to enumerate death and birth rates, and therefore it will not be possible to determine the percentage of life expectancy at birth.I believe that the data that comes out in the official reports is based mainly on speculation drawn from statistics that date back to ancient times, including the colonial era.",

With lack of availability to correct and accurate statistical data due to inaccessibility to local areas, the actual number of populations in those regions can’t be determined correctly, it will only be based on assumptions. The birth rate there is increasingly high with people not paying attention to birth control policy.

People die as much as they arr been birth. Not to mention, there are tribes that aren't accessible (either landlocked or are just left alone because they haven't been contacted).Quote from: OgNasty on January 13, 2023, 07:05:14 PMI have basically 0 knowledge of how they do a census in Africa, or if there's any scientific method at all to learning the population of Africa.  I would however believe that the population numbers are hilariously wrong.  A head-to-head count is what goes and the results are always going to come out wrong due to factors as stated in OP. These counts aren't done all at once and as to the fact, some persons are usually not available at the time, some others are counted twice and some others aren't accessible. Hence, we just rely on estimates to get a possible result.",
