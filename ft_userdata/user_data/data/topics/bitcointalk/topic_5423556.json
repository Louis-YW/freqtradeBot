Since Bitcoin has survive for multiple big crash and FUDs around of mining until now, there's only a tiny chance Bitcoin would die, this mean Bitcoin will likely to recover and create new ATH after the market already back.QuoteCollect potential Alts Bear market.This is a bad decision, there's many alts will become a dead coin during bear market. There's no such potential alts, a scam alts can have an interesting whitepaper and have a good roadmap in order to trick investors.",

When all the altcoins get is pump and dumps, it is best to treat them as short term risky trades rather than long term investment you should buy and bag hold.",

      "body": "I guess it is too limited to categorize everybody in cryptocurrency as either traders or investors. It's as if cryptocurrency is not a currency at all. It's like treating cryptocurrency as stocks. I guess this is a wrong perception of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, for example, is a currency that gives us freedom from banks and other third parties, a currency that requires no trust. Bitcoin is a transparent, immutable, and censor-proof currency. And it is very possible that many are drawn into Bitcoin not because they want to trade or invest in it but because the features somehow empower them. Anyway, in terms of investment strategy, HODL is the best for me. And if you have the extra money every now and then, you can also buy the dips.",

You could call me an investor. I don't usually trade, instead, I buy in a dip when I believe it is a dip for me. And then I'll sell it when I've made a good profit. To be honest, it's difficult for me to make money from trading. As a result, I decide for a medium-term investment.",

They are also a part of this industry as well as gamblers (which are also included because they are using cryptocurrencies on their transactions). But in terms of investment strategies you could also add scalping wherein a trader/investor would jump on a particular price (regardless if it is bear or bullish run) as long as there is a potential market price movement. Pointing here that we may have different market strategies but having the same goal which is to earn profit. Unfortunately, the idea of profit is being too emphasized towards non-crypto users which makes them unrealistic of how money is being 'created' in this industry.",

Let us not forget we are also moving towards more harder recession world wide which is going to shock the market one more time and have bad effects on the investment that we make today.

Because of that, the best to invest on is bitcoin, but not bad to make good research on some better altcoins and allocate like 30% of your money that you want to invest on crypto on them while the 70% can be allocated on bitcoin investment.
