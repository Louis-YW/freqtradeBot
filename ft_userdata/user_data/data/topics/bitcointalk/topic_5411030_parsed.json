I'm not sure if it's just for some countries, that there's a bias towards those that have finished degrees and those that didn't. From what I've watched in first-world countries, many successful folks didn't finish college, and yet they're living the best of their lives with their careers. Future-wise, if you think that you'll be having a good life and career by finishing college and getting a degree do it. But if you think that success is already at hand and you can no longer wait to finish your studies, you choose your path just like the successful people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.",

There's a lot of things you can learn on school and one of it is discipline and also on how to properly read also to write if you don't do this basic things for sure many people will exploit you because they think you are uneducated person.So education is important but still it all vary to the person who do their job to enhance their life since at the end of the day if the educated person is lazy he cannot reach his want to be a successful person.",

Yes education is important but not to the level to depend on education to be rich or that you have to be a professor to be educated. All that everyone needs is that kind of little education that can help you read and write and understand what is going on around up and open you up for opportunities. Being educated doesn't mean you need to spend all your live doing that but it is necessary, the illiterate rich find a way to have some level of formal education to be properly suited and contributory to the society.

But we must also note that there are some profession that requires formal education or certification. Therefore formal education cannot be pushed aside. The problem we have in Africa is that everybody wants to be a university graduate. The reason is that the government and private sector favors paper qualification than skills. Most job vacancies in my country requires a university degree. This has made even people that has no business going to the university to begin to seek and gain admission into the university. In the university they engage in all forms of malpractices and  corruption to get the certificate. When they graduate they become unemployable because most of them should have been entrepreneurs, technicians or artisans.",

But really, school and education ain't everything, bit also once you can assimilate mathematics, logic and physics, finance, accounting,and law,  I feel you're good too go. School really isn't everything, I look at the world Billionaires and how many finished university ? Lol.Investing in oneself, investing in crypto ( Bitcoin ) understanding technology and becoming a builder are something's one needs in this era, because going to school with the aim of coming with good grades and end up being employed with folks you're far better than  intellectually.  In Africa, before you learn about anything, go learn about your history before the white man came, to Africa and how it all was before slavery, you should know how strong you're and not feeling inferior of oneself. Out History this day are no longer taught in schools why ?If you have gone to university completely, done the Nysc and back to the streets with a big file looking for a $20 dollar to be earned at the end of the month after being employed then you'll know school really sucks in some part of Africa. Ain't sexy mate! One should really look for what he has passion for too chase, been successful takes time as one needs discipline and consistency in his/her field. But all this are just hard to bring in Nigeria and some African countries. Govt really making things hard, you have to leave this ends to achieve all of your passion and dreams and making them reality.",

Education has proofed to be important to the extent that those billionaires after getting to the apex of financial freedom, they also crave for another freedom that education give. They go to school to acquire either the education with certificate or to acquire formal knowledge apart from that they they had from their financial skills backed up with certificate.

You have misunderstood education. Education is just being smart people.Don't expect after you get a big degree from education and get a decent job from the state, because so many people have big degrees while the needs of the country are few. Of course you have to compete.So what is the function of education?You dare to talk about investing because you have an education. People who do not have education will not understand investment, let alone crypto investment which is full of risk of price fluctuations.People who have higher education, they think about creating jobs, not looking for work.Actually the right sentence is, a diploma does not prove someone is smart, but a diploma only proves someone has attended school.",
