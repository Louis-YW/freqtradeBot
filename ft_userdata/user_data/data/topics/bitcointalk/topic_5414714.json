  "content": "🐕 🥳  Welcome to Dogermint! 🐕 🥳 We are manufacturers, retailers & collectors of digital collectibles for the blockchain age.Thanks to the rebirth of the Dogeparty platform in Oct. 2021, access to OG tokens minted on the Dogecoin blockchain in 2014 was restored to their owners. The problem is, almost nobody from the original DP days kept their seed phrase. Therefore, ancient Dogecoin assets are scarce -- scarcer the Counterparty tokens, which have been minted & in circulation since Jan 2014, and way scarcer than Ethereum NFTs, which came years later.Why is this a big deal?The Historical NFT movement that started last year has put these tokens in high demand. As a result, Dogermint has sold thousands of tokens over the last year, repurposing old tokens with new, original artwork to create a special breed of NFT that is unlike any other. Most tokens start for sale at extremely low prices, relative to other tokens of the same era (Aug 2014). For example, the first 200 GOLDENSHIBEs went on sale for 15 DOGE each. They now command a minimum price of 2299 DOGE via Dogewallet dispenser.Other popular Dogermint releases include HAPPYDOGE, SUPERSHIBE, DOGEQUARTER, DOGEDOLLAR, BENGALS, and STELLA.How do I get them?The first thing you'll need to do is download a Dogewallet which is a highly-secure Dogecoin wallet that also has support for Dogeparty tokens. For a complete guide on how to use the Dogewallet, click here. Next, you'll need to deposit some DOGE in the wallet. Then you'll need to send some DOGE from the Dogewallet to a Dispenser address. The token will be automatically sent to your Dogewallet address -- no escrow necessary!What tokens do you currently have up for sale?A list of tokens being dispensed from official Dogermint dispensers can be found here. It is also possible to buy Dogermint tokens from non-official dispensers (from other Dogeparty users), as we are no longer publicly selling many of our original best-sellers. Links to our open dispensers can be found in the post below and will be updated as new dispensers open and ones that have sold out close.How do I know these are legit?Dogeparty tokens are featured in a number of timelines, Discord groups and Wiki Pages run by \"NFT Historians\" who have sifted through mounds of NFTs to come up with a collective assessment of which tokens have bonafide historical records. The Historical NFT investment thesis postulates that these NFTs will retain considerable value compared to newer NFTs, of which already exist in near infinite supply, as their underlying token was minted long before most others -- before the term \"NFT\" ever even existed.We've been highly successful since we started and have no plans of stopping or slowing down. Our public NFT sales records can all be verified on-chain and all our dispenser sales are tracked on the Dogermint home page. Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need help getting started. The world of affordable ancient assets awaits!Other ResourcesDogeparty Official HomepageDogeparty ANN on BitcointalkJake Gallen's Dogeparty Resource DirectoryJP Janssen's Dogeparty Asset TimelineOriginal on-forum sales announcement can be found here.",

Dogermint Starter Pack (1000 DOGE)(sending 1,000 DOGE to this dispenser address will trigger the sales of all six tokens, plus the “pack wrapper” token)This is a limited edition collection of 6 different Dogermint tokens, containing 133 tokens in all. Each pack contains:– 1 HAPPYDOGE– 2 SUPERSHIBE– 10 HAPPYSHIBE– 10 DODGERDOGE– 10 WEBCOIN– 100 COUNTERDOGEII. SHITCOIN (100 for 3 DOGE)Shitcoin, also known by its full name, “Shitcoin 3.0”, is a Dogecoin token made with the Dogeparty protocol. The token was created on August 15, 2014 and an announcement was launched for it on Bitcointalk on the same day. The goal of Shitcoin, as per the initial announcement post, is to be the best shitcoin out of all of them. Given the fact that thousands of shitcoins currently exist, this will be no easy task, but we sure can give our competition a run for their money!Shitcoin is also a historical collectible in its own right, with (Ethereum-wrapped version) sales taking place on OpenSea for as much as 0.035 ETH. Created only two days after the launch of Dogeparty, it is one of the first tokens to have an image associated with it, albeit not attached via blockchain entry until October of last year. Thanks to the birth of the Historical NFT movement of last year, Shitcoin has enjoyed resounding success, with nearly 500,000 purchased in the first six months of sales!",

I could wrap next bull market bc those I disagree with your community ethics toward people discussing money and me figuring answering was ok considering when they asked me about such you were around -  I can wait and wrap for 4-5x that. remeber how much you sold wrapped stuff around superbowl lol.However, the fact is I do not want a refund. I held them knowing you got all the good wrapped markets before the Fed rate hike \"crashed\" all these markets for fiat liquidation seekers.I will hold hopefully assuming you are still #1 focused on profit under the veils of a open source immutabile and freely discussing community. No one is buying these right now - so you figure if 3 people ask me about Monary bc they can't purch or are tapped out and the market is as well maybe you let them discuss adopting strategies from our Japanese friends. I'm sure if you treat people like you treat me after buying things with my DOGE when it was worth more and more expensive and held to show support you won't make 100% enemys - but these will make some money after all the opportunity cost I've lost here.It's a shame too because if you listened to me, you could hav a community that doesn't stop with the last asset u made in 2014 on a scrypt coin which doesn't get the robust security from the Bitcoin and Namecoin mining but is a very profitable Wal-Mart for NFT's where Bitcoin, Counterparty, and many of the ones you wish you listened to in full are going to be the Royalty just like when Pokemon hit the US...Because their origin is special, it's not in an email, its not a mailing list, its a very last censorship resistant work around textboard in censor shit crack down 2000's Japan. The servers were set up while an IT specialist was enlisted in the US army and the company too. The Server operated across the pacific and gave censored Japan 2channel... The birth of free expression of a very traditionally artistic and beautiful culture. 2ch from 1999-2015 was a place the US never gave up their data for requests from the feds in Tokyo and Jap anonymous posting gave people personalities back. And 8 days before Watanabe announced on the main text board 2channel 2ch \"2ch.net\" that 1/1/2014 Japan would get its own national virtual crypto currency with the meme Mona from 2ch lore that the greatest hidden gems in crypto had become public.So I'll wait. You know your Shibe name. DOGE - it came from 2ch. Billy Markus just copied the code from Devtome. Yet you treat me like shit for raising money for the future of supporting our wiki, our software, and being around as people like BillyM2k post as devs til their secret book is gone by wekkel.I am so SORRY you didn't audi (well barely correctly) enough money. But you getting on me for helping your community answer ? in a convo they started before I logged in and after you ask I deliver - I even run campaigns and I got you a XID your DOGERMINT store on the true Web 3 with Bitcoin NAmecoin backends, and polygan login Web3 on the front end in games stores oncyber like worlds... I did it free. You need to get your head straight. When you run out of dispensers to sell think about how much you've ever given to Devcoin. The source of your current project. That's right. Free docs. I bet you don't even follow our @devtome twitter. Give it up for Doge rich to throw people trying to give others the chance DVC gave u who profit off DOGE for FREE the same way Billy copy and pasted poor Weekel without even a contributor shouldout in src code to the devtome team.You're not getting it for that. I will sell while I wrap. In fact I may make them better and sell for more. I can just ask some friends who appreciate people who work for $0, donate what hey do sell for their devs hours. And you know what they are now? They just took our lead dev home from Devcon 6 and we had like 8 VC meetings. Will that change me no. But you treat me right, you should be thankful I keep your community informed while you're not monitoring their length monaparty discussions if u want a better control over peoples discussions.As for your Xaya Name, that's your brand. You web 3 ID, your account inventor attached to it in each world, you keys to every door and metaverse. You scores for each cross grid game. Keep it - you would'be been more likely to get me to take your money if I believed you ethically wanted to help a project that led to yours being possible. $300 GOLDENDOGES... ride it while it lasts.Thanks tho for shunning my FOSS funding for Devcoin's sold front end dev to create a Metaverse portol now that Syscoin is advising us more and more. Then calling me a cheat.",

The campaign ended a few weeks ago.* For the record I don't have a refund policy -- that was a special offer for you only... nobody has ever even complained about the value of their tokens... pretty sure everybody knows the risks involved when purchasing blockchain-based tokens. These ones, BTW, come with no promises -- no roadmap, no staking pools, no rewards, airdrops, or guaranteed utility. They are simply vintage tokens with artwork or images attached to them.

      "body": "I was thinking about ways to make these tokens more permanent; mainly relying on a decentralized storage solution that will always be up & running. The best (and least practical) way to make this happen would be to embed the images within several transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain, linking them together in a manner similar to recursive inscriptions. Another way to do this would be to upload them as Ordinals on BTC, or else go full Arweave, which is way cheaper but will it last... hemm... haww...Anyway, not relying on imgur is the main goal. Although to its credit, imgur has been around longer than Bitcoin itself.",
