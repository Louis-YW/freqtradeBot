Doesn't this question the intention and intergrity of such exchange? Source: https://twitter.com/simontwits/status/1706233240535674886?t=Wiz_7Dj4HIKZKkDKETKaCw&s=19",

Woah I really didn't know about the PayPal halt too. To a large extent yeah, I'm now realising that these regulations aren't that easy to comply with. At the end of the day it is the investors in those regions that gets affected when these exchanges exits their markets as they're now saddled with the responsibility of looking for an alternative exchange.",

You are on point and thats why i feel Ben will need to release a statement explaining why the sudden exit. If like you pointed out, a fellow top 5 derivative exchange is still operating there without issue then we deserve more explanation.A similar same scenario played out in Canada and while Bybit and binance left Gracy Chen's team decided to stay back.",
