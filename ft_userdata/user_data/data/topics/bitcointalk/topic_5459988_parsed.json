People invest in it and some people store it long term.",

      "body": "Many people tried creating digital currencies in the past, kinda like centralized ones, but they all failed. But then came Bitcoin, with its blockchain as a public ledger and Proof-of-work verification process. The reason it is so popular today is that it is decentralized and nobody owns it or controls it. That is precisely why it survived and thrived while the others bit the dust.So, the thing is: if Bitcoin ever loses its decentralized nature, it would basically be game over for it.",

But I'm seeing that the Force of Bitcoin today to stand is because is a decentralized currency.Your theory of understanding is correct, and that's a reality that people are mostly into Bitcoin because of its decentralized nature and even Satoshi went to stealth mode only to make Bitcoin 100% decentralized and free from any kind of interference from anybody. Even in 2023 no one is able to have any control over Bitcoin because it's free and open-source, and the miners are the ones who are giving their electricity to the process of mining and completion of blocks in the blockchain.The growth of Bitcoin as a digital currency is mainly because of its decentralized model and that's why it's gaining growth in value and the amount of investors. No body is able to stop the growth of Bitcoin because it can be used by anyone without any interference if it's used in its decentralized way, however if someone is using it via a centralized exchanges then things are different for that approach. I think you should read more about Bitcoin because you seems to be a person who wants to learn about this technology in depth.",

It's the same as if the system became reversible and you could cancel or alter any final transaction to your liking. That's not Bitcoin. Even getting rid of PoW is a direct attack on the infrastructure that secures the blockchain and has kept it reliable in all these years.",

This has given bitcoin the value that it has now and there is nothing anyone can do to change this. It has also made government to hate bitcoin because it didn't give them access to have control over bitcoin. So many shitcoins are crashing these days because it is centralized and can be manipulated by the dev. Decentralization is the key to financial freedom which bitcoin has given to its users.",

For instance, using centralized crypto exchanges is very common, and despite warnings, people often keep a lot of money there because it's convenient to them. Some also use custodial wallets because they don't care that it technically poses a rick of an exit scam and similar things.Another Bitcoin's advantage is that it can be used as an alternative to a bank, especially for international transfers. International transfers can sometimes take days and have a significant fee, but Bitcoin transactions can happen much faster and, if the sum is high, at a much cheaper fee. Also, where's no requirement to enter a lot of data and wait for an authority's approval.",

The centralized currency already exists in many different forms from fiat that we use day to day to online payment systems like PayPal. Each are solving a problem and providing a useful utility hence they have a \"value\". Creating another centralized currency can only be useful if it actually provides a useful utility. In fact this is one of the criticism of the CBDCs that are the hot topic these days, they don't seem to offer anything new.In comparison bitcoin as the only decentralized currency offered a new form of money that didn't exist before.

With buyers and sellers placing their Bid/Ask in demand and supply, the currency appreciates or depreciates.Decentralization of bitcoin adds to its securities and becomes one of the reasons why it’s the most trusted amongst others and have stood the test of over a decade and some years.",

The decentralized nature is at the core of what makes bitcoin different and unique.The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is a concrete feature but we must admit that that is not the only reason why Bitcoin has thrived.Fiat is not useless. It's still a store of value. Majority of the world still use Fiat. Less than 5% of the world population own crypto. So how many of these will be for Bitcoin? Besides, a good number of those using crypto still use fiat. And the over 95% of people in the world use Fiat as a store of value. If Bitcoin was just a decentralized currency and it cannot be invested then I doubt it would as successful as it is today. So it's right to say the decentralized nature and the investment nature are the things that make Bitcoin successful.",

Although he is the one who created it, I don't think he can make bitcoin centralized. So it is tough for the government to figure out how to control bitcoin. But the future is unpredictable, and the technology is constantly evolving, maybe in the future someone can decrypt bitcoins.

Likewise with countries like El Salvador which have also adopted Bitcoin, making Bitcoin more preferred by many people and experiencing additional users every year.
