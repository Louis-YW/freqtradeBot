  "content": "When I started my investing journey, you could buy a share of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for around $69,000.  At the time it seemed an amount so high that there would be a small chance I'd ever be able to own one.  It was the holy grail of stocks.  Since then it has risen more than 5x to it's current value.  However, seeing Bitcoin's meteoric rise and bright future makes me think that purchasing a BTC for below $20,000 now might in the future lead to being able to trade it for a share of BRK-A (currently around $400K).  The day that this happens, I intend to swap 1 BTC for 1 share of BRK-A.  I thought I'd open a thread to look back on this journey as well as open the floor up to others to discuss this idea and the potential for this to happen someday.  I think 2025 would be the absolute earliest and even then, 2029 seems more likely.  BRK-A: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRK-ABitcoin: http://bitcointicker.co/October 7th, 2022:BRK-A: $405,668Bitcoin: $19,470Difference: ($386,198)",
