  "content": "Hi all. Thinking of purchasing an S19 Pro or similar. I’m basically wanting to upgrade from my S9s but i’m worried about reliability. Would you say they are better than S9s? Do they like being turned off and stripped for a monthly clean/blast of compressed air?I would basically be replacing approx x8 S9s but as you know these are relatively cheap. I have to clean monthly as my location seems it even with dust prevention measures in place. Are they ‘better built’ than S9s as I think they only have chips/heat sinks on one side of each board. I also presume the noise levels will be drastically reduced by one S19 to several S9s. It’s a big investment for me so I need it to last. What’s peoples opinions please. Thanks.",

      "body": "Depends on the conditions. High humidity (but still below specs!) will ruin the temp sensor on the farthest board in a year or two. Applying protection on the temp chips (nail polish type) probably solves this. I guess air particles are collected here by airflow + the humidity eats away the temp chip's legs.Otherwise, S19 reliability is way better than S17 and even S9 which was highly batch dependent.",

      "body": "The best efficiency record i have seen so far using Braiins OS+ is indeed with the S19j Pro 104T producing 64TH consuming 1343W. (20.87 W/TH) which is better than the XP using factory firmware.It was set to Power Target 1616, HOT temp changed to 60C and Dangerous to 70C with dynamic scaling enabled with a step of 200W.Theoretically with two of these you can surpass the XP:Single XP 127T 2730WTwo jPros: 128.6T 2686WFYI: S19 Pro has the chip BM1398 and the j uses the BM1362 while the XP uses BM1366. Silicon lottery varies the results of the individual chips the manufacturer decides to put in your hashboards, but the general trend is that their higher speed rated models are more efficient (better yield) than their lower ones. So as we have already seen for years, getting the fastest one running low gives the best efficiency results.As for reliability, yeah its much better than the S17 disaster.For comparison, the best results i have seen so far with the S19 95T doing 24 W/TH (80TH 1965W), and the S19 Pro 110T doing 26 W/TH (92TH 2415W).",

Same production line 2 days later with chips from a different sheet you could be off by 5%.The only  way to insure the best chips is to have them bin tested one by one before you assemble the gear.That is not done for a miner on a regular basis.",

      "body": "From what i understand of the chip manufacturing process (since the CPU days) they are in fact all tested individually, and some pass at certain speeds while others don't but work with lower speeds (same voltage) and then are classified according to their \"yield\".My guess is when they assemble the hashboards, they mix them to roughly achieve the desired overall speed rating per hashboard. Naturally you are going to have fewer chips of high grade than low grade. This is another reason they introduced the \"auto\"(tune) in 2017 when the option to manually set the speed disappeared from their fw, it makes more economical sense.And when the low yields start piling up, lower speed models appear in the market.",
