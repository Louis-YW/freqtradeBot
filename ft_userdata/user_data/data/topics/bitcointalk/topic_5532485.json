      "body": "The very first step and also most important is to understand \"It is your key, it is your bitcoin\" so that people will see it is too vital by choosing a good place to store their bitcoin.It is in non-custodial and open-source wallets. Because with those wallets, you have keys of your bitcoin and you actually control your bitcoin.Other wallets are custodial like centralized exchanges, Bitcoin Spot ETFs are not non custodial wallets so no private keys for you. If you want to have bitcoin from those platforms, you will have to submit your withdrawal request or redeem request and get approvals from them. If they don't approve your request and refuse to give you bitcoin, you will lose your bitcoin.It is vital and definitely most important step.",

It is advised to invest for the long term because that is where bitcoin can be the most profitable however this does not mean that other ways of investing should not be considered at all anymore as it all depends on yourself anyway whether you find short term or long term more preferable at the moment. Some people even do both to fully maximize bitcoin so just learn which one would help you the most.",

Bitcoin is the only game we can all win at the casino.And all it takes is a single mistake to lose it all, hence my disagreement with Michael Saylor on this one... I really hate seeing influential people portray Bitcoin in a way that nothing bad can happen to it and unfortunately, there are enough tech-illiterate people out there who might believe there's no risk for it to ever go south [e.g. scams, hacks, user errors, its volatile nature, etc...].",

That is because the supply of gold is unlimited. It took gold 40+ years just to triple in price, while bitcoin often doubles or triples in price in just one year. As marketcap and adoption increases, bitcoin volatility will go down. But unlike gold, the supply of bitcoin will never increase.",

I can guarantee beginner who knows nothing about Bitcoin and gets to read the first three chapters of this book, that you're going to understand Bitcoin at a very over high level. It connects the different pieces of together and breaks down how transactions works, how they're serialized in broadcasts to the network which allows you to start understanding how anyone can use Bitcoin and how no one can stop the transactions, how addresses were created. Also it covers a private key to a public key to an address all using elliptic curve cryptography and different elliptic curve mathematics and different cryptographic functions and hashes  and it clarified it very simply with many really good examples. At the end of the book, it will leave you feeling more confident in your knowledge of bitcoin. I highly recommend it.",
