Indonesia is trusted to host the U-20 World Cup for the year 2021. The U-20 World Cup in 2021 has been postponed to 2023 considering that it was still busy with the Covid-19 pandemic .However, on March 29 2023 through the official website, FIFA removed Indonesia as the host for the U20 world cup 2023 . FIFA's reason for removing Indonesia as host was because after the tragedy at Malang's Kanjuruhan Stadium which killed 127 supporters on October 1, 2022. The same thing happened on the playing field when Israel fired tear gas at a match in Palestine. The attack took place during the Balata FC vs Jabar Al-Mukaber match in the final of the Abu Ammar Cup at the Faisal Al Husseini Stadium on March 30. Source: fifa.com, the-afc.comThis reason led to various public perceptions, because FIFA never spoke about the U20 world cup after the incident. However, FIFA decided to remove Indonesia as the host after several figures in Indonesia, including the public, refused to allow Israel to participate in Indonesia's U20 world cup 2023 . The decision was taken after a meeting with the PSSI president, Erick Thohir.Regardless of what I explained above.Which country will replace the host of the FIFA U20 World Cup?Which country will win the FIFA U20 World Cup 2023 ?",

      "body": "For now we can't be sure of the host. Among the three (Peru, Argentina and Qatar) now Argentina have submitted its bid to conduct the U-20 World Cup. Mostly Qatar will win the bid, and I predict it based on the country being the host of the last FIFA World Cup. Indonesia have got a good opportunity and it have missed it due to the political conflicts. It is really a big chance being missed and the sufferers will be the young football aspirants of the nation. Now FIFA have frozen funds for Indonesia Football association. It is nice that almost every continent have got similar number of countries participating. I'm not sure of the winning team, mostly it goes to an European country or to a South American country.",

I lived in a place where I can watch some matches live in the stadium if it will happen but it is just like a dream now. Coming up to the question which country will be the host, I think Argentina is currently the most potential one. They are not qualified so they can participate as a host and it will be replacing Indonesia position. Talking about winning chance, it is hard to predict for me as I'm not following U-20 except my own National team but maybe the winner will be one of European teams.",

The host country will automatically appear in the World Cup without going through the qualifying stages. Meanwhile, the fate of the Indonesian team is unclear, possibly unable to play in the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2023 due to FIFA sanctions.Quote from: Bitinity on April 07, 2023, 02:53:07 AMAs Indonesian, it was a very sad news when FIFA decided to remove Indonesia as a host of the U-20 World Cup. Yes. Of course this is a sad thing, especially for a footballer who has big dreams of competing at the world level.Quote from: Slow death on April 07, 2023, 03:24:14 PMlooking at these 3 countries i see argentina as the best destination to organize the world cup, because argentina has always shown that they are a country with a good national teamI think FIFA has other wishes. They don't see which country has the best quality football, but they want to improve football, especially in countries that are still low on that quality. Precisely, FIFA saw such conditions, so it chose Indonesia as the host.Quote from: ryzaadit on April 07, 2023, 04:23:10 PMI guess \"Argentina\" Yes. There was so much hope that Argentina would host. The reason is, Argentina has just won the Qatar world cup, so it needs to raise the U-20 generation on the international stage.",

Personally, I am grateful that Indonesia failed to host the U-20 World Cup in 2023 because the political conditions here are still chaotic and also the instability of Indonesia's relationship with IsraelSome even said that some of the terrorists who were arrested in Lampung had prepared terror for the U-20 World Cup if the World Cup happened and luckily the evil plan didn't happenI hope the chosen host (reportedly Argentina) will successfully run the U-20 world cup 2023 event safely",

I think there was some political or monetary issue involved in that.I am aware of the opposition of Indonesia in not receiving the Israeli delegation in its territory... I respect the disagreements between sovereign countries, but in a sport everyone should have equal rights to participate (with the exception of Russia, which obviously does not deserve the respect of the rest the world for the humanitarian crisis it caused).Anyway... politics and sports are always linked.I wish Argentina does a good job in hosting this competition for the second time.",
