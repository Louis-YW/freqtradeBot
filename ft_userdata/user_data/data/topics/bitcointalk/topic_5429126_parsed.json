Furthermore, how have u learned from it? Would love to see difference in thought. No better place to reach out to than to those who were around before the excitement for cryptocurrency kicked in.I guess it's quite common with new projects or ideas. From my experience, hyped crypto projects/ideas for example tend go through temporal moment of increased interest and patronage from people but this falls massively, they vanish away or are forgotten when it's impossible for them to deliver, even if they do deliver it's typically below expectations. It's alittle similar to how things are hyped in sci & tech world about things people expected will be in use soon...but very little to nothing comes out of them In the end I just do not believe them until I go through the ideas/projects in detail. With my experience so far, I should be able to determine whether their claims are possible or not after thorough investigations.",
