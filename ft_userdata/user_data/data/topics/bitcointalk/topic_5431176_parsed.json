  "content": "I think Liverpool never gave Mané the Honours He deserves all they did was just continue Chanting Darwin Nunez when they signed him as replacement for Mané but the more the games they play the more they see how Mané was significant to their attack and I don't really think Klopp really did Appreciate Mané alot and I guess he also find out hard to accept that  Mané was their Hero.",

      "body": "But I think Mané is not a player who needs this attention or homage.It seems to be important to him what the people from his village or country think of him, he doesn't care about the people in Europe. It may well be that he sees soccer only as a tool to help \"his\" people.If he had put himself more in the foreground, he would have received more attention. He played for Red Bull Salzburg in Austria, a friend played with him, so I still know some stories about Mané - he seems to be very down to earth, almost a bit shy and introverted. Especially the media then tend to pounce on the extroverted players.",
