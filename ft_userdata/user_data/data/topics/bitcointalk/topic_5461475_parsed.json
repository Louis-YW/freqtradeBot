  "content": "Joining the forum in early March of this year was one of the most significant accomplishments I believe I've accomplished in my life. Prior to then, I knew very little about cryptocurrencies and couldn't tell the difference between bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I look for other coins online and on exchanges, and I register with them and purchase different coins in the hopes that my earnings would increase quickly. However, after joining this forum, I've been able to tell them apart. I've learned a lot about security and privacy, and I can confidently explain the concepts of private and public keys, centralised and decentralised exchanges, online and offline wallets, and so on.The forum has been a valuable tool in expanding my knowledge of cryptocurrency, something I will always be grateful for. I was able to learn more about the forum when I first joined it and have continued to do so to this day. I learned a lot about the forum, including the ranks, activity, and do's and don'ts. But because no one knows everything, it is sometimes necessary to ask questions in order to gain more clarity. According to my understanding, the merit can be offered to you by anyone who has Smerits. Smerits are obtained when a user merits you and you receive half of that merit as Smerit, which you can also send out.  If that is how merit and Smerit function, what happens when everyone in the forum distributes all of their Smerits? Because, as a result of this process, the Smerits will one day be exhausted by everyone. But the merit distribution system continues to function; how is this possible?",

Before the merit system was introduced all these must have been thought of and as long as users continue to make posts that are meritable they'll keep receiving merits and so also will their smerit keep increasing the only time your theory of no smerit will work is if everyone decide not to make any post again and move on to other things but from what I can see I don't think that will be happening anytime soon.Quote from: Adams0001 on July 30, 2023, 01:33:09 PM~~~Smerits are obtained when a user merits you and you receive half of that merit as Smerit, which you can also send out.  If that is how merit and Smerit function, what happens when everyone in the forum distributes all of their Smerits?

I could run out of smerits but Im sure one day someone would give me back merits again to gain it. If its work like a token and coin with limited supply and with that burning ratio of 50% deducted per 1 merit then a shortage is possible and merits will be hard to earn and to give due to that.",

It's nearly impossible, as all this possibility has been calculated in the past before the merit system was introduced.I think without merit source being refilled with smerits, there is certainly a possibility of it been exhausted. Let take for example that only 100 smerits is available without any thing like merit source getting refilled then when this smerits is shared out only 50% of it will begets another Smerits  (just like what cryptoadditchie said), in this case 50 left. If the circle continues like that just like halving we would eventually exhaust everything. So the merit from merit sources are actually what is keeping the whole thing from not getting any exhausted",

Whenever the new cycle begin they will get the amount filled with what they are allocated for. sMerits are just numbers it can be increased or decreased by one tap if theymos wants too and since being a merit source is a voluntary job don't expect them to spent their hours to spend their allocated quota.",

I would even say that Smerits has an endless emission, like fiat money or CBDC.OP and other newcomers should not worry about the lack or shortage of Smerits.

If Smerit had been limited, then It probably would have gotten exhausted earlier than now. but it just keeps going.

But the merit distribution system continues to function; how is this possible?The forum has more than 3.5M users, from which more than 100.000 are active. Even without taking merit sources into consideration, the chance for all the forum users to run out of sMerits is extremely low. You'd probably have more chances to win the lottery than to see all forum users remaining without sMerits. Each time you will post a quality material, be sure you will receive merits. So if you will keep being a good forum contributor, don't worry, your sMerits stash will not get to 0 or, even if it gets to 0, it won't keep that value for a long time.At same time, the current 100+ merit sources have a distribution of 30.000 merits each month. This means from start a creation of at least 15.000 sMerits each month. And this amount, combined with all the other existent sMerits makes the situation asked by OP to be highly unrealistic.",
