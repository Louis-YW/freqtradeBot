The Play-2-Earn games market does not stand still; about 596 are already known on this mechanic, of which:419 based on Crypto and NFT;158 are in development;88 contain applications for PC/MAC;506 have a browser-based version of the game or manage game resources through the browser;123 have a mobile version of the game or manage game resources through a mobile application;1 does not include PC/MAC, Browser, or Mobile functionality due to being in the fundraising phase to begin development.And this is information for September 2021; at the moment, this amount is increasing every day. Analyzing each game with the team, we found out that even projects at the development/launch stage have a massive demand in the market, so before the project launches, people buy up NFTs and the project token.Now Iâ€™d love to share a whole dataset (596 data units) for you to download. Yay!",
