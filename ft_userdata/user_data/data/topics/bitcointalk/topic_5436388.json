An estimated 23% of the whole 21 million supply of bitcoins have been lost over time, which by today's price would be around $100 billion. And we can't forget about that software engineer who is down to the last 2 attempts to his IronKey before it totally shuts itself off, so no wonder there's a market for this type of issues.

It used to be (in the 2000s) that you'd only need 8 random characters to have a fairly secure password, now you need more than 13.",

      "body": "Cryptocurrency recovery services, like the one described in the article, aim to assist individuals who have lost access to their bitcoin wallets due to forgotten passwords or other issues. These services may be able to recover lost funds by using specialized software or hardware to crack the password or otherwise gain access to the wallet. However, the effectiveness of these services is not guaranteed and their credibility may be questionable. Additionally, as quantum computers become more powerful, they may be able to break current encryption methods, making it harder to recover lost cryptocurrency. Overall, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan and multiple ways to access the wallet, such as a seed phrase or private key, to minimize the risk of losing access to your funds.",

Bitcoin Wallet Recovery Services - for forgotten wallet password considering the account doesn't get negative trust and many users are recommend this service, it looks reliable and trusted. But if someone is really worried if the recovery service would steal his coin, it's better to ask to experienced user in Web Wallets to brute force the lost password yourself.",

Just prepare better security for your wallet, make sufficient backups, store it in a safe place, etc. Quote from: Sarah Azhari on January 23, 2023, 11:51:13 AMI think to minimilisir the quantum computer crack it is by changes the characteristics and security maybe from RSA-256 to RSA-768?, You might want to read some discussion about it here[1]. What I understand is that we are aware of the risk and will implement quantum-proof cryptography if needed, but the discussion is ongoing. In fact, there have been many threads about it, including this one [2]. Do read them out since they are quite insightful imo.[1] Can Quantum Computer's destroy Blockchain and Bitcoins[2] I don't believe Quantum Computing will ever threaten Bitcoin",

Problem is trust which is not easily being acquired. Proofs as well would be handy. If ever some people would engage to them for the same purpose, I'd suggest doing it not in online transaction to be fair ofcourse and to promote assurance. People may also gamble it out since they won't be having access anymore on their lost wallets. As far as I know it would be hard as long as private keys are concerned. Privacy with wallets is something in this industry unlike with fiat based wallets which can be easily breached or accessed if someone has the knowledge. Just to remind, many people are offering such service but only a few managed to do it and those are in case to case basis, in terms of possibility with recovering your funds.",

These guys, if they are genuine, may not run out of market and they'll keep getting jobs, which will take their eyes off hacking people's account. However, the wait is too long, waiting for 1 year to restore the account is weird, because some clients can lose contact with the tech gurus within the 1 year period, so if the account gets recovered the whole money, including the 20% belongs to them. Hence, getting to such a level in programming means building an app that has all the features required to hack into a cryptocurrency account and that could have taken them a long time to build, why would it have to take upto 1 year to accomplish a task? The article looks like a short guest post with lesser information of what and how they can get this problem solved, still the possibility to get this done is thin.",
