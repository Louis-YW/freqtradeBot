  "content": "At first everything was fine, it looked like a nice office used for withdrawing money. But today (13.10.2023) I was asked for documents without explanation, I provided them at the same minute! After that, they said something inarticulate to me and restored my balance. As a result, the amount of damage amounted to $ 1,500. Please help me figure it out, I really didn't break anything, I just made bets at random, and also played slotmachines. My user is user-3c1888I really hope that Casino 500 has confused something and will give my money backAnd you should be more careful when choosing a casin",

So if they don't want to, the only thing left for the OP would be the legal way to claim his money, and for a change they have a Curaçao license, which is not like if you have a similar problem with the bookie on the corner or the casino in your city and you go to the police station or the court to file a lawsuit. It will cost you more to send a claim to Curaçao than the money they withhold.

You have to reach a third party mediator or the license authority if you believe about your honesty. Every sportsbook ban those users who try to abuse the betting platform. In your case, you were suspected for having connections with the abusers. Either write your complaint to \"complaints@xnext.io\" or submit it to Askgamblers. Otherwise, reach to their license authority.",

I ask this out of ignorance. Is this always the case? Can't they claim damages to keep it?Nope. Far as I know, most casino have it in writing [that the user agreed] on their ToS that if one or two clause were broken, they have the right to confiscate everything. Those who let the \"violators\" get their fund back were doing so as a good-will, not because they're obligated to do so.For this specific case, if we assume that OP did violate the ToS, the casino has right to deny any fund that OP owned, it's there in one of their clause,Quote from: https://500.casino/terms-of-serviceThe suspension or deletion of User accounts shall not entitle Users to any claims for compensation, damages or reimbursement. In case of heavy misconduct, which include, but are not limited to, exploiting bugs, games or security holes, all account balances of terminated accounts are forfeited in favour of 500 Casino.Now, moving to OP's topic, I assume no one invite UserU to this thread?
