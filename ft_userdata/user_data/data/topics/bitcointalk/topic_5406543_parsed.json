  "content": "U.S. Treasury Invites Public To Provide Input On President Biden's Crypto Order!The U.S. Treasury has invited the general public to provide their input on president Biden's crypto order, I found this piece of information online and thought it very useful and one that this community needs to know about.https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/08/2022-14588/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-commentBelow is quote from source.QuoteThis notice invites interested members of the public to provide input pursuant to Executive Order 14067 of March 9, 2022, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.” In particular, the Department invites input, data, and recommendations pertaining to the implications of development and adoption of digital assets and changes in financial market and payment infrastructures for United States consumers, investors, businesses, and for equitable economic growth.The only way to change any regulation is through public comment. What do you think politicians can just go into the regulation and make changes willy nilly?!?! All regulation changes have to go through the rule making process, which requires public comments, and regulatory changes based on said comments. This is the same process of how lobbyist change regulation, THROUGH PUBLIC COMMENT… If you read the comments you can see that almost all of the negative comments are plagiarized copies of one another. These type of comments are from lobbing law firms that have paralegals rewriting and posting them… It’s crazy that we can make worthless meme stocks and alt coins go viral, but we can’t get people to comment on Federal regulations that can actually implement the change we want.We all clamor for a crypto friendly society, I believe this is our chance, I urge us all to click the link below and post your comment of how you feel about cryptocurrency, you can also read comments from other people, I've posted my own comment, go and post yours, lets make this people know that crypto is the future of money.https://www.regulations.gov/document/TREAS-DO-2022-0014-0001 Source:-Reddit.com",

The Americans should translate it as \"hey, we want to have control of this market, tell us how to do it\"If people want to read the comments here to get some fun. https://www.regulations.gov/document/TREAS-DO-2022-0014-0001/commentPeople are really brainwashed",

Because most people are in their ignorant bliss, and have no idea what even to say for a public comment for cryptocurrency order (if they even know what crypto is, or have heard of the concept of public comment).Those who do have a clue are only doing things that keyboard warriors can do, but have no guts to make a change or innovation that requires sweat, tears, and brains.",

What does it attract to us? People with no interest in privacy, in an alternative currency, and in being free of monetary institutions. People who think they can get rich overnight because they heard about buying shitcoins, ICOs, and tokens on Youtube or Facebook between funny cats videos. When the market crashes, you see them all crying because they have lost their savings.That's why we usually say that when the market crashes, it is purged of the weak hands and that makes the market cleaner.Furthermore, speculators are (to me) the cancer of the finance system. We can't expect a fair economy with their way of doing things and the results it gives in everyday life. If this is the case in traditional finance, it will be the same in the crypto industry.And to finally add something I said in another discussionQuoteWhen you think about it, the primary role of banks is to keep our money and then to lend money. Let's not lie, we can criticize them, but without banks our economy would be worthy of the Middle Ages and we would have no perspective. It is through them that companies are created and are able to evolve, that individuals are able to buy their house, and all that.It contributes to the development of the economy, the increase of wages, the development of a population generally speaking.The problem (I call it as it is) starts when money is created by central banks, but is used by banks in speculative markets, instead of being used to finance the economy. In fact money is invented in order for the banks to make a profit. Not to finance the real economy.Now, yes, you can argue that it brings people and popularity and stuff, but it would happen even without them. Sure, it would take more time, but it can't happen overnight. As the saying goes \"Rome wasn't built in 1 day\". Personally, I think Bitcoin will need another decade, if not more.The same goes for Bitcoin's price since it's about supply and demand. Personally, I'm not sure if I care about the price. I rarely check it.",

They only speculate on the potential that regulation might help on adoption. This is arguable considering bitcoin's low chance to scale as a medium of exchange and bitcoin's monetary policy.",
