It is also important to let him know how to protect his coins and also tell him how scammers can come for his bitcoin and not only hackers. Privacy is also what I will let him know. It is important to let him know that trading is very risky because those that know about bitcoin can later find out about crypto trading.",

If someone asks you about bitcoin, it shows that they definitely know you are a bitcoin investor and in investing, profit is the first thing we care about. So I won't beat around the bush with them, and will talk about the potential and profitability of bitcoin first.But then I will tell them about the technology and how it works, what it can bring to us besides profit. We wouldn't invest in something we don't know and don't understand, I think they wouldn't either, so I'll explain clearly about bitcoin technology, how it works, pros and cons of bitcoin...Also, I don't want to be blamed later so I will tell them everything I know about bitcoin, not just the profits    .",

Since with this we can measure if they are really interested and not blinded unrealistic profits came up on their mind especially if they think about Bitcoin is easy quick rich schemes for them.After they know or acknowledge the risk then this is the time that I provably teach those thing that can possibly give them some chance to earn. But only the basic things since they also need to do some research since its not good if they always rely on us since for this I think that they became a better investor if they mixed it up with proper researching to learn more information about Bitcoin.",

Most people are aware of its benefits, so they often ask questions relating to that.And to answer to the question, I will gladly give my response according to what's been asked.QuoteLet's share our best advice and insights for introducing bitcoin to newcomers and how we can help them navigate the complexities of crypto and understand why it's worth their attention.If I'm opportune to lecture someone about Bitcoin, it will be more proper that I start from the financial aspect because that's what concerns most people today. then with time, I can introduce the technical (technology) part in a very simple fashion, like how secure it is, how the transaction works and why it is different from the regular transaction we do through our bank apps.

I could relate and explain to him that, for investors, it's something like digital gold, risky but with the potential for gain. If his frustration is because of banks, well, Bitcoin does allow sending money without middlemen. I don't go all technical unless he seems interested in that aspect. Instead, I try to underline how it is different from regular money, decentralized, always available, and not controlled by any government. However, I will still mention the risk of loss, scam, and advise them to start small, learn a bit more. I'm trying to make it relevant so that they can see how it might fit into their life, not some hype or complicated technology.",
