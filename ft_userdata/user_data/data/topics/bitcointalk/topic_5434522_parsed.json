  "content": "One of the most common and easy ways to profit in crypto industry is to promote affiliate links to online platforms such as casinos, exchanges and micro earnings websites. Probably most of us have already done it in the past, or still do this during the present moment.However, what if you had the reach of 1 million subscribers? Millions of views? And if you endorsed a platform to all those people which turned into scam?That is what happened with some crypto influencers, such as \"Bitboy\", who promoted Celsius:QuoteIn what may have been his most consequential failed tout, Armstrong was one of the most vocal supporters of crypto lender Celsius Network. He first talked about the lending platform in a 2018 project review video. “I do have faith in Celsius and I do believe it will be a successful project,” he said. In the March 2022 portfolio reveal video, he told his YouTube audience that the BitSquad held 25,000 of Celsius’ CEL tokens (worth over $83,000 at that time and around $23,000 as of press time).Celsius froze billions of dollars from depositors in June, and Armstrong said he was one of the victims of the lending platform’s collapse. He admitted during his show that his team “worked with Celsius for years … some partnership stuff.”Read 'em and Weep: Five Crypto Influencers Who Dealt Their Followers a Bad HandOr \"Lark Davis\":QuoteThen ZachXBT made a second allegation, accusing Davis of withdrawing $2.5 million from crypto lender Celsius mere days before the now-bankrupt company froze withdrawals, swaps and transfers on June 12.Davis posted videos with a Celsius referral link as recently as June 10. He had been promoting Celsius with his own promo code, LARK, to his YouTube audience throughout the first half of the year, CoinDesk found. A Twitter user pointed out that Davis promoted Celsius for weeks after he had begun making his withdrawals.Read 'em and Weep: Five Crypto Influencers Who Dealt Their Followers a Bad HandAnd so many other celebrities like Larry David, Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen ( FTX's ambassadors), Stephen Curry, Major League Baseball, Miami-Dade County and athletes who promoted FTX until its very end, although they weren't sharing referral links, but being directly paid by the company.Every celebrity involved in promoting FTX cryptoWhat do you think about these people? Do they have any responsabilities when promoting companies which turned into scam? Should they be held accountable for that? Is it right to profit over your audience's losses? And is there more responsability involved when it's an influent person promoting affiliate links, instead of random crypto enthusiasts sharing their links in social medias?",

Some of them in my country even partner with these fake cryptocurrency businesses to scam the people. The government should make policies that would make customers hold both the company reliable and it's promoters for loss of funds or bankruptcy. These celebrities know that they have great influence on their followers and the want to negativity use thier power to exploit their fans Sometimes I wonder why people listen to these celebrities. Most of them have zero knowledge of the cryptocurrency industry yet thier followers blindly follow thier quack financial advices. I can never rely on the investment advice from any celebrity because they are not well grounded and only interested in thier endorsement benefit. If I cannot research and verify, then I would never invest",

They are going to get a lot more attention then if they stuck me on TV and said buy this car / get this credit card / etc.So they get these famous people to push their services.Once you become a social media influencer  you have to keep paying the bills somehow, so when someone comes and gives you money to push some crypto project you do that. It's just what it is.If you make investment decisions based on that you are going to get burned.-Dave",

Remember Trevon James, who shilled BitConneeeeect on YouTube?   I guess people trusting him got screwed...YouTube has become a shithole and in my opinion, we are better off to avoid it most of the time.",

It can be said that the forum  smaller, so the management will also become a lot easier. Not only bitcointalk but even some of my local forums ban referrer spams.

There are so many crypto gurus and wealthy gurus in general on Youtube. It has really become a very suspicious place to find financial advices. It's so easy to fake a life of richness and success in videos of 10 minutes. Here in my country a scammer financial advisor took a homeless from the streets, who got famous for a depraved situation which gained notoriety on the media, and put him to trade Bitcoin with binary options. Then he recorded videos with this homeless, who claimed to be making 1800% profit trading daily for just one hour.Then exhibited a hypothetical high middle-class apartment purchased for the homeless (through \"Bitcoin trading\" profits), a lot of ostentation in parties, shops and trips...Everything faked and probably sponsored with money stolen by the scammer who managed the homeless. In the end, once the homeless' hype was over, the manager just kicked his ass and now he is back to the streets begging.",

Yes, they may have some genuine followers, but when those followers are deceived by his affiliate links, they will unfollow that influencer. It's quite simple. As a result, we can conclude that they do not have genuine followers. Influencers are paid by the team as well as by affiliates.
