Another example is the RSI, you can set it to send you notification when it reach certain number, like 20 to 30 for oversold while 70 to 80 for over bought. But I understood you though, you do not have to pay for indicators before you will make money from trading, that is true.",

      "body": "Before I choose a tool or indicators I always try to make assumptions. Regarding Bitcoin I made two assumptions long time ago:Bitcoin will not loose it's value (whatever price it has)Whenever Bitcoin's price will go down, it will go up later and vice versaI do not choose cryptos (or other goods) for trading which do not follow at least these two simple assumptions. For me it doesn't really matter who or what influences the price of bitcoin - I always know it's value and therefore I feel quite save. Of course there is no 100%.Following this I choose my Indicators. First Indicator is the macroeconomy. Listen what's happening in the world and what's happening with bitcoin. Look at it's cycle. I need no tool to do that.Next on the short run I take some simple Indicators like MA (7/25 in my case), or 50/200 on a longer run. Only taken for buying. The nature of bitcoin is deflationary or at least stable. My conclusion on this is: His value will increase over time. So it's no problem at all if I can't sell a position, because I know bitcoin's price will rise back again. I know there are more sophisticated ways to do trading / investing. But I like to keep my greed factor as low as possible and just getting some profits every day. It's like driving a car. You don't have to drive too fast, just keep a stable average speed to arrive soon and save.",

There are stages that we must know before actually applying the tool or whatever it's called to analyze the market. Don't let us take the wrong step, I mean prioritize which one we should know first from this trade. What I know is that people who are just getting into the world of trading want to find out quickly, which should not be the time to find out. It would be nice for us to start with the most basic things first before knowing the complicated things, believe me it will help a lot in our trading later.",

OP, I read your PM in my inbox. I believe the best strategy for us plebs is to make our investments by HODLing them very long term in mind. We make less mistakes, and some of the mistakes can be corrected through dollar-cost-averaging. But if you want a more active trading strategy, I suggest \"Index Building\". There was a Cryptocurrency Indexing Building site before called Panda Analytics, but it's currently down. Find an alternative, and post it in the topic if you find one.",
