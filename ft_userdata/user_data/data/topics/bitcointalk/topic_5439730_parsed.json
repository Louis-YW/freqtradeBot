To increase it even further, they can surely move to POS. But I have not seen any such proposal in their blog or in any news yet. So if you ask for possibility, it is possible but if you ask for plan, I don't see any!",

I can't imagine Monero on PoS, it is tantamount to bitcoin switching to PoS, i.e. it will immediately decrease trust and maybe even kill the whole project and there will be a mass migration from this asset. If Monero changes the consensus, it will kill this coin because monero is very often used for private purposes, no one wants a censored private coin.",

I don't think that Monero will ever switch it's consensus mechanism away from PoW to PoS. That does not mean that it is impossible or that it will never happen in the future but i personally just don't think that it will happen. Also there already was (or still is) a privacy coin that also used PoS as their consensus mechanism, DeepOnion.Nowadays that project is already dead with a trading volume of only a few hundred $ per day, but back in 2018 or so it was pretty well known because they distributed most of their total supply to members of their signature campaign and a lot of people from this forum were part of that. So it would be not the first time if Monero would switch to PoS.",

I don't think a privacy coin will turn into PoS as any coin which has turned to PoS despite their empty promises of less energy consumption which are not true as the complete mining electricity is a very small amount compared to what the world consumes and as such these coins never see any success.I don't believe we will ever see a coin like Monero who has changed algorithm a bit of times if I remember correctly like going from Cryptonight to CryptonightV2 and even some other,to change to PoS,Monero is a true decentralized coin different from Ethereum which was always pressured to go PoS and even his creator wanted it and achieved it,after such transition I don't see any success for Ethereum so if Monero devs are smart they would never change to this PoS consensus.",

Else, everything Monero has achieved up to this date will be gone for good. PoS is pure centralization, so I doubt XMR would want to follow the footsteps of other altcoins such as ETH and BNB. If Monero wants to be as strong and resilient as Bitcoin, then it would have no other choice but to remain a PoW cryptocurrency forever. XMR can already be mined by CPUs and GPUs, so energy consumption would be minimal compared to mining with ASICs (if I'm not wrong). Even if PoW consumes a lot of energy, miners can simply rely on renewable energy sources to help protect the environment. Ultimately, the community will decide the path forward for the Monero project. If there's disagreement among peers, then it's likely there will be a new hard fork that will make use of PoS. Just keep mining XMR as usual. Who knows if you'll get lucky someday? Just my opinion",
