  "content": "Influencer Pauly has been accused of serious fraud. After Pauly created an altcoin called Pond0x token and created hype among his followers, he dumped Pond0x tokens among his followers investors. Due to these fraudulent activities investors have faced huge losses which are estimated $2.2 million. This incident proves again why crypto users should not give influencers too much importance and blindly trust their advice. These influencers will one day take advantage of the trust of their followers and take large amounts of money by creating a scam project.Pauly's Twitter : https://twitter.com/Pauly0xWebsite: https://www.pond0x.com/https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x8ad66fb25748af9b94f56824bb2fdf347dc9c618https://twitter.com/RuneCrypto_/status/1684959197526405121Source:https://cointelegraph.com/news/pond0x-token-launch-snafu-leads-millions-dollars-losseshttps://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/pond0x-token-launch-snafu-leads-to-millions-of-dollars-in-losses-3137983https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64c4c120ab98f466e8614555/QuoteDomain Name: pond0x.comRegistry Domain ID: 2784213364_DOMAIN_COM-VRSNRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.google.comRegistrar URL: https://domains.google.comUpdated Date: 2023-05-25T21:43:56ZCreation Date: 2023-05-25T21:43:55ZRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2024-05-25T21:43:55ZRegistrar: Google LLCRegistrar IANA ID: 895Registrar Abuse Contact Email: email@google.comRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1.8772376466",

That's why I hate these centralized altcoins and never recommend anyone to invest in such suspicious projects by being greedy to make huge profits easily.These scams are increasing now because they want funds for upcoming Bull season of Bitcoin. So why you will trust another one when you have Bitcoin to choose? If you still want to make partial investments then why you don't choose top ranked potential altcoins? They are much lower now and will gain surely. I saw several projects who promote to buy their tokens but get crashed by the team. I remember many projects are not just vanished because team sold it all and scammed their investors. So never go for a suspicious or a centralized project any more.",

Even they feed them with literal shit and shitcoins, these followers are the blind ones and they don't mind to follow whatever they say. I just hope that this influencer will get sued and there will be a victim that will come into light and will pursue on what this guy did. Since he's a public figure, anyone from those victims can seek help from the authorities and state what has happened with this rugpulled project that he has made. It's also possible that these victims go with a consensus so that they can file a case against him and so he'll get sued. There's power in unity and if that happens, the other influencers that have been shilling and feeding shitcoins to their followers will see that they can't just do that anymore. I know that there's also the fault from these investors and followers but they've been victimized and blindly attracted to these influencers and misled.",

And this is where big influencers take advantage. Because influencers know that greedy investors will blindly trust them and invest in their promoted projects in hopes of 10x-100x returns. And Pauly and his team have already taken millions of dollars from the market by executing this system perfectly. Crypto investors should learn from such incidents and make themselves experienced so that they can be safe from such scams in the future.",

Another experience added for the crypto community is how so called influencers can be greedy for money. If you check Pauly's Twitter account, you can see how arrogant he is still, even after such a big incident, it seems that these things have no effect on him, he does not even repent.

Everything he did was a win win situation for him, he created a shitcoin listed on Dex and took money from the market without spending any money on marketing. What he has done is definitely a punishable crime, let's see if any victim of this scam takes any action against Pauly.Quote from: nutildah on July 30, 2023, 11:58:01 AMThe chart looks worse than the Squid Games token chart.

Anyway, this is the main reason why I'm not following any Youtube crypto influencer that has a content of like sharing a new project, sharing the pros, and cons of that project etc. because they don't care about the investors getting scammed. At the same time, we can't blame them if we got scammed because they always say with their videos \"Do your own research. This isn't a financial advice blah blah blah.\" This is their magic word so that they will not be blamed if something bad happens with the project they shilled.Overall, just stay away from the coins that these influencers are shilling, or maybe just stay away from them completely.",

That's really good advice, but the world is full of naive and greedy kids who just want what their idols have, which is a luxurious villa with a pool and of course some great car to brag about. However, only cases when someone grabs a few million come to the public, and in fact the biggest scams are those that do not attract the attention of the public, because a few tens of thousands of $ are no longer even worth mentioning.That's why such things should really be regulated in such a way that not everyone can make their own token and put it online for sale. In other words, people should be protected from such fraudsters, and those who do this should be severely punished as a message for all others who think of such things.",

First, they trusted Pauly blindly as a well-known influencer who wouldn't drag them into the mud. The second mistake was that they bought this worthless meme coin that is considered a shitcoin that interacts with the hype. The third is that they didn't read the PNDX currency contract address, whose contract contained a harmful function called _brutalized, which can be used to redirect funds from anyoneâ€™s balance, and addresses can be manipulated. The fourth is their greed which made their first goal to obtain large profits without thinking about the consequences and potential risks.The loss of $2.2 million dollars of investorsâ€™ funds in such a scam currency is a miserable and sad case. This case has topped the headlines of popular news blogs. I hope that people who lost their capital learn from their previous mistakes and do not be attracted by any well-known influencer or YouTuber or whatever his experience, fame, or followers.",
