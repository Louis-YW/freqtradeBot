  "content": "I'm looking at getting back into mining.  I don't have the power or room for a bulk order, so I'm looking for just one s19, any version is fine, but I'd prefer the one that has the easy sd slot access.  eBay is around $1500, so I'm looking in that price range.  Likely will want escrow unless it is someone I've dealt with in the past.What ya got?",

Probably about a year old, with less than a month of run time on them.   I just listed one on eBay for $1750 (to try to offset eBay fees).  Still have two that haven't been spoken for.",
