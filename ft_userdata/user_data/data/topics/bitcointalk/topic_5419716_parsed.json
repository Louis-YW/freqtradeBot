But one thing I know is that if something is forced;most of the time the result won't be good. If I'm on your shoe, I'll take a rest for the meantime and return once I'm calm simply because it is still gambling and no matter how strong your drive is, if you',re unlucky, you won't be able to take your losses back, there's even a higher tendency that you will again withraw from your bank if your 'revenge money' is already lost. Gambler's fallacy, I guess. But if it would work for you, you're free to do so. That is your money in the first place.Quote from: madnessteat on November 07, 2022, 09:29:05 AMQuote from: Fishy001 on November 07, 2022, 09:14:02 AM~snip~You're trying to win back your loss and that's a very bad idea.

That's normal, just be sure to not be too hoked into it.",

You don't need anyone's validation here but I understand that you just want to share what you're up to and what you do.Well, keep us updated on what has happened once the casino where you've lost starts to open again tomorrow.

However, if you think about getting revenge from gambling, this is not the right decision. Because I had a worse experience with the desire for revenge. If you want revenge, you should stop for a moment, calm your mind, let the win be obtained another time with a smaller amount of money. Because in gambling, you don't always need a lot of money to get a big win, so try playing again after you feel calm so you don't lose more money when you lose.",

A lot of people here in my area as I observed are chasing luck and has already lost a lot of money every year than winning despite being in a difficult situation and status of living. Cock fighting, lottery where I was once tried but only won more or less 5 times in just small prizes, card game, cara y cruz and many others. Only one was rumored who won the jackpot in lottery  worth millions but the thing is, that person was already a rich individual he is just so lucky. To OP, I don't think chasing a loss like \"revenge\" will make you lucky the next time you will try your luck but yeah it will just increase your chances though that next \"try\" could also be another devastating loss. Just invest your extra money in crypto. 😁",

And so just like the usual mentality of gamblers, we wanted to get revenge and recoup what we have lost.Anyhow, it's weird though that the physical casinos is closed, usually it runs 24x7, even brick and mortar casinos in our place.Nevertheless, goodluck, I doubt though that you can bankrupt the physical casino, if they see you winning big then maybe they might kick you out for making a lot of money.",
