These tokens are attempt of scammer. clearly you can see the tokens which are scammed are using famous token name and also each token name is their phising website. The aim of these tokens is to decieve wallet owner , when someone see that he got mebox(mobox) and other tokens he will definitely try to swap and for this he will open website and all his fund will be vanished. Quote How can I stop such \"left\" tokens from being sent to me? What do you do with such tokens? you cannot stop , the only way is to just ignore these tokens. I am using Safepal wallet where no scam tokens automatically add. Quote I tried to see these tokens through PancakeSwap and Trust Wallet, but they are not displayed there. Don't try this,why one will send you free token? Sometimes these tokens listed in pancakeswap and you will loss only fee there because no liquidity will be added so kindly only swap your own tokens you deposited or got from bounty/ airdrop (you joined by self). Always check contract address of each tokens and then match with real token, i hope you will never be decieved.  quoting image to reveal it for other users. Quote Screenshot",

If you are uncomfortable then a change of address is needed. Here is also a thread by Pmalek you can read through get some measures on attacks like this You are 100% right about it, scammers will always found a way or will create new wallet to send some useless tokens or small amounts to your wallet address, so that you would become a victim to them. But the best way is to simply ignore them. Many will tell you to burn them or whatever, but they are useless and also very vulnerable, most of them must take you to a burning platform. Which might also be a product of the same scammers, and to burn then you have to connect your wallet. And that's too risky, so simply ignore those tokens and hide them if you can so that you don't have to see them anymore. Never interact with such tokens and be active and educated of the current scams and attacks are ongoing in the market.",

I tried to see these tokens through PancakeSwap and Trust Wallet, but they are not displayed there. Just like everybody suggest, Just ignore those tokens since its useless anyway. You can’t see it on your wallet either unless you import their smart contract address manually to your wallet assets.It's almost impossible to stop receiving these kind of tokens since they are using smart contracts to automatically airdrop all the wallets that holding certain token such as BNB and other popular blockchain tokens. Blockchain displays all the token holder address so there's no way to avoid them unless you don't hold any tokens on your wallet address most of the time then your wallet will be safe from spam tokens. Avoid holding native blockchain tokens for a long time.",

So it is better to just ignore this token since you can't really do anything on this token since it doesnt really have any kind of value so you can really sell it on the market, hackers have a lot of ways to get your cryptocurrency on your wallet, so just dont move this token and completely ignore it so that you could avoid getting hack. It might be an eyesore for most of the wallet users but it's better done getting hacked. I mean there are a lot of this on the market so we can't really do anything about it, I think the wallet itself is the one that needed to do something about it, allowing this shitty token to circulate.",

Your wallet doesn't have a limited capacity that can get filled up, which would require that you empty it. Just leave them be. Some wallets and blockchain explorers have settings that allow you to disable scam tokens or small transactions under a minimum balance. That will make them invisible in your transaction history, perhaps even in your portfolio overview. Check if such features exist in your wallet. If not, don't lose sleep over it.",

You can not get rid of them my own wallet was full of them, and still is, and all I can do is ignore them because they are not harmful but become harmful when someone tries to sell them by connecting their wallets on some swap and end up losing the access of the wallet. So, don't try to sell those tokens, doesn't matter how valuable they are, in the end, they are not useful instead full of viruses which might become a reason for compromisation to your wallet. Just ignore them, and don't do anything with them.Quote from: woobid on September 25, 2023, 01:34:13 PMHow can I stop such \"left\" tokens from being sent to me? You can not stop them, because even if you would block a wallet to not receive assets from but wallet creation is easy and free for the hackers and they can try the attack from a different wallet, then you have to block them all. But there are many wallets like the mixin wallet, which had an option to not receive funds from unknown addresses. But Mixin currently got hacked, so I won't ask you to join them. Quote from: woobid on September 25, 2023, 01:34:13 PMWhat do you do with such tokens? I tried to see these tokens through PancakeSwap and Trust Wallet, but they are not displayed there.These tokens are not tradeable, instead, they can take you to the swaps, like when you will search for them you will see their listing on some swap exchange, and will connect your wallet their to get rid of the funds, but you will also lose access to the wallet and end up losing your own real money.",

You can't prevent these coins from being sent to your wallet, so the best solution is to ignore them. Of course, if they annoy you, you can send them to another wallet, but this will not help you dramatically, since after a while you will receive similar tokens again.",

The coins are in your wallet, but they are not affecting you in any way, so it’s better you just leave them there. The only way you can get rid of coins is to send them to another random wallet, but I think it’s of no use. If you send the current once to a random wallet, you are still going to receive more later, so are you going to keep on sending them to a random wallet? Just ignore them since they are not affecting your main coins. Don’t try to swap any random coin you see in your wallet, since those coins are scam coins. If you try to swap some, scammers might end up having access to your wallet, and they will drain all the coins in your wallet. When you try to swap some, a gas fee will be deducted, and you won’t be able to swap the coin. The gas fee that will be deducted is going to the scammer.",
