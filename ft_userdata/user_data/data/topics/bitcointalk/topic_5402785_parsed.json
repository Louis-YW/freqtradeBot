  "content": "They say you can never be too prepared.I need a few experienced people who have been in the space for years to review our new site, make recommendations, and ask the questions as if you were going to be putting in your own money so we can be better prepared.We want to ensure we have everything covered that gives a clear understanding to non-crypto people of our project.The last thing we want to do is lose them or confuse them. Spend 2-3 hours helping us, and we will pay you $100 in BTC per hour through Escrow.We will pay the same day, and depending on your merit and position; we would be open to paying in advance for each hour.The only requirement is we require 100% discretion. Â We ask that you don't talk about our project to anyone at this time.Thank you in advance.",

      "body": "Actually you can do this for free and just leave the project on the thread and let the critics come and tell you what they honestly think about your project. But since it's part of your condition that you don't want to get anyone to talk about it to the public. I guess this is the type of project that you must be working hard very well and the idea that shouldn't come out before you launch it. The pay is good and I think you'll get more reviews with legitimate people if you post this on the Services as said by Abubhakar. There are actually good reviewers there that will definitely give you the best impression that they've got for your website and everything on this project.",
