Possibility for this to happen if you downloaded the malware which is scripted to automate all the incoming transactions to hacker's wallet.Only download the wallet from https://electrum.org/ and verify GPG signatures before funding the wallet.",

      "body": "There's sadly nothing much you can do if the transactions have been confirmed. Electrum developers can't help you with your issue either. This is a non-custodial wallet.As mentioned above, it seems like you have malware. This is quite worrying though, this is like the third time I see a similar post in the last couple of weeks or so. Did this happen on PC or mobile?",

      "body": "Another thing that you should be careful about is where you backup your seed phrase and the people you give the device you are using. Password your wallet and backup your seed phrase very hidden from people. This may also be an offline attack. Your seed phrase can be compromised offline too if anyone sees your backup. You can add passphrase next time. With passphrase, new keys and addresses are generated. But if you lose the passphrase, you will lose your coins, just like if you lose seed phrase.Very important to be careful of malware. If you have huge amount, use cold storage like wallet on an airgapped device or a hardware wallet.",

On which device are you running Electrum? On a windows machine or your phone etc.?It seems the device you are using is compromised. 2. Also, is your wallet password protected? 3. Another important question: How did you obtain your wallet - which website did you download it from?4. Which version of Electrum are you using?There was a vulnerability in an older version of Electrum that would prompt you with an update request and if you followed through on that it would download a malware version of Electrum.btw, there is a dedicated wallet section on Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=37.0",

But it's not prone to get hacked if you use it as a hot wallet, if you use Electrum as a cold storage, your coins almost 100% secure.",

If yes, when did this stealing after deposit start?Can you remember what might have caused this behavior of your Electrum wallet to begin with?Did you ever enter your wallet's recovery words on an online website, maybe persuaded by some entity without knowing that this is an absolute no-go?How and where did you backup your Electrum recovery words? Ever saved them on an online digital device? Ever taken digital pictures of them?I suspect a compromisation of your recovery words, especially when the stealing transaction appears almost immediatelly when the deposit transaction into your Electrum wallet isn't even confirmed (both are at first unconfirmed until they get mined into a new block). But it could also be malware on your computer or you didn't download a genuine version of Electrum.",
