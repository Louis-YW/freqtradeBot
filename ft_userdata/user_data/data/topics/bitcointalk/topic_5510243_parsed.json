      "body": "Well these are not NFT’s, or changed or added inscription.  All natural satoshis.Just to be clear, these are just satoshis deemed rare and isolated in certain ways.  Satoshis lost in isolating was an early issue.  Now they have ord wallet addresses that make it very safe to move around. Still Fungible technically.  But look at it like collectible Fiat Currency coins.  Fiat currency like USD Coins are still fungible, just because someone collects it for a certain rarity.  Collecting them does not change the satoshi in anyway.  Block 9 450x for instance are from the first bitcoin that was ever mined. So just pieces of the first bitcoin mined, and the first block.  So it is basically owning some of the first bitcoin ever (available). I think the first 10 are in Satoshi’s wallet and should never move.  Still completely fungible, just like collectible USD currency coins are still fungible.  Again not additionally inscribed or nft’s.  Just more rare than other satoshis and they have been identified and categorized just like Coin Collectors have done for hundreds of years.Satoshi did make the software capable of inscribing satoshis.  This is a function of the blockchain software.  Just like all satoshis have a NAME and NUMBER inscribed by the blockchain even before they have been mined it is all predetermined by the BTC software.  There are some pretty cool satoshi names out there (assigned by the BLOCKCHAIN, not some random NFT dev).  Because of the amount of satoshis that will be mined over time there is virtually any name you can imagine.  My name is one first and last.  So are some of my friends. And ridiculous phrases.  All satoshis have names already. You can search all of this.  And this was done by Satoshi not some NFT dev.  It is in the blockchain software.  Some of the Satoshi names are hilarious.  You can search and check wallets and search random names on Ord.io it uses the ordinal software to search the blockchain data.  There are other useful sites too to check your own wallets.I am just trying to clarify, it seems like maybe there is some misunderstanding of what rare sats are. Not NFT’s or added inscription.  All Natural, just separated and grouped to be collected.So if you have rare sats in your wallet you can isolate them for almost nothing.  It is not an costly thing if you use the Sparrow software.  It is a pretty cool thing once you realize Satoshi Nakamoto did this. He assigned names and numbers, and other technical data that by design can make them more rare/collectible than others.Oh and FYI, guys are making MILLIONS selling their rare sats getting like 5000x what they are worth as a single sat and prices are going up.  Again not NFT’s, all natural un molested sats.  You could be holding some and not even know it (but you can check and isolate them). Sothebys auction house sold some rare named sats for like 15k -25k each.  Also there are exchanges that trade them and certain sats have been sold for multiple bitcoin for their rarity.",

If the seller sells the private key (without moving the coins), it would be scam because they will still own those coins and can move them at any time.",

All satoshis are the same and have same value, what the *uck is Rare Satoshi?It does not make any sense of all. If it is Rare Satoshi, does it mean you will not spend it.Satoshis, bitcoins are created for spending and they are all spendable. No single satoshis, bitcoins should be kept forever because they are rare or whatever reasons. Only lost bitcoins won't be spendable.Check if you have any rare satoshiThe scam is like I have 1 BTC created from a block in 2024 and you have 1 BTC created in a block in 2014, and your 1 BTC has higher value than mine. Is it fair?Does it make sense?It's scam.",

      "body": "I personally disagree that certain Bitcoin mined in certain block is special, this whole rare sats is a very speculative market, more like an art business rather than cryptocurrency or even investment. The price range of a single rare sats is extremely wide, like how the Block 9 Satoshis have been selling between $6 and $1,100.  https://magisat.io/category/activity/b9-450Besides my personal opinion the whole concept of these sats being \"seriously valuable\" is still pretty debatable even in the collectible community. Christie's and Sotheby's have featured some, but mainstream appeal and liquidity simply are not as developed as other collectibles or NFTs. Worth being cautious, not jumping in purely out of FOMO without considering how niche this market still is. Investing in rare sats might take longer to see real returns, and the hype doesn’t always match the market stability right now.",
