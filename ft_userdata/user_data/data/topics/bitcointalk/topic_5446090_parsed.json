Someone can not overpower a whole nation, America will never give you that chance unlike Adolf Hitler of Germany and Momoh Gaddafi of Libya, Africans are suffering old deadly leaders who kills for power.A through democracy does not required blood but the transparency of choice of people.African politicians are always desperate to grab power. They don't care how many people will die due to their power-drunk attitude. They promote electoral violence and malpractice without considering the effect on the people. In Africa, elections are rigged while corrupt politicians select their preferred candidates. Unless people are allowed to choose their preferred leaders, Africa will continue to be a mockery of democracy.People may call Muammar Gaddafi a despot but to me, he is one of the best leaders in Africa. I am not supporting his disregard for the fundamental human rights of Libyans but the economy of the country was super. He ensured that no Libyan lacked the basic needs of life. Many Africans migrated to Libya because of its steady economic growth. I am sure these rebels that took arms against his government regret their actions. Libya is currently a failed nation. The leaders in my country disregard human rights and still subject us to poverty and suffering.",

But once they won at the election then you will see their true colors about abusing their power. In my country, people really loved a president that hear the scream for help of those who in need. However, it will only last for not long it just a few months you will see their true colors that they will use their power just to make it right even it will lead to killing people. Let's say for example is the killing of drug abusers (War on Drugs) here in the Philippines due to high rate of increasing of drug addicts in the streets which is illegal. They red targeting people who was mentioned by people who's using illegal drugs. The worst part is they even kill at home in front of their family which lead them to trauma, sometimes rehabilitated users who changed their life and their family who was left by the dead drug users. You can say that it will lessen the rate of illegal drug users but using your power just to make it right by shooting them was never be an option to clear the ratings. This means that even having a peace democracy of people's choice if you elected the wrong leader it will end with bloods.",

I believe that in the best case scenario, you would see your co-citizens as part of your family, but polarization in politics would not allow that to happen. Officially the US is not a dictatorship. However, it's a dictatorship by a group... Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court - and those who pull their strings. Dictatorship might not be the correct term, but Biden is certainly understood to be a king by many people, even though they wouldn't use that term. Watch the video in the links here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445825.msg61953557#msg61953557. Very important.In every family group there are the 'politicians'. Usually these are the elderly, who aren't strong enough to do the 'farming', but are smart from their experiences in life.Family as government doesn't make for strong empire. But it DOES keep internal empire from conquering the people. How? The freer families have freedom. It shows. Those lacking freedom want it, so they force their family government to have it.",
