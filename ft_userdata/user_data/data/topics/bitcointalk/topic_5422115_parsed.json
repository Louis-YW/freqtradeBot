  "content": "There’s a new type of malware, which iterates on the common address swap attack to form a particularly nasty and difficult-to-detect threat. The malware currently uses JavaScript to carry out its effects — hence disabling JavaScript can neutralize it and reduce your browser’s attack surface. This can be easily achieved in the settings for most Chromium-based browsers.Here’s the action flow for disabling it in native Chrome:1. Open settings.2. Search “Javascript.”3. Click “Site Settings” under the Private and Security section.4. Select the “Don’t allow sites to use Javascript” option.More info: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/3-minute-tips-how-to-avoid-this-strange-new-crypto-malware",

      "body": "Well, did you do it though? CMC article is oversimplifying the solution right here. While they should mainly endorse the main solution given in the article, disabling JS is not approachable for a majority of users who are interacting with JS-intensive websites. I even doubt most exchanges are working without a JS. This solution on OP is intended specifically for LocalMonero site, where it is fully detailed and based on https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/y90fwg/psa_weve_discovered_malware_that_replaces_the/. So, to give NoJS advice as the whole solution without specifically applying it into specific condition is a too broad generalization for the users.",

So this is the malware I believe those people affected.People must learn the basic securities of using the internet especially don't clicking some random links without thinking.",

In this case I will reformat the whole PC and start afresh, there is no way you would no that this is the only successful attack that's already unleashed in your PC. I'm done with chrome browser because it's not as strong as the official windows 10 browser and also it's cool to always stay updated, always update your PC from time to time to avoid missing out on new patches and security updates.",

I see a lot of computer users are not really aware of this kind of trick and certainly, these people are prone to malware attacks. Now I see it is everyone's concern and much help others to be aware of the situation. However, this can't be done and rid of them right away, they still have a lot of chances. At this time, even if we use and install reliable device security on our computers, we can't be 100% safe, not at all.",

Sometimes, this malware finds ways to do things that are not good for users.I also see a lot of malware on Facebook so I see a lot of Facebook accounts that suddenly get their accounts hacked because of these attacks.In terms of my experience, I currently do not change anything in my chrome settings every time I open my PC on the desktop.",

For these viruses, it is only necessary to use specialized anti-virus software to remove them. Always check your wallet address before making a transaction, although it takes time, after copying the wallet address, I always check each character of it, I check at least 2 times and then press the send button. Malware is extremely sophisticated these days, so we should be slow but safe.",

Unfamiliar sites or files should not be downloaded in the first place, we all know hackers are doing this since then and if we are going to be more careless then we can expect them to get access on our most confidential files and that might include your personal keys. I'm not familiar about this new Javascript malware though so thank you for sharing this one and I'll run some test now for my PC and make sure that my laptop is free from any harm. Many are paranoid now when it comes to their security, this should always be our top priority above all.",

This is a basic cyber security defense, Being careful on what you are installing and downloading. There's a lot of hackers now and putting trojan into something that a user could possibly install is not really new. Hackers are just improving old method they have and improving it on a way that potential victims wouldn't expect it. I remember that I have a friend who where a victim of the classic copy paste virus before the bull market starts, All of his assets where sweeped and believe me or not he is an IT student which obviously know more about computer than the average users. We tried to locate where does the virus came from and I promise you that we couldn't figure it out. Hackers are just being smart day by day.",
