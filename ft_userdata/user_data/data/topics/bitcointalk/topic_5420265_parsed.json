  "content": "The Big banks lending money to each others.Money don't disapeare just changing the hands.We should use crypto the same way we should start lending to each others for investing in crypto and for trading.We want to create the money making system without much of liability or respondebilities.For this we need high supply coin so we can mint or by mining it will be liquid and all borrowing will be happening with this. How it should work ? Step one: Mint or buy some big basket of cheap currency and start lending it out when everybody borrow you know they gona sell it to get usdt or btc. Once they sell it you as the lender can make money shorting on futures.So you keep the price of coin low always If you borrow this cheap coin to the borrowers becouse they unlikely want to hold the coin but they gona sell it.If you borrow you gona pay back with some small % so it will give automatically this coin reserve currency status.More you borrow and pay back the better will be your credit score so more you can borrow. So you start with 500 and after one year you can get like 10000 of coins. So it will be fun process of making money no liabilities no losses no responsebility and if more people coming in then more coins will be minted or created by mining.To make this coin more liquid we can open real stores wich accepts those coins in store so the coin will be liquid the buyers will buy that coin who really gona pay with crypto in groecery store.Off course all this activity will make this coin very unstable and very volatile but who cares ? The Will be For Free and not much of liability becouse you get coin for Free and you have no liability to pay back only it will affect your credit score so you cant borrow more If you don't pay back first time.And If you build up your credit score you can make a lot money without liabilities becouse it's a Free money.This way you don't run out of money even If many who borrow the coin from you will not pay back.High supply like xrp shiba and tron is best but there should be Even bigger supply to make sure you have coins for everybody who want to borrow those coins.Pretty much like the FED does it  when they keep rates low they will print alot dollars just for the same reason as i mentioned to keep supply high so they can make sure they got money for everybody who want to borrow money.If we use crypto just the same way as the old money masters then we gona create like crypto wall Street when we borrow to each other and make profit without liability.",

How it should work ? There could be room for growth in cryptocurrency based venture capital.It would be like the reality show Shark Tank. Where an inventor pitches an idea or invention to investors who can provide funding and financial backing. Except all support would be denominated in crypto. To produce profits in loan (or investment) markets, usually requires wealth multiplication of some type. In an ideal sense, the loan has a goal of multiplying the value of the loan beyond its initial value. Venture capital investment in inventions and ideas is one method of achieving this. But of course, there are other methods.Offering loans to professional house flippers, people who buy low cost goods at auction repair and upgrade to sell at profit. There are many established markets where loans can be offered to receive a return on investment.",

The huge majority of stores all over the world aren't even accepting the most trusted Bitcoin, why would they accept a more useless coin like yours? And you're also trying to make sure you have coins for everybody? I'm afraid that's not the way it should be. Scarcity probably works more instead?But let's not anymore go far. Your idea of creating a coin for others to borrow so that they could use the proceeds to invest and trade is already sorely lacking of sense.",

I think this is the perfect opportunity for the entire crypto community to grow and get the true value of digital currency and our lifestyle is no longer controlled by centralized banks. So make some kind of plan with the governing authorities about this so that it can be adopted.",

Im sure everybody want to borrow that way.No risk for borrower If you not paying back you lose becouse every time you pay back you can borrow next time even more. So rates need to be low for borrower If there is too many borrowers then coins can be minted more to make sure everybody who want to borrow can get coins.Since crypto is only digits and numbers you can create endless ammount of coins.",

You cannot compare your private coin, or anybody's coin for that matter, with the USD. The USD is the legal tender of the entire United States of America. It is backed by the government, by laws. It is the official currency of the entire country. Therefore, while it may not be mandatory that every single US resident must use the USD, it is the preferred currency of individuals, government offices, businesses, and so on. Can you make another currency-- a private currency at that-- like this?",
