  "content": "Hi I noticed an S9i miner that was not over locked but has been running at a higher rate since installing brains OSJust noticed it was off and all the supply wires from PSU had melted/plus the ends?Plus all x9 connections on all 3 boards are all melted and I have just broken the burnt plastic off for now. I’ve ordered x50 ends for the hash boards. Do PSU still powers your and has 12v on the main hex bolts. 1. What solder station/solder/flux/tip cleaner do I need to repair these?2.  Can you purchase the pre made ends (x10) in total that I can just bolt back on the PSU?I have an ancient soldering iron and the lead if stuff/short and was not good so looking ti get an ‘all in one’ Hal’s decent station. Anyone advise please Thanks.",

PCIe plugs can only be plugged/unplugged *at best* 25 times before the contacts begin to degrade very fast...To repair them you need a high wattage soldering iron - as in 60W or more - because those pins and the thick power planes suck away heat like crazy.",

I reduced it to 1250w and the meter showed 1370w. I’ve ordered this iron. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/394066347197?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=yWxoV2EuRkO&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=xuEErDW3RGK&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPYLooks like it has solder and copper tip cleaner with it. Hopefully this will keep the tips in good condition as I always seem to ruin them/solder will not adhere but balls up/falls off the top??I’ll order some wick as well to remove any excess. What is the secret to keeping the tips in peak condition so solder akways sticks to them?Is it just turn off, a simple wipe/clean just in the copper and then in the wet foam pad and back in holder?. Why have the copper and the sponge?Cheers",

So you need to set up the properly enough heat that can melt soldering lead. Then use steel wool to remove excess solder from the tip.Solder wick can be also good to clean the tip.",

Unless doing several connections one after another (just go for it) the normal wipe before each joint will keep a nice shiny clean tip.Something else to be concerned with... When the PCIe connectors get burnt like that - especially all of them on a board - there is a good chance that the ribbon data cables and/or their circuits on the control board took a hit as well. The s9's had a nasty habit of using the data return lines for power return when the usual PCIe connections fail. Well, *trying* to...",

I managed to removed the end of the plastic damaged end and clean pins up and it cable plugs in fine now.

      "body": "Brilliant advice as usual. So the key to keeping the tip in good order is just to keep it clean by a wipe in the pot of copper tool cleaner and then a wipe in the moist foam pad. That copper tip cleaner just looks like leftover swarf from milling/lathe work with a bit flux in it. Watched  few videos and it’s also unreal on how far out of calibration these irons are. There is ‘tool’ that has diodes and you simply add solder and touch to the centre and it gives the accurate temp tip to allow you to cal I rate it. It looks like a flux capacitor type thing.  I’m thinking 375c is a good starting temp. I even purchased a pair of magnifying glasses with leds and a set of verity’s lenses as my eyesight is not good close up. I’m actually looking forward to having a little play doing this tbh. I think that cleaner for flux is basically thinners here in the U.K. when I googled it. Lmk if I’ve missed anything. Thanks once again, what a great community!",

Use 100% isopropyl alcohol (not methanol - it corrodes copper) or pure acetone if you chose to not use flux remover. Another good choice is spray brake or carburetor cleaner followed by an alcohol or acetone rinse. Just flood the joint, use a toothbrush to scrub a bit and flood again.As for the metal swarf, truth be told I rarely need to use it and that's only when using a large tip that has a lot of excess solder on it after doing some heavy work. The wet sponge/pad works fine for normal use.Exact temp does not exactly matter, key point is that the temp is reasonably controlled.",
