      "body": "I don think anybody cares other than the miners… Pow or POS people only care about the prices and Eth isn’t doing bad there (compared with the other coins) so I think people aren’t mad. The markets in general isn’t in a good shape anyway. The miners also moved to the other projects so I don’t think they give a damn about eth anymore. Sometimes I think people make decentralization a bigger thing than it is. Most eth investors/traders don’t give a damn about it probably. It is different with bitcoin though. Bitcoin investors really care about decentralization.",

I think a lot of people don't really care about PoS or PoW or about mining. For me personally ETH's ability to provide cheap GAS fees and reliable speed is the key to the future price of ETH.",

But if you are talking about altcoins, I do not know but there are people that prefer decentralization. If you are talking about if PoS is not decentralized, yes it is not.Quote from: j1792 on August 21, 2023, 02:40:49 AMDoes switching from POW to POS significantly reduce gas costs? And significantly improve TPS?No, it does not reduce fee at all.Quote from: j1792 on August 21, 2023, 02:40:49 AMWhy do you think ETHW failed?Because ether and ERC20 has gained ground already and influenced by their creator like Vitalik Buterin.Quote from: j1792 on August 21, 2023, 02:40:49 AMIf there is a new coin that tries to re-provide POW ETH, will you buy it?Bitcoin is PoW and has not changed, you can go for it. Quote from: j1792 on August 21, 2023, 02:40:49 AMI found several POW-based ETH altcoins released recently, do you think these altcoins have a future?There were some that were successful in the past, there are some that are created now that will have future. But just that developers of today are lazy and only go for token instead of a coin.",

It has been proven as a defective mechanism for achieving decentralization.Quote from: j1792 on August 21, 2023, 02:40:49 AMDoes switching from POW to POS significantly reduce gas costs? And significantly improve TPS?No. In fact, it is the most known misconception about The Merge. Migrating from PoW to PoS did not reduce gas costs. It also does not improve the network scalability.The Ethereum community itself has addressed those two misconceptions, you can take a look at https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/#misconceptions.QuoteWhy do you think ETHW failed?The same reason with why Ethereum Classic \"failed\". Most Ethereum users did not fully care about immutable decentralised network.QuoteIf there is a new coin that tries to re-provide POW ETH, will you buy it?I found several POW-based ETH altcoins released recently, do you think these altcoins have a future?No. They will not garner interest if they merely rehashed things that already exists and do not give something new to the spaces.",

Everything that's going wrong with Ethereum is not associated with it's choice of algorithm but with the development paths taken and the pace of improvements. I don't think a POW fork of ETH would work, ETH blockchain is already a congested one and the market won't sustain two forks of similar ETH.  I don't have high hopes for ETH either. They were a pioneer but newer coins are more capable as utility tokens than ETH.",
