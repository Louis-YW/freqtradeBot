  "content": "Hey buds.I am a lover of movies, not just all movies but the most interesting ones..If you are a lover of movies yourself, you will agree with me that most times, title does not really tell if a movie will be interesting or not, in-fact, by going with title, you sometimes buy or download and watch a movie only to end up very disappointed and feeling like you were cheated..But then, on the other hand, there are movies with very dull, uninteresting titles , but when you happen to watch the movie, you will stay glued to it till the very end due to how interesting that movie is..And from my personal research, casinos and gambling related movies dont come with the best of titles, i mean they dont have that Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr kind of title where you feel \"oh my gosh, this movie must be smoking hot, i must watch it\" na na, casino/gambling related movies dont come with such titles, and maybe that is why are not always that popular because they dont really pick people's interest, but like ive said before, title of a movie most times dont tell if that movie will be interesting or not.The best way to truly know movies that will be interesting is by special recommendations by those that have watched that movie, this is what i want us to specifically focus on doing on this thread, discussing only and strictly casino/gambling related movies, for those of us who aside gambling, loves watching movies on our spare time, we could get an idea of what to watch next from this thread...I hope for this thread to become one of the mega threads centered only on casino/gambling related movies and its discussions only, so to keep the thread as clean as possible, and from possible hijack from spammers ...The thread will be self moderated Its a simple ruleEvery movie suggestionsDiscussions - like the movie scenes, characters, happenings, what so ever..Must be related to the topic.Anything outside the topic \"i am sorry\" will be deleted =So if you've never watched a casino/gambling related movie before and you are interested in watching one or more, ask for recommendations, don't post shitty and off topic comments - deleted.=For you that have watched some couple of casino/gambling related movies, feel free to recommend it, discuss it, analyze it anyhow you want,Lets just have fun discussing something different from sports, gambling addiction and no addiction stuff, while keeping to the rule of this board.",

That reminds me, what about squid game? It was quite popular when it came out although it’s not a type of gambling we see in modern days since it involves one risking his/her life to win, but gambling is gambling…",

A long time before when I was a child I thought that movie pretty entertaining.The villain was a casino owner who wanted to steal Wilma from Fred, so he rigged the games to awake the greed of Fred who became a gambling addicted and forgot his family and friends. Therefore, causing personal conflicts betweeen him and his wife. Initially he made huge profit, but since he was greedy and couldn't stop playing, the villain rigged the games the other way round, so besides losing his friends and family, he also lost all his money...I remember having an impression every casinos were rigged after watching that movie.",

Take Casino Royale as an example. It has that feeling, but not because of the casino, but because of that Bond suspense, and the fact that he's on the clock. The movie and the game is paced faster because he always has something else to deal with while playing. It's that feeling of time running out and the suspense of not knowing what tricks other players are going to show makes it a great movie. If you're looking for recommendations, I love the movie Rounders. I watched it as a kid and I could see it again without feeling boredom. Rain Man also has a nice card counting scene, although the movie isn't about gambling.",

Most realistic poker movie i've ever seen. There were some actually good poker playing involved. I would absolutely recommend anyone interested in poker to watch this. Poker playing scenes made sense and i am betting that they were designed by actual pros. Matt Damon analysing hands in the game by narrating his thought prorcess at the background was brilliant to watch. And it wasn't talking down to viewers in condescending way. At least it wasn't to me.",

This is where I also notice Sandlker's phone theme features BTC. He is a businessman who sells fake watches and also a gambling addict with so much debt to his brother-in-law. This is a messed up story of a man with a gambling addiction affecting his family, he cheats and pawns someone else ring but comes out as a winner at the end thru gambling. And got his revenge against his brother-in-law who keeps busting him because of his debt.  Not much for a spoiler but there's more to the story.",
