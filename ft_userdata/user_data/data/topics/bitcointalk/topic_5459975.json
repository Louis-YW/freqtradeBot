Investing in altcoins too will give high yield and I will not advice you to invest all in bitcoin. Do not leave your coins in one basket. You can invest 70% of you money in bitcoin, while the remaining 30% on altcoins which are riskier to invest in than bitcoin.If you think that you want to invest on a single coin, bitcoin would be the best to go for. Know also that you may invest in altcoins and sometimes the altcoins can disappoint you.",

      "body": "Answer to your query is in the trading volume and market capital of BTC and ALTs. Few days back the market capital of whole crypto industry was covered by BTC like 51% or 52% market capital was covered by BTC only. Does this not emphasize the importance of BTC over ALTs. This also distinguished the interest of people in BTC over ALTs. And if we talk about the profit ratio that both BTC and ALTs could make you then this factors is not comparable because the factor that caused you huge profits doesn't relies in the coin or token you are investing it depends on your knowledge and strategies you used.For example, the whole market is lead by BTC so you could make 1000$ in BTC as profit and in ALTs too but it depends on the knowledge and experience or obviously the luck you have. other wise these two entities are just different from many other factors but profit is not the one.BTC is the king here and ALTs (alternative) means second option to select for investing in BTC. I agreed with your point and that's the reality too.",

Bitcoin is the only thing that makes the most sense out of all, this is one of the reasons I will forever keep having Bitcoin and the biggest bag I hold.",

If you think Bitcoin will have the highest return possible out of all other altcoins, you should go with Bitcoin. Historically, Ethereum has given more returns every Cycle than Bitcoin maybe because it's used more as a product rather than Gold, which Bitcoin has became? If Bitcoin can provide the fast and efficient usage, it will surely replace the Need of Ethereum in the Cryptoverse.The only advantage Bitcoin has above all other altcoins is that it's still Proof of Work while Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake.",

Although in bull seasons like this the pump usually affect all crypto so for me I think diversifying your investment into different coins during this period would probably be an option I will not be afraid to take seeing how many coins is going to pump up, it will be an ideal time to accumulate as much profits as you can from all your investment on crypto and BTC in particular.",

Have you ever heard of Liberty Reserve, E-gold, et al. Cryptographers such as David Chaum and the electronic money called ecash? E-cash was even used by some banks in Europe such as Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse,,..Now you can say me you were talking about a currency using cryptography (a cryptocurrency) but it doesn't change anything. Bitcoin isn't the first digital currency or cryptocurrency.b-money and bit gold were probably the very first , distributed and anonymous system.

Bitcoin is well-known, has proven itself, and carries weight.That cryptocurrencies don't provide much of a boost is something I can relate to. However, it's important to remember that not all objects develop in the same way or at the same rate. Furthermore, cost should not always be considered primary. It's all about the tech, the plan, and the crew.But who am I to dissuade you if Bitcoin is what you truly desire? Have no fear, keep HODLing!",

You've probably never heard them say that it's a bad thing about investing in bitcoin because they trusted bitcoin or that they haven't experienced any major losses in their investment or they just know better. Spending on your lover or romantic partner is an entirely different league, you don't invest everything because you can still lose even if you haven't heard anyone saying bad stuff about bitcoin, also if you don't invest in your partner/lover, there's a possibility you're letting go of the right person for you. Moral of the story: don't be a rabid fan of bitcoin, there are more important stuff out there besides making money.",

Giving priority to Bitcoin which means 50%+ of the total investment in Bitcoin and the remaining 50% in various altcoins according to the level of potential and risk level,  because most of the altcoins as you already know find it hard to rise in price once they price crashed significantly but Ethereum have always been following Bitcoin footsteps and rising along Bitcoin each time and also fall when Bitcoin drop in prices which have made Ethereum to be one of the active altcoins in terms of market stability.",
