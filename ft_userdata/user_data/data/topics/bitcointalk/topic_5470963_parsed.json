These are problems that arise from time to time in a business, especially for a corporation as big as Musk's. I'm not a fan of his handling of Twitter but I think it's doing just fine and he's introducing different innovations to keep the app at the top. The worst that can happen is, that he'll sell off Twitter at a loss, nothing like losing his empire. Right now two countries would have to pay $1 to use X. This is just the testing period of that initiative. If it works that's a dollar a year from about 40m people. That's a lot of money. Musk is a proud man so I don't see him losing his CEO status and he's also a smart man, so he'll find a way. There's no big deal.",

In the future he will surely stop being the main face and will give that position to someone else, moving to the board of directors and leaving office.",

There could be other assets or investments he still had that he might not have made known to anyone. If probably Twitter crashes and is not able to generate the capital he invested in it, whatever it has cost him to acquire Twitter, I believe he can still be able to regain it within some time of generating profit from other of his investments and his company. Although there is nothing very impossible, it's possible that he can lose the CEOship of his company, but that cannot easily be possible.",

In my personal thought about this, Elon Musk knows what he is doing, he might not become a billionaire if he is not good at thinking and strategizing. If in the eyes of others what he is doing is wrong, so be it, but at the end of the day, Elon Musk's plan will still exist and will be followed, not what others say.If he did something, for sure he knows the risk that he will face, Musk is a billionaire man and at the same time he is also a risk taker, so such actions are not new to him to be honest. Trust me in the end he will solve it better.",

However, even if Twitter ends up bankrupting and being sold to another company for a small amount and he makes a loss, we can easily say that tesla alone would be enough to make him keep going and that's the most important part of his wealth, which doesn't seem like slowing down anytime soon.",

He's too big to fail now, and as long as his stepping down on both these companies doesn't force him to lose all of his equities and shares in these companies I'm positive he's still going to live comfortably. The bad bet he made on Twitter is already taking its course and he's making the people that's not even responsible for it pay. Imagine having to pay for a \"once-free social media application, that's just what he's making you do now with Twitter. Tesla isn't doing any better with all these allegations and backlash targeted at the safety features of his vehicles and the viability of autopilot. So yeah things are going to suck for him from here on out if he doesn't do anything.",

Musk is a smart businessman, and being a risk-taker, he will not allow himself to lose because he is a real businessman.Apart from that, he is the type of person who will not allow himself to be defeated. Maybe in the eyes of others, his judgment is wrong, but in the end, they will see that Musk is still the one who will benefit a lot from the truth. In short, he still has the last laugh.

As for Twitter, it's true that it's been in a bad spot since Elon took over but that doesn't mean it's going to die or disappear anytime soon. Elon is completely changing Twitter and everything in less than a year so it is difficult to confirm anything about the future of this social network.
