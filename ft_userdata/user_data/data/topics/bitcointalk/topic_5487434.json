EG not have all utility thrown into the cap gains category, but be adjustable dependant on utility to be in different tax classifications and regulation treatment(when not used in a custodian/cex/regulated service)(money on FOREX markets is regulated differently than money in retail commerce market of goods/services)",

The whole article was about insider trading and while some altcoins might end up being securities, some of them certainly are not going to be.This is from sec.org press release about the coinbase insider trading incident:QuoteNikhil Wahi and Ramani allegedly purchased at least 25 crypto assets, at least nine of which were securitiesHow this turned to \"New US Ruling deems most altcoins, if not all are securities\"?There were ton of shady icos / token sales, including some famous respected coins out there. And those made stupid mistakes, and i often wondered if they are ever going to be paying for that. And it just might be that wheels of justice have been slow. So i would be amazed if many of altcoins that had token sales wouldn't be securities.But legitimacy on these coins/tokens varies, and some of them actually managed to be run by professionals. Some of them were private sales, some of them were distributed by airdrops so legitimacy against some public token sales with moon marketing are on whole different level.",

You do not need a soothsayer to tell you that crypto assets are stores of value, utility and security. Many are only making their own versions of interpretations and that is why such cases are being dragged to the court to ascertain what they truly are. But for me, there is no mistake here, unless maybe some people do not want to accept some facts whether because of their love for crypto or for their hate for it, but indeed, cryptocurrency as a whole has all the qualities/characteristics posted above.Regardless, it is time for the world government to know that the world is revolving, so it is no longer the time that we believe that securities can't be used one way or the other. Cryptocurrency is beyond what can be restricted to a single function, and as an asset, let it do whatever it is capable of doing without intimidation. Are they not using securities to settle transactions and debts, especially bonds?Is that not a form of payment? So, I simply do not know what the so-called Michael Saylor is driving towards. Many people will just be running their mouths without even knowing anything.",

People have been calling for the \"end of the crypto casino\" since forever.On the point of it not really being a new concern, the SEC's position on classifying cryptos has been evident for a while. The story of the SEC treating altcoins as securities goes back at least as far as 2017, and then they just expanded this rhetoric (Bitcoin isn't a security, but other cryptos are) over the years, as is well-described in this article.I also want to comment about crypto casinos specifically. The SEC's rulings apply only to the US, not the rest of the world. And crypto casinos often didn't serve US customers in the past anyway because online gambling is largely illegal in the US (the details vary from one state to another, but still).",
