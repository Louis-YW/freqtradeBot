For me the very first thing that I would do is change my email address password because even though it's not true, we should always update it maybe 2-3 times a month or what you prefer. Also do a deep scan of your computer, but we should run daily scans if you really want, since sometimes we attach thumb drives coming from outside or download files, like freeware, which has a load of malware on it.Also avoid entertaining emails that say you have won part of BTC and saying you have to click the link,. never ever do that delete that immediately I have received lots of emails like this be careful.for sure lots of people have been a victim of this, a few years back one of my clients has also been a victim of ransomware, and emails saying they have your data, so be very careful about what you do, and never communicate with them as much as possible.Who among you also received this kind of scam and tricks what did you do, we could also educate new comers so that they will not fall victim to this kind of scam and hacking.",

But if you use a different password for each site you shouldn't worryQuote from: tech30338 on October 23, 2023, 02:02:03 AMwe should always update it maybe 2-3 times a month or what you prefer.In theory that is the best option but if you do that i recomend you to use a password manager that can be sincronized between devices because it can be dificult to track every password that you use.In my case i use a different password for every single page.Remember to enable to Second factor authentication for everery site, but avoid 2FA by SMS becasuse it can be vulnerable to SIM swap.Regards!",

      "body": "It's possible that a computer was compromised by malware, such as keyloggers, which can monitor your typing and potentially access sensitive information. Simply changing your password might not be enough, especially if the attacker already has access to your email or if your computer is still compromised.To ensure your digital security, the best course of action would be to reformat your computer. This means wiping it clean and reinstalling the operating system. After that, change all your passwords, starting with fresh information. It's also essential to exercise caution when using your computer – avoid installing unnecessary programs and refrain from clicking on unverified links, as these are common sources of malware infections.",

But they later find out that paying ransom is a grave mistake because they will not stop blackmailing and asking for more money. If one receives such an email,  just do a security check and take necessary protective actions. If it is fake, stop communicating with these criminals. But if it is true that he has some of your information, gather enough evidence and report to the relevant authority. Scammers will become powerless if they know that you are not ready to give them anything.",

You can change passwords at least ones in year depending on your preferences and when changing your passwords do not set aside a day to change passwords to all your accounts in one day or at the same period as this raises suspicions and could make scammers link the accounts together. Also as some who is into cryptocurrency where security of your passwords are paramount you should avoid anything related to password managers and customized keyboards. Both of them store your passwords and since they are all closed source you don’t know what happens with your passwords stored on them. An hacker that gets access to those password managers app would automatically get access to your account passwords too. Also the use of password managers makes one to rely on them and as such you will forget those passwords and when time comes to recover them either because of device lost or damage you wouldn’t. Also when using an email for accounts related to anything finance, make sure you separate that email with the ones used for social media accounts and other sites. Emails are easily visible in this two places and could lead an hacker to any of your financial informations on the email.",

The hacker will try to gain trust from the users before trying to trick them. We have various elderly people in this region who are paid old age allowance by the government. Earlier old age allowance was usually brought to a specific place, but now, thinking about the convenience of people, the government gives old age allowance through mobile banking. Elderly people are usually not very aware of the hackers so they call the mobile banking number of everyone who gets old age allowance and ask them to share various account details. Hackers have blanked the accounts of those who have shared various account information without understanding this fraud of hackers, so we must always be careful of such frauds. Cryptocurrencies are usually the most fraudulent so we must be extremely careful.",

These are often phishing scams attempting to trick individuals into revealing personal information or clicking on harmful links. Deleting such emails is the right thing to do.It's unfortunate that many people have fallen victim to these types of scams. Sharing your experiences and education on avoiding scams can indeed be helpful for newcomers and others who may not be familiar with the risks. By raising awareness and promoting safe online practices, we can collectively work towards reducing the number of people affected by these scams.always be cautious with your personal information online and continually stay informed about potential threats.",

You must change your account password and choose a setting to log it out on all other devices. Because it's you change your password, you will have no issue to log in on other devices but hackers who only know your old password will not be able to log in your account again, except if they hack your new password too.First steps to do to temporary secure your account, avoid further compromise. After that, I will clean my device, install a new OS and change my account password again.Some people even don't mind to use 2FA for their accounts and it's too late for them to do this after their accounts were hacked.",
