This certainly raises concerns for the world economy.And periods like this historically occur before significant stock market crashes. Will this affect the price of BTC too.

This will have a negative value if worse things happen when the data is released. This shows that the crisis caused by Covid is still having an impact and has not been handled properly.

What I feel is that any important US data releases, in particular, have a volatility impact that can cause BTC price movements.Quote from: Jawhead999 on September 26, 2023, 08:40:11 AMIt's not because Covid anymore, but Russian invasion to Ukraine which still not cleared yet.

It's true that oil prices in my country have just risen and food has also risen. I also trade vegetables and fruit at the traditional market near where I live and it is very difficult to make a profit these days.If the war continues and breaks out in a big way, I don't know what the fate of stocks and crypto, especially Bitcoin, will be like. But I hope this will be over soon because many will suffer.",

It's currently tethered to its own ideals. People who had influence over Bitcoin in the past were the wrong kind of people who heavily depended on the centralized financial system to influence it.Â  When something unpleasant happened to the financial system it affected Bitcoin negatively. Things has changed for good as Bitcoin was disconnected from the bad system and connected back to its true purpose which is what will determine how well it does in the future. A failing centralized financial system won't affect Bitcoin negatively. It's expected that people who depend on the system will move over to Bitcoin as the system fails gradually.",

Moreover, in 2020 COVID-19 didn't bring the price of bitcoin. In fact bitcoin became safe heaven for investors who feared their fiat would be worthless as inflation was gradually increasing because economies got shot down leading to increase in prices of goods. So I don't think bankruptcy will disrupt the price increase of bitcoin because investors would like to leverage fiat they have on btc and that should cause more appreciation of price of btc.",
