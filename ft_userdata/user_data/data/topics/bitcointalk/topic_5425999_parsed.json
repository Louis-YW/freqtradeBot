  "content": "Ledger is partnering with Tony Fadell (the creator of the iPod) to build a new hardware wallet 'Ledger Stax'.Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/dnp-embargo-for-126-at-930-am-et-ledger-partners-with-ipod-creator-tony-fadell-to-build-latest-hardware-wallet/The wallet is a credit card-sized device with embedded magnets so that multiple devices can easily be stacked. The outside is a wraparound e-ink display that can show transaction details and even NFTs.The Ledger Stax will retail for $279, compared to $79 for the Nano S Plus and $149 for the Nano X wallet.Your thoughts?The wallet is going to be available by Q1 2023 but you can pre-order it now: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-stax",

I don't see anything there that would attract me to it. It's interesting that there is no mention of the internal storage capacity and how many apps can be installed at the same time.The positive thing is all-around support for both Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. I agree that stacking the credit card-like devices seems stupid, especially considering their price. The battery seems phenomenal if the technical specifications are true. It can be charged wirelessly and can stay on stand-by for weeks and months depending on how often it gets used.    They are stingy with the recovery sheets. Apparently, only one is provided in the box. I wonder if it's that difficult/expensive to include at least 2 if 3 is mission impossible?  Anyone interested in preordering should read the bottom of https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-stax.Ledger still needs to get their new HW wallet certified. If the required certification isn't obtained, I guess the production won't go ahead or it will be delayed. Those who preordered will in that case receive refunds.",

My mind is going over scenarios where I’d crack or break the screen, besides having to be wary of battery running down or eventually depleting it, storing it in a larger hiding place, making sure I don’t drop it, and so forth. The flashier it gets, the more delicate it becomes, and I’m happier off with a sturdier solution in any case.The price is steep, and it doesn’t seem to take away the need to interface with Ledger Device or such either on a laptop or on a mobile phone. The name, if derived from the fact that you can stack them together (through embedded magnets), seems unbefitting, as that is not a feature to enhance by far.All in all, I do like techy toys, but without further hands-on contact, that is what it seems to me at this stage.",

So if I lose it an attacker knows who to $5 wrench attack to get the PIN? And why would I want it to display NFTs? So I can whip it out in public to show everyone my super expensive and rare NFT and make myself a target for attacks? And I really don't understand the stacking function. They want you to buy a separate device for each wallet? At $280? Lol. Or maybe you and your family members are meant to stack all your devices together in the same place to make it super easy for an attacker to steal them all at once?Absolute nonsense. They should be focusing on things like Tor support and bitcoin only firmware, but I guess those things don't make money. So instead we get stupid gimmicks.",

Admittedly, this company knows how to lure buyers with an attractive and bright cover / wrapper.You can't ignore the price. ~$280 is a bit pricey, but I'm sure there are geeks willing to buy this and brag about it every step of the way.Also, I admit, the device looks nice, but this should not be the main function of the device. It is more important that the HW is reliable and safe for storing crypto, and not for flaunting the device at parties.

Since it is cheap and doesn't attract unwarranted attention, unlike this one.Looking at how they promote this wallet, looks like their target is new retail investors who usually hold crypto on exchanges. Maybe one or two of their research department staff look at Reddit and see that this thing can sell since those people like fancy stuff, it is clearly not for me (and probably not for the majority of the user in this forum either).

If that's true, it's quite impressive because I have never heard any other hardware wallet manufacturer to have such a feature.This is marketing speak. Their definition of \"on\" in this sense will be that it will still display your NFT or your name or whatever other risky information you decide to display on the cover, but it won't actually be powered up for months at a time I'm certain. E-ink displays only use a tiny amount of power. As soon as you start doing resource intensive tasks with it like signing transactions then the battery life will reduce accordingly.",
