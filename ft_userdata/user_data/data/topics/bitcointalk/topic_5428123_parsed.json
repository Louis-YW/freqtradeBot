It's confusing when time formats don't correspond to preferred settings.Random account with sole negative Trust summary taken from Meta board. It's 3 August 2015 & 8 March 2015I've demonstrated post Time Formats from my thread. It changes according to what's been selected. demonstration1demonstration2demonstration3Trust summary time formats don't alter with any combination. Is it something you'd like changed?",

While i might agree that it should be changed too when changing the time format since it's describe that its \"throughout this forum\". But theymos could just change the \"Time Format\" description instead that only post time format are affected.",

The SMF function timeformat (date and time) takes into account the user settings, so it’s possible that the dates on the Trust page are not using the flexibility of the format function for one reason or another.",
