  "content": "Hi,Apologies for such a basic question, but I am new to bitcoin and it can all be a bit overwhelming.Â  So far I've just dipped my toe in the water and I've made all of my trades (9x$1000) on coinbase pro.Â  The money is free to ack into the account ($2000 / day limit) and each trade is $6.95.Â  I'm toying with the idea of making a larger purchase ~$200k and I'm not sure how to do it.Â  The most straight forward option would be to wire the money into my coinbase account and make the trade just like I've made the others.Â  Is this a reasonable way to do the transaction or is there a cheaper and or safer and or better way to do this?Thanks!",
