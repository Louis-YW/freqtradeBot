This new method not only keeps my crypto safe, but it also makes my crypto investment strategy a lot easier.In addition to this new method, I’ve discovered a few other tips that have been invaluable to me.For example, you could create a “decoy” wallet with a tiny/0 balance amount of Bitcoin. This way, you’ll be able to divert potential threats/thieves away from your crypto.You could also try using a multi-signature wallet for extra level of security.These unconventional tips have given me a new level of confidence in my crypto holdings.",

If it’s different please explain how it works and how it will divert potential threats like you stated away from our holdings.QuoteYou could also try using a multi-signature wallet for extra level of security.And again, this is nothing new.

This way, you’ll be able to divert potential threats away from your crypto.That's plausible deniability, where one creates one wallet with their seed and then includes a passphrase which opens up another wallet entirely and the passphrase is stored differently.If anyone discovers your seed and accesses your wallet they find a believable amount of bitcoins that you own but not your main stash of coins; that is only discovered when the passphrase is included.This also helps with a $5 wrench attack.Quote from: bitnote on October 17, 2023, 04:35:45 AMYou could also try using a multi-signature wallet for extra level of security.Both of these methods are not new. Anyone opting for them should be very aware of what they are doing to avoid any technical issues when backing up.",

You should never leave wallets in locations where thieves typically search for valuable items, you store then as securely as possible where is out of reach. But if they get discovered they find the decoy wallet with a believable amount of Bitcoin.A zero or little wallet balance kept in an open space will only suggest that there is some other wallet kept more securely that they can discover.",

Do you think the thief will think you clearly don't have any coins? nope, they will think you store or hide it somewhere.If the thief left your house, case closed. But what if they point your head with their gun and force you to tell where all of your coins?",

That's quite common in crypto world. We all use multiple account for various purposes. We all keep the main account number secret and share the ones which are already public. We use that public account for all kinds of transactions. This is very basic here. Just like any other investment rule, we just need to diversify across multiple accounts. So that any any account for compromised, we don't loose all our cryptos.",

You could simply convert your decoy to WIF, whenever you wanted to move the funds.It could be color coded inside a picture, imagine taking a picture with your family in a carnival, or in front of a Christmas tree, having the key encoded in colors in the order of tree lights.  There are 10,000  other possibilities and ways to \"keep your coins safe\".Just make sure to mix your coins before moving them to the final destination(cold storage).",

But if the hacker is smart, then he can easily find out your holdings and can easily understand that you are using this wallet as a decoy.And you might get stuck in more problems, but the best practice is definitely to use a decoy wallet because once they open your wallet, you should set up some APIs or bots that would be triggered and move your funds from the main wallet to the different wallets so that your main wallet could be saved.I liked this trick.

Most institutional investors and exchanges also use this type of wallet.Regarding storing a small amount in one wallet, it is a good idea, but we also have weaknesses, it will cost quite a lot if we need large funds, if we withdraw for example from 10 wallets then the costs we have to pay will be 10 times more. Then we also need to correctly store the phrases for each wallet we have, of course it's a bit complicated. However, if we don't have a problem with these two things, it won't be a problem.",

But at some point, you will have enough funds, and then you will be looking for ways to save them. So I recommend you keep digging into topics like this because not only the post by the OP is beneficial, but the replies of the last page's members are also beneficial and can take you to threads that might help you learn new techniques to keep your funds the same.I also learned a lot by just following this simple method. You have to be optimistic and energetic to read long threads. And yeah, we can call this tip unconventional because it does not work for everyone. If the OP finds this tip helpful for him, then it is not guaranteed that it will be beneficial for others too. The best way to keep your huge funds safe from hackers is to keep them in cold wallets, like hardware wallets, but you also have to be very selective in choosing between hardware wallets. Because hardware wallets also come with different security levels.I also used to think that I didn't have enough BTC, so hackers might not be looking for me, but you can definitely see that you would be receiving spam or phishing links on your SMS or email. Which means they are trying on everyone, and once you become a victim of them, you will realize the importance of these topics. So better to remain up-to-date just like the hackers.",
