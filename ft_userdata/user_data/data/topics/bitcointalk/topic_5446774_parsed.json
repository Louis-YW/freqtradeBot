      "body": "If your country is not a Bitcoin friendly place.  Then the best thing you can do right now is download Tails OS, flash it on a USB drive and use it as the main OS for Bitcoin operations.  Use your main Operating System normally as you did so far, but use the removable USB drive with Tails on it for Bitcoin.If you use Tor, make sure your country does not prohibit Tor usage.  If you are concerned about this.  Connect through a bridge.  Your ISP will not see that you are using Tor this way.Anyway.  Back to your specific question.  Unless you are EXTREMELY cautious, they will likely be able to make a link between your IP and some specific Bitcoin Addresses.  This is particularly true if,-- You are using Block Explorers to search your balance (this will instantly link your IP to the Addresses you search)-- You are using Light Wallets or Custodial Wallets (including Trust Wallet!!!)-- You are not using Coin Control cautiouslyLike I said.  Best bet for you is using Tails OS for Bitcoin operations.  But keep in mind.  Using Tor with Exchanges will get your account banned and probably your deposited funds frozen.-Regards,PrivacyG",

But it makes connection slow. Ediit:Download the app, click on the setting icon that is beside 'full device VPN', enable the apps that you want to use Tor connection for. Go back and click on start which is displayed on big icon onion image.It is better to bypass android and never use anything related to them or using open source OS.

But if you mask your IP, they will then know (if they want to) that you are using a VPN or TOR. They won't know what you do with it though. Unless you are a wanted criminal or the government targets you specifically, this should be enough for them to stop looking. They would have to contact the VPN provider and request information about you to see your logs. Government personnel aren't going to do that randomly or just for fun.Who else can see and log your IP address?The software and the servers you connect to. You use Trust Wallet, and they can see it.
