      "body": "A short position might likely lead to bull trap. I will advice you not to average when bitcoin price is already low and the price drop is too much significant.It is just like $10 in total which you are using to learn derivative trading, which is good and I will not advice you to go beyond that for now.Start with low leverage. If you begin the trade at $17000 and later average with $3 and again average and the liquidation price is at $20000, that means you use around 10x leverage or more to first open the position. That is high, use low leverage.Always think of making profit even without averagimg, but averaging could later help to increase the liquidation price range.Avoid bear trap.",

      "body": "Use a much lower leverage instead of \"shorting with DCA\" maybe even x3 or lower so that you learn how the market works whilst not putting your funds at a high risk when using high leverage and panicking to adjust the margin of the open position.Also, look out for Bitcoin historic support and resistance levels, they can be helpful for you to determine where your stop loss, take profit and liquidation price should be.",

      "body": "It is very risky to invest in bitcoin in a short position and right --it could lead to a bull trap as a reply above.Investing in the long term and waiting until there is the stability of a bullish trend in the market would really give you a good profit, no stop loss is needed because all you have to do is to wait for your desired profit when you harvest it. DCA's way of buying bitcoin is also good if you have a lot of funds, as long as you are not selling your bitcoin under the price that you purchased it, you are safe from losses.",

But averaging or using DCA short position on future trading or with leverage when doing trade is like not worth it because remember that there may be some fee or funding rate fee as long as your trade is open.I suggest you also use low leverage.",

Are you able to control if price changes only 0.5%? I believe you can not manage risk with this too minor price fluctuation.Better when you have small capital to start, invest in Bitcoin. Work and buy more Bitcoin in 2023 bear market and wait for 2024 bull market. Don't trade spot. Don't trade margin. Don't trade future.Websites for Dollar Cost Averaging",

Also, apart from that, what you are doing is good and good from what I can see.I also agree with what you said about DCA because it seems like we're only saving this way, what you're doing is a strategy of day trading.",

With the current movement of bitcoin, I think it will be better you avoid future trading for now, stay away from either long position or short position, if you want to trade its better you trade stop for now, and if you still insist on trading futures, then I think you should deposit like $10 and use only $3 to enter your trade, the other amount left will help you increase your liquidation price, make sure you use low laverage, the higher your laverage the higher the chances of being liquidated and also make sure you do your analysis well before entering a trade.But the best thing to do currently is just to invest in bitcoin for long term and have rest of mind.",

Imagine what is you would have been buying when bitcoin was trading around $30k and then $20k and finally around $16k levels. Yeah, you can simply keep holding and I am sure you will get at least 2x profits before end of 2024. If your point is immediate or monthly profits, I have answer for that as well.If you focus on instant profits then you you should not have opened this topic because you must have plans before shorting bitcoins for the situations like market goes against you. When you do not have concrete plans for what to do when market moves as per your expectation and against your expectation, there are 90% of chances to lose your capital. I am sorry for saying that but fact is open. Switch to long term holding and enjoy massive profits over the time.",

But if the market position changes and goes down again, you make a profit. And if you haven't closed your trade yet, profits are starting to show there as the bitcoin price is now $17,018. But if you have closed your trade out of fear of losing even more money, you have seriously lost your money.Starting futures trading is not easy and requires experience and skills beyond spot trading. If you have not been able to determine where the market will move, you will take the wrong position and have experienced it.",

In my opinion, trading futures without plans like no stoploss or no target levels must be suicidal. Being profitable at any point of time is not a big thing in futures trading but exiting with profits is really a wise decision when considering the amount of fluctuations we do experience on day to day basis. I stopped futures trading hence I do not suggest anyone any trick these days still if I hear someone making profits out of futures trading, which really makes me happy and urging me to get into it as early as possible but honestly I am not having any plan to do so.",
