  "content": "Bitcointalk.org aims to allow about as much freedom as is reasonably possible. But this is not a darknet forum, and with mixers looking \"grayer and grayer\", it's no longer reasonably possible to allow linking to mixers. Even though \"a cryptocurrency mixing service is not necessarily illegal,\" a clear pattern has emerged where mixers pop up, last for a little while, and then get taken down by law enforcement once they get too big. Allowing mixers to be posted on bitcointalk.org before they seemingly-inevitably get declared illegal and seized is not sustainable. Therefore, promoting mixers will no longer be allowed, similarly to how darknet sites are already disallowed.To avoid disruption, there will be a grace period: Nothing will change until Jan 1, 2024.Starting Jan 1, 2024: - Forum accounts that are obviously run by mixers are not allowed. * - Mixer announcement threads are not allowed. † - Promoting mixers in signatures, avatars, and profile-bios are not allowed. - It's not allowed for mixers to do giveaways, sponsorships, bounties, paid posts, or paid ads in posts. If a thread is for paying people to do something for a mixer, then that's also not allowed. † - Mixer URLs will be automatically wordfiltered out, but you can still discuss mixers otherwise. Using link-shorteners or other obfuscation techniques in order to post URLs which would otherwise be wordfiltered is not allowed.  * Existing accounts will be banned from posting, but will be allowed to continue sending/receiving PMs for at least a few months so they can settle any business. † Existing threads will be locked and archived.You do not need to go edit/delete your past posts. Links will be automatically wordfiltered-out as of Jan 1, and nobody should be banned for old mixer-related posts. You should remove any mixer signatures/avatars/etc. soon after Jan 1, though.Definition of a mixerFor clarity, here is a detailed definition of what we mean by a \"mixer\". Most people know intuitively what a mixer is and don't have to read this.Something is considered a mixer if it meets all of these requirements: 1. It has a feature advertised for taking property, improving its privacy somehow, and then returning roughly the same type of property.     a. Even though you can sometimes use non-mixers to mix coins by depositing and then withdrawing, this doesn't make it a mixer because this is an incidental use of the service; the service isn't advertised as privacy-enhancing.     b. If a site is not primarily a mixer but has a mixer function, such as a mixer function on a gambling website, then the whole site is considered a mixer.     c. If the site takes coins, gives you a possibly-transferrable IOU, and will convert this IOU back into mixed coins much later, then the temporary conversion into a different type of property does not prevent it from being considered a mixer.     d. If the site internally converts your deposit into other things as part of its mixing, but ultimately the point of the product is to get your original type of property back, then that's a mixer, not an exchanger. 2. It is possible for the mixer to steal property passing through it. Assume that the sender does everything as correctly as possible. Also assume that no miners/verifiers on the base-layer cryptocurrency are evil. But assume that every other actor involved is evil (everyone able to vote in a DAO, every coordination server, every counterparty, every member of a multisig, etc.). Ignore short-term software bugs which are expected to be quickly fixed. 3. The service does not collect KYC-type info from all users. (This is not an endorsement of KYC generally, or a condemnation of non-KYC services generally. Non-KYC services of other types are still allowed, and in many cases they are a good idea.)Examples of things that are not banned mixers include exchangers (unless they have a mixing function), CoinJoin-supporting non-custodial wallets, and Monero.",

Mixers are not necessarily illegal but it is only matter of time when they will be sanctioned like illegal mixers.Should the forum stop advertising mixers? (now I think the question should be \"allowing mixers\" to be more accurate with the forum operations because it does not advertise mixers, forum users do it) I really thought about it when I asked community in that thread. Finally you decided to do something hard, but for the best of forum generally.",

I think short-sighted members did not foresee such an outcome but after what happened when the Sinbad mixer was seized recently, this was something highly likely to happen. If not after Sinbad, then maybe after the next but mixers were eventually going to be banned in the forum if they kept getting seized by law enforcement agencies.",

They can advertise their mixers somewhere, on other forums, darknet but they will miss this forum a lot.Will it come to a time of KYC-mixers?It sounds weird now but maybe in future, it will happen and with KYC, mixers will be allowed by laws.

Will crypto non KYC casinos be next as they too can be used for mixing. The government are winning and there's nothing we can do about it. It's sad that one of the most rewarding service on the forum that pays their participants a decent amount of money is going away. I guess we'll return to the casinos taking over the forum. Mixers were associated with Bitcoin and it was nice seeing them around as it remembered us of privacy.

The point is the government wants to monitor everything so services that makes it difficult for them to know what is going on is a threat to them and they're try to eliminate them on time and not give them similar doubts they did to Bitcoin and see where Bitcoin is today (impossible to kill). I also see things heading the way of kyc-mixes as the government is okay with privacy that's under their supervision.",
