Most of them do not even know how to secure their wallets ðŸ¤£Honestly speaking I too sometimes find in confusing situations like I had moments few days ago. Legendary does not mean that you will know all technical details, specifications, setup. You do not become a geek. But you have better idea since you are with the community from long time and you are part of every pieces of history. A brand-new user who never heard about this forum could have better knowledge then anyone else in the forum. There are many lower rank members who share excellent understanding about bitcoin tech and fundamental. Legendary is just a rank. Because your rank is Legendary, you are not true Legend. To become a legendary (if that is your goal) you need to know how many posts you need to make to increase your activity, keep posting regularly and figure out how to earn merit. Spending few hours a day or even less than half an hour of a day, you could become a legendary someday.Becoming a true Legend is something else. There are many round us but not many.",

Time certainly isn't indicative of knowledge, I could've been here for 10 years, and only participated in the gambling section, whereas I'd be limiting my exposure to anything that would teach me more about Bitcoin. It's not the time it takes, it's how effectively, and intensively you study usually. However, yeah being here longer means you've probably strayed from your normal posting habits from time to time, which might mean you pick up some extra knowledge. Honestly, if you spent a year in the Development, and technical discussion section being active, and participating you'd probably have a decent fundamental base by the end. Since, those guys that frequent that section tend to have a passion, and aren't afraid to tell you why you're wrong in what you've said. Which, honestly is perfect for learning. I do feel some users do get intimidated by certain sections because of it, but I genuinely believe it's not hostility for the most part, but their passion for the subject at hand shining through.",

The forum was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and saw the first exchange, the first altcoin, and the first ICO, but also catastrophic software flaws, massive thefts, and incredible scams. You too have an opportunity to become part of the forum's history: whether and in what way you do so is up to you.Bitcoin and me (Hal)Satoshi's lessonQuote from: theymos on January 03, 2019, 03:51:55 AMSatoshi is not awesome because he was watching the crypto world and had a brilliant idea. He's awesome because upon having this idea, he carried it out.Satoshi's lesson is that you don't need to be the next Einstein in order to change the world. Nor do you need to have much money, or influence with the world's \"movers & shakers\". You just need to put in the effort. Satoshi, probably just an ordinary hobbyist like anyone here, saw that something was lacking in the Universe, and he fought tooth-and-nail for 2+ years until this imperfection was corrected. This is what makes Satoshi and his work my greatest inspiration.Since we've long passed the moon, I hope you'll join me in aiming for the stars.",
