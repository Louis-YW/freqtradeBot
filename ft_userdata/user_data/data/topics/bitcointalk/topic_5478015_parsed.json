Zero knowledge about crypto trading and get 90% successful rate for your trading in this market, it's impossible and unbelievable. Because this market is volatile and run by news, by Bitcoin halving cycles and regulations on this market can affect it a lot.If you are not experienced in this market, you will belong to most vulnerable traders and more easily to lose money.I don't say you told lies but if you want to make your claim more convincing, please show proof. At least screenshots that are even hard to verify but with screenshots of your trading history, it's better than nothing.",

Patience is the main factor that will lead us to success if we will not keep patience while doing trading we can't make any profit.I have experienced this when I was new to trading I use to do over trading even when I have no need to. This always results in liquidating my account results in total loss.Quote from: SAHASAN on December 15, 2023, 01:05:28 PM>> Do not try to gain extra profit. Remember that expecting too much profit can make you addicted to profit and incur huge losses.You are right we should not try to gain extra profit or profit that are so imaginative that our selective coin can't even reach for example I recently selected some token and invested some small amount of my capital with the purpose of holding them for longer period of time.I was planning to sell them when they will cross there ath again but those coins were not to cross their ath so I recognized that soon and realize that I should have book the profits that at least I can book right now, something is better than nothing.Quote from: SAHASAN on December 15, 2023, 01:05:28 PM>> When you see the price increasing very quickly in a very short period of time and there are posts and discussions everywhere including social media that the price will increase, then refrain from catching any buys and trades and investigate the reasons for the price increase.[/b]This is known as shilling aur artificial methods to pump and dump the price of any token this is totally immoral and we all should avoid this practice even if we can utilize this method to make huge money. To avoid this we should be aware of the term fomo and how to control our feelings.",

Profit would really be just coming next if you are really just that knowledgeable on what you are doing. Dont rush up on everything then you should really be just fine.Point #3-Always set those take profit line or prices or simply with those goals not unless if you are going for long term then this wont be bothersome but if you are reallythat trying out to snip profits in short time then this is what you should gonna do but of course this isnt something that everyonecould easily grasps and does really need up that skills of you to do so.",

(crash, or ath)Those who trade a lot without even timing the market usually end up with huge and consistent losses while those who knows how to analyze and timing the market, they only got limited trades and still end up successful. So trading is not all about consistency, but trading knowledge and performance matter the most. Which I really think it's not possible for traders who are still new in the market and have zero knowledge in trading.However, trading can be well mastered in time. And probably by that time, you will not just maximize your trades, but you end up trading with caution and trading when the market is favorable to trade.",

Sometimes successful traders do not like sharing there secret experience how they were able to attained the height they are now. Maybe the reason is not to inspire the new traders to be ready to learn and keep learning about the market. The market is very difficult to understand and if we don't plan well or study the market very well, we might not get to the level we tend to get to, making consistent profits from the market.",

A lot of newbies lose money because they have been waiting for a few days and want to trade already and not miss a chance, but the reality is that if you can't find a trade that you trust then jumping into it doesn't really benefit you at all. I believe that we need to end up with something that should be a lot bigger and we need to end up with a return that should be making a greater profit for you when you are certain about it.If you start trading because you feel bored and haven't traded in a while then you will most certainly end up with a loss, that's just how it is, but if you end up trading because you have TA'd and found a good trade then you can start trading. Be patient, sometimes there isn't a single trade that you are certain about for a whole week, maybe more, it doesn't matter if you end up with a loss or not, you need to make sure that you are doing the right thing whenever you can.",
