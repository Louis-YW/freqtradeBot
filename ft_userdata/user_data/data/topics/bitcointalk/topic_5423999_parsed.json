  "content": "The utility token Kii is listing on P2B & LAtoken exchanges on November 30th following the IEO sessions in September & November!Kii is the transactional utility token at the root of NuIDâ€™s decentralized identity ecosystem, which enables user-owned & user-controlled digital identity. Owning Kii will grant individuals access to this ecosystem, which will provide portable, frictionless, secure management and verification of digital identities. Kii will initially be issued as an ERC20 token before migrating to the KiiChain ledger in the future. Kii will pay the cost of credential registration on a public blockchain, pay for use of NulDâ€™s existing trustless authentication solution, and pay for future identity use-cases within the ecosystem.Project OverviewTrustless Authentication for Trusted Identity powered by NuID & Kii, supported by The Kii FoundationThe Problem With Digital Identity: Identity on the web today is broken because authentication is broken. The current identity model is both centralized and fragmented: centralized by services each holding large silos of user identity data and fragmented with users having to separately create identity profiles across every service they interact with. When a silo is compromised, all of the users within are compromised and each credential theft resulting from a siloâ€™s security breach enables the next security breach, mass credential theft, and an inevitable perpetual cycle. The current state of authentication and digital identity prohibits users from having ownership and control over their own identity online.NuID's Solution: Trusted digital identity requires a rock solid core for authentication. NuID is building a new paradigm of digital identity through trustless authentication for services and a portable, device-agnostic identity model for all users of the web. Individuals will represent their identities with their zero-knowledge authentication credentials, stored on a public blockchain; services will deploy the NuID trustless authentication solution. The interplay between individuals and services will grow a robust Nu Identity Ecosystem which will make the internet more secure, return data ownership to individuals, and release everyone from the limitations of the current model of authentication. Kii is the transactional utility token at the root of the Nu Identity Ecosystem. Demand for Kii is determined by the services that use it to register NuID authentication credentials for their users & from future identity use cases within the NuID ecosystem.NuID Highlights:-5.5 years old (Started early 2017), VC backed, and in-use b2b authentication product (ZK Auth solution launched 2019)-Patents granted on 57 claims (https://patents.justia.com/patent/10880089) , protocol audit by top cryptographers.-Total Amount Raised: $4million seed financing, $1.5million Kii pre-sale-Leadership team: https://nuid.io/about.html#teamToken Allocation:Development & Operations 20%Verification Incentive 10%Presale 10%Public Sale 20%Team & Early Contributors 5%KiiChain Support 25%Development Fund 10%Following listing on centralized exchanges, Kii will be available via decentralized exchange soon as well.Learn more about the project:ðŸ”¸Website: https://nuid.io/ðŸ”¸Kii token website: https://kiichain.org/ðŸ”¸Twitter: https://twitter.com/_nuidðŸ”¸Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/company/nuidincðŸ”¸Telegram: https://t.me/NuID_Kii",
