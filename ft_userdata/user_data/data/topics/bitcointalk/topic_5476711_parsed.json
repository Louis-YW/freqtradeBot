Of course this isn't always the case, especially when it comes to bought accounts or accounts that were dormant during most of the time since the merit system has been introduced.Actually you've inspired me to keep an extra eye out for non-Legendaries who write good posts and are often overlooked.",

Each individual has his reason for giving merits to a post and while some would question the motive behind @phillipma's generosity towards you, I feel he has a better reason to. So you may regard hoarding of merits as pointless, but the next person knows why they are doing it and since this merits don't really 'decay'(at least not that I know of) why not keep it till it's 'ripe' for usage, right? Then again, just as other have pointed, it's not always cool to publish your merit 'good deeds' because it may come off as more merit fishing to the next person and even though your motive was actually far from that, for me it would be best to keep your deeds out of public view and rather let your works speak for you.",

But you shouldn't be stricter in giving it out as your \"much more selective\" is scary on its own. Just be natural about this and continue to give to those who are deserving of it until it finishes again. Then look away when you've exhausted it as you are not at fault and there's nothing bad in that.QuoteI think this is a nice reminder that is the prompting when you are to hand out merits:  \" This is what determines your forum rank.

It's also not what the forum wants, but you see, we have different ways of gauging things and we can't hand merits out the same way. There are times I would be looking for those to bless with merits but I would not see either, above all, you are right, we should not be sentimental about this as it would amount to a waste eventually if not spent.",
