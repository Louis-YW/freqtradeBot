That would be an untrustworthy way of starting. You have been given link to service announcement, check some of the links there about service announcement and see how it is done, focussing on explaining about the service you want to render.",

You can add the social media like Reddit, Discord, Twitter etc , not wrong at all, it is about your business, but make it professional. I was only surprised you did not mention your website while mentioning social media. Know that it is about your business, add all information necessary, most importantly, your website. Check those ANN threads on service announcement board to see how it is done and be very active on the thread that you create, read what people are posting.",

If that's important for you, also consider acquiring copper membership.",
