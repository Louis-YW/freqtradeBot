So let try and spread other good uses of bitcoin and not only spreading how bitcoin investment can be profitable, why not we acknowledge othe good uses of bitcoin, this is just my own opinion.",

Some places worry it'll mess with their own money but I love how it's free from control and opens up cool ways to invest.

For growth development is quite good, only the current price position is still in the correction stage for accumulation and this is still ongoing. the time now is to continue collecting if you still have reserve funds.I believe this is poor advice. Anyone wanting to accumulate Bitcoin should have done so in the months leading up to Donald Trump's presidency. Buying now is much riskier compared to earlier opportunities.From my perspective, the chart I'm looking at does not look promising. A significant portion indicates that Bitcoin has already peaked, especially since the stochastic RSI on the monthly candle appears very bearish. While there may be a slight chance for a price increase, I doubt there will be a breakout of the all-time high of $108,000.For now, I’m keeping my fingers crossed. My main point is that the best times to accumulate were in 2022 and 2023. Accumulating Bitcoin now feels akin to buying at the peak. The chart certainly doesn’t look good. If I were to advise anyone at this moment, I would suggest waiting for the next bear market in 2026.",
