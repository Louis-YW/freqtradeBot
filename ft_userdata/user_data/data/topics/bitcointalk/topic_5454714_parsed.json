  "content": "I merited a post a few minutes ago and there were 3 more users who merited the post before me. So, I was the 4th user to merit the post. We all had shared 1 merit to that post, maybe because we don't have a lot of smerits (Common in the Bengali local thread)¬†  Surprisingly, my name was being displayed at the first while I was the last person to merit that post. I can't remember if I have ever noticed that before, or maybe I have forgotten.In general, higher merits to lower merit will make the order but when everyone shares the same amount of merit, what is the algorithm? I just checked all of the 4 profile and it seems activity is the only thing to count here to make the order. Is it? Have theymos ever shared this?",

Then the only way I could think of it again is that it's based on reputation. That's why DT members will come first according to their rank, followed by others.This is just an assumption.Edit: UchihaSarada then the only explanation could be my assumption above.

The arrangement has always been higher merit to lower merit order and when same number of merit is being shared i have always thought it to be in the order of time but Op story and image tells us otherwise. Maybe it could be an error, maybe Everything will rearrange back after some time just has my profile failed to change from member rank to full member rank even after activity was updated but after some time everything went to normal.",

Yeah it's not like that, in this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448111julerz12's position is ahead of DireWolfM14 while the two have a large difference in weight DT2 values [1].I just think the order is: sum, then total login time (which is the unique variable).

What I have concluded is that the order primarily works according to the principle that those who have awarded the most merits are the first, and then if several users give the same number of merits, the order depends on the date of registration.

It is a very simple criterion that makes sense.I agree with your first point, but I get the different facts that the date of registration is not the only factor that will affect the order lists on a post even if they submit the same number of merits.You can see the facts in this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5253221.msg62243331#msg62243331Supposedly if registration date were to be factor, then @reagansimms registered on April 10, 2014 is in second place compared to @ETFbitcoin registered on July 26, 2014. I think date of registration just one of the factors that affect the algorithm apart from activity points, DT strength and few others.",

It is a very simple criterion that makes sense.No of course because Nicnaccoin has given 1 merit in that post and still Nicnaccoin is visible after my username while Nicnaccoin has joined the forum in 2017. On the other hand, I have joined in 2018, one year after Nicnaccoin joined. Registration date isn't the criteria here as we can see. So far, it seems number of activity is the criteria. Highest number of activity will be visible first when same number of merit is shared.Well, this was just my curiosity about how this works. I know it's not something important but it's good to know the criteria.",

Nice guessing but I don't think the weight on the DT has any thing to do with it rather I have observed that the number of merits given out is the reason and having digged through some thread created by me I realized that when the number of merits given by each user are in equal number the last user because first regardless of the rank of the user or position.

It is possible that formula like this is also used to determine the order in which merit is sent after the highest number in the first place:Code:1000 - ((Activity Rank + Trust Rank + Earned Merit Rank) / 3).",
