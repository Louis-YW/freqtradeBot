  "content": "What happened:: I just discovered a thread that was posted in the Bounties section of this forum; the OP posted a fake Github link to a pescalcoin wallet to download on the computer and invited the hunters in his thread to download and test the wallet on the computer in exchange for being paid 1000 PASCS or 500 USDT ERC20/TRC20.First, The amount of payment per person is unbelievable, and this scammer allocated 50,000 for his \"PROOF OF TEST\" topic, which is, of course, a ploy to lure anyone.Second, His account on the forum is Newbie and was created today at 03:24:47 PM.Third, His Github account was created 3 hours ago, and he uploaded PascalsChain.zip 1 hour ago, well he posted a fake Github link; the official website is Pascalcoin.org, and the original GitHub link is >>#, Even all the sizes of the original wallets did not reach 66.5 MB as the size of this scammer's wallet.Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3573305Reference Link:  [PAY FOR TEST] PASCALS Topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463828.0 Â | ArchivedFake Github Link: Code:https://github.com/PascalsChain/PascalsCoin/releases/tag/1.0.0 Additional Notes:  I believe that the wallet published by this scammer contains malicious codes. Still, it was not detected by the antivirus programs, so do not download any wallets from questionable sources except its official sites. Do not be deceived that it is a clean wallet program and has not been detected by the antivirus. Also, do not participate in any \"Proof Of Test\" topics like this from new members, and don't download the wallet to test it on your primary PC/Phone in order to get the big payment because you will not receive it in the end, and your device will be hacked, be careful.",

You can make another report in this thread dedicated to cases of spreading malware.I think that person is going to get banned, and the post deleted.If you happen to have a GitHub account, you can also report the fake profile for abuse, and it will be disabled.",

If a user installs this malware on their device, there is a possibility that the user will lose everything. Hope no user has installed this wallet out of greed, and if someone has installed it then they should take quick action so that they don't get hacked.OP thank you for exposing this suspicious user.",
