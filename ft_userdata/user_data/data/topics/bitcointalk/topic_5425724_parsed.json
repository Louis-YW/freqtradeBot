  "content": "Addresses That Sat Idle for Years Transferred 1,221 Bitcoins Worth $20M Over the Last 4 DaysDuring the last seven days, bitcoin’s price has remained above the $16K region following the aftermath of FTX’s collapse. Since then, a number of ‘sleeping bitcoins’ that sat idle for five to nine years have been moving during the last four days. Bitcoins that were worth far less back then are being transferred for the first time in years.How this news got my attention is only an attestation to my  interest in Bitcoin. If such amounts have suddenly been transferred, it is for good reasons especially during these times where we see that Bitcoin had remained steady after dipping. It goes to show the Long term investment prowess of its owners. I would like to find out if such amounts was invested via DCA spread over the time, or if it was purchased at once. If DCA method of investment was adopted, is it commensurate with the amount stated despite the fluctuation over the past years?Was it also likely that another method of investment was used to have achieved this feat over the duration?https://news.bitcoin.com/addresses-that-sat-idle-for-years-transferred-1221-bitcoins-worth-20m-over-the-last-4-days/?utm_source=OneSignalPush&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=PushNotifications",

Some addresses are also very old so he just need a thousand bucks to get it, he just buy it in one go. Based on the addresses shown it looks more like the owner buy in one go, and then save for years. Those addresses looks like it belongs to different users, but who knows.",
