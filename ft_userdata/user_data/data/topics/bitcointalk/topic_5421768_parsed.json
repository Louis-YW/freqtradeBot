  "content": "Good morning,This is my first post although I have been following this forum for quite some time. I am in need of help with an unconfirmed transaction which has been stuck since 14th November. My problem is because my digital wallet(blockchain.com) automatically set my fee too low and has been unconfirmed since. Usually the fee is adjusted automatically, depending on the amount of transaction and has always worked. Took a couple of hours and everything was fine. This time however, the fee was way too low and unfortunately noticed it after sending the funds.Please understand that I am not an expert on bitcoin. Although I like the simplicity of the wallet, I am not familiar with certain procedures.Are there any bitcoin miners here that can help me out with this transaction? Any help from you guys would be greatly appreciated. I will send the transaction hash for better clarification.34556a0c6703676c6ff79e09a367b9c4e35b4cdb9670691bfdf8bd3f6bfc0defThanks a lot guys.",

How long it might take? just interestingIgnore the dollar value of the fee, focus on sats per vbytes , you pay fees based on the size of your transaction, but since there is a limited block size, all that matters is how much you are willing to pay for every byte you use in that block, OP just so happened to be pretty unlucky because on the 13th ( a day before he broadcasted his transaction) the mempool size ( there is actually no \"THE\" in mempool but for sake of simplicity) was at an average of 2MB, the average bitcoin transaction is about 250 bytes so roughly 8000 transaction at any given time during that period, so supply is 1MB vs demand of 2MB as an average, in fact in some hours, there were fewer transactions than the block could fill, so miners would happily accept any transaction at the cheapest possible fee.Fast forward the mempool size reached nearly 138MB on the 15th (most likely due to FTX crash, these black swans cause people to transact a lot, either those running away and selling or those who just bought what they call the dip, or those withdrawing their coins from exchanges to safer place).Now since there is way more stuck transaction than the miners can handle, people are willing to pay them more, as I type I randomly checked and saw some transaction right now are paying over 140 sats per Vbyte vs 4 sats OP is paying, so he is going to have to wait until miners run out of those \"expensive\" transactions and then they will include his transaction.The mempool is getting smaller and smaller as I type, and it's likely to shrink even more around Friday night then the 4 sat/vbyte transactions will become attractive again and his transaction will go through, if I had to throw a number at the wall I'd say 30 hours from writing this comment.However, there is really no guarantee on how long one might need to wait, imagine for whatever reason people wake up tomorrow and decide to use bitcoin for daily payments and the average sat/vbyte doesn't drop below 10 sats, this transaction could be stuck forever  , of course, that's extremely unlikely to happen but one should always use a wallet that allows them to react when something like this happens if OP has access to the PKs he could just use another wallet to broadcast the transaction again at higher fees, or -- he could just wait till the weekend.",

I understand now that I was unlucky thanks to your detailed post.Let's hope you are correct on your prediction  Thanks again for your contribution.Your transaction is still stuck and yes you are unlucky due to FTX panic selling. The current mempool still congested so your transaction is way long before it confirms or be rejected by the mempool. If you need this BTC right away the last option you can do is CPFP if you have full control of the wallet where you sent the BTC just like what I said above it can help to push your transaction to confirm.And I think block chain wallet keeps broadcasting the transaction so this transaction will be stuck if the mempool is still congested.",

      "body": "- Well, the only key to solving your problem issues is to use the Transaction accelerator which is provided by some mining pools. In this way, it will allow you to prioritize the transaction by including it in a block mined by the pool, meaning it will be confirmed quickly. And some good transaction accelerators are Antpool and ViaBtc. Now if you like to get a high fee on your transaction you can use RBF(Replace by fee) method will allow you to increase the fee on an unconfirmed transaction to incentivize miners to include it in the block anyway.",
