Developers know that usually gamblers are men and they know that it lures gamblers if they will use sexy girls as a dealer in casino with a various games. It is very common in Blackjack, Poker, or in Rollette, a sexy dealer that you can interact with them, who knows here the sexy dealer Kimberly, the dealer in Infinite Blackjack, or the most I like Brooke, the Texas Hold’em Poker dealer.

I've played with live dealers a few times but none of them really stuck for me, nor did I really ever want to actually interact with them (yes I hate socialization). I do interact with them if they start talking like I think it's basic courtesy to do so if they start it, but if they don't well I'm also perfectly fine with that. I just sit there and play while malding about how shtty my luck is for that day. Quote from: DoublerHunter on August 26, 2022, 11:56:55 PM^ How I wish before to experience sexy dealers in the casino.

The one that makes them look really really mature and clean and professional, just gives them the vibe of being able to talk to you and answer pretty much anything you throw at them.",

I played it few times only so I have no favorite dealers, but I have to say that the dealers from Evolution gaming are nice. There are many beautiful and sexy dealers. I'm not really sure if players take this as a consideration to play the game. If I have to play live game, I would not care about who is the dealer because I want to gamble not to watch the dealer. I can even say that beautiful and sexy girl may change your mindset or your plan while gambling, so be careful and stay on your gambling limit/style.",

Liking women as dealers doesn't really make much difference if you are talking online casinos because you don't have the chance of close admiration or to say a word that can even add some pulse to your \"third leg\" lol. Online female casino dealers are just what you view but for offline, you can have a chance for a date if your game is tight",

Win or lose, both are fine for me but maybe to some they will feel incomplete once they lose and the host of the live game is also boring but if they win, I think that boring feeling will change, more if the win is big enough.The dealer or the host of the live games are not being hired to make jokes in front of the people or to entertained them but their main purpose is only to draw the games or call the results. People shouldn't expect more from them.",
