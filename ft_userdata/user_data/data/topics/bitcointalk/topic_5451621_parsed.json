Via the simple market, on your reliable site (and with a faucet!).",

I understand that regtest could be utilized for development and testing processes, and should be used specifically for that purpose. But sometimes it might require testnet coin to test the platform/project synchronously within the network. Nevertheless, I don't have a high hope that such kind of initiative will go long-lasting, or leading even though it is compared to meme coins/tokens.",

Geth is highly sorted out by testers because it is required for like 90% of testing. Well the same can be for tbtc if there is a demand for it, i mean if we start to have btc20 projects who knows?",
