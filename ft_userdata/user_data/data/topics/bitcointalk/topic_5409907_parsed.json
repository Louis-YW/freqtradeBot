  "content": "I used to put my trust in $RACA but now it turns out to be a complete failure. All of its products were doomed to fail. All the holders are bleeding. So I guess Alex TokFlow was right when he analyzed how RACA manipulated the community in his latest article. It sounds convincing to me as he showed evidence using data from TokFlow AI which is quite clean and reliable.

      "body": "Raca was a scam token. Its product was only a thing to fool its investors. Basically raca developers have not competence to create a proper product. There's no doubt if this token was going dead. This time the marketcap was only around 140 millions dollars but i think if that was still overrated. I was seeing it based from the various things. Metamon was the worst thing that i have ever seen in the crypto gaming platforms after SLP.",
