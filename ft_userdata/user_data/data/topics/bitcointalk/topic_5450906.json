It means that people and businesses are adopting Bitcoin and integrating it into their systems. The higher transaction means that the amount of people using this technology is growing at good rates.QuoteBitcoin Transaction Breaks Past Records in 1 May 2023 So What Does This Transaction Growth Indicate For The Future?This transaction growth can bring positive results as it shows that the use case of Bitcoin is increasing and many businesses are implementing it into their systems. It can also be a cause of concern for the price of Bitcoin because it can go down if the selling pressure gets high. Although, it doesn't work that way but the possibility still arises.",

      "body": "My opinion would have been entirely different had the majority of these transactions not Ordinals. But since 54% of this all-time record is made up of Ordinals, there's not much to say except perhaps that Ordinals have probably clicked and that miners are probably happy that there's a considerable increase in fees because of them. However, this is probably not something to be really excited about, and does not really represent growth in adoption, if one is of the belief that Bitcoin transactions should remain monetary.",

And I noticed this a while back when I couldn’t get a 10 sat per byte transaction to confirm anymore.Seems to be getting more and more expensive to make Bitcoin transactions. Today you would need to use 50-60 sat to get a confirmation within the hour. Almost as much as an ETH transaction pretty much.",

Honestly I'm not really interested in that chart because it will prevent people from making transactions, imagine now one transaction is charged at 50 sat/vB or the value of $ 1.97 with an estimated time of 24 hours (https://bitcoiner.live/) it's quite expensive .",

I don't think we can really make price-related decisions/conclusions based off of this.I believe that it is contributed by the increase of Segwit usage since 2017. Especially since 2021, the Segwit usage has been increasing a lot. Segwit usage chart shows that its adoption and actual usage has good growths after about one or two years.It looks like Segwit usage is breaking its cap and will make a higher area soon.If more people use Segwit for their transactions, Bitcoin blocks will possibly have more total transactions because of its advantage in transaction size.",

Now most of educated person entering into crypto and the first thing one learn will be Btc. This number of transaction will increase more if some big countries allow Btc deals like UAE",
