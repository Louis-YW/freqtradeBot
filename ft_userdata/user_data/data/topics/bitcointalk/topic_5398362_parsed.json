How can one possibly invest all they have worked for in a project like Luna, that is basically inviting trouble for yourself, to look at it from another angle, investing all you have into any project whatsoever is breaking the rule of thumb of not investing more that you can afford to lose, which is also another mistake for users who went contrary to that.This has been reiterated times without number, many of this altcoins are pump and dump/short term coins, and you have to really be careful with them, take profit once you get them, as a matter of fact if you do not have any plans of attempting to get rich quick, then you should avoid them completely and invest with Bitcoin, the thing is Bitcoin is a long term project that requires patience, so you must eliminate any thought of a get-rich-quick scheme. What makes Bitcoin a whole lot different is that you can be certain that despite any correction phase/plunge, sooner or later it will rise back up, the same can't be said for most altcoins, quite a lot of them dump, and that is the end of it.",

Yeah, life is actually a process we all must take one step at a time, and this is one concept everybody needs to understand, because even those at the top today were ones a beginner, so it's just a matter of time as long as you keep doing the right thing, you will surely arrive.It is better to achieve a goal working on the right track than taking short cut that never last. So i advice everybody to always be proud of who or what ever rank they are on the forum, and interact with a clear mind, and growth shall come at it's due time.QuoteLuna might have taken away all you ever worked for, be strong and keep moving for you are not alone, we all are in this together, let's draw strength from each otherThis is the biggest shock in crypto and Luna holders, because i wonder how they must be feeling right now, because i myself can run mad seeing my $2000 turn to $150...

Could Luna possibly be the then next to BTC? Â There's no how someone will invest all his savings in a project like Luna.Meanwhile a situation like this makes some people claim Â victim of what didn't happen to them.Well I see this is a bad period for everyone, if you are not caught in Luna, you will likely get caught in order coins But it's better to get caught up in btc than to get caught up in altcoins.Op I like your lines of advice and motivations",

I hope people that lost to Luna will next time know that it is good to know that they are gambling with altcoins, next time, it would be better to convert to bitcoin once they earn from altcoins because altcoins are more volatile during bear market. Luna was a painful as it falled abruptly and significantly.",

Even those that give the investment advices always put a disclaimer that it is not an investment advice, that one need to do his own research. Such grudge do exist in real. There was a close guy of mine who lured me into a ponzi scheme costed in sheep clothing. I didn't know. I trusted the guy and invested $2000. Not knowing that the guy only invested $50 and reap me off 15% referral of my $2000 and withing 2 weeks he made about $10,000 and the scheme crashed while I was only able to get back $200 as a return of investment. I didn't act as if something happened to me, I forgave him because he didn't rob me but the grudge is still in my mind. As my guy, I was expecting him to atleast reimburse me a little, but he didn't.",
