Tagging an account with member rank won’t do much good because the scammer can create a new account on the forum again. $350 is a lot of money and the scammer wouldn’t mind losing a member account for that.",

Member rank? The scammer is a newbie, so if he wants to scam again on the forum it will be easy for him to create another account. In any case, in general, you should take many precautions before buying anything P2P on the Internet. Contacting a stranger with unknown or no reputation to buy something you want and sending him the money first has a high risk.Flag supported btw.",

(then search how this works on telegram).Of course I'm not gratuitously accusing anyone here, what would I get out of it? This placement of yours is biased to say the least.The reason I created this topic is to help other people who may suffer the same financial loss that I suffered because of this scammer.I know I will never get that money back....",
