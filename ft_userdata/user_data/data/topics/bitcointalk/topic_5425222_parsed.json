I already commented it some time ago in another thread: I remember seeing in an interview a psychiatrist saying that very rarely people who commit crimes admit they have done something wrong. In other words, the one who rapes a 9 year old girl justifies it by saying that she \"provoked him\", and things like that.That's why I'm not surprised that now this asshole comes out saying that he hasn't done anything wrong. The only thing I hope is that he spends many years in jail.",

Of course, he can't label himself a criminal, or do you believe someone that has not been tried by a court of competence to be preaching guilt? BSF is certainly guilty as far as the documentaries I watched about him are concerned, there are many possible charges that would be filed against home when the time comes.What you referred to is just an interview, and I know he would say what his lawyer(s) advised him to say. However, his innocence remains paramount unless a court decides otherwise. So, let's give investigators a chance to do their job as we seatback and watch.",

Especially since most of the tweets at that time were denying the rumors that the platform was in a bad financial position.Problem is this SBF and his fraud gang is in fifth position of mega-donors for the 2022 midterms USA elections, we are talking about almost 40 millions USD according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Election Commission data (financing both parties candidates aligned with his philanthropic vision of so-called \"effective altruism\"   )so they definitely  had gained some friends among the people who matter.And this situation sucks even worse, if possible, if you compare it to the one of that Tornado Cash developer who has been qarrested in the Netherlands and seems like Dutch authorities decision was the result of a direct request by the US authorities because they consider ( particularly their OFAC - Office of Foreign Assets Control) Tornado Cash as an enabler for transactions between terrorists and criminals.If this is the case then they should also arrest whoever invented the internet because many criminals use it.",

And the media is not just representing him like he is a misunderstood philanthropist but also wants the people to think that he has no intention of scamming. It wasn't premeditated. If he isn't someone with well-connected parents, SBF would have been in jail already and could end up dead by suicide.",

I am sure he has even hired some of his defense team that would give him the best legal advice and service. Anything he says in this interview can be used against him in the court, that's why he needs to be very careful. I am sure all his statements would be based on the legal advice he has received. Therefore don't expect Sam to speak the truth because he needs to protect himself. But the truth is that he mismanaged people's funds and used them for some incriminating activities. I am sure he would not escape sanctions, if his donation beneficiaries in government doesn't influence his trial.",

My free advice for him, let him buy 5 BTC and become a long-term holder, and with the rest of the money let him rent a small apartment and get a job at McDonald's - of course if mommy and daddy manage to buy him freedom.",

Is a strange expression, as they are usually animals described as sly or intelligent. You have to discount anything he says really, because he is the person ultimately responsible and the way he treated the company was downright criminally irresponsible. He was responsible for a lack of customer funds separation and part of the problem was the side business that was manipulating trades that actually benefited his personal wealth. It feels like the administrator is about to uncover a heck of a lot of bad business practice that has landed FTX where it ended up.",

Even if he did not facilitate fraudulent transactions or sign them off, he would still be liable if he was at all aware of them.SBF is taking the negligence angle here, in which he might concede that he should have been aware of the misconduct that was going on at FTX, but that he was not actually aware of such misconduct, thus subjecting him only to civil liability. Civil liability means fines, not prison time. Keep in mind, every statement SBF gives is under careful advisement of an expensive legal team. This interview wasn't done so he could come clean to the public, it's strictly done to ease pressure the feds might have to indict him by the public. Theoretically, any country that had user funds stolen could levy charges against him, but they don't have jurisdiction. If SBF were to step foot in any of these countries, they could arrest him on the spot.",
