As for me, I will prefer at least 100% annual profit but it also depends on the amount of money that you put in it. The higher the money the lower you will want the risk to be and the more the lower the risks, the lower the return in percentage.",

My question is, is this return acceptable, or in your opinion, what would be an acceptable or good return?Yes, that's an acceptable return but are you able to prove that it can happen to you through trading? How many times did you back tested that? Having an specific percentage of profit or ROI annually is hard to hit. It's because this is a volatile market and you will never know how much you'll be earning through trading. While you can actually make good money if you've got that percentage and then you've got a huge capital, that makes sense but to think of how much exact it is is like that might not happen. Another thing, this topic belongs to the Trading Discussion.",

Many traders will want something more risky that 20% which can promise a some more profits, but winning no matter how small is better than losses.But since there are no guarantees, even with backtesting there is no guarantee of profits.",

My question is, is this return acceptable, or in your opinion, what would be an acceptable or good return?Of course yes, any form of profit is good when it’s consistent. 20% is already an insane percentage for fixed profit yearly when you have high capital invested. Banks only offer below 5% while most defi platform offer below 10% APY with their stablecoin and top coin staking. But this acceptability on the percentage still varies on how much margin you are using because it’s useless to have 20% profit while the total profit in fiat value is just a penny. To be precise, it’s based on your preference on the profit amount to categorize it as good but 20% profit generally speaking is already above good return.",

My question is, is this return acceptable, or in your opinion, what would be an acceptable or good return?Getting an average return of 20% per year is quite good if you trade - in fact it is still better than the return on my bitcoin investment in the last 10 months. So far I've had 15% returns in the last 10 months - but this is still worth enough for me to accept as a holder.The thing is investing and trading are of course different - but in most cases I think traders always have a hard time maintaining their return percentages consistently. I don't know how honest you are about the annual percentage return on your trades - but I don't think you need to lie about it. 20% is pretty good - it's your profit, not someone else's.Quote from: tabas on October 01, 2023, 07:45:53 PMQuote from: cryptobeestrategy on October 01, 2023, 07:04:59 PM-snip-Another thing, this topic belongs to the Trading Discussion.It has been reported.",

Then maybe you set a target of 40% as the percentage that is now a good return and then you start getting it and it becomes no longer enough again. In a straightforward sentence, I mean any percentage you see as a good return is only good until you start getting it. To someone who has never recorded 20% annual good return, that target is good for them, for another person who has had that return, it no longer will be acceptable, a higher target will be needed.",

On the other hand, with the bull market, if you are doing worse returns then just holding... Well results are obvious just by comparison, right?But i have to say that you are setting bar pretty low with only 20% gains.",

My question is, is this return acceptable, or in your opinion, what would be an acceptable or good return?How do you know that you can make up to 20% profit every year in trading? I'm not sure if you backtested your strategy for a year or just a couple of days. If you backtest for one year, I can be sure that you will reach that level of profit. For me, you will not only be able to reach 20% profit next year because the halving phase of Bitcoin will happen. We know from the history of Bitcoin that as long as the halving phase starts, after that, the price of Bitcoin will increase. It's a huge profit if you compare it to your annual income from the Bank.",

My question is, is this return acceptable, or in your opinion, what would be an acceptable or good return?It's good. I say anything above your capital is good enough and can be considered as a success already, anything past that is just a bonus. Even more so if this was a stable annual return (which I doubt, but hey who knows), heck even a 10% stable return is more than enough to be called a success imo. I'd say judge it for yourself still though, 20% may look small if your capital was small in the first place so you might not really feel it. Depends on how you feel about it, but with a smaller capital I'd rathe risk it for possible bigger gains.",

The aim of trading is to seek profits, whatever it is, even 1 percent if one trade is more than enough. Sometimes what makes trading a loss and a waste is greed, the desire to get more even though the market is no longer able to move in the direction we are going.",

Terra collapsed because of their high APYs which failed to maintain when bankrun happened in May 2022.I want to ask you, 20% is a good rate but if it is a figure you get from back-testing (even one year backwards), it does not guarantee you will get a same APY when you are in actual trading with the strategy moving forwards.What will be your risk management if the 20% APY fails in actual trading?",
