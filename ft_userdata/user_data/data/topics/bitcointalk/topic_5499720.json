We're talking about a country that was trying to introduce CBDC for years which is everything that bitcoin stands against. IMO china is playing its own game and that game revolves around controlling its citizens, faking whatever it can, making money and weakening other countries. China banned bitcoin because it was hard to control and gave people some freedom which they took and begun to move money out of China and that could not be allowed to happen, since money and people are both the property of CCP.",

That's a pretty damn big deal.I have been lucky enough to obtain a digital yuan \"hardware\" wallet set, as well as an individual wallet with some digital yuan funded on it.. I like to collect stuff from oppressive regimes ( those who don't study history, are bound to repeat it )",

Ethereum is not included in the cryptocurrency market as of now and I will not even advise anyone to invest in it. I have made the mistake and I will never do again. The only time I will still invest in Ethereum again, it is when Ethereum has fee-less or transaction without fee then I will invest if not even $0.005 fee as a transaction fee I will not invest. Ethereum is nonsense. When people were saying it I thought they were playing but now I have confirmed with my experience. Ethereum should be abandon by real bitcoiners.

However, i don't think it changes anything, China has not lifted any ban they had on crypto, so this isn't a sign of anything positive for BTC in that country.I don't know why some people are so concerned about the direction China has taken concerning BTC, they have already chosen a path and it is easy to understand why. Based on how things are run over there, they prefer things like cbdc, something that would give them more control over their people and surely not a decentralized money they cannot control.",

And probably this is the reason why they choosen Ethereum, who knows, they just want to rub it in with Bitcoin ethusiast around the world and says that they hate it and that they are going to support Ethereum and call it whatever they wanted it to be. However, it doesn't mean that Ethereum will suddenly grow just because of this announcement. On the other hand, it might backfire on Ethereum itself as there could be a lot of speculations on China giving a nod to a crypto that is very centralized.",
