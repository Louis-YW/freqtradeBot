      "body": "As mentioned above BestChange has a list of exchanges that support BTC -> PayPal: https://www.bestchange.com/bitcoin-to-paypal-usd.htmlBut there are things to keep in mind here:- The funds are sent as goods and services, so the transaction is subject to more fees (taken by PayPal).- Some of these platforms have hidden fees.- Speed: They all run in the manual or semiautomatic mode so your transaction might take a few hours to process.The alternative that I would suggest is P2P trading using either Paxful or LocalCryptos. You will have to be extra cautious since you will be dealing with other individuals, but it should be faster, and even cheaper than the above platforms.",

I can't really remember why exactly (maybe the lack of protection when dealing with digital goods?) but for as long as I can remember, PayPal was not something that exchanges were interested in. I've been in the crypto scene for so many years, and the only reputable exchange I can remember using PayPal is Virwox.com which shut down a couple of years back.So once again, if you want to minimize (and not eliminate) the fees, P2P trading is your best bet.",

But you can try the P2P in Binance there is no fee for exchanging your Bitcoin and receiving them directly into your bank. I can't find any other exchange that can able to exchange crypto and receive them directly to your bank or card.Or if you are living in the US you can try Cashapp and exchange your Bitcoin into cash and withdraw them directly to your bank account or via Cashapp card with a $2 fee(They only support Bitcoin).",

Since they offer free Paypal payouts with coinbase exchange, then if they have partnerships with other platforms, the possibility of withdrawal will be available.and you can still withdraw indirectly using your bank account.",

Sadly however my Coinbase account is closed so this won't work for me anymore.Considering pp's transaction fees which are usually quite high, it looks like it's the only exclusive partnership between coinbase and pp to set the withdrawal fee completely free.Afaik, there is no limit to the number of PP account holdings for each customer. Why don't you create a new coinbase account with the identity of your family that you most trust (eg your wife) to connect to your alternative PP account?",
