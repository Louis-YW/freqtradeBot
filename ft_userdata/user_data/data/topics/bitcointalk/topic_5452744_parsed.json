You can choose to have at least 2-3 altcoins and so you will have a solid portfolio with that. I'd rather have a few altcoins that I invest with greater sums than to diversify it with small amounts to many of them. But if this is your approach, good luck as you'll never know what will be the future of these altcoins of yours.",

Instead of investing a small amount in those 10 altcoins, you just focus on the 3 coins you like the most and think have the most potential. That way it will bring better profit for you. One more thing, I advise you not to invest too much in old altcoins like DOT and NEAR...there is no guarantee they will continue to grow in the next bull season. You need to learn about the history of the altcoins market, most of which failed to achieve new ATHs and were replaced by potential new altcoins. Investing in altcoins is very risky, so be careful.",

I think of a proposal that you can refer to, about adding investments to portfolios with obvious criteria like altcoin top (ETH, BNB, DOT,...) but in my opinion only one is needed. Choose from them, new but potential altcoins (ARB, SUI, APTOS,..) and low altcoins including trending altcoins and shitcoins that you can count on to deliver profit.And of course it's also important to establish the return goals you want, or the time you should expect them to be, risk and return is always abound in any investment, so always do your research anything.",

If you dont want to hold Bitcoin as it is safest, yet give less profit, then there is no place for ETH in your portfolio, as it is basically same BTC.",

I think you should find promising projects by your own. Because it is have to be your choice to invest into something, not an action you did after someone point you on something. However, we might give you some hints, such as examine what is trendy now, and dont invest in it, because current trend has been for too long already and is about to change. Start with figuring out what were market trends since 2017. Usually they last for 6-12 months. Find them all and invest in something different what projects offer.",
