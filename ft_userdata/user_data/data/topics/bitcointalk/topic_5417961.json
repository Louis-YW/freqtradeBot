I would give a prize for the best analysis, which could consist of 0.0025 or 0.005 Bitcoin in current purchasing power or whatever it is at the time I publish the thread (between $50 and $100 if you prefer).I'm pretty sure I wouldn't break any rules with it and that I shouldn't have to ask permission but I'd rather ask with this thread just in case.",

By adding a Bitcoin prize, it becomes incentivized posting which belongs in Games and Rounds. But Mods or Admins can make an exception, so I'd say ask either Cyrus, hilariousandco, mprep or theymos if you want such an exception.",
