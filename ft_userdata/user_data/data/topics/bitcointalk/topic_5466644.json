      "body": "First of all it depends on what source of income you have, if it is steady one like wages or salary then the best thing or the most convenient way is to set aside nothing more than 20 to 25% from this income, this can at least be considered a losable amount than anything higher. The DCA strategy should be either weekly, bi-weekly or monthly depending on when you usually receive payments. Continually do this without looking the price movement of bitcoin because waiting for just dip or bearish period isnâ€™t a proper DCA strategy. You can simulate your DCA strategy using this tool and to see how your strategy will work out",

Dca is a very easy strategy to implement and the investor makes the decisions based on their personal financial situation. There are many topics talking about dca on the forum that you can search and learn from, but what you really need to know is that you should buy without considering the price of BTC, but as for when to buy or how much to buy, it depends on the investor.",

A simple rule: whenever I have additional income, I invest in Bitcoin, gold, and stocks, while trying to limit my investment in Bitcoin to a thousand dollars per month. It may decrease or increase, but the average is always like this, and perhaps after we witness the new ATH, this amount may decrease to 500 due to the bearish approach of the price of Bitcoin in that period, and then the other 500 dollars will be transferred to gold or stocks. The end of the strategy will be to collect 200k to 400k and then I can think about buying a good apartment.",

So if you can invest 100% of your income in 30 days, that means that is what you can do it. But some people can only invest under 50% of their income because they have bills and other things so they have to adjust between investments and others.I might use 10%-20% but it depends on my monthly financial position. The percentage amount often will not be the same for the following month because several expenses are not fixed in size. But so far, it's been going well and I've even managed to keep a little money in the bank.Everyone who has been investing in Bitcoin for a long time will adjust their budget and expenses accordingly. And if their expenses are not too large and they also don't have difficulty using a rather large amount of money to invest in Bitcoin, that is an amount they can afford, and so is what we do.",

      "body": "A better question is \"What is percentage of rest of your income after spending for life expenses to use for DCA in Bitcoin?\"Because it relates to your risk management too. You can not use all your income or 90% of your income if you don't have other source of money to pay life expenses or 10% of your income is not enough for it. If you over DCA, you will face with self-forced selling your bitcoin when you even don't want to do so.It also relates to your total income as if it is not enough for your life expenses, to survive, you can not DCA so if you say I spend 0% of my income for DCA bitcoin, it sounds very bad but in reality you have no choice if your income is too low. In an opposite case, if a person earn x10 more than you, lives in a same area, but say he spends 0% of his total income for DCA bitcoin, it sucks.",

It depends on a countless number of things, the type of responsibilities someone has and above all, how much someone is making on a regular basis. If we stick with \"what portion of your overall income\" idea, there is so much variation to still be considered before sticking to a plan that someone else might suggest. If someone is making $100,000 a month and is investing 50% of that into Bitcoin because it feels right and the lifestyle allows to do it and take the risk, maybe no kids or family is involved and no mortgages have to be paid back, then I guess there is no issue with that. But if someone has to feed 2 kids and pay a mortgage for house, I would say that 50% is too much even when the person is making $10,000 a month. I think it's just not really helpful to hear from someone how much is invested in Bitcoin. Whether it is 5%, 20% or 50%, without any background info those numbers lack meaning for anyone else.I guess in relative terms the more someone is making, the higher the percentage can be because that person could cut down on many things if necessary.",

But I have a plan to increase it to at least 15% next year. By the way, being consistent in doing DCA is quite challenging for me because I am a freelance designer, right now I got a contract so I still got a semi-stable income, so I can still consistent, it will be much harder if I got no contract and my income is based on the project I got monthly.",

Actually, I am getting payments in BTC, and that same BTC amount I earn, I hold them and only withdraw the amount that I need. But most of the time I try not to withdraw any satoshi from them because that's against the DCA. The point is, that I do not have any specific amount of BTC that I collect or accumulate after a specific period of time. I just accumulate randomly and the amount/time is so random. But as I said before, I am happy with my strategy as I am used to it now. As, sometimes, I have to face difficulties, for example, when the market comes down and I have to withdraw money and I am at a loss, So, I try not to withdraw the amount, but instead use the money that I have already in Fiat. Even, I try to save as much money as I can in the dip time period. But, fortunately, I have been able to accumulate a good amount of satoshies and I'm happy. Now, I hope I will be able to hold them till the next ATH.",

In any case, for anyone who's earning a comfortable and competitive salary grade, I say you should put in anywhere between 1-10% of your total earnings in a month on bitcoin if you're looking to invest using DCA. And this goes for whatever type of DCA strategy you're into, whether it's bi-monthly, monthly, or every other month. The whole point of investing in DCA anyway is to just make sure you have a stake at a valuable asset like bitcoin without breaking the bank by putting in a large amount of money in one go. Once you're able to do this, all you ever need to worry is how much more you could invest in, but for beginners who are just starting to dip their toes into crypto, I say you invest this much and you're good to go.",

I don't want to pinpoint Bitcoin only because I'm also investing in the Stock Market.I know that the bull run is coming in a few months (possible), but I value security more than profits that's why this year, I started investing into dividend stocks so that it can give me quarterly dividends. In that way, I'm still earning money without doing anything. As for Bitcoin, I'm slowly accumulating more in preparation for the upcoming bull run. TBH, I can go to as high as 50% or even as high as 60% of my monthly salary to invest, and I can still afford to lose it if sh*t happens. After all, I don't have that much expenses still. If I'll give one piece of advice to newbies out here, I think it will be to invest wisely, and always use your brain not your heart because emotions will most of the time will lead you losses.",
