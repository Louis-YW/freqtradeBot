      "body": "Try your local bank or ask a friend or family, its not quite normal behavior to open an account in a forum and ten minutes later ask strangers for a loan.The normal thing to do is to present yourself, show who you are and your intentions, and maybe a couple of months/a year later it could be OK to ask somebody here for a loan when you proved yourself honest.If i was in need of $35 i would ask some friend and i would have the money ten minutes later.Its just strange... i donÂ´t understand why totally new accounts go in and straight ask for a loan, they cant for real believe that somebody would send money to a total stranger.I am saying this with all respect.But maybe focus on something else instead of trying to get a loan is the first way to go.",
