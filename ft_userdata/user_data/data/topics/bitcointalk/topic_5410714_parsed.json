  "content": "Hello collectors! So with the recently released Cardsmiths Currency Series, I decided to dig up my old unopened Geekoid Duo cards. I initially planned to NOT open these packs, but after seeing how popular the Cardsmiths release was, and how Geekoid fizzled out into obscurity I decided to finally open them.Wouldn't you know it after opening all eight packs, I came to 75% completion on the set cards... Funny how that works out, eh? I am willing to split 50/50 reward with anybody who can help me complete these sets to finish the seedphrase. The Geekoid website is working somewhat, although janky and with many timeouts, so I don't quite know where to find the potential wallet amounts, or if these have already been redeemed. IIRC, there'd be multiple complete sets and first it was essentially come first serve, so this may all be moot.Let's see if we can put our cards together.Thanks!",
