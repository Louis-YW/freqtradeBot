  "content": "Recently I came across a query where I suggested that We cannot post in the \"All English\" language in a local board or it is not recommended at least. Yes, i know that if the posts are a mixture of English & local language, then it is fine. Even if some posts are being done in pure English, they are ok but if a person has a post history where he only insists to speak in English on a local board, what do the rules of bitcointalk say in this regard?",

Local language post can only be posted on their respected locals.",

As per the Nigeria local board, English is also allowed on the local board since the general language, which is Nigerian Pidgin, is just a little different from English itself.Â But a local board, to me, will be more interesting if the natives of the place can communicate in their respective languages; that's what makes it a local board, so that they themselves will be the ones who could possibly understand themselves better.",

And more over its called a local board for a reason where you get to socialize with your own styles.",

They know you're not a native speaker of the local language they speak - so posting in English is fine.

The same applies to the Indian or Pilipinas board.I want to draw your attention to the pattern of English spread across local boards. See, in the first four local boards you listed, English cannot be used. You wonder why. It's because English is not the official language in those countries. And in the second list of countries you listed (Nigeria, India, the Philippines. You could add Pakistan), English is the official language. That is why you can write in English in these local sections.That is, the formula is simple: if English is the official language in the country, then you can write in English on this local board. Otherwise, no.",

The same applies to the Indian or Pilipinas board.I think if we need help for something solid, not spam, not troll, not scam, we can make an English post in a local board to ask their opinions, guides ... but it is best if we do it as bilingual way.The post should be- In English, with original content.- In that local language, with a translation from Google or any translation tool. A poster must note that part is taken from a translation tool.Why do we need bilingual?- Locals might not understand English, so the translation is needed.- The translation might not express all and correct meaning of the original content so we need to have the English (original) version. Locals who can understand English will better communicate with us.If we can do it in global (English) board, it is better.",

So far, I haven't been banned for it I think this is also perfectly okay. In your case, it is also a special case - if u can call it that. Through your services like your weekly updates about the trustlists, D1 + D2 member and your merit data analysis you are omnipresent... atleast for the german local area. If there are any issues or questions, I've been quite happy that u have commented briefly and to the point by urself.These updates are very much appreciated and therefore can be overlooked. Besides that other users are always helpful - if necessary - to translate ur texts (which are already really limited to the essentials). Therefore I would say that this should not be a problem and you should be safe from a ban!",
