  "content": "I have been in this crypto market for a while now. 2 years plus if I remember correctly. I have seen BTC at $29k when I first entered the crypto market. Then after some struggle, BTC went up so high reaching almost 70k making it the all-time high price of BTC. Then in 2022 it just falls and where it stands now. I have seen it grow and fall too. Current market condition is so unpredictable. But I have made my own analysis, and now I know that every time BTC has fallen in the past, it just bounces back to the top to grow stronger than before. As whom holds more than 1 BTC now, I think you guys are in this crypto world for a long now. How does it feel to hold it in Bear market? And what would you suggest to the people entering the market recently and having thoughts about selling their share of BTC? What's your advice to them?As for my advice, I would say \"Try to do some research on Bitcoin's past and see what it has achieved. If you dive deep, you will see it's potential and would never sell until the right time\"Edit: I said 1 BTC+ and there's a reason for that. I know how human mind works. If you have less than 1 BTC(almost 1) then you will be willing to hold it to make it to the 1. And those who have more than 1 BTC Like 1.5 or 1.2 something like that. They will most likely sell the other and keep the 1 for the future. I am not here to know who owns the 1 BTC. Just curious, do they do the same?",

Actually, not just on this bear market but also during the bull run.Not just all about holding but the attitude of being patient. You have to be calm at all times because you'll never know how high and low it will be for the price of bitcoin.It's normal to sell when you're in profit and as well as if you're panicking but, if ever you're about to sell then make sure that you're happy about it.",

Quote from: tjtonmoy on December 21, 2022, 06:53:47 PMHow does it feel to hold it in Bear market? And what would you suggest to the people entering the market recently and having thoughts about selling their share of BTC? What's your advice to them?Experienced forum members can still give good advice on this as they have been around this space for some time now, witnessing different bull and bear markets over that time.• It feels frustrating to hold initially as you constantly check on the price, multiple times a day even, only to see it remain stagnant or even drop. You wonder when it would rise and you'll get that adrenaline rush of a bull run. There would also be a lot of dead cat bounces, where it does rise, only to fall back soon after.You need to build your mental resolve and of course, only invest what you can afford to lose.• If you're having thoughts about selling, look at the charts and zoom out to see the larger picture.You likely wish you had bought ten years ago, but even if you had and sold early at any price drop, you'll still have profited nothing.",

What's your advice to them?If you just entered the market recently means you have not made as many losses as people who have been in the market for a longer time and holding more than 1+ bitcoins. I can imagine that for those who had or still have up to 1+ bitcoin are not taking this bear market season as lightly and easily as others who only hold fractions and why not, when they have lost a lot already.  I don't have up to 1 bitcoin but I imagine the advice I will give to people who just entered the market will be sell if you know that the money you have invested is not an amount you can and will want to loose, sell if you cannot be patient.",

OP just said Never sell until the right time. He knows when that is which is once the price hits the all-time high after halving. BTC bull market has a cycle, we all know it goes way up after halving. If a person holds his BTC by that time when he knows the bubble is about to pop, then he might just regret not selling. Yes, I sometimes regret not selling some. I often think of how much I could have gotten if I bought back at the current price.",

Nevertheless, in my opinion, the amount of BTC is quite irrelevant in this case since the majority of us are at a loss of over 50%. Even if you've held since 2012 as Franky1, it'd still hurt thinking that one day Bitcoin would be worth almost $70,000 each. Generally, I'm quite optimistic, despite an approximately 60% loss, because this isn't money that I take into account on a daily basis. Thus, I pretend that I don't have them; it helps keep my mind at peace. I'm hoping that we'll see a recovery in the upcoming few years.It's unlikely that I'll ever acquire a whole bitcoin, but fortunately, the lower prices make it way more affordable than it was a few months ago.",

But I think I still have similar feeling with some people that have gotten to that one bitcoin mark. For new investors, checking the price almost every time might be their current behavior because they might not have the knowledge of how the bitcoin investment system works. Most of them are threatened or scared when the see the price drop. But for investors that have been in the sector for a long time, they are not really scared of the daily or weekly performance of the market because the have a lot of experience concerning the sector. For me, I have decided to totally have confidence in bitcoin, therefore I am not moved to sell my investment anytime soon.",
