  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk community,I wanted to bring attention to a new and innovative solution to reduce our carbon footprint, Carbon NFTs by NFTCar.NFTCar's Carbon NFTs are tied to specific cars that have been scrapped, meaning that for every NFT sold, one ton of CO2 has been removed from the atmosphere. The cost for each ton is $80 USD. The carbon footprint of the car is determined by its age, mileage, and fuel consumption over the next ten years.What's great about these Carbon NFTs is that they are recorded on the blockchain and government registry, so anyone can verify the reduction in carbon emissions associated with each NFT. This ensures that there is no room for fraud or misrepresentation.Air pollution is a significant issue globally, responsible for around 4.2 million premature deaths, with cars contributing up to 80% of air pollution in cities. Carbon NFTs provide an exciting way for individuals to take responsibility for their carbon emissions and make a difference.What are your thoughts on this new technology? Do you think it has the potential to make a significant impact on climate change? Let's discuss.",

Most likely scenario here is that you or your friends own a car stripper bay and you decided that you can make nfts from cars that you would scrap anyway. Because i am pretty sure that those cars you scrap wouln't be polluting anything anymore.Quote from: jacafbiz on April 25, 2023, 07:45:10 PMI don't understand why people continue to promote this Climate change scam, do you know the number of funds that have been pumped into this, the funny thing is that those people in charge of this climate change fund have no understanding of the environment. I don't believe there is any climate crisis except the manufactured one so I don't see the need for this project if not to scam other gullible investors off their BTCDude, there are ton of peer reviewed research and almost every scientist out there agrees on the fact it's real, and you choose to \"believe\" otherwise because you feel like it and maybe one scientist said so?",

      "body": "And before the existence of the NFT, car manufacturers did not pay taxes on environmental pollution? More than 5 tons of CO2 are emitted during the production of one car. And each gasoline car emits 1-2 tons of CO2 per year. And if you calculate how much CO2 is emitted in the production of other products, then these numbers are huge.",

I hope not, as enough people have lost all their money with NFTs and I do not want to see the same thing to keep happening over and over again.",

It's only about the willingness but since some are greedy, they will ask for an exchange first before doing the right thing. This must also be an obligation of the government or the environmentalist but I think there are some actions that are already done. I heard that some time in the future some countries are going to be free from these carbon emissions. This is great and I believe on it.

You must not be surprised on why scams doesn't seem to end.",

Do you think it has the potential to make a significant impact on climate change? Let's discuss.Even if carbon crediting was initiated with the best of intentions, individuals and businesses take advantage of its flaws for their personal gain. The effort to develop our planet is still environmentally friendly, but we should also make procedure improvements and close loopholes. Even if carbon credits have questionable trustworthiness and questionable intentions, they at least have something to do with the environment. And we expect that many new projects will fix the technology's inefficiencies and ensure that it truly is environmentally beneficial. I think it's a good sign when individuals prioritize the environment when using technology. Even some businesses gimmic their own products or services, but it is still worthwhile. Even though technology is causing damage to the environment, it can still advance and make the world a better place. Carbon NFTs may have had certain problems at first, but they can and should be taken care of.",
