  "content": "Play n Go is my favorite slot provider but I only love Arturian Legends themed slots.There are so far 5 of them but I want to include only 4 as the last one Clash of Camelot does not fit in the same way of game play mechanics as the other 4 do.All the slots I am listing give you up to x100 multiplier in different ways.I am ranking based on my personal opinion which slot is better and why it is better.1.The Green KnightThis is for me the top slot from Play n Go where in the bonus round you have a guaranteed x25 and a guaranteed x100 spin even if you don't win anything.This though takes more time to give you the bonus round compared to the other games I will list,usually after 250-350 spins in average but it can go up to over 1000 without giving you the bonus round so be careful with this one.2.Diamonds of the RealmThis for me is the second best Arturian Legend slot and in here you need to collect Diamonds to get further,you trigger the free spins with 3 Diamonds and start at x2 multiplier,you need to collect diamonds to go to x5,x10 and finally x100 multiplier.While in this game you will get the bonus round more often than in Green Knight,in here rarely you will go to the last round,this game has the best mechanics as you don't need to hit a wild to get the multiplier like in the other games,in here to any combinations the multiplier will be active if won.3.15 Crystal RosesThis is the third best as in here the bonus you will get it extremely rare at over 500 spins in average but you can get some boost sometime as you have 15 crystal roses that can be lit and if you happen to get 15 of them you win the legendary free spins,15 free spins at the x100 multiplier.In this though you need a wild to get the winning combination at x100,if you hit a normal win without a wild you don't get it and this is a big turn off for most of such games.4.Swords and Holy GrailThis is exactly the same as Diamonds of the Realm where you get the bonus often and rarely go to the final round of x100 but in here we have the same problem which is you need to hit a wild in order to get the active multiplier and that is why I listed this game last.So my personal advice to anyone wanting to try these slots it is better to play Green Knight of course when you have a big balance and when you don't you need to play Diamonds of the Realm",

      "body": "I have seen the experiences shared by several other members about their games in the Play'n Go provider several times and it is indeed quite satisfying if they manage to get a win because in the Play'n Go provider gamblers can get big wins.However, after I tried playing there myself, it turned out that it was difficult to be able to win slot games at this provider, even the minimum bet was quite high compared to other providers.Is it possible that slot games at this provider can only be won for rich gamblers who have more money so they can play longer until they manage to get a big jackpot.To be honest, now I always have limits when I gamble, so if the funds I have set run out before I get a win, I will stop playing, so this Play'n Go provider doesn't seem very suitable for me, who only has limited betting skills.",

      "body": "I've played The Green Knight a few times and when in the bonus round it's hard to get hits. You get 1 guaranteed spin on each multiplier but have to land 2 green knights to get 5 spins on that multi. Normally you get the 5 spins on the x2 or x5 levels. Rarely on the x25 or x100 levels and even if you get the spins you don't get a win with the big multi very often.",

      "body": "1.The   There's no reason why you cannot use this slot as it is just what this game is for and it helps make sure that you don't end up with a win even with the bonus rounds and it really helps get you in the bonus round.As long as you have a big balance you will still get a boost as you get 15 crystals as is the best possible for most of this game though not as much as you will get in the previous game but this game can be good for you. You need to know all the other slots in the game so take the time to learn a little bit about them to make sure you get everything you are looking for with this game in the right form.    2.Dolphin    This is the third best slot that you will get as they are the most in the slot and you have to use it only to get a bonus round.The King of the Hill is the third best because in here if you get the bonus round they are the best because in here you have to use a big amount of energy for this slot and that is what you will get the bonus",
