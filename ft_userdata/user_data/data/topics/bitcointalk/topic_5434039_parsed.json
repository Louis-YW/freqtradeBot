On top of that add the hundred do thousands of job losses once companies pulled out, a figure that will start to bite around now since a lot of them were generous enough to make a 6 to 12-month payment before firing people, and the hundreds of thousands dead and mutilated in Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands that fled Russia with full pockets, and those were the guys that earned a lot, a real brain drain that will leave its mark for decades.But of course, there will be some that will say Russia is stronk, Russia has resources, Russia this and that but Russia is a shadow of the URSS that had all of those and much more, but still ended in the garbage bin of history! You can't wage an economic war when you're dirt poor and your ally is the one that should tell you a few things about the sanctions that turned the wannabe global power into an economy the size of Denmark but with 50% inflation and unable to feed its population, although it also turned out they are pretty good at killing and hanging their own citizens.The bottom line is that when economics are involved, nationalism and pride are useless, you can lie to yourself whatever you want but this won't change a thing, you can dream of anything you want but this won't do any good either once you wake up, so the right choice is doing something about. And the first step for a population to not fall into this is by not having a dictator in charge, not being a slave terrified of going against the ones that should fear your vote, and stop blaming everyone else for the things you could have avoided.

      "body": "Putin's propaganda covered up and continues to cover up the horrendous consequences for Russia and its citizens due to the military invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions are slowly but surely gaining momentum and their harmful effects will continue to affect the Russian economy even after they are lifted. In 2022, which has already passed, more than a quarter of the Russian budget was spent on the war in Ukraine, and Putin does not hide the fact that next year even more money will be allocated for military needs related to aggression against Ukraine.The sanctions against the Russian Federation imposed in 2022 did not destroy the Russian economy, as was first expected. However, they had a negative impact on many industries - from engineering and aviation to the export of oil and gas and other goods.One of the industries in Russia that has been hit the hardest by the sanctions triggered by Putin's invasion of Ukraine is aviation. Spare parts for aircraft that were previously supplied from other countries are no longer available for Russia. Therefore, in 2022, experts recorded more than 130 dangerous incidents related to aircraft, as well as 28 air crashes, on the territory of the Russian Federation. In a few days of the new year, about 10 dangerous cases have already occurred in Russia.During the first few months, more than 1,000 foreign companies left the Russian market. The Russians lost up to a quarter of their imports, and production in the technology industries fell by up to 80% due to a shortage of components.However, the world continues to impose sanctions against the Russian Federation. Next in line are new packages and the confiscation of Russian assets in favor of Ukraine. Therefore, over time, Russia will feel the consequences of the sanctions more and more.",

The government has printed out the last reserves: the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will start selling yuan to patch up the budget.The Russian authorities decided to turn to the last non-sanctioned foreign exchange reserves to cover the federal budget deficit, which reached historical records at the end of 2022.From January 13, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, in the interests of the Russian Ministry of Finance, will start selling Chinese yuan from the National Welfare Fund on the Moscow Exchange.As the Ministry of Finance announced on Wednesday, operations will be carried out within the framework of the updated “budget rule”: if oil and gas revenues of the budget exceed the base level, the surplus will be used to purchase yuan, if vice versa, the currency will be sold, and the resulting rubles will be sent to the treasury.In January, the Ministry of Finance intends to sell yuan for 54.5 billion rubles - so forecasted receipts of raw material rent will fall short of the plan.https://www.moscowtimes.ru/2023/01/11/pravitelstvo-raspechatalo-poslednie-rezervi-minfin-i-tsb-nachnut-prodavat-yuani-chtobi-zalatat-byudzhet-a30515PS following the results, Russia will also collapse the Chinese Yuan Quote from: Zlantann on January 11, 2023, 07:58:20 PMThings would keep getting worst for Russia unless they end the invasion of Ukraine.

I don't blame him much though, I blame Russians that still allow an authoritarian to rule them for too long in this century. This is not happening in any advanced countries, and no wonder Europe has never been divided like this because of ego and an overdose of power of a villain. Only God knows the extent of the damage his actions and reactions have cost Russia, and this am afraid would linger for centuries to come.They (the Russian government) are in the business of deceiving people through media but the reality is now getting clearer in the sight of everyone. There is no way such weighty economic actions meted out to the country would not have both immediate and long-term effects, the effect is only just unfolding, and Russia might be in a sorry state with time.According to Thehill on a news credited to Forbes Ukraine, Russia has spent about $82b in their senseless invasion of Ukraine.I view this as an additional pain for the country aside from the economic brunt facing. The money they were supposed to use for the development of their country is now being channelled to the destruction of humanity to the detriment of Russia itself. This is a big shame!",

Underestimating events is a typical media trend. They did it when they said \"Hillary had a 97% chance of defeating Trump in the 2016 elections\". They said that Trump had already lost.

Unemployment may not be too high (although it is easy to check one hundred is also a fake), but income is a question. Today, if you do not take Moscow and St. Petersburg, 60% of the able-bodied population live at the level of the poverty line. Otherwise, where, for example, does the debt to banks of 27 trillion rubles come from? 90+% of these debts are conditionally middle class. Homeless people are not given loans and mortgages, just as they are not given to the unemployed. This means that the working population has very low incomes.Food. Many, but there are also nuances:Again, judging by Moscow and St. Petersburg, everything is not bad. But then ... Reminds me of shops from the late USSR By the way - do you want to know from what grain mass bread is produced in Russia? I'll tell you - fodder! This is grain for feeding livestock, if it's easier  Or what chemistry is used to make dairy products? Read even the official studies of the dairy market Energy security ? 50% of the population is supplied with gas, about the same number have water supply and sewerage. Oil storages are already full almost \"to the eyeballs\", and there are almost no gas storages - Russia almost always stored gas in the Ukrainian GTS. Excesses of produced gas and oil lead to the rapid conservation of deposits. But Russia cannot reopen it - it is a technologically backward country, and even in critical sectors of the economy it is 90% dependent on Western technologies. And you are talking about safety here Developed industry? Are you seriously ? And what is developed - give examples that can be checked? Maybe Russia itself produces nails?  Russia is a technologically backward RAW appendage of the West, dependent on Western technology and money.do not try to pass off Russia as something less significant for the world, the only thing that modern Russia has succeeded in is terrorism, military and economic.

Let's not underestimate the enemies and recognize that Russian economists did marvels with a very bad situation on their hands. The gold standard and harsh foreign currency policies worked quite alright to stabilize the ruble, and while people did get poorer and prices went up, we're talking of people who largely went through the harsh 90s and are also generally used to bad economic conditions and barely surviving but still existing. The goal of sanctions, as I understood it at the beginning of the full-scale war, was to bring Russia's economy down so much that it won't be able to wage the war any more because of not having resources to maintain its army and weaponry. Clearly, this isn't working, as Russia can still gather its mobilized people and throw away their lives in Ukraine but also inflict some suffering upon Ukrainians, it can still buy drones from Iran, and it can maintain its economy on a very poor level but just enough not to have a societal collapse.I do think things will get worse for Russia and that sanctions will inflict more long-term damage, but it's going to take time, while Ukraine, naturally, would prefer to win the war as soon as possible.",

Let's not underestimate the enemies and recognize that Russian economists did marvels with a very bad situation on their hands. The gold standard and harsh foreign currency policies worked quite alright to stabilize the ruble, and while people did get poorer and prices went up, we're talking of people who largely went through the harsh 90s and are also generally used to bad economic conditions and barely surviving but still existing. The goal of sanctions, as I understood it at the beginning of the full-scale war, was to bring Russia's economy down so much that it won't be able to wage the war any more because of not having resources to maintain its army and weaponry. Clearly, this isn't working, as Russia can still gather its mobilized people and throw away their lives in Ukraine but also inflict some suffering upon Ukrainians, it can still buy drones from Iran, and it can maintain its economy on a very poor level but just enough not to have a societal collapse.I do think things will get worse for Russia and that sanctions will inflict more long-term damage, but it's going to take time, while Ukraine, naturally, would prefer to win the war as soon as possible.Greetings from Kyiv Look. For some reason, everyone decided that sanctions are like a toggle switch, or a lethal injection into a vein - once, and that's it, the body cools down! No. Sanctions don't work that way. The sanctions are stretched out in time and have the goal not to try to quickly \"neutralize\", but to make the country's economy, financial system, industry, military-industrial complex suffer an irreversible destructive effect. It's like a boa constrictor that slowly compresses the rings around the victim's body, first immobilizing it, then it becomes difficult for the victim to breathe, and then a crunch of bones is heard. And even if the victim manages to fall out of these embraces by chance, this victim will never become as fast and strong as it was before - the muscles and tendons are already torn, the brain is already damaged from lack of oxygen, the internal organs are damaged and do not work as they should, and rather everything will no longer work as it was until recently, and the skeleton is broken and will grow together for a long time, but crookedly, causing pain later with every movement ...These are sanctions. The USSR held out for more than 10 years until the economy began to suffer. Sanctions against Russia really only work for 6 months. And the scale of the problem is already greater than that of the USSR just before the collapse! So do not underestimate the effect of sanctions!The fact that the terrorist country has some resource - I agree. This is 100 million obedient slaves. It is they who will fulfill the will of the miserable cowardly parody of the Fuhrer, cowardly hiding in the bunker for the last years ...And then everything - emptiness, the rot of the economy, no slaves, NO-THI-NG  !!![moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

If several hundred coffins arrived in these cities every day, there might be protests, but the fact is that Putler sends people from rural areas of Russia to Ukraine, because they mean absolutely nothing to him.In addition, the average Russian is already numb to the point that he is always with the government either out of fear or some kind of pathological loyalty.Quote from: davis196 on January 12, 2023, 12:19:31 PMWhich propaganda should we trust more? Western or Putin's propaganda? Or maybe both are lying a lot, which was totally expected.To begin with, ask yourself who is the victim and who is the aggressor, and then who lies more and for what reasons. If you think that Russia is liberating Ukraine from Nazism, and that everyone who is with Ukraine is a Nazi, then believe that propaganda. When I see that the supposed second world military power of the world is fighting for months to conquer a small town in Ukraine with the help of mercenaries, then everything is clear to me - the worst days for them are yet to come.Even before the sanctions were imposed, relevant experts said that it would take several years for Russia to feel their effect. At a time when such a powerful country has to rely on North Korea and Iran to wage a war, isn't that more than enough proof of how weak they are - well, the other day Putler was mad at a minister because he failed to sign a single contract (if I'm not mistaken, it's about passenger and military planes).",

On top of that add the hundred do thousands of job losses once companies pulled out, a figure that will start to bite around now since a lot of them were generous enough to make a 6 to 12-month payment before firing people, and the hundreds of thousands dead and mutilated in Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands that fled Russia with full pockets, and those were the guys that earned a lot, a real brain drain that will leave its mark for decades.People ignore the fact that a lot of educated and rich people, especially young ones, left Russia and moved in different countries. These people are the core of the country.Who are the core of the success of the country? Educated, young people and the ones who have a capital to make investments into them. When the majority of people who leave your country are in this queue, I don't think that you are doing well in the near future because it takes a lot of time to upbring them.Quote from: stompix on January 11, 2023, 07:51:39 AMBut of course, there will be some that will say Russia is stronk, Russia has resources, Russia this and that but Russia is a shadow of the URSS that had all of those and much more, but still ended in the garbage bin of history! Russia truly has a lot of resources but unlike Norway, those resources aren't used to benefit the society, they are either used for military purposes or to overfill the pocket of corrupt billionaires.USSR was never as strong as people think, quality of life was very low and furthermore, pupils were forced to work in tea plantations too, overall forced labor was used extensively and I sometimes wonder why people dream the soviet union.",

Russia is not geographically isolated and is self-sufficient so my rough estimate for the sanctions to start working is approximately NEVER  You are just wrong I'll even explain why. And I’ll even start with such a statement, which you probably don’t expect from me!So - for 50% of the population of Russia, sanctions will not be noticeable !!!Yes, yes, yes, exactly. I have no nonsense, everything is true!But there is a nuance. Their standard of living is such that it is WORSE TO LIVE IN THE SAME WHERE!!! Sanctions apply to those who have something to lose. And sanctions do not work on the lower strata of the population - as they were the lower strata of the population, they remain at the bottom of society, where it is no longer possible to go lower!Here you are talking about Cuba - have you been there? Have you seen how people EXIST there? The sanctions have done their job - you can't live there, you can exist there! Card products, lack of usual services for normal countries, lack of any choice and OPPORTUNITIES! There is nothing ! This is what I saw in 2011. Then I know Cuba began to change, now I’m not ready to say what has changed there.I specifically drove through Cuba. I thought I was unlucky, I ended up in such a depressive region, albeit a tourist one. It turned out - where I was - it was still \"a good standard of living.\" Believe me - if you are left to live in Cuba for half a year, in a couple of weeks you will be crying with elephantine tears, just to be taken away from there, back, anywhere!Oh yes, and about self-sufficient Russia - a very funny joke, very Tell me - why, 6 months after the imposition of sanctions, Russia ran out of ALL stocks, the sale of gold reserves begins, entire industries stop, and the government hysterically demands to lift sanctions? And the \"great geostrategist\", in fact, a miserable parody of the Fuhrer, is not the first time begging Ukraine for negotiations? Tax increase. impoverishment of the masses, curtailment of all social programs ... Even the relatives of the dead soldiers of the Russian army who are fighting a terrorist war in Ukraine (objectively - terrorists are murderers) are not paid \"coffin\" benefits, deceiving in every possible way (they promised to pay 7 million rubles, they pay from 30,000 to 250,000 rubles in real)",
