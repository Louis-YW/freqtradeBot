  "content": "Hey Bitcointalk members.,I'm facing a problem with the Bitcoin Wallet (beta) on my Android device, which I downloaded from the Play Store. However, I'm here seeking help from the community, as I'm trying to assist a friend who's experiencing this issue.We want toÂ  export the private key from the Bitcoin Wallet. We've managed to export the backup file and extract the seed phrase successfully.(openssl) The trouble arises when we attempt to import the seed phrase into Electrum and detect an existing account. Unfortunately, every time we try, we're met with the frustrating message \"No account exists!\". We have changed the path and all the parameters.Now, here's where it gets interesting. The Bitcoin addresses within the wallet are segwit addresses, \"bc1q\". All transactions are visible on these addresses without any problems -(Mobile). In an effort to resolve the issue, we've useed the Coleman BIP39 tool, using the m/84 path (bip84). Surprisingly, the tool generates different addresses that have never been used.To investigate further, we compared the legacy addresses (starting with \"1\") within the wallet app to the bip32 addresses on the tool, and they match perfectly. (which means that there is no problem with the seed and it is correct) However, when it comes to the segwit addresses, the correct ones don't show up. We've scoured the web for specific paths to try, but none of our attempts have been successful. Even when importing the wallet backup file onto another device, we encounter the same data as on the initial device.The only information we can gather from the app is the extended public key, which starts with \"z\".I'm reaching out to this community in the hopes of finding a solution to this problem and retrieving the correct used addresses. Any help or guidance would be immensely appreciated.Thank you all in advance for your support.Best regards,",

Just to clarify, the legacy addresses in the Bitcoin wallet app are functioning correctly. I have verified this by cross-checking them with the results from the tool, and they match perfectly.However, the issue arises with the segwit addresses (starting with \"bc1q\"). Unfortunately, these segwit addresses do not align between the Bitcoin wallet app and the tool. This becomes significant as the funds are currently held in these segwit addresses.If there are any further insights or suggestions you can provide to help resolve this matter, I would greatly appreciate it.",
