  "content": "I thought for a while now (while = some months) about creating a fresh topic for users offering escrow services.I know there are already two topics on this matter -- Recommended bitcointalk escrow services and ₿ LIST ₿ Bitcointalk's ESCROW providers. However, they are not updated for months. First topic was created in 2017, while second one is from 2013. Author of first topic appears as being last active on Jan 31st but, before that, he was seen online last time in August 2022. And, even if he was online in January, he still did not make any update to his topic. Author of second topic was last seen in November 2022.Excepting that, the lists provided in both topics are not relevant anymore. Some users are not active anymore, such as John K or bL4nkcode. Some turned into scammers, like yogg or bL4nkcode. Some simply don't want to be listed, such as Hhampuz.Having these in mind, on Jan 19th I PMed the users from both topics to ask them if they are still offering their escrow services and, if so, to let me know about any update regarding their conditions.I was thinking to allow a month for replying to me and, in case they would not reply even by then, this would mean that (1) the user is not active anymore, (2) the user is not interested about offering the service anymore or (3) the user does not deserve to be listed anymore. Regarding (3) my thoughts are the following: if you want to offer this service, which implies agility and being fast, how can you do it if you are unable to barely reply to a PM during a month?!So having all these said, about end of February I would like to create this new topic. I believe it's very important to have an up to date thread, containing users with good reputation offering such services, as otherwise someone new, which does not the shady background of other users from the existing topics, may end up cheated or may end up asking for this service from someone which is not active anymore.I created current one to explain why I intend to do this, in case some will ask why I started a new thread if there are already two ones.Excepting the topic about escrow services I am also thinking about launching a new for registering post records. Similar to the issue with escrow services, there is already such a topic: [WALL OF FAME] ᗌ Save your Postcount - Milestones ᗏ (UPDATED: 16. December 2021. In this case, the author -- SiNeReiNZzz -- disappeared after scamming shasan. As a consequence, nobody can update it anymore.And, since a revamped thread for merit records was created after the original one became unavailable, I believe that a similar solution should be adopted in this case as well.The problem is that I don't know if I'll have enough time for updating often this thread. Perhaps someone else can do it, if he is interested and has more time than I have.",

I have topic \"Few Trusted Escrow Providers\"I was not aware of the existence of your topic. Each time I performed Google search for escrow topics I only found the other two topics mentioned in OP. In this case I am glad to see that an up to date topic is there and I will abandon my idea. Maybe we can do something to make your topic more visible? Perhaps a weekly bump? It's important to have your topic be shown in Google searches above the other two topics, as those ones are obsolete.Quote from: shasan on February 01, 2023, 10:35:56 PMEdit:Just removed a few members from my list and soon I will update more.Edit:I have updated the trust rank, removed a few more escrow, and edited the escrow fee.

And need to look up if there is any other escrow service announcement.I already contacted all escrow providers from the other two threads and I have some answers from some of them. I'll share them with you inside your topic, in order to better it even more.Thank you all for your replies and suggestions as well.I will lock this topic, as it's no longer needed, since the problem is already resolved, and I'll continue the discussion inside shasan's own thread.",
