You risk reducing your profit probability from 50% to less than 50%, which is what happens in gambling, as the gambling service will not continue if the return on it is 50% or more.Day trading with a stable return, even if it is 1%, is great, even if it is low, it is better, since in the short term your portfolio continues to grow, and the same in the long term.",

With such a candle move, 5% of your margin is enough to give you a $25 profit, give or take you should be able to make more than $15 a day at an average condition of the market.A 5x should increase your margin total capital to $1500, if the risk-to-profit ratio of any trade you have in mind is low, it will do you no good, I think that original capital is good enough for sweet profit unless now that the market is not stable to open trades.",

For example I am a long term investor, all I do is buy and hold, that's it, I just buy and do nothing else. Some people are traders but not day traders, they buy when it hits a certain low, and sell when it hits a certain high, they trade based on the price, that can be within an hour, that can be in a month. But these people? They are the ones that trade with their analysis all day everyday and constantly. They have to be precise to the minute, and that is why its much harder to do what they do.",

But that experience did not end well for me, So, I took a break from that, and when I began to start it again but stopped by others due to some reasons so till then I never trade in the future.And I am not a trader or scalper but a BTC holder. And I prefer everyone to be one but people do want to do something that could make them pressurized like losing and gaining money. So they start to do trading I know that's not a good factor but it is what it is. So, my strategy, for now, I good and make me less worried.",

If you do like on having that lesser risks on sticking with 1x then its  your choice but going with 5x wont really be that bad but of course you should really be mastering yourself on making that be sustainable so that if you do earn $1 or $2.5 on $500 capital on 1xthen you could eventually earn more as you do go forward or higher in terms of those x's. Strategy? This would really be those common technical approach and certain combinations and varieties of toolswhich it would really be just on the same concept on how its been used and things differ on how you do make out decisions basing up with those indicators. Decision making and other emotional kind of aspector part would really be definitely be different on each other. So you are the ones who would really be finding out on what suits you.",

But it's always better to put leverage only in Bitcoin and at maximum I could say Ethereum because you know that only these two currencies will at least respect some supports when they begin to fall other than that I have seen a lot of currencies falling madly and people getting ripped off everything. Obviously, Stop loss can help but when it comes to leverage trading you can't risk anything. There can be chances you never hit your limit stop loss and the market stop loss might sell your assets at a very low price.",

Every day is not profitable, and 5x leveraging is not really too risky compared to 10x, but sometimes I really do take the risk of using 10x and am always ready to bear the loss.I am not yet trading for now, but when I was dedicated to it, I didn't only trade futures; I also traded altcoins for the normal \"buy/sell\" sport trading on some CEX, and I was doing it daily. Some days, my profile could go as far as $10, depending on how volatile the coin was. My trading capital was not less than $500 as well, and sometimes if I buy a token for like $0.0121 before the next 24 hours, you might see the price has gone up to $0.0129 or 0.013. That was just how I was making money too, but not all the time. Some tokens can just drip to $0.005 after I buy them, and sometimes I will have to wait for up to a week before they can go up again. But if I see another very volatile coin to buy, I don't usually wait that long; I will just buy the new one and use it to recover my loss. It worked for me, Mahn. Back then, there was this coin, \"CHZ (chiliz),\" that profited me about $50 just in one day.",

The important thing in trading is that if you satisfied with your profit of your strategy, then you can keep doing this.

There is a volume and marketcap block that prevents something like that from happening and I believe that we are going to end up with something like that eventually. Life is not that simple and we need to achieve something that is bigger volume to make that happen. Some small token could give you return that is double and you would be happy with that if you are using something small.But, if you want to get a bigger amount and double that, the volume and liquidity of that small cap token may not be enough. This is why its quite important to focus on what you can do, and not what the token can do for you. Just look at the strategy a lot more.",

Also before increasing the trading fund, it is good to make calculations that if bitcoin go against the position that you opened, that how much will you be losing at certain prices. If you are good with the calculation, you can increase the trading fund and follow your strategy. Assuming I started first and increase the leverage, emotion can set in and this can change my trading strategy. Some positions opened are not favouring a trader at the beginning, but because you use low leverage and capable of losing such little amount, the trader will not close the position and later the market can reverse and resulting to profit.",
