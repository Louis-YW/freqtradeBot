  "content": "LoyceV's Avatar and Signature logBackgroundSome users try to cheat signature campaigns by switching their signature back and forth between campaigns twice a week. As part of my convenient service for campaign managers, I now keep logs of signature changes of participants. Example: LoyceBot's signature.This topic is work in progress. I created it before my scripts are ready, because I need it for testing. Feel free to post here already.How to find yourselfClick loyce.club/signatures/<userID>.html or edit your userID into the URL. Example: LoyceBot's signature history.How to joinPost in this topic to start your avatar and signature log. Updates continue after you remove your postEnroll into a signature campaign managed by someone who uses this serviceCampaign managers can request whitelisting to create a list here (see sample format in next post)Campaign managers who use my campaign service don't need to post hereWear any signature and be detected by me in the future, when I add you to increase my historic dataWhitelisted campaign managersCode:Royse777LoyceVHhampuzicopressLittle Mouseirfan_pak10yahoo62278See loyce.club/signatures/0_campaign_managers/<userID>.html for your data (still incomplete). Example: Avatar and Signature log for campaign manager LoyceV.Job hoppersOnce this is running a bit longer, campaign managers can use this to differentiate between \"job hoppers\" and more loyal campaign participants. Of course it's up to the campaign manager what to do with this information.UpdatesAll avatars and signatures are checked at random times, on average at least once a day. I keep track of the last checked date, and show all changes. This signature for instance looks the same, but made some changes to non-braking spaces* so it was detected.Updates in this topic are checked every couple of hours, after which the campaign manager's data gets updated too. This is a separate process from checking the avatars and signatures.Paid? Donations? Or free service?I like catching cheaters, but since campaign managers don't work for free, it seems fair to charge a fee. How about this: if you (a campaign manager) catch a cheater thanks to my service, we share their last campaign payment 50/50 and give the cheater negative feedback instead of a payment. Deal?Post removalI want to keep this topic compact (so I can quickly scrape it many times). That means I'll delete almost all posts that don't contain a list from a Whitelisted user. Discussion is allowed, but I'll probably delete it at some point.* I'm starting to think the non-braking spaces can change when a user goes to \"Forum Profile Information\" and clicks \"Change profile\" without changing anything in the signature. This is not a big deal but the unintended result is that it shows up in my change log.",

I've added the random factor to make it harder to game the system. So cheating is still possible, but it's a risk as the account owner won't know when his signature gets checked.

Changing positions often comes with a salary increase as part of a contract. Many employees prefer to change jobs rather than wait for a raise or a bonus from their employer. If you're looking for better pay, leveraging your experience to find a new role may be the fastest way to earn the salary you desire.I've seen people who switch jobs twice a year. That gives them quick salary increases, but their new employee can already expect them to leave again soon. That means the effort and money invested in hiring them will quickly be wasted again.Quote from: BenCodie on September 16, 2023, 04:23:37 AMmeans that one who takes the opportunities they can get, will be treated lesser than someone who stayed in another campaign for 10+ weeks?Maybe. Maybe not. That's up to the campaign manager.From what I've seen, being the highest paying campaign means users barely leave, but users in the lower paying campaigns leave the moment they get a better offer. I can't tell if campaign managers are going to do something with this information, but if I'd be a manager and I'd have 2 equally qualified candidates, I'd prefer the one who's most likely to stay the longest.Quotepossibly unfair treatmentIt's a free market.

Create a union Fun idea  I doubt there will ever be a need for this though. If advertisers want more traffic, it's an incentive to move around members rather than keep a long term one. Posts from 1+ week ago can appear first in popular threads. Rotating through more members means a wider variety of these scenarios. That's my 2 cents anyway. I am no doubt interested to see where this innovation will take things next",
