In short, the cost of your bitcoin hardware wallet is not related to the security of your Bitcoins. It's personal preference in the end.",

But in terms of security I still think it is down to how you use them. All the reputable hardware wallets might almost immune to hack but once your maintenance culture or usage is kind of careless no kind  of hardware wallets you use that will stop you from getting your funds comprised. So just get the reputable ones suggested by the forum that matches your price target and then exercise good maintenance culture",

However this statement can be not correct with new products, new brands or old brands but with new upgrades like Ledger wallet with Ledger Recovery Service. It is not correct when people are FOMO with a new brand, new products.QuoteOr, rather, as the main factor of being opened source, does the price to determine the security of my bitcoins when using a hardware wallet?Being open source, being old enough to be tested, reviewed by community, developers and users, being tested by hackers are important for quality and security of a wallet.If a product is bad or an upgrade is bad, that brand will lose its value in the community and price will fall.JUST don't buy used (second hand) hardware wallets from any brand. It is bad security.",

Or, rather, as the main factor of being opened source, does the price to determine the security of my bitcoins when using a hardware wallet?The cost of a Bitcoin hardware wallet should not be used as a yardstick in judging how secured a wallet is. The fact that hardware wallet A is more expensive than hardware wallet B doesn't make wallet A more secured than wallet B. Whoever that has been harbouring such misconception should delete it. The most important factor that can be used to determine the security of a hardware wallet is the openness. An open source hardware wallet is more secured because if there is a bug in the code, there's a greater tendency of it being found and corrected on time before a hacker uses it to create havoc because there are lots of eyes looking into the source code.",

Or, rather, as the main factor of being opened source, does the price to determine the security of my bitcoins when using a hardware wallet?Base on series of past stories that I have heard, I will gladly say that the price of a hardware wallet does not determined the security of a hardware Bitcoin wallet,  but the reputation of that wallet, online reviews and what a large population of people are saying about that exact same wallet you intend to buy, and also, where you buy a wallet from greatly determines how secure or less secure it could be, because I have heard series of complaint about people both on & off this forum who bought these \"Hardware\" wallets from a third-party website such as Amazon and got their funds stolen through hacking. Which is why its good that people buy these wallets from the official website of the company itself e.g Trezor or Nano-x Bitcoin hardware wallet.Moreover, other features to look out for when trying to buy a hardware wallets include the; security features (which I just explained), Supported cryptcurrencies, compatibility, Backup and recovery options and last but not the least, buying from it's official website.",

Just as a cheaper smartphone can work better than one at twice the price or you can survive in a 5k car while the other guy ends up dead there is really no specific rule that the price guarantees something.  A wallet can cost more if it offers more features but those features don't mean security as much as accessibility, a wallet with more altcoins supported won't matter for somebody who only owns BTC and the thing can go on and on!Of course, a wallet costing more might mean the team has spent more time testing, better materials, and better eveythign but that's not a rule, see the $ 1,790 Balenciaga trashcan pouch.That being said, as ETFbitcoin mentioned I would stay away from very cheap wallets and of course, the ones given away for free by no-name manufacturers at conventions or web promos and competitions as there are high chances those have been tampered with and they are just fishing for victims. They can afford to give away a thousand if they manage to trick somebody who has a few BTC on them.",

I don't think any hardware wallet company will sell their product at a low price if they have worked hard on it and invested in making user friendly. Of course, development needs investment, and this is where price should vary from wallet to wallet. Also, it does matter when it comes to building quality. Wallet developers had to work on their software and ensure no security issues. If some companies offer way cheaper than the standard price, you could have avoided them. Because to give you the inferior product, they also had to decrease their expense. You don't know where they reduced the costs. It might be on security improvement.",

If the hardware wallet is open source and it's been verified that there is no vulnerability detected that could be used to hack the wallet, nothing like data backing up to the wallet developer's database, then to me, it's all good.The rest of the security is now based on how you handle the wallet; that is what will make your security stronger. The top security is now left for the user of the wallet; if the person is careless with the wallet, then even the most expensive wallet funds can still be stolen from it. But if our backup phrase can be stored and protected effectively, and the hardware wallet is also not connected to any infected device, then everything will be considered safe to some extent.",

We are all aware that when demand is high and supply is limited, the price of a product rises. So my response to the Ops question is \"it depends.\" By the way, hardware wallets are far better to software wallets since software wallets, even though being open source, are still vulnerable to viruses or hacker assaults. That is why most cryptocurrency users advocate hardware wallets if you intend to retain a large amount of assets for an extended period of time.",
