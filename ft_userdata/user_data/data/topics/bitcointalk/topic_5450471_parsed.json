My last PC, which I dumped and started using a newer one, was infected by a virus. If I had not been careful enough, I could have been a victim of the clipboard virus. This was as a result of buying the so-called pirated Windows from a third party, thinking I had a shortcut and cheaper software.I learned my lessons from that, and I believe making their way into an original OS is the best way for any hacker to completely gain access to an entire system with all specific directives on what their exact targets are.Apart from this pirated OS from third parties, I believe there are also possible ways for hackers to penetrate, provided that one is still making use of the internet with that computer. Those dark developers are getting smarter day by day; one just needs to be extremely careful at all times.Quote from: Z390 on April 28, 2023, 12:59:12 PMIt's because of all these messes is why I prefer using my Android smartphone to keep a small amount of crypto and store the rest on a hardware wallet, computers are too risky for crypto wallet. Even mobile phones can be penetrated, so you are not completely safe; we just have to apply some preventive measures irrespective of which gadget we choose to use. Hardware wallets are always highly recommended as the safest, but they're not completely free from being penetrated as long as you are connecting them to a device with an internet connection. You also need to be careful about the kind of device you use them on.",

People just need to operate very smartly these days with their digital assets; otherwise, there can be a steady hack. Just as @_Act_ mentioned, if the malware is able to penetrate Binance, that means it's also possible to penetrate other CEX.

However, if usage of the OS grows – so that it achieves mass distribution – the OS will attract the attention of malware creators that will see an opportunity to gain from attacking the OS.Popular OSs and applications… lead to popular malwareIn effect, the more popular an operating system or an application is – the more often it’s likely to be prone to computer virus attacks.The number of malicious programs created for Windows, Linux and Mac OS closely correlates to the market share that each of these operating systems has achieved.I was a Windows OS user in the past and often had problems when it was exposed to malware, then finally switched to macOS about ten years ago. Until now, I have never experienced being exposed to malware. But just in case, I had Bitdefender antivirus installed for a few years.Quote from: Husna QA on October 10, 2019, 12:59:02 PM   Quote from: _act_ on April 28, 2023, 08:31:28 AMWhat is Binance doing there?
