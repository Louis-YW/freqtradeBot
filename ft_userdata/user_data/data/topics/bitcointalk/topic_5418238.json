  "content": "This topic is inspired by the comment I found on nc50lc's post that led me to Welcome to the new Bitcoin forum! where I read Satoshi's announcement of the official opening of this forum to the public on November 22, 2009.Here are my questions and that is the reason for this topic. In the first picture I saw that Satoshi has 5 coins as against the 4 coins assigned to the Senior rank like his. Another thing is that Satoshi's 5 coins are not gold coins like others but silver coloured. What does that mean. Can anyone care to explain that?In the second picture, the red marked areas indicate dates with big gap between the 3rd and 4th post in that thread. That is between sirius and PrintCoins posts. They are 1 year and 9 months gap between them. Does anyone also know why? Does it mean no other person posted between them until then or there were posts in between them but they got deleted? Was the forum not that active then?",

Or maybe it was just locked then reopen when lots of members joined? I don't know exactly.",

That settles the first question. I never read that part until now. How about the second question. Do you know why there is such wide gap?",

So you can just lock this thread for people not to use it to spam.I asked two major questions. Only one has been answered and I acknowledged it.

You can check it yourself using the link belowhttps://ninjastic.space/topic/5If you check Satoshi's topic history and post history, you will know that there are other threads created and some people are also creating their own threads too.It can happens this time too that a thread can be created, people will post there and stop posting for like months, a year or more than a year before people will continue to post on the thread again. But Bitcointalk at that time can not be as active as this time. Best not to lock the thread to see what others will post regarding this.",

Was the forum not that active then?I was not here back then, unfortunately, and I don't know whether theymos has done anything in there (removing posts, changes), but I can speculate.By looking at ninjastic.space I've seen that \"post #3\" is the 200th post in the forum and \"post #4\" is 665348th, so I'll say that people simply didn't care much of the welcome message and just posted in more interesting topics.Even more, \"post #4\" is asking about the old forum, hence it's clearly not from the first wave of \"welcome aboard\" type of posts.All in all, probably only theymos can answer this; and it's not something really important, I guess... You can pretty much live with \"people didn't care to answer to the welcome topic\".",

The forum was nowhere near as active in 2009/10 as it is today. I would refer you to the forum stats page.For example, in November 2009, there were only 37 posts made, and in December 2009, only 44 posts. By comparison, a recent visit to the patrol page shows 200 posts in about an hour and 20 minutes, and that only counts posts made by newbies.",

Does it mean no other person posted between them until then or there were posts in between them but they got deleted? Was the forum not that active then?regarding OP's second very interesting questions, I guess posts were not deleted because all posts exists but on different topics, here I found how to confirm thissirius post # 200 on February 02, 2010Then from post#201 - 211, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 - 5000, 10,000, (20000 x), 30,000,40,0000, 50,000, 60,0000  i checked all are posts exist You can from this using merit link, just change the post id Post # 201 = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;msg=200Post # 211 = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;msg=211Post # 10000 = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;msg=10000 .....Post # 60000 = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;msg=60000 Until PrintCoins post # 665348 in the welcome thread after sirius post # 200https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;msg=665348From this I can conclude, no posts were deleted (yeah may be few here and there but no big dump deletion by theymos) and almost all posts exist but on different topics.You can get the exact post and topic link if you know how to? Don't ask me For examplePost #201 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30.msg201#msg201Post # 999 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117.msg999#msg999Post # 30000 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2209.msg30000#msg30000Post # 60000 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4138.msg60000#msg60000------Quote from: Maestro75 on October 25, 2022, 08:23:52 AMI asked two major questions.
