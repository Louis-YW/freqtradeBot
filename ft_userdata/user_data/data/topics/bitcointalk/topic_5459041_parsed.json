  "content": "Downloaded today from the official site/ Play store. When I click Send, it turns my phone camera on and there's a message saying : \"Scan an Invoice, an Address, an LNURL-pay, a PSBT or a Channel backup.\" But there's no option to do anything. There's no option to provide an address or QR code so I can send the funds out. I've been trying for hours now to get this to work somehow. I'm actually trying to buy medicine I really need, so I've been rather stressed about this. I also found another person reporting the same issue in the Play store last week.Thanks",

Import your seed phrase and you should be able to spend your coins if provided that you have not use a fake wallet for it.On Electrum mobile, no field to input your address, just scan it and it will work.",

The issue is my QR code is on my phone--for instance on my digital receipt... or in my screenshots folder, since I took a screenshot. But when the app gets to that page where it turns on the phone camera, as far as I know there's no way to scan a QR code from this setting unless it's on a physical piece of paper?I've also tried pasting the address at the bottom as you mentioned, but it won't let me. The address is correct, but it won't let me paste anything at all actually.Your first image looks similar to mine:https://64.media.tumblr.com/799a91ffa0e9c0bf1cf21d1d89f262a8/7272b10cc134bbd9-4c/s1280x1920/2c59ad5550a3c2db108a679776de65c55f17ec36.pnjHowever, this is what comes up with I attempt to paste something, or even just click Paste: https://64.media.tumblr.com/14f386eceead87ee5840d83c0d34a8be/7272b10cc134bbd9-ad/s1280x1920/afc4fb2940735810acf0dfe5aca83018f9293cdf.pnj",

There is no way to upload a QR code image.That error in the second screenshot should only show if you're pasting something other than a bitcoin address but since you said you couldn't paste an address either, would it be possible for you to share the address, to see what could be causing the issue?",

I always make this mistake especially when I copy an address manually from a text file or something like that.Electrum devs should work on this to make it easier for the user to figure out what he has done wrong.",
