(please state it).https://abcnews.go.com/US/stabbed-front-las-vegas-casino-victim-dead-police/story?id=91123497 I'm no rich guy, but I do visit casinos every now and then to unwind and get a quick break from the stresses of life. Lately however I find myself preferring online casinos more than the live ones, but that is because I am a little lazy. What takes me a 10 min. walk towards the casino could've been used to spend money and possibly win and enjoy games on an online casino. Plus some Online houses offer some sort of live dealings which alleviates the awkward feeling of having to bet with a bot. Although of course the fear of getting hacked and be drained of all my winnings, or even my funds looms over me. It never really goes away. Guess that's part of betting. There's a plethora of risks you should be willing to take whether it be online or live casino gambling.",

But hacking online sites will be a problem for every user like phishing sites, malware, etc.Live or Online Casino has their own advantages and disadvantages and depends on the needs.",

However, a casino is quite large. I think we can say goodbye to covid after all, if you look at how little it is in the news. Casinos have also been affected by covid, but I think they were able to build up a nice buffer in the time before Covid. And you can always use a mask if you feel more comfortable that way.Totally out of topic reply. Back on the topic in regarding with security then it would really be just normal that there are things which cant really be prevented nor be stopped specially on these kind or type of incidents.If there were stabbing issues or incident then it is really that a flaw into their security on why they do let in a certain person who does really have that belonging but reading up on the article it is really said to be having that kitchen knife, so where he did able to get that?As a player then you should really be that vigilant most of the time because you dont know on what things would be ending up and there'sno such thing about being safe place, considering that casino does involved losing and winning then expect that there are ones who do have those impulsiveand cant be handles emotions.",

I usually take some friends so that we can have fun and watch each other's backs. It's the same with drinking at night and walking home alone. Drunk people have a habit of doing everything much slower so it takes them more time to find cash in their wallets and this allows others to take a peek inside. I've heard of people stabbed in my city for no reason or beaten just because they were an easy target, but I've always walked with at least 1 friend and thankfully never been attacked. Muggers rarely mess with 2 or more people, unless it's 2 drunk women.",

Having an option to play online is a good one for our own physical safety but when it comes to online, there’s no guarantee for our safety since anything can happen and so far, most of the top casinos are still doing great and I didn’t see any news about a casino getting hacked.

      "body": "Staking bets on Casino houses is fun and you've got to see the croupiers in real life and meet up with other people in lieu of building networks online, but staying in a Casino house consisting of drug dealers, button men, drunks etc is dangerous at night. Since such businesses are managed by different underworld families seeking control over territory, unexpected dramas could happen any moment. A target can be attacked there and an unlucky innocent player could get injured too. On the other hand, playing online is fun and calm. It'll boost your calculation on stakes without any mental or environmental distractions caused by noise or side talks. The fear of playing with bots should be considered, yet it doesn't matter if the live dealers operate on provably fair. The deal is to win a game and not if your competitor is human or bot. If you think you can't manage or handle the hassle attached to Casino houses I think the online Casino was built for you.",

Security is something to really be concerned about in this period considering the very harsh economic situation that are forcing people who formerly decided that they would never indulge in some activities, to have a change of heart just to survive. These days even individuals who you least suspect can be criminals, turn out to be well dressed criminals. I would advise that for safety reasons if you must visit live casinos, only visit casinos that take their security seriously and do not just let any kind of individual use their service or hang around aimlessly without doing anything.",

The best protection is to try and work on your own fitness to be able to defend yourself when necessary. You can find horror stories from every type of place in the world, from nurseries, to garden centers to old peoples homes, to hospitals. Admittedly casinos will tend to have a few more drunk people around, however they have some of the most advanced security systems in the world which can deter an average thief who knows they'll be identified pretty easily.

You can play by the confort and safety of your home. If you hit the jackpot, you don't have to worry about being followed on your way back home by thieves, as you will be already at home!On the other hand, when you go to land based casinos, you never know who can be behind you. This is the main security concern when playing at physical places. And when gambling is forbidden in your country you also have to worry about the police, besides the thieves, who can be in collusion with the casino itself.",

I'm not okay with the smell of their cigarettes and not to mention, second hand smoking is more dangerous. Another thing is life concerns as OP and other users have mentioned; just what if you've won a jackpot? Would you be safe once you got out of the casino? These are 'indirect' security issues but possibilities for sure would worry a player who's not used of playing on such establishments. This is also why I prefer playing online. Scam casinos could be avoided if you will be quite doing a research about the platform you are engaging yourself with. You may check for their reputation in the industry, ask for feedbacks from its players, and compare its offers to check if it is not unrealistic or if something is worrisome.",
