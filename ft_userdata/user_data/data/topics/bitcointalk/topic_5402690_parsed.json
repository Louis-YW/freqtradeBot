The pandemic causes a new and worse thing, hyper-inflation for world economy. Basically, it does not change and governments keep printing more fiat to circulating supplies.The market is just panic, extremely fearful and panic now. The coming news from FED is comparable to news (announcement) from World Health Organization in March 2020 about the pandemic.

Every Bitcoiner i talked to stacked more sats, the only people that lost, used margin or didn’t hold their own keys. There’s definitely indicators that confirm this trend, even tho we can’t quantify how much exactly.",
