And this:Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/swan-bitcoin-terminates-customer-accounts-crypto-mixing-servicesPritzker stated that the current political climate has put a lot of fear into the banking sector, with most banks simply refusing to do business with anything in crypto. Thus, for them to continue their Bitcoin on-ramp services, their custody partner has to interact with banking services governed by FinCEN regulations.Especially, I do not expect people can be complaining about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general that they are causing global warming. Mixers are seen to be used for illegal activities but the money in banks are not seeing to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing. Among the most fiats used for illegal activities, only little do the government and regulators know about. If there is no bitcoin or other coins and tokens, there will be illegal activities both online and offline and their scam fiat will be used for it.",

We all know that even before bitcoin, there had been illegal dealing in any form of activity, and the government can't deny that. And with the said money laundering, we can also see that the major money launderers are those who are in charge of shell accounts, which they are allowed to send large amounts of money across to any part of the world without being questioned. How much is being spent on illegal purchases of arms and other sorts of illegal activities like terrorism drugs? When you talk about this amount, we can see that it's nearly impossible for crypto or bitcoin alone to be used to execute such deals. There is no doubt that many criminal organisations are using bitcoin for their illegal activities, but the numbers are few compared to what's happening in the financial and banking systems, which they all know about, and yet they need a reason to attack bitcoin by all means.",

I think that this is another way that they think they can use to deprive bitcoiners from their private life.The government just hate the people can use bitcoin for whatever they want to buy without them being able to trace the transactions, which I think that this is the main reason that they are against any form of privacy that you can get from bitcoin and they are not happy that bitcoin gives financial freedom to its users. This is the reason why bitcoin should be used the way it was designed, by using a decentralized exchange and a noncustodial wallet. I believe this is the reason why Bitcoin ETF will be approved so that they can know more about the bitcoin owners that bought from ETF",

I can understand that a source of income is requested, but the source of currencies is an acknowledgment of the existence of clean and dirty currencies, and if this concept continues, it is the end of any currency.",

Attending a school does not guarantee education because an educated man should have an open mind to reason and read about issues before making conclusions. So it is true that many people who go to school are not educated because they fail to use their minds.  People fail to know that most information they get from some news channels is designed by the government and other organisations to control their thinking. And many people are too lazy to research to validate if this information is true or fake.  QuoteMixers are seen to be used for illegal activities but the money in banks are not seeing to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing.

Most of these funds stolen from these nations by politicians are laundered to foreign banks. Recently some of the money stolen by these corrupt politicians was discovered and gradually repatriated to my country. None of these funds are in Bitcoin, in fact, most of them are in some of the leading currencies of the world. My country has not discovered any money laundering carried out using bitcoin. Attacking bitcoin because of illegal activities is the only excuse the government has and sadly some educated illiterates are digesting this misinformation. There are many good people who use mixers for the sake of privacy, making laws such as these FinCEN regulations is like assuming that everybody who uses mixers is a criminal. The government have not prohibited the use of fiat because it is used for money laundering because it is within their control.",

I expected better from them but what did I expect from people who would go to any length just to ensure they control everything. These financial institutions have overtime aided in misusing funds of the public but the government turns a blind eye because they are the masterminds behind it and will fight to ensure that nothing hinders them from that access and will  make sure they suppress anything (in this case, Bitcoin) that tries to make them look irrelevant and there's no better way to do that than to choke it's existence with rules and regulations.",

Even the the World Bank themselves gave the excuse of:Transparency … what a load of bull. The fact that every transaction and every wallet is viewable by anyone looking at the Bitcoin blockchain means “transparency” is a LOT better than using dollars.Environmental impact … again, what a load of bull. Even now, more than 70% of Bitcoin mining is already using renewable sources of electricity. Not to be “green”, but because the cost of fossil fuel is getting so high. This is climbing, since China banned Bitcoin mining in their cheap, government sponsored, coal burning regions.All excuses. Extremely easy to see the lie.   The real reason they just don’t want to: If they accept BTC as a world currency, all those crappy Fiat stuff will soon lose value due to this alternative. Every country in the world would immediately need to also accept BTC as a normal trading currency. And thus every country in the world would see their own currencies compete against BTC. Which in turn means there’s no more barriers to stop their currencies going into free-fall hyperinflation. I.e. the real reason is FEAR. Period. All else is simply excuses to try and save face.",
