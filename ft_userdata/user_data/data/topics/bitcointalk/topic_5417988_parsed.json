  "content": "Hello,I am the owner and founder of Fennec. Fennec is a bitcoin fork meme coin that will have continuous 4chan, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram marketing over the course of the next 2 years. We are mining our genesis block in about 3-4 weeks, and are a fork of Bitcoin, operating on the SHA-256 algorithm. In anticipation of price appreciation, people on this forum who own old SHA-256 algorithm equipment may be able to dust off the old ASIC and put it back to work in exchange for block rewards!There will be 21 million coins in the total supply, and a 2.1 million coin premine (10%). This will enable us to have an ICO, so that we can fund future exchange listings. We already have one (small) CEX that has accepted the project and is eager to list us. There will be 50 coins per block reward, and 10 minutes per block... so everything is starting out in a similar fashion to Bitcoin, with the exception of the premine which we need for future exchange listings, web maintenance, and development. The funds from the ICO will be kept on a multisig safe/wallet, so the team has to authorize any purchase that I make with the treasury. This is to add security and build trust in the project. We will very likely have a page on our website that lists all the team transactions, and their purpose, for complete transparency.Aggressive marketing will ensue over the next several months, but for now the community is approximately composed of about 75 members. This will increase drastically within the next month, marketing will start in 2 weeks or less. For the time being, the hashrate will be extremely low, and I would implore anyone interested to participate in the support of the Fennec network. You will be able to mine a considerable portion of the total supply within a relatively short span of time if you are impressed with our development and are interested in taking a chance with us. I would confidently say that you will at the very least recoup your energy expenses in the beginning, and if you continue to hold, there is surely potential for profits.Please feel free to stop by our Telegram community chat where all updates are posted @FennecPortal . Our mining group is much smaller, but will contain details about configuring mining rigs to our network, and will be a place for troubleshooting or feedback... you can find it on telegram at @FennecMiningPortal . Our website will be live in about 2-3 weeks, which will have many more details. Please join us on telegram for more updates on exchange listings, marketing, community building, mining pools, coin development, and project management.I am not sure if posting a thread like this is against the community guidelines, but I do not mean to impede. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve the nature of the post so that it can be in line with Bitcointalk.org community guidelines. I am very new here, and was simply hoping to spread awareness of the project without coming off too aggressively. Thank you.",

I suggested a few days ago to do a ltc/doge algo vs btc algoandddd doge went from 5.9 cents to 11 cents.so l3+ gear is now good enough to go back to mining ltc/doge as 2 units can do 1gh at 1400 wattswhich is $0.75 cents in ltc and $4.50 in doge that is $5.25 in value  for 1.4 x 24 = about 34 kwatts so at 10 cents  = $3.40 power costor a $1.85 value per day for 2x L3+ and the benefit of heat if the weather is cold where you have the L3+Same goes for an S9 if btc moons every one will drop this coin. Going back to btc.  Good luck with the project.If it was in LTC/Doge it would have just been hit very hard. Same goes for if it is in BTC and BTC rallies bigly.",
