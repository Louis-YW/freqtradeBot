The halving is coming & people in the know are aware of what happens to the proce after the halving. I don’t think we’ll see a new all time high in 2023 but 40k is possible.",

These positive news that makes BTC price increase and it has nothing to do with DOGE.",

Bitcoin has been on the raise since the turn of the year and has moved up to 80% of last years ending value of $16k. The surge is greatly influenced by the recent bankruptcy saga faced by many notable banks like Silvergate and Silicon Valley. Also the continued political threat to the dollar as an international exchange currency has driven some people towards saving in valuable assets like the gold and bitcoin.",

It is ridiculous to even imagine or conceive. Since we have know this market, it has always been Bitcoin the king who drives the market. When did the king hand over the mantle of driving the market of a meme dodge?Bitcoin good performance should be related to Fed decision of not raising the interest rate and again as bitcoin halving is approaching, many are trooping in to secure their place .",

Dogecoin is still trying to rise from its slump and Elon Musk is behind it, while Bitcoin's recovery has nothing at all to do with the meme coin Elon Musk has backed.Investors are starting to realize that fiat currency continues to slowly lose value, they believe in Bitcoin more than any other investment. Bitcoin has been able to survive and is still the top Cryptocurrency since many years it is very unlikely that Bitcoin will fail due to its huge usage and growth. If you were holding Bitcoin when the price was $25k, you would be part of a recent recovery scenario.",

While IMO the increase is small, it's apparently enough to affect the stock and crypto markets. Like others in the thread, I don't think the growth is due to anything related to Dogecoin. When Bitcoin is on the rise, it can inspire a boost for some altcoins, but what happens to a particular altcoin doesn't usually affect the growth of Bitcoin itself. Moreover, Dogecoin is actually almost 12% down over the last 7 days, while Bitcoin is 8.7% up.",

Bitcoin halving is also a trend next year so it helps a lot to boost the Bitcoin market price as well, a lot of investors are accumulating a lot of Bitcoin for sure.Cryptocurrency hype is starting so it would make sense that we see a big spike in the market price, if we look at the news and articles online we can see a lot of cryptocurrency hype.",

But I think this rise in price is not because of any news related to doge coins, I just it's because of the adoption of more people moving to better investment options as bank continues to fail and prove unreliable.",

Bitcoin is indeed a good time to rise and recover from dump in 2022, it is clearly time regardless of whatever issues underlie its rise. Recovery is expected to continue throughout 2023, but I still think we will get correction at some junctions. The FED may have an effect on the price, but I'm not sure how much of a correction will occur ahead of the 2024 halving.",

It is clear that investors have seen that fiat currency is not a secured means for them to pile up their asset and even the USD has depreciated. Investors is looking for a means in which they can use to stake their funds,bitcoin is the only option to this because inflation is less to problem to it.Bitcoin price reached 30k and would keep on moving up,since we are expecting the halving next year. Right now I am looking forward to see bitcoin price move upward to 32k,due to the principle of demand and supply.Gracias",

The main concern for BTC is the usability not its pricing which is speculative.  There is always a higher and a lower estimate for future BTC pricing, one is a speculative hyped line this is parallel to the base price for BTC which is more about usage and rising population of potential and actual users; all of that has improved I believe despite the 2022 pullback.",
