In response, the Russian Investigative Committee opened criminal cases against International Criminal Court Judge Tomoko Akane and prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan to bring the obviously innocent Putin to justice and prepare to attack a representative of a foreign state enjoying international protection.    Knowing in advance that the most important person in the entire judicial system of Russia is its president, who is subordinate to the knights of the cloak and dagger, it is highly likely that Tomoko Akane and Karim Akhmat Khan will appear, in the event of their abduction, before the Basmanny Court in Moscow or be exposed to Novichok. In short, I would not give a broken penny for their fate. The only advice I can give them is for Akane and Karim to keep their underpants in a secure safe. (1)  1.
