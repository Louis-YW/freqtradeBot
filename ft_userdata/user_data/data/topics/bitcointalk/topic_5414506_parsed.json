Bought hardware wallet from official stores.3. Don't leave most of your Bitcoin on centralized exchanges.4. Don't click any link, http (not secure) or any suspicious files.5. Never staking or lend to centralized party in order to get tiny interest, even more invest in ponzi scheme.",

Everything in this world is cyclical, from fashion to wars. All this has happened before. The most important thing in this cycle is to remember how all seemingly new but, according to historical data, old events end. With bitcoin, this is always a victory, and with big pluses.",

Even though we know the bitcoin cycle is up and down, there is a bear market and a bull market. but Fear and greed remains difficult to control for some traders who do not have much experience.for those who have been through and running on bitcoin since 2014 until now then maybe they can stay calm facing the current market situation. but I personally as a beginner still not used to it. my friend advised me that \"buy when red and sell when green\". or can be interpreted \"buy when the correction and sell when the price rises\". but the reality is sometimes the result is the opposite. due to the psychology of beginners who are different from those of experienced ones.but indeed it is also part of the cycle. BTC has market cycles, traders also have experience cycles.",

It is a good idea to hodle bitcoin in the bear market and also buying bitcoin in the bear market is very good but how many people can do that without fear. As it is now many people are even afraid of the bear market because it is overdue. When the bearish became unbearable people would start to withdraw their funds to USD to and watch the price from there. And when the price gradually goes up they would buy BTC again.",

On minute level it’s upto our trading strategy how we invest, grow, hodl and trade it. That’s just small picture of it. Those who are long term hodlers will exactly know how bitcoin works on cyclic patterns and how much returns it could give us back. There are stories of peeps who had bought bitcoin before 2015 also and yet they have not sold a penny. Ask them the effect of going from Point A price to Point B price without even getting defocused by various ups and downs in between. Because it was simply incriminating and what they saw is their pennies turned into millions.",

I guess, this your advise will really help many people to endure in this bear market so that they will smile when the price finally hit bull market soon.This kind of thing is needed in a bear market situation like this. Because not everyone can endure seeing bitcoins in their wallets when the price is far from when they entered. When FUD is heard everywhere, it must be fought with what the OP said. It can help reduce the burden that has been eroded by their slightly declining mentality.Actually fear can be fought like this, coupled with the statistics from the past that this has indeed happened.",
