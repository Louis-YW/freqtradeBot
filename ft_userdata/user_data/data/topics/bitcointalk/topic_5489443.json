  "content": "The concept of tokenization has been around since 2017. It essentially involves creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership rights in real-world assets. This \"on-chain\" approach facilitates easier exchange and trading, ultimately increasing the asset's liquidity [1]. This innovation has grabbed the attention of traditional financial giants like JPMorgan and BlackRock, fueling the RWA trend within the crypto market [2, 3]. Initially, the focus was on tokenizing securities for smoother trading.A surprise twist: instead of tokenizing securities, we've seen the securitization tokens with the launch of the BTC spot ETF in January [4]. This innovation allows traditional investors to easily purchase exposure to Bitcoin through ETF, bypassing the complexities of directly acquiring and storing BTC themselves. The BTC spot ETF has unlocked tens of billions of dollars in investment from traditional markets, fueling a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Notably, even though these ETF providers are currently acquiring their Bitcoin on the OTC market, the impact on the broader market is undeniable. As the price of Bitcoin rises, the entire crypto market expands, creating opportunities for crypto investors to profit.Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, once said: \"ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets. Step two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset\" [5], but if in the future, most securities can be tokenized, then BTC spot ETF can also be tokenized. Then we will have a crazy value chain: value (energy) => tokenization (BTC) => securitization (BTC spot ETF: IBIT, FBTC, HODL...) => tokenization (BTC spot ETF token: IBIT token, FBTC token, HODL token...).Tokens reverting to just tokens - a red flag for the market. While we envision integrating crypto into the stock market through tokenized securities, established financial institutions are already weaving traditional securities into the crypto market with a BTC spot ETF. It's worth noting that some crypto investors see the BTC spot ETF as a sign of Bitcoin's progress. However, I believe it might be a strategic move by the stock market to establish itself within the crypto sphere, potentially steering investors towards BTC spot ETF rather than encouraging them to understand blockchain technology and self-custody their Bitcoin. Could BTC Spot ETF be Wall Street's Trojan horse?I would like to know your opinion on this issue:Do you support securitization or tokenization?BTC spot ETF is the maturity or degeneration of BTC?Does BTC spot ETF have any negative impact on BTC and the crypto market?References:[1] Tokenization: Real World Assets, Real World Benefits[2] JPMorgan debuts tokenization platform, BlackRock among key clients: Report[3] The Rise of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWA): Unlocking Asset Liquidity[4] Spot Bitcoin ETFs Explained: Everything You Need to Know[5] BlackRockâ€™s Larry Fink says bitcoin ETFs are just the first step in the technological revolution of finance",

I don't get the whole point of your forum thread. Are you complaining about the Bitcoin spot ETFs? Are you one of the people, who think that Blackrock and the institutional investors will \"take control over Bitcoin\" via the ETFs? I guess that this is your main thesis here.Bitcoin spot ETFs are just financial derivatives. They don't change how the Bitcoin blockchain works. They can only influence the BTC price.If the ETFs help in pumping the price everyone is happy. If another bearish market occurs, I can assume that most Bitcoiners will start b*tch and complain about the ETFs",

As you've already guessed ETF guys don't go on the usual centralized exchanges to purchase bitcoin to be able to affect the price like the way you described. Additionally they don't constantly buy bitcoin to be able to contribute to the constant rise. Instead they make bulk purchases every time they want to offer for of their ETF crap to more people who sign up. That means even if they were to affect the market, their effect should be instant and one time only not a constant rise over weeks or months.It would be like saying \"a whale that made a one time purchase of something like 10000BTC is the reason for the rally that lasted 2 months\"! Such one time purchase could shock the market and cause a rise in a couple of hours but it won't last for 2 months.At the end of the day, the rise that we saw (from $30k to $60k in 4+ months) is the result of actual money coming into the real market purchasing real bitcoins not the money that goes into ETF purchasing IOUs. One of the major reasons for it is the upcoming halving.In any case I like you title when you refer to ETF as a trojan horse but I don't really agree with the rest of your topic.",

That is definitely possible but I think even with much effort, it wonâ€™t get that far.There are a lot of investors who were against ETFs but I think it helps to propel theprice upward but it does not mean I will be favoring centralized way of purchasing bitcoin than its counterpart. I believe that a lot of people feel the same way. From an investorâ€™s point of view, the emergence of ETFs is a good thing allowing more people to buy bitcoin. Itâ€™s not that they canâ€™t buy it themselves but rather itâ€™s the thought ofhaving a trusted, credible and reliable place to buy bitcoin in is what makes them favor ETFs. With this in mind, I hope bitcoin becomes mainstream enough that we can go back to itsoriginal purpose which is to become a payment method through a peer to peer transaction. [/list]",

Besides the media impact, although the money flow into Spot ETF does not directly create buying pressure on CEXs, it has a positive impact on price volatility through many ways and stages. I will probably present this in a separate topic in the future for us to discuss.Even though I see such a positive impact, I still realize that Spot ETF is eroding the core value of BTC, which is the self-custody of assets that Satoshi always encouraged: ordinary investors choose not to buy BTC but buy spot ETF, and the storage of BTC is entrusted to large investment funds, and these funds become intermediaries that manage and charge fees from investors. That is clearly not what I want for the development of the crypto market.",
