I would gladly share my opinions about your picks if ever I find the time or if we have the same bets because I had been also targetting those over and under but mostly in a parlay to increase the profits.Quote from: ElectraBets on April 04, 2023, 10:51:04 AM2-1 today:Nets MLNew Orleans Pelicans v Sacramento Kings under 237.5Memphis Grizzlies v Portland Trail Blazers: under 237I like the Pelicans versus Kings under bet because there's a chance the Pelicans would be forcing the win and their defense will be intensified. As for the Grizzlies vs Trail Blazers, I might go the other way as it could become an All-Star shooting mania for a no-bearing game.",

I would gladly tail all three of them and see where it will go. Maybe even go for a parlay to make the profits more attractive. I think the over 220.5 for the Detroit Pistons versus the Brooklyn Nets is also a good pick so I am taking that on a single bet only. Most of the Pistons' games are 100 points and above. While when the Brooklyn Nets are winning it's mostly 120+ so this could really hit.Good luck to you and may you win all your bets.",

If you end up having a positive record - at least over 53% - your record will certainly attract followers. Over/under betting is similar to spread betting, but it's best to go with what you are comfortable with.I'm keeping an eye on this.",

That was a solid 3-0. Thanks as well for sharing your tips here. I am tailing again but only the Philadelphia 76ers vs Miami Heat this time. It seems like the oddsmakers just realized Jazz vs Thunder over 234.5 is a steal. I only have 236.5, 237.5, and 238.50 here. GLHF for these games.Standing: 3-0Gains(+)/Losses(-): +2.66It is up to you if you include the units in your tracks mate. And with regards to the same thread that is already existing, to avoid possible deletion from an admin, maybe you just simply change the title of the thread to \"ElectraBets NBA unders/overs tips\". This would clearly distinguish your thread from the other existing thread.",

Perhaps, it will also help with the tracking that you are doing. I made your tip in a parlay and it's a hit. Well appreciated. Somehow this stops my long streak of losing in the over and under section.  I am in doubt about the 76ers vs the Heat under 221.5 but I will tail it too. Will just avoid a parlay for now and keep in singles.I don't see over 234.5 in my favorite sports bookie for the Jazz vs Thunder. The lowest is 236.5 so I will just have to stick with that.",

We are now on the semi-finals and things are getting more interesting in NBA. Should be a closed thread I guess. But to those who are into NBA League especially this year wherein there are many changes with rosters,  betting is becoming more loud recently. One is with LAL and GSW who were rivals before. Odds are to LAL for game 2 even if they have won the first game and that is probably because of the homecourt advantage. Odds are simply the heart of the polls and will never dictate the outcome but could be an edge to gamblers as we all know. Die hard fans of each team are more likely pushing their biases to finals and the trophy itself. Glad that this season is havaing the hype as before.",

The teams were not even accurate.This playoffs is a little different. Dangerous well-experienced teams like GSW, Miami, and Lakers are in the bottom seeds and somehow managed to upset the top seeds.Lakers vs GSW is really a close series. Prior to its start, I can say GSW only has a 55/45 slight edge. I already made a bet of -6.5 on GSW. They lost game 1 but it was close. And they badly needed a win before traveling to Los Angeles for the next 2 games. Money can be a factor to change odds because the house will try to balance its bets from both sides.",

I am going with spamming because in other parts of it, he doesn't know what he is talking about.  Anyway, the OP of this thread had been inactive after the season ended. We don't know if he will ever be back again. It's actually a waste because he is having some good picks to share and I also made some profits from tailing them. Let's see if he will come back the next season and continue this thread of his. He said it was to keep track of his records but I think he got busy or maybe just got bored of what he started here.",
