Haven scrolled some posts here, I was impressed and interested in this crypto forum.All I need is the way forward.First, let me welcome you to bitcointalk and the best way forward for you right now is to take the time to build your knowledge about Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market entirely, if you have not been thought about wallet and wallet securities. Because those are the most important lessons besides others, take your time to learn and keep educating yourself and in one year from now, you should have gained better knowledge on both cryptocurrency and financial analysis aiding you in making better investment decisions.Once again welcome :",

It's your second thread in 1 hour with little to no context, and zero addition to the community which you are impressed with.I would rather prefer you to go and browse the forum, try to make more posts rather than threads. However there is nothing wrong by creating a thread but yours are of no use at all.",

If you are here to learn and acquire knowledge, then the best thing for you to do is to start exploring the place. Just as ImThour said, you can actually use the forum search button to help you discover questions that have been asked by previous members and answers given to them. You can also ask questions under existing threads, which is much simpler than creating a new thread for the same questions and problems that have been answered and solved before.There have been numerous lists and links already suggested by different members above; just go through those threads and familiarize yourself with the forum, and I believe I will continue seeing you around with your contribution to the forum.",
