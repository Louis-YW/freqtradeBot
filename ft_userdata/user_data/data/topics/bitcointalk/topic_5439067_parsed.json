  "content": "In every nation, the growth and development of the country depends on the actions being taken by its leader. Most countries are famous for the stringent measures they took to get where they are; in areas of stopping major importations of good and growing it locally, strengthening the fiat to be at least at par with the dollar, ensure security in the country and make it a place suitable for investment, etc thereby ensuring that growth is not hampered. In the case of Nigeria, they opted for redesigning of the naira, The country's fiat as they believe it would help curb the illicit inflow money which could be used to bolster financial crime. But this action by the govt seem to cause more pain than gain as most cannot access the new naira, transactions seem to halt and masses experience unrest. If care is not taken and the govt doesn't act fast, it could cause a deep strain to the economy.  Is the naira redesign a misplaced priority, a waste of funds or a confused act by the government? What can be done to rectify this anomaly?? Helpful opinions would be welcomed.",
