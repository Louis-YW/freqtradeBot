      "body": "The core reason why people think that Bitcoin is a scam is a lack of understanding. Not everyone understands the concept of Blockchain, some people hear the \"chain\" and think it's a cycle just like Ponzi while some others find something to read meaning into. However, the most recent and prevailing reason is fraudulent activities that go on with the help of Bitcoin (You can't blame Bitcoin, it's a currency, anyone can do what they want with it be it good or bad). Today there are a lot of scams out there and it's just too much that it obscures the view of newbies. All the hacking incidents that have happened are also a contribution somehow. So, for these reasons, many people just feel it is not a straight path and that it is a scam.",

There are different classes of people in the world today, and the world is not just your country. You might be living in a first-world country with fancy tech, good info tech, and a lot of channels through which information and education about new technology can get easily passed to society, but in some other countries that don't have a good means of informing the whole society about a new technology, only those who have the opportunity to travel out to the cities around them would have more information about recent things than the others. I am living in one of the most beautiful cities in my country, and I know fully well that if I travel from here to my village and begin to ask some of the educated and uneducated youths and old people living there to invest in Bitcoin, they will first of all ask me what Bitcoin is, and if I can't show them any physical (asset) thing as Bitcoin, they will possibly think that I came from the city just to scam them. So, OP, there are people who still see Bitcoin as a scam, and the reason why it's so is because they don't have good knowledge about Bitcoin. If you see people like that who are willing to learn, then teach them if you have the time to spare.",

There are situation that you people will look at you as a scammer even without you having a conversation with them talk more of forcing them to invest. I believe you may have come in contact with an Internet fraud that offered you 1000x profit that make you feel that the only we people can see you as a scam. Just as Dr.Bitcoin_Strange, said in his example, in some villages or town there are people who are educated and yet uneducated on others things like bitcoin, with there vast knowledge or long time study they believe that whatever you tell them when you are not highly educated as them is rubbish. This kind people may consider as scam when you talk about something like Bitcoin to be a money that is not visible. In some areas whatever the population is not aware of is generally considered as scam when introduced to them  because of ignorance. So is not only when you try to force people to invest that they can consider you as a scammer.

Maybe that's because you're in a city that is exposed or civilized, well over here I can't find where to buy stuffs with Bitcoin. The only place I have see that they accept Bitcoin is a furniture shop where  sofas are sold in wholesale.",

And with that, it's human nature to be afraid of what's new as we resists change, specially the fiat and the banking system. They see crypto more of a threat, but for us it's a alternative.And Bitcoin is still fairly young to begin with, so there is going to be a learning curved, and there will be negative things that we will here from it's detractors specially in 2017 when it was one of the best year for Bitcoin as people around the world was very curious at the same time there are a lot of attacks. Nevertheless, we will continue to march in the next 10 years or so and I don't think that those misinformation will be enough to stop this revolution.",

Father of crypto? I can't help myself, but to laugh. Anyways I will not focus on that one because I agree with what you said that misinformation in the internet is at it's peak right now. There are still newbies out there who are still getting scammed because of misinformation. There are newbies out there who look Bitcoin as a scam because of misinformation. There are still newbies out there who don't want to invest into Bitcoin because they believe that it's a scam. Why?

The good thing about you is that, you did your own research yourself, and saw that everything, or at least most of what they said to you was false. Those fraudsters will try to milk those newbies as many times as they want until they don't have money left. As long as there are newbies, there will always investors who will get scammed.Quote from: Barikui1 on November 06, 2023, 10:49:44 PMthe best I do for them right now is to educate them about it, which some even told me what they think Bitcoin was, which is totally untrue about it.Well, educating them is the way to go, but be careful with the information that you're sharing to them because there might be times where what you're sharing to them are wrong. I guess just continue with what you're doing, and thanks for sharing the correct information to newbies out there.",

(new subnetworks need to be build from fresh learning from old subnetworks mistakes)these days bitcoin has transitioned from being money to being asset (from spending to investing) so you have to show the well known institutions that not only sing bitcoin praise. but also are really involved in it. not just investing in the coin. but setting up services and getting their lawyers to apply to the regulators to show its not just a fad but something seriousso right now bitcoin is settling into the realm of utility as an investment vessel of peoples store of wealth..the whole misinformation game other play in promotions of old subnetworks as solutions was something i had to unravel and reveal as a plot to get people to leave bitcoin. the \"bitcoin NFT\" meme ordinal junk was another one. making sure contacts i knew didnt fall for those crap schemes, and so far they are listening to stick with actual bitcoin hoarding and avoiding the silly games pretending to be bitcoin next gen things",
