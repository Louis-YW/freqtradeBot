  "content": "Neptune Network is a decentralized network that aims to provide a secure, efficient, scalable, fair and transparent platformThe total supply of NT tokens is 20 billion, and the user pool accounts for 64.5% of the total supply. This means that the majority of NT tokens will be distributed to users of the Neptune network. The airdrop listing time depends on the user when the distribution is completed. This requires joint efforts from everyone. After the airdrop is completed, users will receive free airdrop tokens and begin unlocking and redeeming them. At that time, all users can freely buy, sell and exchange all NT tokens in their hands.Neptune Network is a Web3 ecosystem that will bring decentralized interoperability to every cryptocurrency user. Join NT and you will embark on a journey to redefine finance in the digital era.https://neptune.betJoin the Telegram group: https://t.me/NTNetwork1 to receive regular rewards every week",
