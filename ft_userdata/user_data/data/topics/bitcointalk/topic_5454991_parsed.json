The first sacrifice you need to make is to give your time, which is equally your attention, to whatever you want to achieve in this life. Once you have given your full attention, the next thing is for you to figure out areas in which you can focus and channel those times into your areas of specialization in order for them to work for you. One problem most people do have in this life is \"Copyright\" ©️ because they see that \"Bitcoin\" is working for me they will want to do that Bitcoin trading which am doing in other for them to be like me, without even asking for the right information and what's involve how I get to where I am currently, they will just gather little information and not everything and when they do it the way they thinks is right and it didn't work for them they will complain that it's not working for them and they will want to try another different thing moving from one thing to the other which when one have a divided attention on different things they won't actually achieve anything in life, until they give it their full time and turn it their passion unless they want to live by assumption and luck if not real life success most of the time depends on the number of time and dedication given to something.",

Yeah, time is important, especially time spent digging deeper into knowledge about the projects you're investing money in, whether that's stocks or Bitcoin, or any other form of investment. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, I consider patience to be more important than anything else, without patience there can be no success. Of course time isn't everything, but in my opinion not being in a hurry is one of the necessary conditions for success.Quote from: tech30338 on June 03, 2023, 04:23:31 PMEvery time I see people doing crypto then complains that they have done everything but still does not work for them.The reason behind why they wont succeed is because they are counting the hours they have done the work, while they are complaining others are hustling and doing things extra mile.Making extra effort will make things improved in everyway, for example you wan't to learn a lot of things in crypto, things will not be done in one day, remember how elon musk Tesla, SpaceXalmost go to bankrupt, but instead of complaining he continue doing things even though there is a lot of failure on his company.What is the lesson im trying to say, keep your focus even though things get tough, keep moving even though its slow, because eventually those sacrifices will have a positive results, never get tired,because once you quit, you will never get those dreams came trueEach situation is different. Personally, I don't think Musk should be used as an example in general. I mean, we should have access to better examples than heirs investing their funds again and again.Overall I agree with your message, I just think that not all generalisations are true. A lot of people will fail at projects no matter how much time, money and patience they invest in them. Nothing is magic or automatic when we talk about money, and everything involves risks. You're right to think that perseverance is an essential quality, but it's not the only one to have. There are many conditions for success, especially in this market, and some of them are unpredictable.",

Life is full of unexpected twists and turns, and sometimes our initial dreams or plans may need to be adjusted along the way. Yes, I agree that sometimes it is important to remain persistent and focused, but it is equally important to remain open to new opportunities and possibilities that may arise. This does not mean giving up on your dreams, but to remain flexible and willing to evolve with our dreams.",

Every investor should be able to do a periodic evaluation of his performance and identify the reason for his success or failure. People should stop complaining and take responsibility for their actions. QuoteMaking extra effort will make things improved in everyway, for example you wan't to learn a lot of things in crypto, things will not be done in one day, remember how elon musk Tesla, SpaceXalmost go to bankrupt, but instead of complaining he continue doing things even though there is a lot of failure on his company.What is the lesson im trying to say, keep your focus even though things get tough, keep moving even though its slow, because eventually those sacrifices will have a positive results, never get tired,because once you quit, you will never get those dreams came trueLearning and patience are core courses in the field of success. The solution to every problem can be found through research and application of findings. We should identify credible sources and constantly learn and relearn. Business or investment doesn't grow overnight because it takes time to make a profit. That is why every trader or investor needs patience to succeed. If you are not patient, you might sell your coins before it gets to the time to make a profit. Learning also needs patience and time.",

Because what is in their mind is that what they want can be given too easily and too quickly, but not in crypto. No matter what we do, spending 24hrs a day but if we keep in a hurry, things don't work that fast. Hard work and patience are needed when it comes to investing that was the truth and that is the reason why only a few people succeed in investing while many had quit.  And that is why many people had fallen into scam projects believing that this is the answer to their call, INSTANT.

Hours invested in something may not really mean effort because it may mean that it is fruitless when the mode is not in the right ways. Someone who spend a little time but we'll utilized can get a better result. This is why before you invest in a project, you need to make time for your research work so that to be sure you are investing in propsr project but if you make the mistake of wrong investment then you will be running in circles and that means all hours in effort will be long wasted time.",

But this is beyond only bitcoin, if you don't have the patience and endurance to keep going even at your biggest loss, you'll never be able to reach the success and happiness that you desire to and watch others achieve. Time is valuable, and every time you spend learning a new skill and failing, you've merely covered up more time it'll take you to be successful in that skill. Every error you make along the road is a lesson you've learned and will not repeat, making your task shorter in minutes or hours to complete when you try again.

It doesn't mean your doing it wrong but, the activities within the cryptospace is highly unpredictable. How then do you get to quantify what yo expect within a given time or period. Foe all we know  it could go against you and all your predictions. This is the most realistic thing about cryptocurrency.Let me get this straight.Crypto (Bitcoin) is a currency: Yes.Fiat us asuch a currency: Yes.Currencies do appreciate or add value as well as experience some devaluation (Crypto/fiat): Yes.You save fiat in fixed deposit accounts to get interest on them after a given period which is often insignificant and still, your okay having your money back: Yes.Cryptos can be hodl on wallets and you can profit or lose based on the prevailing market condition: Yes.Why then do we find people stressing so much as to what's going on with there hodlings and not do the same for goat.

The ones who begin using crypto-currencies and within few days they leave it because they joined it for the purpose of earning millions of dollars within short amount of time. Those people joined the market just to be rich quickly and were definitely influenced by the social media influencers who told them about the story of Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and Doge, Shiba, Safe moon, and others. They thought that they could also get rich by delving into such market, and would earn millions within weeks.There is a famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr. “If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” That's enough to prove that only the ones who believe in hard-work and consistency will be the winners in the future.
