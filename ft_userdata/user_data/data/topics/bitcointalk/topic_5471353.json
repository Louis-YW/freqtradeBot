  "content": "https://freedom.tech/patriot-act-comes-to-cryptocurrency/A fantastic article authored by Seth For Privacy (https://nitter.cz/sethforprivacy), who is the Head of Strategy & Marketing for Foundation Devices, known for their Passport hardware wallet.As I've mentioned in another thread, and as Seth explains in this article, this newest piece of legislation is an outright attack on bitcoin. It is clear the US government want the only way to use bitcoin to be through fully KYCed centralized exchanges. They are trying their hardest to absorb bitcoin in to the existing fiat system and surveillance state, and destroy the very thing that bitcoin is.What can you do about it? Get your coins off of any centralized exchange and in to your own wallet. Close your KYCed accounts and refuse to ever complete KYC again. Use privacy tools. Anonymize your coins. Refuse to use any service or product which treats bitcoin as non-fungible and discriminates against or censors certain coins. Bitcoin was not made to become an off-shoot of the fiat system, to be another tool by which the government can can surveil, censor, and control. And if you happen to live in the US, start contacting your representatives about this draconian piece of legislation.https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/https://kycnot.me/Spam will be deleted.",

And if someone has not yet realized that any KYC passed will backfire on them in the end, then there is nothing to be done about it. Moreover, state structures will soon begin to more strictly direct ordinary users towards services with different levels of verification. I am deeply convinced that sooner or later the US government will classify all services that exchange bitcoins anonymously as strictly prohibited. I believe it is not a problem for them to refer to any law, for example, section 311 (of the U.S. Patriot Act).",

I am starting to do this now. I often use some KYC services, albeit without completing KYC and felt that was okay cause I was not enabling the anti privacy war, but even if you do not send them your documents, the time period when you use such services, you are dependent on that as a central authority, so if you use an exchange but don't pass through KYC, they can still choose to freeze the coins you are about to trade for no reason and force you to send documents to identify yourself or abandon the coins you just sent. They also collect tons of other information about you which can easily be gotten if you don't use at form of anonymity tool.You are also promoting those anti privacy platforms when you use them to trade, buy/sell or store your coins.Quote from: Three Millionth User on October 23, 2023, 02:51:42 PMYou can't do anything about it until people start learning from their mistakes. They have to first realize what their mistakes are. Many people don't see using centralized platforms and submitting your documents as detrimental to their privacy.",

The problem is not with the exchanges, it is the government and why the exchanges are involved is because the government can only successfully enforce their laws through the exchanges. The exchanges must comply with the rules of the government. Meanwhile, we need to understand that exchanges (CEX or DEX) are very big part of the cryptocurrency industry, the industry cannot do without the exchanges. If you check the number of newbies that come to this industry, majority of them came through the exchanges and instead of them to own non custodial wallet and save their keys, they will open account on exchanges.The government cannot sensor all the bitcoin. There are still highly private people like the Op and some of us who doesn't dwell much on exchanges and KYC.Quote from: Upgrade00 on October 23, 2023, 03:56:15 PMQuote from: DooMAD on October 23, 2023, 03:36:15 PMThat's the tricky part.  Once you've lost it, it's often not an easy thing to obtain again.  Privacy lost cannot be regained, but one can choose to prioritize it after a period of not doing so and still achieve some levels of anonymity.Yea, if you do not validate your data on exchanges, to a certain time the data would become invalid.
