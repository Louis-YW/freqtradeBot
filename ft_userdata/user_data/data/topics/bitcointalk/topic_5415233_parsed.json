  "content": "CHIFFRAL (kg)2022 - The digitized kilogram for all times and all people.A priori ;The beauty of history is that it can be used to connect every subject and is applicable in every aspect. For example, Bitcoin was created as an applied history of gold. Miners mine for it and then decide whether or not to save, invest, or speculate. Bitcoin also emerged as the first successful digital money and what tends to work well is often copied. The emergence of a Web3 is bringing new currencies to the market with the dream of being stable and used as currency, but this may be wrong because everything that could be called money, Bitcoin already is. The alternative coins would only be shadows and will stay that way because they act like central banks, diluting the money supply.Honesty is the first step, which they don't have.Needless to say, that without a foundation, everything would collapse. So, what is the foundation of Bitcoin ?The answer could be trust. Networks could not be established without trust, thus, Chiffral is targeting the core of the problem, for all times and all people.Language is important because it is how we communicate and learn. There are two ways to make a language understandable, you could impose it or you let the market decides. Fiat dollars were strategically imposed, thus, everyone communicates and, (instead of learn) they earn. Bitcoin is letting you the choice to decide to use it or not, unfortunately, it is not widespread as we would wish due to the issue of language (symbol, BTC).There is already a language that everyone knows, but they don't realize it. A language used by every nation, in every day life. We would not have to wait that Bitcoin reaches its full capability, knowing that our time is limited.1- Privacy ;Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or a digital form of money, that could be very useful. However, there is a danger that people might not learn from history and create new cryptocurrencies that are just as good as Bitcoin. If these cryptocurrencies are going to work together, they need to use the same language, or denominator. Some people think that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, will eventually replace traditional fiat currencies, like the US dollar. They believe that Bitcoin is more stable and will not fail like other fiat currencies have in the past. But, are we willing to have Bitcoin as the denominator for all or are we willing to at least create a perfect foundation for every crypto that may exist. Many issues have been met while using Bitcoin like the public ledger which could undermine people's privacy and could get them in trouble with the law in some places. Do we want to risk having those problems?2 -Trust ;In 2010, a person bought 2 pizzas for 10000 Bitcoin. Another problem is that people do not understand Bitcoin because it is not a currency that is used in everyday life. Chiffral is adding a detail that Bitcoin is not able to reach, which is 227 years of trust since the symbol of the kilogram (kg) is used around all nations. You would certainly think twice of spending 10000 kg of Chiffral for 2 pizzas, because you understand the meaning of kg (kilogram).A posteriori ;Chiffral is a cryptocurrency that is already understood by people, even before it is used. The reason for this is because the symbol for the kilogram (kg) is used by all nations and is something that people are familiar with. By having this as a denominator, it will make it easier for people to understand and use cryptocurrencies (that may also exist in the future).@TellAsmar /Telegram",
