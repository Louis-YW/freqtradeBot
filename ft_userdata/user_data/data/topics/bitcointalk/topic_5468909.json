I just hope they improve the support team's services because there are a lot of complaints regarding dealing with the support team.Does the license require a special domain for customers from Singapore, or is it for settling transactions in the local currency, or is it just allowing users to access bank accounts directly from Coinbase?I see that they are working on developing products and services specifically designed for Singapore so it seems that the Singaporean market is filled with many traders.@OP You need to edit the source because it's not working.",

A translation in our local thread explained how coinbase 3rd party KYC data keeper sold those user data on the darknet for $1 each. Coinbase freeze user accounts more frequent than any other centralized exchanges. Nobody knows who is the next target of this platform.",

This move will attract more investors to the crypto sector and it will also create more job opportunities.  Singapore is one of the crypto-friendly countries and they are also taking advantage of the country's industry to attract investors and raise money through tax. Coinbase has been one of the solid exchanges that have lasted for a long time and they have brought innovation to the centralized crypto sector. But we should all remember the fact that the goal of Bitcoin is decentralization.",

Due to regulatory uncertainty, Zebpay moved to Singapore and they are now providing services to over 30 countries. Looking at the current situations in United States more and more cryptocurrency related companies are expected to move to crypto friendly countries like Singapore.

Because Singapore is already a hub of crypto. Crypto and NFTs and Metaverse are being adopted there. The people of Singapore are so educated in the field of crypto. Even if you will see, many exchanges and wallets, belong to the developers and CEO, who are Singaporeans. And coins is a good exchange in the US and bring a good volume to the BTC and overall crypto market cap. But to be honest, I don't like this exchange and there will be many others too, who don't like it. The reasons are a lot but they sold the user's data without them knowing. overall, The news does have some impact and might help more newbies of Singapore to adopt the BTC for daily purposes and this will increase the trading volume and hence the candles will start to make huge too. This means more volume means huge candles. Means more price of BTC.",

Com has already been thriving in that region of Asia so this isn't a cause for celebration.Crypto-currency has gotten main stream that I don't think their is any country in the world that can be restricted from carrying out crypto-currency activities, so the congratulations should go to the exchange because it's good business for them, but newbies never leave your funds on an exchange just a reminder.",

When such huge companies adopt the BTC as payment method then BTC priced up and does the unexpected. Initiatives like these will increase the adoption of BTC overall, and in the long run, we will see BTC breaking the boundaries that it has set before. Because these types of licenses will increase the trust of the people in Coinbase and BTC. Such licenses seem to be irrelevant to those who are old users of crypto and do know and understand the systemBut those who are new to crypto and still do not take part in the cryptocurrency, are going to adopt it now, not everyone, but we will see a small number of people coming to crypto due to such good news. Overall, I am enjoying the market.",

A quick search shows that the business needs to have some capital and one Singaporean citizen involved in the company. It doesn't look like you need to have an office there. If that is the case, the difference is not that big to other SEA countries afaik. The key difference is definitely the infrastructure and access to the market.Not really surprising, considering even businesses like gacha gaming open new branches here every year.",

As more and more countries see the benefits of regulating and supporting the cryptocurrency industry, they are likely to follow suit. This could lead to a significant increase in mass adoption of cryptocurrency in the coming years. I'm also impressed by Coinbase's commitment to working with local regulators and blockchain firms. This shows that the company is serious about building a long-term presence in Singapore, and it is likely to attract more users and clients to the platform. I think this is a very positive development for the cryptocurrency industry in Singapore and around the world. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Coinbase and the rest of the industry. I'm particularly interested to see how Coinbase's collaboration with local blockchain firms will play out. I think this could lead to some innovative new products and services for users in Singapore and beyond. I'm also curious to see how this development impacts the cryptocurrency industry in Singapore more broadly. Will it attract other major exchanges to the country? Will it encourage more businesses to start accepting cryptocurrency payments? I'm excited to see what the future holds!",
