  "content": "Hello , Probably is the most common topic but i couldn’t find an answer by reviewing post topics .1. I use to mine bitcoin back in 2010,2. I have transferred the rewards to bit coin core wallet. Then i spread it to few addresses within 2 wallet.3. I have encrypted all information in few ways and format my hard disk (windows 7)    - encryption 1: encryption of all files with encryption software which I have no clue which one I was( I have few files which I suspect to be key file and container ) maybe using VM    - encryption 2: files made with paint with the QR of every address in the wallet                          - same with: word, PowerPoint, photoshop, excl. the files as been corrupted by removing    header of file and change of the extension      - encryption 3: the bin folder with the files inside (but I’m not sure about it)* I have protected many windows files and information ( basically all the windows folder) if I need to restore the user somehow * if I remember right part of the transduction I did while the wallet is closed Thank you all so much",

      "body": "The first two things you say make sense: you used to mine bitcoin 12 years ago and you created two local bitcoin core wallets to hold your mining rewards.What comes next in your post is seriously confusing... as is the actual question you're posing...What did you do to what disk exactly? Did you use all 3 types of \"encryption\" (eventough only \"encryption 1\" is actual encryption... Hiding info in image files or \"hidden?\" folders isn't encryption... especially if we're just talking about plain qr code images... If they were really hidden inside the image that would be called steganography, but this isn't what we're talking about i assume.)?It seems pretty strange to me that you'd be able to make a core wallet in 2012 and put any qr code in an image file... Core wasn't HD at that point, so your wallet would just be tons of completely random private keys.... Or did you mean you still have QR codes for addresses saved somewhere (they are useless when it comes to recovering).I can give you one tip to start with: if you formatted a disk with encrypted info and you want to have *any* chance in recovering: do not boot from that hard disk, do not write to that hard disk... Either seek specialised help, or at least clone the complete disk (for example, using dd).Now, if you're seeking help, it would probably be in your best interest to seek a professional (especially when talking about larger amounts). If you want to do it yourself (with or without our help), we really need to know more: What did you do exactly and in which order did you do those steps...ps: if, during this discussion, anybody asks you for the actual data, or for your seed, or your private key(s) or your wallet files: do not give this info to anybody....",

Did you manually export the private key and address pair and generate the qr code (since, iirc, bitcoin core did not have a functionality to generate qr codes including private keys... but my memory is fuzzy at the best of days, so i could be wrong)Anyways, my initial advice would still be the same: make sure you don't overwrite any more blocks (since you say you formatted the disk). Bring it to a professional, or (at very least) make a complete clone of your disk before proceeding.Then, everything depends on the kind of encryption you used... Was it full disk encryption or file based encryption? If file based encryption, you could probably use file recovery tools and try to recover the encrypted files on your formatted disk... Afterwards you'd have to either find information on the encryption scheme by looking at the recovered file, or by brute forcing all methods?",
