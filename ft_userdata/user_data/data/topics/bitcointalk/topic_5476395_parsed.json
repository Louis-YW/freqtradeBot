Consider a casino platform that does not want its users to go through KYC. They have a smart contract that directly forms a bridge to wallets on either the Ethereum blockchain or the Binance chain. They use the same technique as a Bitcoin mixer wherein they convert deposited Bitcoin to what we know as Wrapped Bitcoin on either of these two or other blockchains, isn't that a mixer when you withdraw the deposit amount to your chosen wallet?   I understand that it is not possible to deposit Bitcoin on a smart contract-based non-kyc casino. What I understand is that it is easy to convert Bitcoin into other altcoin-based Bitcoin and then what will happen? Will theymos again ban them? I have other options to hide my Bitcoin identity such as I can convert my Bitcoin to XMR and then it won't be easy to trace it. What do you think will be the next option for Bitcoin mixers, is it no KYC casino or Monero?",

Now if you talking of Non kyc casinos is just saying a decentralized casinos which is mostly of wallet connection to make deposit and withdrawal except for the centralized casinos that asked of users identity to deposit & withdraw large funds.  Quote from: _act_ on December 03, 2023, 04:47:00 PMYou know exchanges are like mixersWait for a moment, I am being confused here.. but didn't find this in his post to also place same ban on exchange, did he?",

      "body": "The difference is that a Bitcoin mixer advertises itself as providing privacy, I guess. The real question is what's the difference between a mixer and any method which involves obfuscating your coins like coinjoins and Monero. Practically, the latter are even better for concealing illicit activity, because they are unstoppable and do not rely on a central point of failure which can confiscate property. Quote from: Bureau on December 03, 2023, 04:39:44 PMWhat do you think will be the next option for Bitcoin mixers, is it no KYC casino or Monero?We really don't know. This ban was unexpected. I think we are all in the process of trying to grasp what has happened. I am pretty confident that theymos would yield to government pressure and censor no-KYC casinos, Monero, or any other content if the authorities apply enough influence.",

XMR is the next option for mixing alternatives since it’s just a simple buy and sell if you can find a decent exchange that offers it. Bitcoin mixer will not be gone in general. I believe they will continue exist and use different crypto forum as long as there’s demand for their service.",

When you use a Web3 casino you need to connect your wallet, and the funds you win are sent by the smart contracts back to the address you've used to send your funds first. I don't know any web3 decentralized casino allowing users to change the destination address of the smart contracts. So could you share an example if you know one of them? In addition why did you mention casinos and not exchanges without KYC or Dexs? They could do the same thing as that if it is possible.",

As explained in post by _act_ where the Bitcoin you are going to receive isn't the coin from the address that you have sent the Bitcoin. I already know this since I have done it myself when I was gambling and I was kind of curious so, I did checked the address I have sent the Bitcoin and I see it in there but not the Bitcoin I received since it is from another address. Mixers are a service if you put it that way where you won't receive Bitcoin from the same address where you have sent it and there's no games in there but only the mixing service alone.",

Okay, so I'm forbidden from advertising a site in which you're allowed to mix bitcoin through atomic swaps, but it's totally fine to advertise a service which converts your bitcoin to XMR as long as you can't convert it back to bitcoin within the service?And BTW, does there even exist a service which allows you to exchange bitcoin with altcoin but not the other way around?Quote from: FatFork on December 03, 2023, 06:47:33 PMSo, for example, you can literally get your own coins back when you make a withdrawal from a casino or exchange.Or you can get entirely different coins, therefore have them mixed.",

But there is a bigger question around what truly separates mixers from other common ways people try to obscure their coin trails? I guess this ban caught many off guard which suggests the boundaries and distinctions around privacy versus illegality remain blurry here.  Ultimately, we lack clarity on what crosses the line or why this particular practice went too far when plenty of other obfuscation techniques persist.  It seems an area of crypto desperately needing thoughtful guidelines that protect privacy without enabling crime.",
