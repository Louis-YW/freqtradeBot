  "content": "Hi Guys,I am currently working on a project to launch structured products on BTC (and probably on ETH as well at some point).I have spent 10 years in finance and even though I am staggered by the developing speed of the ecosystem, I am very disappointed with the products proposed to trade on a smarter way than just a future with x200 leverage (and also because I am not ready to bet my house on the markets).So if you are interested with this topic, just hit me up or join the Discord group of The Phalanx Project (https://discord.gg/Jf4G8jzm) or send an e-mail to phalanx.structured.products@gmail.com.Every feedback valued and welcome.Cheers",
