If there is 1:100 Odds then over time the mathematical average will hit your number 1 out of a 100. Now you could hit the number 3 times in a row or go 1000 times without hitting it. Either way, the casino is always going to take their cut. So you will lose in the long run the equivalent of the house edge. If the house edge is 2% then you will lose $2 out of $100 over time.",
