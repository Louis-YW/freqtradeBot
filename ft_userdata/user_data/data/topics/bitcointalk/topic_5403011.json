If they're not closed they're open for scamming I want people to understand they're 100% scam.Let's put it this way, if you manage to close/block 1 such site, at least 2-3 new ones will appear. Bad guys use the freedom of the internet to do bad things, and no one seems to be able to stop them at this point. However, it is not just that such sites exist, but that someone can even think that such an offer can be true - a grown man who thinks logically should never fall into such a trap.Furthermore, people looking for ways to get rich quick are most often victims of such scams, and scammers are counting on that. Money does not fall from the sky, unknown people online do not share it with other strangers, but false promises are enough for some even when they suspect that something is wrong.",

You will find some people who come to the crypto world only with the thought of getting rich quick. Those who are looking for more shortcuts and ways to make quick profits are actually the victims of such scams. Those crypto users should try to understand that where they offer more lucrative offers, they are more likely to fall into the trap of scams.",

I agree that even if they are supported by personalities or influencers or they boast of having connection to a well known company if they offer a very high percentage of daily profit or promise double your coin, it is a 100% scam, it can't ever be sustainable and no way it can be legit, scam is the other word for the doubler.",

This kind of scammer is even easier to guess, no need to do more research. No one really doubles money just by sending it instantaneously.send 0.1 BTC you Receiv 0.2 BTC, just a joke. in crypto anything can happen, there is no get-rich-quick scheme, everything requires a process.",

It's about them offering you a fabulous opportunity to make a lot of money, in this case doubling it, but you have to give/send the money first.In this case you have to send them your Bitcoins for them to \"double\" them and once you have sent them you lost them.Most of us don't get caught in these scams, but there is always the unwary who fall into the trap. I even remember that last year I was watching a video on Youtube of Saylor with some subtitles saying that to promote the Bitcoin, they also doubled what you had to send first. And it didn't occur to me to send anything, but at the time I didn't think it was a scam. I could have believed at times that it was a Michael Saylor promotion. It was the next day when I saw a thread about it on the forum that I realized it was a scam.",

In the digital world, there really are countless opportunities for scam, and scammers are taking advantage of it relentlessly.Instead of hours spent on YT or some social network, I would advise all these young people to read some good book, go to nature, or do some good deed.
