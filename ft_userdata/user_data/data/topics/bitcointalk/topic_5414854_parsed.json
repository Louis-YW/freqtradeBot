If it's still under warranty, contact them and ask for a replacement unit [here's a case with a slightly different issue] and if you're out of luck, you can refer to the following thread: Ledger Nano S Oled Screen Replacement",

I assume you’ve got the mnemonic well stored somewhere offline, so if worst comes to worst, you’ll be able to restore your seed on another device/wallet.The image looks worse than other cases I’ve seen, where some parts had the normal brightness, whilst other were very dim (but still there). Not sure if it’s due to the photograph itself, but I can’t see any of the dimmed part I was referring to on your image.As a very temporary procedure in case of extreme need, it is sometimes possible, albeit not likely for a long time, to see if you can make out the information on screen in a completely dark room. Another option is to use the phone’s camera and zoom in (it seems to ease the dimming effect).Edit: Missed your second post. If your ledger was brand new, you should get it replaced where you bought it. You could try using a different cable so as to give it a go, just to discard a cable issue.",

I don't think it's something that should be emphasized too much, because the screens on smartphones or TVs also break, and such devices cost significantly more than the cheapest models of hardware wallets. As with the advice above, contact the manufacturer and try to get a replacement even if the device is not under warranty (some have succeeded).",

I can't think of a way how that can be caused by not using it for a long time.Who knows what could be the issue...I know laptops can have issue with display board when some resistors or chips stops working or burn out. Ledger is using very cheap chinese display, and it's possible contact connections gets loose over time or something related with crystals.Most problems people reported with wallets not used for a long time was dim screen, I can't explain why but maybe ledger can explain this better.",
