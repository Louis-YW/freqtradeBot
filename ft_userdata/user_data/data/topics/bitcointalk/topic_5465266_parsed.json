  "content": "Despite the warning, Nigeria, Africa like stable coins. The reason for this thread. Awareness to convert your BUSD to bitcoin or other stable coins, or to dollar in your domiciliary account.Many people among us do not hold naira because naira is a depreciating asset, we all hope maybe one day this would changed. But as of now, inflation has encouraged us not to save money in naira but in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But some Nigerians also prefer stable coins like USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, TUSD, USDP, FDUSD, ex cetera. BUSD because I know many people among us use Binance exchange.It is better you convert your BUSD to bitcoin or other stable coins. I will advice people to use domiciliary account and hold dollar directly, but do not let us deceive ourselves, we know many people among us just want to avoid bank. But domiciliary account will still be my advice.The purpose of this thread is to tell you people to just convert from BUSD without thinking about it twice.Paxos Will Halt Minting New BUSD Tokenshttps://twitter.com/binance/status/1697159019234791909The main link the read: Binance Encourages Users to Convert BUSD to Other Stablecoins Prior to February 2024Quote from: https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-encourages-users-to-convert-busd-to-other-stablecoins-prior-to-february-2024-d392843e81fd4bc3a5f7eAs Paxos has halted minting of new BUSD, Binance will gradually cease support for BUSD products. Announcements will be released for any impacted services. Please be assured that BUSD will always be backed 1:1 by USD.Binance will continue to support multiple stablecoins and digital assets on its platform. Users are encouraged to convert their BUSD assets into other available assets on Binance prior to February 2024. Users may trade their BUSD balances for FDUSD at zero trading fees, or convert their BUSD balances to FDUSD at 1:1. Although Binance will allow people to convert BUSD to other coins until February 2024. I think this is one of the exchanges that knows how to plan for their customers not to panic, but not during hack.",

Domiciliary account is not the best, but better in the absence of a better one. Also I can not totally discourage stable coins, you can hold little amount of stable coin which you can afford to lose. If there is a stable coin that is independent and trustworthy like bitcoin, it would have been the best, but none like this is existing.",

Well, stable coins are issued by centralized corporations and these stable coins can lose their peg; they can also be frozen in any wallet you store them.

Due to the fact that the value of naira keeps depreciating, converting to dollars or Bitcoin should be a better solution now, because in a short time, #1000 might be equal to $1, or it could be worse, and when that happens, it's really going to affect those that are keeping a large amount of money in the bank without investing it or putting it into a currency that can retain its value or even add to the value. In the forex market, that's just how those currencies are traded. Any money kept in naira should just be a small amount that has been kept for use.",

True fact..When you draft out your expenses for the month (including weekly expenses) it would allow you to be able to save and manage your savings in btc or usd but let it be that you are holding a decentralized asset be it usdt. Alternative options is just to hold bitcoin, maybe for regular spending should be from someone setting a business maybe one should plan himself or themselves properly, banks are something else and their accumulated charges are so annoying just waiting for money to get into account and they automatically debited you from it.",

But however, it's been nice of you sharing this update among us, as people who owned BUSD will do well from today to convert their coins to Bitcoin now that the market is still bearish, or other stable coins such as USDT, which happens to be the most popular stable coin.",

I don't know what was bringing down USDT value, but if I can recall correctly, then BUSD was overvalued to the USDT, where it was around 0.99 or 0.98, and the Busd was equal to 1, and when converting large amounts from Busd to USDT, you will always have some figures added to you. That's when I noticed that a few people that I know prefer using the Busd as a payment option when ever we have a deal that requires me sending them crypto.",

      "body": "This is a good piece of advice and further awareness to those who didn't know, it's also better for those who are smart enough to be proactive on this. I don't deceive myself which is why I've never seen a reason for me to save my coins in a stablecoin other than the USDT as it could serve all the purposes I want from it and it's even the most recognized and most valuable of all the stablecoins. The only time I sent money to the BUSD was a mistake, I mistook it for BNB, and I made the correction immediately.Also, the advice about saving the money in a bank account domiciled in the USD is a very good one, I was even the first person on our board who suggested this months ago (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456858.msg62427913#msg62427913) since I've been doing it over 10 years and it has helped me against the country's inflation. I continue doing this often despite having money stored in the stablecoin as well, this is to limit my storing risk as I still trust my USD in the bank than the USDT off the bank which could be hacked at any time.Nonetheless, this still tables down to what the money is meant for, keep it in the bank if there is no use for it and keep it in stablecoin if it's intended for investments. I can't imagine keeping all the money I don't have an immediate use for in stablecoin for a whole year, it's not a smart decision unless the person has something to hide.However, stablecoin is the best to work with when you invest and trade in cryptocurrency, you can easily switch coins with it with ease. It saves during bearish times and will hold the asset until the bullish moment is reactivated when it could be sent back for crypto investments.",
