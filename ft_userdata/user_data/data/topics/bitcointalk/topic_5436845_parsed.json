The 90% of games that have been out from crypto are not really games, play to earn was big a year ago but that is gaming for me, you just click one a day or something similar... The one game with crypto aspect I like was Thetan Arena, at least you were playing and It was interesting but the crypto aspect of the game was bad. The game that can be interesting to play and have sustainable crypto aspect will do really good. But those games need a lot of time to make and crypto being volatile it only makes it harder.",

And they're hardly found on the blockchain games. For instance, GTA has multiple players around the globe, if similar games are integrated on the blockchain gaming niche, it'll be of great influence to players. And they can earn through the time spent playing games. Another fascinating games are peer to peer games where people connect through the internet and play with other players around the globe. I think Web3 would facilitate the integration of peer to peer games. We should also look on investors for the gaming projects, if PES or FIFA invests into crypto games they'll be a change and more players would join the train.",

      "body": "Most streamers despise cryptocurrency for a couple of things. Wintrading and scamlinks for instance are where most of their hatred is seated. Wintrading is the act of deliberately throwing your game for the promise of benefit from a player from the enemy team, most of the time this comes in the form of monetary compensation and crypto is one of the biggest payment channels these wintraders abuse, due to anonymity and other reasons. Scamlinks from crypto scams also litter their viewer chats way back then from bots who send links in waves. This has been effectively solved now but the impact it made in the streaming industry made it so that almost all streamers automatically hate anything that involves crypto.",

Many are hesitant to play despite how good the mechanics is because of these. If there will be a game that will remove or lesten these hurdles then it will probably a changing matter, its just a matter of when it will be available.",
