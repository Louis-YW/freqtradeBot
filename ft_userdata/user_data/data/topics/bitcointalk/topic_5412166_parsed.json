Medicine is finding its way into the cutting edge of crypto and the Blockchain spaceQuoteThe Omnicom Health Group, we believe that technology has already transformed healthcare,from research and clinical trials, to treatment modalities and overall wellness.This group of health practitioners so much believe in the possible innovative advancement the blockchain and crypto industry stand to contribute to the general Healthcare improvement as well as ensuring 100% patient data accuracy and accelerate the access to drugs and increase inherence..One of the key sectors where trust should be shifted from censorship to decentralised distributed ledger. Even if it will require permission to gain access to such data but the fact that it remains accurate keeps the trust the world will have for the Healthcare sector to its maximum.QuoteIncentives and data integration are not new concepts in healthcare. However, innovativetechnologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies enable transparencies for dataownership and thereby give each stakeholder greater involvement and responsibility in thedistribution and management of healthcare.The idea of an encrypted public ledger among medical agencies, patients, and networks(on a network owned and mined by the patients themselves) invites an exciting future thatcould change the way data is used to treat patients.Far from being a science fiction concept, many companies are exploring how to incorporatecryptocurrencies in current operations. Broader applications will be imagined and broughtto market, significantly transforming the care of health across every individual andpopulation, while also giving patients the power to see how their information is shared.Do you also see a future of quality health care with crypto and Blockchain?source: Omnicom]=https://omnicomhealthgroup.com/pdfs/Cryptocurrency-in-Healthcare.pdf]Omnicom",
