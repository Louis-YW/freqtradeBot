  "content": "Broadly speaking in gambling, there are 4 patterns/graphs of winning or losing which maybe we all are sure of and have experienced one of the 4 patterns of gambling distortion. Keep in mind that this discussion is just the result of my research and may or may not be true. Before I go any further, I remind you that gambling is a game that must be controlled as healthy as possible and can be accounted for by itself, therefore, be wise in dealing with gambling regardless of the type of gambling.First, let's discuss the gambling distortion pattern as shown in the image below:1. Gambling Distortion Pattern IBased on the pattern image above, it is certainly familiar from the start we have made a potential winning deposit right in front of our eyes. Well if this pattern occurs or has been experienced, it looks like you will continue to play or another possibility you decide to immediately withdraw your winnings and leave. Because you realize that if the game continues, you will most likely lose.2. Gambling Distortion Pattern IIBased on the second picture, in short, you will understand that when we make an initial deposit, we immediately lose and are never awarded a win. If a gambling pattern like this happens to us, there are 2 outputs that result: first, you give up and don't try again because you realize that gambling will not make you win against the house or you continue to run out.3. Gambling Distortion Pattern IIINext is a picture of the third gambling pattern of course when you first make a deposit you get a total win, but here the problem is that you lose control and are too confident that the victory you just got is just the beginning and feel confident that there will still be many wins ahead. Conditions like this push you into a trap that motivates you mentally to continue to have big ambitions. As a result, the wins are getting smaller, little by little loss but still accompanied by uncontrollable ambition, finally, all the balances owned are lost.4. Gambling Distortion Pattern IVFinally, the 4th picture is about gambling distortion which I think is quite interesting and of course plays with mentality and capital in gambling. Where the pattern above describes the ups and downs of the gambling rhythm that is experienced. At the beginning of making a deposit, you are given a win, feel comfortable and then experience continuous losses and your capital is almost exhausted, but then the victory comes back unexpectedly after feeling that at that point of defeat there will be no more wins, but it turns out that your emotions are revived and Epic Blast is a great resurgence in gambling.Based on all the graphic descriptions of gambling above, it encourages me to share, whether it is for beginners or maybe those who have been playing gambling for a long time must have experienced this kind of gambling distortion. One more thing I emphasize is that what has been said does not mean I encourage someone to start a gambling journey. But just sharing experiences because gambling is often considered by people a source of instant wealth. Unfortunately, such thinking is not true and must be straightened out. You can have fun gambling, but as fun, as it is, remember that gambling carries a higher risk of losing and mental disorders.Conclusion: what I say can be wrong and can also be right, you can correct what I explain if there is an error. Please share what kind of gambling experiences and patterns you often experience while at the casino.",

But when they're keep losing, they hope they will comeback just like the pattern IV. While the truth most of gamblers will end like the pattern III where they're greedy enough to make profit.Everyone will don't want to experienced the pattern II while actually 99% of the gamblers will be like that.",

      "body": "I think pattern 1 and 4 must be statistically infrequent or more infrequent than the other 2. On the other hand, I think we should add another pattern that would be a variation of pattern 1: it would consist of the person who wins, goes home but halfway or as soon as he arrives he gets a compulsion and returns to the casino to end up losing everything and more. I suppose it would be similar to pattern 3, but with a time gap that represents when the player leaves the casino and ends up returning.",

It is more like what pattern you have in picture three. There is that enticement with first and second attempts before the house begins to take all it has allowed you win. You also said something about being sensible while gambling. That is the advise but most times we do not have the ability to stick to that advise. And that is what brings addiction.",

Most of the time, they are just breaking even and not even enjoying the fruits of their labor; they just exerted a lot of effort just to go back to square 1.

I am obviously losing money in the long run although I already offset it with what I earn and save + the amount that I use to gamble every week ($20, never over that). The first pattern is a trap that people should avoid. Of course, we're high on our emotions and we'll be thinking that we are in for a treat, but over time, the house wins against us and we'll easily lose our first win.",

Gamblers experience good win at the beginning deposits, and after few withdrawal they feel more confident and go for large capital deposit which ends with maximum loss and unable to recover the losses. Gambling will have ups and downs and this distortion pattern should also have the key element luck.When luck gets added automatically the variation will be much and the patterns will change completely. Four distortion patterns can be termed as winning pattern, losing pattern, Control pattern and recovery pattern.",

Please share what kind of gambling experiences and patterns you often experience while at the casino.I never really thought about how the patterns in gambling would look like. The 4 pictures you gave us are all a simplistic approach, especially the first and second picture are only linear lines which is not so realistic. For me these are the most common scenarios, it either goes well or it's a bad evening and I am losing money. But in either direction there are moves up and down on the line. It's not like I lose two games and then I know I will only lose that night. The pictures make it seem that there is a trend in gambling which of course there isn't. A total loss like in picture 3 rarely happens these days, because I try to have treshold loss in place after which I stop gambling for the day. So once I lose a few rounds in a row and I used all my budget for the week I have to stop gambling. In my opinion such an approach is important to avoid going broke, because once you lose all your money is no more chance to recover. Splitting my bankroll in smaller sizes to gamble each week there is a much higher chance to  recover my losses from the previous week. The last picture is what mostly happens when I run my martingale strategy, there is a loss streak only to be recovered at the end.",

The pattern depends on someone's gambling style and of course the choice of the game, in my opinion, those of us who like to play slots more often fall into \"maxwin/lossmax\" situations. In my experience, one pattern is missing, we also have an almost straight line, where we don't win or lose much. It's like some normal play, the opposite of the aggressive style of playing that includes a lot of pushing and rising bets. This aggressive style is usually responsible for these patterns presented by OP.",

      "body": "The first pattern, you deposited money into a gambling site, you win and you withdraw your money. That is not possible in reality for most people but just only few people because if someone gamble and win, he will want to continue to gamble and enjoy it. If the person is not conscious enough, he would later lose and the loss can be max.The second pattern, in a way you will deposit and never won before losing. This has happened to me before but very not frequent. When I was an addict, I go for small odds, win more bets but lose more amount of money until I lose all due to the small odds I did use to go for.  But this can happen to people that just gamble with the max amount they have.The third pattern in a way a gambler wins and have confidence to play more but to lose more after winning is very common in gambling if the person continues to gamble at the moment.I do not believe in the fourth pattern. Every gambler that wants to win should just leave gambling for some days or a week before gambling again after losing if he wants to have the right mindset to use to make profit again from gambling. Comeback is almost not possible in gambling.",

If a person gambles and losses money in the first place, the initial reaction would be to recover it. This cycle has brought about so much damage to gamblers where they have this attitude of retaliating and recovering their losses. The graphs that you provided OP are very informative- I hope majority of the people would be open and read this information. Thank you, OP!",
