So what do you think about bnb in next 5years?Is it really worth for long investment?  Will it increase like ether or become dump like others exchange coins? Totally depends on what would be the relevance or popularity of Binance Exchange in the next 5 years that we do have. We do able to see those popular exchange platforms on 2015-18 as far as i remember on which it is pertaining about Poloniex and Bittrex and this is something that no one believed that they would really be replaced out by Binance on later years. If Binance would be able to maintain out its reputation and popularity then we can assume that BNB price would really be might be able to increase its price even more comparing to now,but if we are seeing the different thing like it gets hacked and losses out its popularity then expect on what would be the price condition of those binance related coins like on the things that been mentioned above. Everything would really be mainly affected and this is one of the risks involved on investing with Bnb or even other coins which it doesnt really give out assurance or sureness about profit for long term or even on forever.",

BNB can fall to almost of no value and become shit coin and become useless for previous holders.  That's the reason why exchange coins are always risky. And i think bnb price will be effected in future because of being hacked and attacks as 5 years is very long time. Apart from that, bnb could be profitable invest in long period even still it is good to hold for next bull session. Risk is everywhere even others altcoins have also such possibilities but without risk, no profit will be gained. Or btc is only option for investment",

So what do you think about bnb in next 5years?As long as the exchange site will be long live and BNB will always be stable. The product is the main key that was backing the price of BNB. I remind you that if BNB has hundred millions people registered on its exchange site. It has also billions daily trade volume. As long as the exchange site can keep its platform and nothing happen with BNB. BNB may able to reach another all time high again once the price of bitcoin will break another record. It's just matter of time. The key was on the exchange site caused by this used to backed the BNB.Quote from: Justin999 on August 23, 2023, 09:30:30 PMIs it really worth for long investment?  Will it increase like ether or become dump like others exchange coins? It's really worth and why not? I tell you that if binance has been owning so many utilities on its platform nor blockchain. So many people are actively using it right now. it sounds non sense if it will be dumped like another exchange site. The main problem was consistently to always being honest. Another exchange site like FTX dumped caused by it can't be honest.",

All in your hand want to hold BNB for next five year or not because I don't really trust with CZ as owner of BNB, several time get cases with SEC Commission and bring negative impact for making BNB back to lower price. Don't fully trust with holding all your money in BNB for five years later, better spent half o few percent of your assets in several kinds of coin not only with BNB. Last two months, BNB have down trend price and keep going down every day, CZ still not update yet about what happen with BNB drop drastically last two months.",

In addition, the opBNB network is currently being tested, aimed at solving the scalability problem, and in which BNB will also act as a native token.
