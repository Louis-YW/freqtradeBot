  "content": "I stumbled on this online and I decide to analyze this on how it could help for finance freedom.1. BE YOUR OWN BOSS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE“If you don’t build your dream, someone else will hire you to build theirs.” – Bill Gates.This may sound not too easy for someone from a poor home. Most people believe you should have millions of naira to start a business but this doesn't work that way often. Although all businesses need money for establishing and survival but always remember one can start small especially in a developing countries. There are some businesses that one can start with little capital.Key word: In most developing countries, there are always a problem to solve in the community. This can be  financial strength. So, study your community, observe their problem and provide a solution to it through your business. No matter how small it is, you are now your own boss and this will grow big one day.2. START AS EARLY AS POSSIBLETime wait for no one, start anything you want to do on time. Remember, alot of people are in search of same opportunity. Delay may not be helpful. I remember 6 years ago, when I plan to start a POS business in my location, no such business around then. If I had started earlier, I would have gotten a stand before other but my delay make me lose the business opportunity. Today, we have over 10 POS in that same community.3. FOCUS ON YOUR UNHAPPY CUSTOMERSTry to make people happy is always a the best. For a customer to be unhappy, there is a problem somewhere. Get involved, study their problems, learn from it, take into account any feedback they are giving you, as it’s a cheap and easy way to adjust and improve your product or service for the future.4. MOVE FAST AND KEEP INNOVATINGMost today’s successful entrepreneurs live by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s now-famous motto: “Move fast and break things.”  In our ever-changing world, it’s essential to keep up with the constant updates and changes to technology. In a world that is full of new start-ups, you need to always move faster than your competitors. We raced to put our products into consumers’ hands as fast as possible. So always act fast on any opportunity that comes your way.5. ALWAYS TAKE A CALCULATED RISKIt’s nearly impossible to start a new business or launch a new product without some degree of risk-taking. Calculating ones risk in business may help to determine if the business worth investing on. Weigh your risk to your possible outcomes and determine the expected return. If a positive outcome the relative risk of a negative outcome, then such business opportunity can be utilized.6. TRAVEL THE WORLD AND LEARN NEW THINGSTraveling is part of education and learning. During the process, you meet new friends and learn new ideas which may be useful in your business in future. Travelling around the world can help to bring new business idea. Honorable Akin Alabi, the founder of Nairabet (a sport betting company in Nigeria) was the first person to introduce sport gambling to Nigerians. He brought the idea from overseas. The idea hits Nigerians and he makes alot of money from this. Till today alot of sport gambling company keep surfacing in Nigeria.CONCLUSIONNothing good come easy. It involves great work with passion. Your decision on what to become in life can drive you towards achieving your dreams. It may take some time to rationally get from where you are to where you want to be but you will definitely be there one day. Just take make a move, start something, be focus and see how success will drive you towards your dream.",

The potential for success is always in front of us in its own way and with the portion we take. Always remember the portion of success, because then we don't need to be anyone other than creating financial freedom according to what we can.I just want to say that the 6 points mentioned are not foreign to our ears. Believe us we always try to do it according to the portion of life and the portion of each success. I follow all the motivations of Bill Gates but the portion of success according to Bill Gates and the portion of success according to us is clearly very different.",

Just take make a move, start something, be focus and see how success will drive you towards your dream.Exactly.And just as Bill Gates, what I've read with another wealthy guy in the name of Jack Ma. He said that when you're around 20s to early 30s is that you need to find a good boss. Because everything that boss have learned with his entire experiences and run, he'll share to you just how good he is. There are people that don't have passion for business and making their own company so they stay in employment and working for a company.That's applicable to them and when they have found a good boss, I guess all the learnings will be there and that good boss will encourage that person to start his entrepreneurial journey.",

This is why it is a developing country, and not developed. It is expensive to hire people, there are a lot of taxes, bureaucracy, etc... Things are much simpler in a developed country.I know it is always possible to make money in a developing country, but big companies and great ideas (like amazon, microsoft, tesla, etc) never come from Brazil or Nigeria, but from United States, England, Germany.... There is a reason for that.Anyway, those are nice suggestions from Bill Gates. I liked the last one \"travel the world\"",

For a customer to be unhappy, there is a problem somewhere. Get involved, study their problems, learn from it, take into account any feedback they are giving you, as it’s a cheap and easy way to adjust and improve your product or service for the future.This reminds me on Jeff Bezos in one of the earliest Amazon documentary. His philosophy has always been that the company should be customer-centric and he has always stuck with it. Here are some of my favorite quotesThe most important single thing is to focus obsessively on the customer. Our goal is to be earth’s most customer-centric company.If there’s one reason we have done better than of our peers in the Internet space over the last six years, it is because we have focused like a laser on customer experience.We’re not competitor obsessed, we’re customer obsessed. We start with what the customer needs and we work backwards.Focusing on the customer makes a company more resilient.If you make customers unhappy in the physical world, they might each tell six friends. If you make customers unhappy on the Internet, they can each tell 6,000.",

No pressure, but I feel everyone should be able to find out the position best fitted for them on time and be the best accordingly, either the best boss, or the best team player. Everyone will like to be the boss of themselves, but truthfully, everyone cannot shoulder the responsibility that comes with the position and title, so just find what works for you.",

Because if you are lazy in any work or any thing, you can never do it properly.Always thinking about something new, planning to do something new etc. Doing these will develop the talent.work harder Because there is no development in anything without hard work.

Quote1. BE YOUR OWN BOSS AS SOON AS POSSIBLEBecoming an entrepreneur should be a planned and calculated step. Before you start your business you must ensure that you have studied the business and draw a roadmap of its operations. I have seen people resign from their paid jobs without planning because they want to venture into a particular business. Most of them regretted their action because the business failed. Quote“If you don’t build your dream, someone else will hire you to build theirs.” – Bill Gates.Everybody must not be an entrepreneur to be successful. Some people do not possess the attributes or temperament of entrepreneurs. They are wired to be hired by others. Their dream might be to be the best salesman in the company. If I am hired and paid well to assist someone builds his dream, then I am good.Quote2. START AS EARLY AS POSSIBLEStarting early means avoiding procrastination. If you have all you need to be an entrepreneur and you are sure that you would be successful and you keep postponing the start date. Starting early in business is relative and I don't think it is all about age. You start when you are ready. Some successful business owners started at a tender age, while others started when they were old. It is also important to utilize identified opportunities because you might lose them. Quote3. FOCUS ON YOUR UNHAPPY CUSTOMERSFocus on every customer. Treating happy customers well would motivate them to bring in more customers. If you focus only on the unhappy ones, you might lose the happy ones. Quote6. TRAVEL THE WORLD AND LEARN NEW THINGSTraveling gives so much exposure and experience but it is very expensive. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to travel outside their environment because opportunities and innovative ideas can be identified. But you can travel on the internet and other forms of mass media. You can travel anywhere around the world with your computer or phone.",

I agree with all of the above, but there is one more thing.I don't remember which article of his I read, it was quite a while ago, but there was a good emphasis on the next thought. And he is not the first, but he applied it very qualitatively in modern business. The essence of this thought is extremely simple - correctly assess the situation, identify real problems, draw the right conclusions. Sounds simple, even primitive. To clarify this slogan, I will cite one historical fact so that you understand its value. I do not answer for the accuracy of the nuances, I retell from memory, please take into account The Second World War. Britain is fighting in the air of Europe with the German Luftwaffe. Of course, a problem arises - the survivability of combat aircraft. The designers are focusing on determining the damage to aircraft, very carefully studying the damaged aircraft that have flown to the airfields, in which the hull, engine, and control systems are damaged. The goal is to determine the thinnest places in order to correct and increase the survival rate of both equipment and crews. A lot of work is being done, constructive changes are being made to the design of aircraft. But what is surprising - it does not give a noticeable result ...And only one young designer asks to give him the floor, promising to explain what the venerable designers are wrong about. Absolutely expected, he is \"sent away\", young, inexperienced, what can he say useful?! But some time passes and the designers understand that their great efforts do not give a noticeable change in the situation. And then they remember the young engineer and invite him to speak. He comes and says simple words, but which turned the minds of all venerable and experienced designers and engineers. He said the following:- You have chosen the wrong point for defining problems. You are examining the planes that FLYED to the airfield, and we need to investigate those planes that DID NOT FLY and crashed, because. they were fatally injured! The planes that have flown in do not have such, there are damages that created big problems, but did not \"kill the apparatus and pilots.\" After that, British engineers began to collect downed aircraft, and began to study OTHER damage that actually led to the destruction of aircraft. After that, completely different changes were made to the design of the aircraft, and the survivability of British aircraft instantly increased!This is what I mean - we very often look for a problem not where it really exists, and based on incorrect conclusions, we make incorrect decisions.Sorry if it's long, but very revealing.ling.",
