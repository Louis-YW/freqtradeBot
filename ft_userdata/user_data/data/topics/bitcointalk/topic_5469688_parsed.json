Orphan blocks (using the real meaning of the term \"orphan block\", i.e. a block which does not have a parent, and not a stale block as most people (incorrectly) use the term orphan block to refer to) are valid blocks but with an unknown parent. In these cases the node in question sees the completely valid orphan block first, and then sees the parent block(s) later (although this should not happen anymore since we swapped to headers first syncing). And then there are also stales blocks. I could see a block at height 800,000 and accept it, then see a second block at height 800,000 and reject it, but the second block ends up becoming the accepted block when it is mined upon. And of course during the IBD blocks aren't actually downloaded in order.Blocks are chained together by each block's header containing the previous block's block hash. That's all. It doesn't matter what the timestamp is, or what order the blocks were seen or downloaded by your node, or how fast the blocks were transmitted through the network, or anything else. Just a chain of hashes all the way back to the genesis block.",

Therefore, the would also have known the timestamp of 811,272, and they would also have known that their timestamp was 2 minutes earlier. But as I've explained above, it literally doesn't matter, and so they are not going to invalidate their block header and lose the block reward by changing the timestamp and trying to mine a new block header from scratch.It's maybe worth pointing out that the next block, 811,274, also has a timestamp 1 minute earlier than 811,272. So it's actually more likely that 811,272 was mined with a timestamp in the future, rather than 811,273 and 811,274 were both mined with a timestamp in the past.
