So I want to make clarification if a Jnr member can post with pictures or I must still get the copper membership account before I can post with pictures,because picture speaks better than writing.   Maybe I need to become a member with 10 merits first before I can post with pictures ? DO NOT POST SESC LINKS",

People with limited, low bandwidth for their Internet access might get trouble.If images are big, you should resize them before uploading and posting on Bitcointalk. Because if you don't resize first, you can still use width or height option for your image but the image size is the same for loading.",

You are now a Junior member, being so, your account is then capable of posting images. You do not need to gain 10 more merits.You can upload images and get their bb codes from different platforms such as imgur and imgbb. From FAQ:QuoteWhy can't I post images?Because you need to be a Junior Member to do that. To become a Junior Member you will have to have posted in three activity periods and have at least 28 activity. However, you can bypass these restriction by buying a Copper Membership for a small fee here.",
