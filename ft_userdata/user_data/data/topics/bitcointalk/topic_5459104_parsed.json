A popular sat. A cheeky buggar sat, eh? I want to know what is the best website to trade ordinals NFTs as well as to get informed on what are the trending Ordinals right now on the market, up and coming airdrops that you may all know of. I would like to know what is the best wallet to use for this as well? Might as well play around with it. Who knows could end up getting some really good ones that increase in value for a short time enough to cash out and get your chips up, savvy? Cheers,TREAD",

Appreciate the heeded warning Franky. I mean I guess a lot of economies could really be considered fake, couldn't they? The Fed creates dollars out of thin air and although they are considered real they're really just fake money based on credit from the US Gov't haha. Yeah, I guess you could call it the wild wild west of Bitcoin \"scam\" NFTs right now, all of these BRC-20 sites are competing for dominance and creators are rushing to pedal their latest scam sats lol. I mean don't get me wrong there is no real value that ordinals bring other than bringing more users to the table to adopt crypto but even then these same NFTs don't have even a fraction of the hype that other ETH based NFTs brought investers/consumers in the early stages. Thanks for the warning Frank! I am still doing my research here, I wouldn't mind earning a few chips though off of speculation in the short term if I can",
