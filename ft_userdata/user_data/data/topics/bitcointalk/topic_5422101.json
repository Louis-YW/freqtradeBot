Waiting for your offers.Also looking for a sponsor for my literature project. I'd like to write and publish two fiction trilogies, one of which is nearly done, it has a name Underground Project and tells of a young adventurer Silvestr, that looks for the truth in the deep net of caves and tunnels, resembling Dragon Age and Witcher in general, and second, about a team of space adventurers in a world of political tricks, wars and disputes, just like Star Wars, Mass Effect or Space Rangers, has a very detailed lore currentl. Some details can be found in my github repos (github.com/atronax). It is quite good and original story, that needs some financial help to push the work on it off the ground.",
