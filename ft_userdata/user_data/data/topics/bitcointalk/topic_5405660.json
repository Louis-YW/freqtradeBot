You're right that everyone should be prepared because we don't know how long this economic downturn will stay.But as long as you know that you're in the right assets and investments, you're going to be safe from this crisis and your assets are going to make you feel comfortable despite all of these economic worsening.",

Its the retiree that is quite a pity when all they were planing was to retire with dollars in mind but its the dollars that is about to retire. Currently the US still can take advantage of printing a lot of USD since its the reserve. But its the inflation that is worrysome for the citizens. I have seen those doomsday youtube channels. Somehow it can only happen when there will be a time that discontentment will encourage revolt like what is going on in European countries these days. So its starting already like Boris Johnson forced to resign before the people goes on the street. Discontentment will arise when the people in European countries will not be able to buy food due to high prices and supply chain issue is also collapsing. Its not just going to be bread or powered milk that will not reach to the groceries but even the basics like sugar, coffee, toothpastes and the likes.",

That means CBDCs and anything else that is centralized which includes majority of altcoins are going to have the same fate as fiat not to mention that CBDCs are the same exact thing as fiat.As the centralized economy collapses, it takes everything centralized down with it.",

At least in the short and medium term. Fiat currencies will not collapse suddenly as it may seem to you, and if this happens, the cryptocurrency system will not be able to compensate for many reasons, the most important of which is that the size of the cryptocurrency market is very small compared to the global market for currencies that contain the most common currencies such as the euro and the dollar, which its gigantic weight may not in itself offset the collapse like the one you describe .",

I don't know if what I'm trying to say is what you meant from the analysis Fiat currency don't have to do anything with cryptocurrency falling and the cryptocurrency increasing . Because when Fiat currency for he the only concern decentralized currency not the digital currency and it is based on the economic effect of the country because different countries have different Fiat currency which can be caused through inflation",

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that is decentralized should be left in the dark for they are a threat to that control which they are aiming for. A good goal for speed of transactions and avoid passing any sickness due to physical cash and coins. But let's not kid ourselves, everything they will do is for their selfish objective. I am not against the government but I am against the traditional way they manage a country. It's being passed like a legacy.",

Till today I have not figured out the real cause for countries to ban cryptos. https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/the-cost-to-mine-different-cryptocurrencies-in-every-country Countries have interior motives for the banning but they would something to cover up their real reasons. As for me beacause the governments are corrupt and they have stolen enough money from the country's treasury, so if cypto is accepted as the legal tender, it would affact them. but that not the base, they can convert it. You are trying to point out the cashless society. The cbdc is a very good plan mostly in British but what causes the delay of implementation is unknown to the ordinary masses. But if the cbdc is implemented full, the fiat bank will be affacted, so the directors of these bank have to influence the government not to implement it. And this happen almost all the countries in the world.",
