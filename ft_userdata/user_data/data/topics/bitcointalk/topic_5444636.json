I’m hearing that it has been a crazy year and almost all of the brackets are already disqualified. Knowing that I’m guessing I would already be out of the running anyways.

They both came to SIU and absolutely killed it. Painter was an assistant under Bruce till he left for IL, his one year as my schools coach he was MVC coach of the year, and had us ranked #15 in the nation, which is huge of course for a mid major. Wheelz you prob remember those Saluki teams, we were stacked back then and the MVC had creighton (& Kyle korver) and Wichita state, so was a really good conference . When he left it all fell apart. The guy can coach and recruit, he’s 413-197 career at Purdue, last two seasons being his best w 29 wins. He’s likely not going anywhere anytime soon IMO…but yeah today was his worst loss ever that’s for sure.",

I remember reading an article in our school newspaper discussing it and being pissed off lol. We almost played IL in the tourney but they lost and we advanced..IL was my team growing up , so of course wanted to see them play each other. Anyways I hear ya, his tournament losses have been a big black eye. Just feel like being an alumni player, coming off two big seasons and the fact that Gene Keady was there for an eternity, they may give him some more time.Regardless..my brackets are bust , that was prob my quickest exit ever lol.",
