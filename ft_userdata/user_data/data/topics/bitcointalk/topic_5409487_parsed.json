I don't know about the new exchange platform because for me very worried so it's better to choose a secure exchange platform with good reputation then it will be much better in my opinion than the new exchange platform.I see that bitcoin trading competitions are very rare except for altcoins where they have just listed on the exchange, so there are always trading contests there with quite varied prizes, take a look at kucoin about the TOKO coin trading competition there, https://www.kucoin.com/id/news/id-id-en-bep20-toko-launch-48000usdt-in-toko-are-up-for-grabsDo you think the reward is worth what you are looking for?",

I doubt this is going to be a \"good investment\". You have to face a lot of competitors and you have to trade a lot to be on the top. Most likely you will be losing money while trading and on fees.",

I did not understand anything clearly after reading your paragraph You are also not clear whether you mean about a new website or not. But basically you want to say about which trading site you think is a bit clear. I think he was being very clear, some exchanges from time to time decide to host trading competitions in which they decide to give a prize to the traders which can follow a set criteria, the criteria can be volume, profits, most profitable trades or whatever they decide, and the ones at the top of the leaderboard receive the prize.In a way they are similar to gambling competitions we see at casinos all the time, however with the huge number of traders that some exchanges have winning any prize is very difficult,",

      "body": "Amazing input guys, thank you all!  A friend of mine shared with me one exchange, that is having this type of campaigns. PLEASE tell me, what do you think? My friend he has participated multiple times in the last one year.  He has received his rewards on time as described in the T&C.The exchange is based in Switzerland and is listed on Nasdaq, which looks very credible to me! In the current campaign the main details are:- The Tiers are fixed and it depends only how much volume we will generate. No competition, nor gambling element, which is great!!! - The minimum trading volume to participate is $2000. - The highest bonus is $3500 paid out in Bitcoin, not in a sh*t coin. We intend to participate and trade together. From The way he has used so far is the following: - We need to have appr the same crypto value on both of our accounts.- We see that there is a decent slippage in the VALOR/USDT and VALOR/BTC Pairs, which in this particular case is beneficial. - One of us both buys their native VALOR Token- The other one transfers either BTC or USDT to his account. - We look at the order book and aim at the slippage area (if the highest Buy price is $0,3 and the lowest Sell price is $0,38, we will trade at $0,34 USDT per VALOR)- So we are swapping the same tokens many times. One opens a sell order and the other one buys it.The trading fee is 0,29%, but we will pay with valor tokens to reduce it to 0,195%. And here is the maths: - If we aim for the top, we will generate $1M in volume. We will pay around $1950 in fees and each will get $3500. Meaning that I can make $1550 net in Bitcoin, the same goes for my friend. Since there is no competition element, I will share it here  https://crypto.smartvalor.com/PS: don't forget to DYOR",
