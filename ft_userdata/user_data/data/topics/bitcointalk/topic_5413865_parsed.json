Thank you!I was wondering if you checked them on coinmarketcap?Â  If you bought them on coinbase then you want sell them and move them all back to coinbase so they can be sold there.I just checked your token, if it is correct this is the token you are referring to then you can sell it on DEX exchanges.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-luna-token/This is my first time seeing this token, how can you get it before. coinbase barely listed it on their exchange.",

Why it is bad? Because what you bought is not real Terra Classic. Similarly, it is terrible if you don't buy BTC (Bitcoin) but buy Wrapped BTC.Second for your question, you can find answer by searching on Coinmarketcap.com.Below is link to available exchanges for WLUNA.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-luna-token/markets/",

Based on data on Coinmarketcap, you can sell $WLUNA on several DEXs, including Uniswap, CronaSwap, CRODEX, Sushiswap and ShibaSwap. But after looking at the volume data of these various DEXs, I would suggest you sell them on Uniswap (V3), they have almost 100% $WLUNC trades there, which means you can easily sell your $WLUNC there.",

You are talking about WLUNA, not a LUNA, the currency that has collapsed and that all channels talked about.If you sell it now, you will sell it at a very low price, so if the quantity does not make a difference to you, try to replace it with a LUNA, as it is supposed to do it easily to de-wrapped it from the place you bought from it, but are you sure that you bought it from Coinbase?Quote from: jmginer on November 30, 2022, 07:59:59 AMCan you please tell me if it is available in Uniswap? because it does not appear for me.Nope, check it here ---> https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/saitaswap/ or https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/cronaswap/",

Because during bear market, there's many coins will become dead coins.",

When you try to withdraw, which chains do you see?If it's ERC20, then you are out of luckIf it's BSC then there might be some hope, but liquidity is so low",
