  "content": "After seeing Mr.Magkaisa's post, I decided to teach my friends a little about Bitcoin. I know them through university, they are 25, 27 and 35 years old respectively. A few months ago, we talked about our work, and I told them that I am a member of a Bitcoin community.They had no understanding of Bitcoin. After seeing Magkaisa's post a few days ago, I decided to call them and invite them to my home. First, I showed them a video on YouTube and then wrote everything on the board. They wrote down all the tips, and next week I will teach them how to buy bitcoin through an exchange. Maybe Binance or Coinbase. After the meeting, I had a good feeling. Teaching others is a fantastic feeling. If they invite their friends to this class, I can teach more people about Bitcoin, and maybe I'll invite them to this forum.For now, I will teach them about buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin, and I'll use YouTube for video tutorials. Also, maybe I'll buy a book about Bitcoin (if I can find it); if not, I'll have to download a book and print it out.Do you know a good book? Please let me know. (For elementary level)PS: If you have friends who don't know anything about Bitcoin, start teaching them. Believe me, you will be happy after each meeting",

Maybe Binance or Coinbase. I am strongly objecting here, you are teaching them or starting them on a very wrong note. You shouldn't be proud to take them to exchanges when you have not taught them how to own bitcoin and have their personal seed phrase or key. Teaching them the real liberty about Bitcoin and they can learn about exchanges as they grow in the industry. Their bitcoin can be freezed or compromised on exchanges. Since you are their first teacher, please teach them the real bitcoin values because it is difficult to unlearn wrong things when they first sink in the medulla. Congratulations for your great move.",

So how about I suggest you postpone the teaching class until you fully understand Bitcoin, how it works, the risks involved and the best way to avoid such risk. Because in as much as Bitcoin is a good investment, don't forget that it is also volatile, of which the price value goes up and down every single seconds. So please never you be the teacher who teaches only the advantage of Bitcoin, but whenever you teach, always try to make people understand both sides, so that when the time comes, they will be able to make the right decision. So once again. I wish you goodluck",

I'm not going to force them to know the technically, but I have to tell them about the basics of bitcoin so they don't get lost even if they're not interested in learning it any further. The orientation of most of them is just income or profit from bitcoin, but that's not my problem.",

You are being that teacher and that is very applaudable, a good thing also is that teaching helps you know better, so in doing this OP, you are also doing yourself some good.",
