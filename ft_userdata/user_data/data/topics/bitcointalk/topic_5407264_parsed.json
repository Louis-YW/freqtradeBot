Are there people who think like this or people who dislike people staring at them because they are too attractive/beautiful for them. It's annoying sometimes to see people focus on your appearance while you speak to them... You notice they become too shy and sometimes with lustful look on their faces.

But I'm referring to the beauty side of attraction. Do we have beautiful/handsome people who want to look unattractive so that no one is too shy or lustful not to concentrate on what is being said or taught by them?

Face covering, etc Instead of covering  there face or using  a mask I think they should just involve in more conversations with people I think with that  they can actually reduce been shy so meeting new people  either in school  or any form of agencies you know this days   People prefer to relate with there phone rather than having a normal conversation with people.",

Same here(in regards to the bolded) ... I mostly do that if have nothing important to tell people, or if I need a quiet time alone like people need quiet place to walk alone and think... or like walking on forest path alone to think.To hide your identity and achieve the desired result you will probably need to avoid using things that will end up attracting attention to yourself, maybe by dressing and looking like people around you. People tend to focus their attentions on things or people who look oddQuote from: Nicholas Schaefer on July 28, 2022, 05:22:16 AMI don’t know.
