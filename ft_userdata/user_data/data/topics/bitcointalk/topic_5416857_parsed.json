There is also a post where you quote a saying from your country and you use quotation marks. Quote from: Ihugbogo on October 07, 2022, 11:35:38 PMMy people always says \"Nah who get food to chop they save\"... All that shows that you know about these things. If the copy-pasted parts were in quote tags, italicized, or in quotation marks, like in the example above, people could say you made some effort to make it easier to distinguish your words from the parts that were taken from somewhere else. This could be a case of someone forgetting to put the source link or someone intentionally leaving it out for whatever reason. You will have to convince the admins that it's the latter.",
