Can high economic growth stave off negative circumstances of high inflation and global financial contagion? How do people see this playing out over the long term?The trade war between US Donald Trump and China' Xi Jinping, China's strict lock-down because of Covid-19, investment in infrastructures and good leadership contributed to the economic growth of Vietnam. Donald Trump pushed a policy that mandated majority of top US companies in China to come back home. Some companies had to move back to the US but others that find it difficult to come back moved to other Asian countries mostly Vietnam. This country almost have the same characteristic with China such as competitive wages, so they are economically attractive. China took its lock-down policy to far that most companies were struggling to survive, thereby making them to move to closer countries. I know politicians cannot be trusted but the government led by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh have really been developmentally oriented. They have invested so much on critical infrastructures that have attracted more investors to Vietnam. In a time when other nations are going through recessions and other economic problems, dedication and prudence have made this nation to become a pacesetter to others. Congratulations to Vietnam.",

Vietnam has been pretty impressive with the their export. They export a lot of telephones, mobile phones, and parts. This makes up 21% of their total export. Textile makes up 12%. They also have a very good trade relationship with the U.S. and China which happen to be major markets for these products. In 2020 they were the only country in their region (South-East Asia) to make a double-digit percentage in E-commerce. It increased by 18%.They're also the world's second highest exporters of coffee, second to Brazil.

It's indeed consistently increasing. In short, the country is indeed getting rich. Infrastructures are improving so much. In terms of agriculture, technologies are also getting a lot better. Vietnam is now exporting agricultural products. But on top of this, they are actually exporting electronics and electrical equipment, mobile phones and telephones as well.  But I'm not talking about the living conditions of the people. It's one thing for a country to have nice GDP figures; it's another to have a high standard of living. China also has a dragon economy. But how's the millions of Chinese at the bottom? They're living in dire poverty.",

In the era of industrial iteration, Vietnam has indeed become a big production country. The extensive management method has made this country with a population of nearly 100 million people on the top of the world again. Of course, the development of other technology industries is relatively rapid. It is worth looking forward to one day being able to start a business in Vietnam.",

Those starting from a lower base will find less friction as there is a lot of \"slack\" in the system. Over the last few years, even more so with the Covid situation, China has shown that it has lost it's edge as a powerhouse for all sorts of different reasons. Many people are actually scared off by the political direction that China has taken and the instability that has brought, with the government changing the rules (for the worse) all the time and having random crackdowns. The other major thing is wages, the Chinese are starting to demand ever higher pay which was the major reason that they were super competitive in the past and younger generations don't want to work in the more menial jobs that made their country richer in the past.",
