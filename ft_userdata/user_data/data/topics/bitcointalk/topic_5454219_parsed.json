An address is a public key hash. An address is used to receive bitcoins. If you want to receive bitcoins, download and install wallet software, use it to create an address, and then have the bitcoins sent to that address.",

Timestamp Server : The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at thetime, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp inits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.chapter 4 Proof-of-Work : The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, thehash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the numberof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. chapter 5 Network : 1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in thechain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.----------------------------------- What i have from all these ?!As mentioned above ----->>> Signatures x509 certificates - Tokens - time stamp - hash file - private keys wiki  x509 certificates - For information i have version 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509How look like private key i have ?!As mentioned above ---> 64 size A-F - 0-9and here the wiki private key look like E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key",
