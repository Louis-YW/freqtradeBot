It's more secure to simply back up the wallet file and transfer it to your new computer though. This is because your seed phrase contains everything needed to bypass Electrum's 2FA and spend the coins, so if it was stolen by some malware on your computer or seen by someone while you are accessing it then an attacker could use it to spend your coins. Your wallet file, on the other hand, only contains one of the necessary private keys, and if it is stolen then an attacker would still need to be able to provide the correct 2FA code to spend your coins.Using the wallet file rather than the seed phrase also means you don't have to go through the process of setting the 2FA up again on your new computer.",

But as o_e_l_e_o has perfectly answered your question, you can import the backup seed phrase and disable the 2FA in a way it will be become 2-of-2 multisig wallet.",

When you create a wallet, the wallet contains one private key, and TrustedCoin store another. Whenever you want to sign a transaction, you sign it using the private key in your wallet and the private key that TrustedCoin hold for you. If you recover from your seed phrase and disable 2FA, the wallet is still 2-of-3, but your wallet will now contain two private key (both derived from the same seed phrase), allowing you to spend your coins without interacting with TrustedCoin at all.Once a multi-sig address has been created, it is not possible to change the type of multi-sig it is since that would mean changing the locking script, in the same way we can't turn a legacy address in to a segwit one, even if they both use the same private key.",

You need to move/copy the wallet file to the right folder under appdata\\roaming\\electrum\\wallets or it should be here belowCode:C:\\Users\\(YourUserNAme)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Electrum\\wallets",
