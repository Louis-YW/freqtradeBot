      "body": "Good to see Dota2 tournament again, and as expected Team Liquid is still the favorite team to win the championship. Well, few more hours and they will commence The Lima Major 2023. Interesting to see other teams to qualify for this.I think this will be a battle between European team and China.  Will start looking for a better odds for this one and will surely not miss to watch the game as well.",

Perhaps the issue of Knights in the last DPC CN 2023 Tour 1: Division I is true.",

      "body": "Nice update OP, It’s been a long time since I didn’t watch Dota2 tournament after the last TI. Also I’m surprised how Kuyanic page evolve on producing a quality materials for presentation of the leaderboard. Team Liquid is expected to dominate this tournament since they won the WEU qualifiers without any loss while most of the power house team is already there. What really surprised me is the good performance of Talon E-sports. I wonder if they can keep this up on the next few days of group stage.",

On the other hand, I didn’t see Thundra to be behind the current standing… I think one why they are behind is that Wraith Pack was nerfed (which Thundra heavily countered from the last TI)? Anyways, I want to see some revelations of OP items and/or heroes.",

Meanwhile, I am betting on Gaimin Gladiators, Entity, and Team Liquid. These teams will have better chances of proceeding into the upper bracket semifinals.Today will be full of great games as each team will give it all since dropping into the lower bracket is not a guarantee of a comeback. Definitely not an easy road when PSG.LGD, beastcoast, and Tundra are the ones waiting in the lower bracket.",
