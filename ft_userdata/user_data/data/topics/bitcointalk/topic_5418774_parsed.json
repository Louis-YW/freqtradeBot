  "content": "Bear with me please. I dont post much but I am a lurker who comes by from time to time. I have noticed that this is a place in the forum where people get the help they need.I have 3 questions for you.1. I have some bitcoin which I am planning to sell soon. I prefer real meetups and peer to peer deals. For that I need a good mobile wallet that I can send my coins to that I am about to sell. I have heard only good comments about Electrum but the Desktop version. The Mobile app lacks in the features department. What is a good Android phone wallet I can use for bitcoin? Trusted, non custodial, supports PIN or passwords to unlock, and no bugs.2. My second question is not about bitcoin. For some reason people like tether where I live. It can be difficult to find a bitcoin trader. They prefer you convert your coins to tether and send them that instead of bitcoin. My guess is they fear volatility? I dont like it but I have to adapt. Can someone also suggest a good mobile and Android wallet that works with Tether and Tron? Same options like with the bitcoin one please.3. The only DEX I have read about is BISQ. I know nothing about it except that some consider it too difficult and overcomplex to use. Is there something else where I could convert my bitcoin to tether if I need tether? Only good DEXs please. I have had accounts being locked for months on popular exchanges and I dont want that again. Even if I want to trade live with people maybe it is not a bad idea to be able to withdraw USD or EUR from a DEX if possible to my own bank account. Do they work like that?That is all I have for you. I am hopeful people here are experienced enough to help.",

Do they work like that?Bisq will certainly let you trade your bitcoin directly for USD or EUR, provided you can find someone to trade with. There is no denying that Bisq is somewhat more complex to use than a standard DEX, but it is also the more secure and private. There are some pretty in depth guides on how to use it available on their Wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Main_PageOther good DEXs which support fiat trades are AgoraDesk or RoboSats.",

Trusted, non custodial, supports PIN or passwords to unlock, and no bugs.The best Android wallet for that which I have used is still Electrum. The desktop Electrum is far better than mobile Electrum, but I see no issue while spending on mobile Electrum at times except when using coin control. Yet I can be able to use address freeze on mobile Electrum, but just not flexible and useful up to using coin control. My advice for this is Electrum, use it. The second wallet I have used in the past, but which I do not use again for now that I can recommend is Bluewallet. Mycelium is also good, but mycelium users do have the issue of bugs in a way your wallet will not display the actual balance, but deleting the wallet and import the seed phrase on newly downloaded mycelium wallet would be of help. I do not know about Schildbach, but I strongly believe in what o_e_l_e_o recommend.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on October 29, 2022, 09:59:14 PMAs far as I know two features are missing in the mobile version of electrum. One is coin control and the other one is signing/verifying messages.There are many other features on desktop Electrum that is not on mobile Electrum. You can no more generate legacy address on mobile Electrum and the absence of console on mobile Electrum make many things not to be done on mobile Electrum. Even as mobile Electrum can create multisig, he can only generate 5-of-5 multisig at maximum, it can not go up to 15-of-15. In addiction to signing a message, you can not also encrypt a message on mobile Electrum. I like how the fee is now estimated on mobile Electrum with lowest fee to be 1 sat/vbyte if the mempool is not congested, but fee customisation (I mean editing the fee and manually write the sat/vbyte in any number of your choice) is not yet possible on mobile Electrum, but I do not think this last one is necessary.",

Given this, Electrum would be fine, as he can simply load up Electrum in advance with whatever he has agreed to sell. No coin control necessary.And yeah, although a completely customizable fee setting on mobile Electrum would be better, the 1/2/5/10 sats/vbyte setting on the static slider is usually acceptable.",

One is coin control and the other one is signing/verifying messages. My guess is that OP won't need those two. His coins are stored elsewhere, and if he is planning to only use the mobile wallet for his P2P trades, he will make one transaction and send those coins to the mobile wallet. There is now one UTXO there and hence no need for coin control. The only exception is if he agreed to make two or more deals with multiple people at the same day or around the same time. Electrum could potentially connect his UTXOs since there is no manual coin control option available.

If you think about it, it's sort of the same thing if your Electrum app doesn't have many UTXOs. If you have 2, just freeze one, and Electrum will spend from the other. If you have 4, freeze the 3 you don't want to spend from and the one that is left will be used in your new transaction.",

The change from his first trade becomes his output for his second trade. If he does care about privacy then create entirely separate wallets, one for each trade, as then there would be no risk of outputs accidentally being used together and no risk of any change from the first trade accidentally being included in the second trade.Still, this involves carrying more bitcoin than necessary to each trade, which brings additional risk.",

With this method, UnitedNot could prepare multiple transactions and speed up the trade. Has there been any known issues with coinb.in or similar broadcast pushers where it wasn't possible to broadcast the transaction due to some bugs or the coins ended up on a different address? Only cases where the user didn't make mistakes during the transaction creation and signing process, of course. No one seems to be addressing the question about USDT. I have some in a hardware wallet, so I can't really comment on other options.@UnitedNot Maybe you are going to be forced to drop your idea about using an open-source wallet for TRX and USDT and be satisfied with a multi-currency wallet that is closed-source. The one I know that belongs to the open-source category is Unstoppable Wallet. Unfortunately, their website doesn't have a list of supported assets (which should be available), so I can't tell if the tokens you need are supported.",

There is no benefit to security, since a $5 wrench attack can still force you to broadcast the transaction just as easily as it can empty your wallet of coins. However, you lose the ability to tweak the amount you are sending based on the current exchange rate or edit the fee based on the current mempool.Quote from: Pmalek on October 30, 2022, 11:34:21 AMNo one seems to be addressing the question about USDT.Both Tether and Tron are centralized scam coins, and if a trading partner insisted I used either of them I would politely decline and find a new trading partner.",

However, you lose the ability to tweak the amount you are sending based on the current exchange rate or edit the fee based on the current mempool. I agree with you. But, I didn't have an upgrade in security in mind when I said that. OP claims some people close to him prefer taking USDT instead of bitcoin. He mentioned volatility as one possible reason for that. Perhaps it is. Yes, it's possible to change the agreed amount just before the deal is competed, but maybe they fear that Bitcoin can lose a few percentages, so in the short-term, they got a bit less BTC then what they paid in cash for. Bitcoin going up or down by 4-5% is possible in a short amount of time. The same thing can happen with stablecoins or worse (I am looking at you Terra), but they obviously don't take that seriously. Not to mention the centralized aspect of the token and the fact it can be frozen anywhere.",
