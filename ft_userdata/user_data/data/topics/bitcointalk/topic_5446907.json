  "content": "The market is gradually turning green as the price of bitcoin is rising. I noticed that I've been added to a few Telegram groups that are offering trading signals, but I think we should all be careful to avoid falling for any of these scams. Now that the market is turning green, even newcomers to cryptocurrency will start providing trading signals even when majority of them don't even understand cryptocurrency. Some will even demand for payment before you are even added to their group. I know that many newcomers to cryptocurrency in Nigeria don’t have knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general they are merely after money and thats why they always end up searching for trading signals. We should all avoid individuals who provide trading signals because, from what I've seen, they frequently use that strategy to scam people. If you want to trade, make sure you learn how to conduct analysis and perfect your trading strategy.",

At one time, I was also interested in books on trading. And my very first book, which laid the foundation for all my crypto trading, is of course a book on Japanese candlesticks. Then I came across a video version of this book, which showed the most significant Japanese candlestick patterns. Based on this information, I began to build my trading strategy. Now I only use graphical analysis.Here, in addition to general information on trading, there are also training materials on technical analysis, day trading, arbitrage, Elliott waves, algo trading, Fibonacci levels, Bollinger Band, etc. In general, there is something to start with developing your understanding of the market. All links lead to Amazon, no referral links.

      "body": "As a trader or individual you don't need any signal to start your trading journey rather if you want to start trading on bitcoin you should learn to study the bitcoin market and it's past histories for you to be able to trade bitcoin to know whenever bitcoin price seems not to be pleasant to you again as a trader then you could make an adjustment to understand where to sets your targets.Bull is very bad for someone to join trading signals, I was once on a trading group but whenever I noticed they aren't giving the right information I keep bleeding asking myself what I m still doing on that group. But today I have learned very much better to understand the market than before. Lastly we must learn to have patients if you must to trade and learn all principles in trading.",

      "body": "Patients is what really matters in life especially in trading, you don't just jump into trading when you don't understand the market and have no knowledge of bitcoin past histories. Learning the market and having your own trading strategy will be the best for you to excel in trading.Take note my trading strategy might be different from yours and if you try to use my own trading strategy, you might run at lost. As for trading tips from telegram is a big scam because I don't think they even understand the market properly but they will come up with stories about trading just to scam you on your hard earned money. So be wise and don't believe most things people tell your about crypto trading because you don't know if it is for real. Learn on your own and understand what you are going into how it works for you not to run at lost.",

      "body": "The worst thing to do is agree to what those chart makers tell you on telegram; it's all a scam. I don't know how they managed to scam a friend out of $500. First, he agreed to pay $100 as a trading fee; afterwards, he was referred to create an account with a fake exchange, which I suspect is the exchange of those scammers; he deposited at the address of that exchange and couldn't open the site again after that. People should just be careful when engaging in different crypto trading platforms; scams are in almost every aspect of the crypto space. There are a lot of trading tips on YouTube, and in this forum, a person who is eager to learn about trading can create a thread and ask any questions about their concerns, or ask questions in an existing thread that are related to the same question they have in mind on the  Trading Discussion board",
