My \"GUT FEELING\" tells me that some of these modern mobile wallets have security issues in their design.I prefer the OLD STYLE Desktop wallets that have GITHUB Releases.",

I don't see any critical vulnerability when I use that web wallet.If you really want to be extremely careful and secure, choosing a hardware wallet is a surely convenient option.",

I have not stored key anywhere and nor connected wallet with any third party service but my wallet hacked three times and fund was stolen. Same type of problem happen with some other friend and they lost their fund. You can use Solar wallet and hope it will be secured and stay away from Lobstr wallet.",

The most reputable and popular hardware wallet I know are ledger and trezor. To prevent from malicious attack, you should buy the wallet from official stores. Relying on third party/reseller is really risky.",
