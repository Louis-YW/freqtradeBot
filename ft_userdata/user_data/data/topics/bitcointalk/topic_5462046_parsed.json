  "content": "I've been inactive for quite a while because I'm in the process of renting a house. I don't know how easy it is in other countries, but here, it's an extremely time-consuming and nerve-racking process. I spent more than a week in the streets without any success.I know for a fact that many tourist-oriented cities across Europe are facing similar issues due to the increasing supply of Airbnbs and the increase in digital nomads over the years. This is rendering the situation uninhabitable for local residents, who have to face the constantly increasing rents because homeowners prefer to rent to tourists and digital nomads, who have a much higher spending capability. On the one hand, from homeowners' points of view, it's understandable; they want to make the most out of their property, but on the other hand, locals will ultimately be forced to leave the city or live in poor conditions.For instance, a typical example of how much remote working has spread in Europe and Greece specifically is the following: The official digital nomads Facebook group used to have less than 5,000 users approximately a year ago; now it has over 34,000, which doesn't necessarily mean that all these people live in Greece and work remotely, but I'm trying to emphasize how broader the issue is for locals because there's an increasing interest in short-term rentals. I remember a few years ago, the local newspaper was filled with housing listings, but after the introduction of Airbnb and short-term rentals, this has changed. Not only is there a lack of housing due to the increasing demand and the constantly decreasing supply, but those that are available are too expensive and, in some cases, unsuitable to live in due to how small and improvised they are. My previous apartment was in the basement and suffered from serious humidity and mold issues.The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in my area is about €400, which is still far from being perfect or ideal, often lacking basic utilities such as proper heating or a solar water heater, which is a must for the 300 days a year of sunshine we have. I know that compared to other European cities, this amount of money sounds insignificant, but when the average salary is approximately €700, you can wish yourself good luck living alone. No wonder almost half of the population aged between 18 and 25 still lives with their parents.In my opinion, it's doubtful that this situation is going to improve anytime soon. Touristic cities are bound to suffer from a lack of available housing for long-term rental, and Airbnb can no longer be regulated in order to create a balance between locals and tourists. What do you think can be done in such cases, and what would you do on a personal level? Move out, stick to paying an extreme amount for housing, or live in a substandard apartment hoping to find something better in the future?",

It's simple, it's a matter of more demands than availability, this is where the government should take action by encouraging investors in that sector, and by providing access to more facilities that will not only encourage the government to provide housing units but also encourage mortgages and real estate buoyancy in the country.",

You need agents or Airbnb depeion what you are looking for.Housing is such an expensive aspect of life in this time around and you know many investors have gone into such business and that is why you see the short term rentals making much money, it is about the business and profit for them. Across the globe, short term rentals make more money than the long term accommodation and in some area what you see is just the short term rentals. This is where the government has to come in. They need to build more houses. In the past in Nigeria, it was the practice that different state government built houses for the civil servants and others housing estates that where put on rent, mortgage or lease. Some houses were built by government for outright sales but I think this time around, the government isn't focusing on proper housing regulation because then there was Federal Housing Authority (FHA), I don't know how active that authority is now.",

Let me argue from the point of view of tourists or tourists in terms of the availability of places that have been prepared by tour guides, here maybe I will comment on the very expensive price of lodging, traditions like this are commonplace when we visit tourist attractions. Usually there is an alternative to having friends or acquaintances in the rental housing sector so that they can provide affordable options. Once again, when the location of housing or rental houses is strategic, we cannot deny that the price will be more expensive. For this reason, while my family and I are traveling, we always make sure that lodging is included in a tour package so that we don't have to pay twice the cost.",

Thing is different in the city, the rent went up high. I guess people are still going to the office daily in here that's the reason why the city is still overcrowded.

This surely depends on where you live, this might be an individual case in my area. The condition to receiving government assistance is usually against you too, there are some requirements that it's hard to qualify, but that's a lengthy discussion for a different matter. Moving to a non touristic city may be a better solution, but like all options, it has major disadvantages too Quote from: Gozie51 on August 04, 2023, 12:24:28 PMRegards to your stress in trying to look for a house for rent, you can't do it alone.

The majority of them don't do anything more than create a listing on the internet and forget about it. You have to chase them in order to assist you and show you the properties, when it should be the exact opposite. Agents should listen to your needs and assist you to find the optimal property to rent. It used to be that way, but the recent demand in housing lead to a massive increase of so-called agents that lack the skills and the professionalism to be of any help.",

There are two cases either the property is very costly or the property is not available at all. This is what happening everywhere and it will even become worst as we move forward. Students are increasing in number, many properties are also rented by them in groups so they are not available for the families. In many cases people like to stay in the community based circle but when it’s students around it’s chaos so they usually has to compromise such areas. There are actually many filtering criteria that needs to be understood before one can rent to be honest. I feel you in this case.",

We are also facing the same issues in my country because of rural-urban drift. You have few options because this will not change very soon. You should consider moving to places that are less attractive to tourists. These areas will have available and cheaper houses. I know it will be a problem maybe considering the location of your job. But if you work online, it will be a good option. These areas might not be as comfortable as other good cities but you need more money to compete with tourists. Another option will be to increase your income. If you have more money, you can afford any kind of accommodation you want.

Of course, this raises the issue of distance from the workplace if it is located in the city, but sometimes you cannot have cheap and ideal accommodation near the workplace.When it comes to tourism and climate change, I have read predictions that summer temperatures will be higher and that this will affect everyone involved in tourism, especially in the Mediterranean, where this summer broke all temperature records with extremely strong storms.

More housing than demand lowers the price making it more affordable.Do nothing solution and wait, another thing that will work since the law of economics will start biting also, there is an influx of cash to the homeowners, there are people who spend more, thus prices in that region become higher, once the price becomes higher it becomes less attractive for most digital nomads who do this for cheap housing and start moving to the next city.

He started sourcing the apartment since from last year December and we lived close to a university where students always occupied most of the apartment and especially those students whom there parents are very wealthy doesn't hesitate to secure an apartment because to any amount those house owner places their price student would rent it without any waste of time or even slightly want to negotiate price with house owner, and to any amount they are willing to pay without minding or having to consider those who are living or even those that are to come because they already set a standard for rent in that region and, the worsts part of it is that they always increase their rental in every year without considering the inflation and to compared with the average salary of some worker.Even as that most people always ends up spending their entire savings in housing and how do you think this people could meet up in life because I know too well that they must save and, apparently any worker who doesn't save do not really securing himself or her family a better life as I believe that there is always a challenges to come, although despite people do not pray to face any problems in life but we most act on a predictive aspect of life to always have a backup when the time shall comes.Yes! This could be true or not but is something inevitably that we must face in life, especially when it comes of house renting and properties.To be frank with you, and also I don't know your condition to be single or married but I am on the opinion that you could still remains with your previous apartment and only if you think you can inhabit there then back down and remain over there while you work and save money to secure a better place for yourself. All less you have a family where that place doesn't longer contains you people maybe you feels uncomfortable whenever you finds yourself inside same apartment, yes this could likely be true but you don't need to over stress your or having to compete with the tourist those who spent money without having to determine whether others are up to such standard. Off course, they don't have to consider because they're not in same shoe with you so they can spend their money however and whenever they feels like spending and it could be in an expensive things, luxury, maybe cars and on whatever they feel is attractive to them without humiliation.But for you not to be intimidated you don't have to live in same locality with them maybe you could find yourself over an area where you feels is more conducive for your standard and way of life, unlike us over here we do our best not to live a stressful life or being on a competition with those whom we think we can't compare our standard of life to theirs.",
