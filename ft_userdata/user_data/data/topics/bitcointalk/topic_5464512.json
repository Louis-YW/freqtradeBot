If you can use that to generate electricity and that is more environmental friendly than burning coal or in some cases Diesel generators.... then that is a positive thing. I think they said that they are not allowed to push that electricity back into the grid for some reason, so they are using it on-site to power their Bitcoin miners.... so they are using an alternative power source to mine.... and that is a positive thing.",

You cannot actually \"dump\" methane gas... it is released as a natural process from these garbage dumps and it goes into the atmosphere. (like your body produce a fart)    ..... so this company found a way to use this and to generate electricity and then use that electricity to mine bitcoins.",

There is logic in using such gas, but those who constantly attack Bitcoin using the environmental vector will not say that this is something positive if we know that they focus on Bitcoin consuming electricity like a smaller country. They don't even care that the losses in the electric network on an annual level in the world are about 50 000 TWh, but they are worried about the absurdly small 200-300 TWh consumed by BTC during the whole year, and at least 50% of that comes from renewable sources.",

I read in an article that the CO2 released by methane gas from combustion is much lighter compared to coal or oil, but when compared to solar or wind energy, the CO2 released by methane gas is quite high, but there are some issues that say that the EU government will work hard to eradicate the use of methane gas.I am not an radical environment activist, but I am happy when I hear that there are bitcoin miners who use energy that is more environmentally friendly than coal or oil and it is only fitting that all bitcoin miners adopt a more environmentally friendly combustion system so FUD regarding bitcoin mining is bad for the environment can be fought with data and reality in the field.",
