The error message you are seeing, \"An unknown web exception occurred while trying to read the JSON response,\" suggests that there might be an issue with the connection to the Bitcoin Core node.There are a few things you can try to troubleshoot this issue:Make sure that your Bitcoin Core node is running and reachable at the address and port specified in the BitcoinLib configuration (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8332). You can verify this by trying to connect to the node using a tool like curl or a web browser.Make sure that you have correctly configured the bitcoin.conf file in your Bitcoin Core data directory. This file should contain the following lines:server=1rpcuser=<username>rpcpassword=<password>Replace <username> and <password> with the values you specified when you started Bitcoin Core.Make sure that the values you are using for the rpcuser and rpcpassword in the BitcoinLib configuration match the values you specified in the bitcoin.conf file.If you are using a firewall, make sure that it is not blocking incoming connections to the Bitcoin Core node on the specified port (e.g. 8332).I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
