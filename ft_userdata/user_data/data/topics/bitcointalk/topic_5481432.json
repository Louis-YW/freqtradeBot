Although bitcoin fee right now is also high but I can send it to the person aboard which would be very fast. If I want to make an foreign online payment, my country is allowed to pay but the bank is declining the transaction. I used bitcoin for the payment. There are times that fiat will fail someone as it is centrally controlled. But I still use fiat for making payments, especially locally which is fast and cheap.. Locally, I see no reason to use bitcoin. Most of my transactions are local transactions. I use fiat for local transactions. Most of my transactions are local transactions. This always still makes me see bitcoin more as an investment. I have bitcoin because I invested in it. But sometimes I use it for payment. But what I noticed is that people use bitcoin to hedge against inflation and also as an investment, than to be used for P2P transaction. But we should still know that if you use bitcoin for investment, that is not affecting its purpose for P2P transactions.",

Source? you can't just make a conclusion from your assumption.There's a difference between P2P currency and currency, if Bitcoin is used to be a P2P currency, it means there's no relation with third party. While as a currency, it doesn't matter whether the person send their coins from CEX or wallet.According to Bisq trading volume, there are still many people make trades, currently it's higher than 2020 (when Bitcoin price is low) and 2021 (the latest Bitcoin's ATH).https://bisq.markets/",

      "body": "\"Bitcoin as P2P currency vs Bitcoin as an asset\" - here the ratio will probably be about 10/90. There is simple confirmation of this. All institutional investors buy bitcoin not for use as a P2P currency, but as a speculative investment instrument. Even those who use it as P2P currency (in most cases) use it as an intermediate wrapper for dollars (or other national currency). I'll explain. People take their dollars, buy bitcoin, send it to others, who eventually convert it back into dollars so that the dollars can be used to buy other goods and services. In fact, at this stage, bitcoin is the same wrapper or shell for traditional money, and not an independent currency. This is one of the bitcoin entities along with an investment asset.",

Well maybe to others as their needs maybe applicable to how they make use of bitcoin, some are still fine in making transactions with it despite the high fees while some don't even mind the cost for that, holding it as an asset is a decision we can take on our own, but remember there's no how you can hodl for that long without still ended on moving to another wallet for exchange.",

All the hurdles faced in fiat currency transactions can be seamlessly transacted with Bitcoin. Currently Bitcoin transactions are not widely used due to government restrictions in various places but if the government approves Bitcoin will be at the forefront of financial transactions including any banking system. However, those who have a good understanding of Bitcoin tend to focus on the holding rather than the transaction. Bitcoin will become a valuable asset in long-term investment allowing an investor to earn multiples of his wealth. I personally value investing in Bitcoin as well.",

Of course no one is happy when transacting with Bitcoin during periods of high conjestions as fees can be sometimes annoying.Your post is quite confusing and not composed well so it can fail to express your opinion.I guess you wanted to say about Bitcoin transaction fee and its impact on small and big users (in capital scale). I agree that Bitcoin transaction fee becomes more expensive since the appearance of Taproot, Ordinals, BRC2 tokens and Inscription exploitation on Bitcoin blockchain. They even abused ViaBTC Free transaction accelerator too.This is true, people with small capital will hesitate to use Bitcoin blockchain for transaction recent months. Oppositely people with big capital will do not mind about it because they can spend $50 or $100 transaction fee easily, without headache.https://howmanyconfs.com/https://blog.lopp.net/how-many-bitcoin-confirmations-is-enough/Two above resources will help you to know Bitcoin blockchain is the best for security and best for big capital movement.Quote1 confirmation: sufficient for small payments less than $1,000.3 confirmations: for payments $1,000 - $10,000. Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000. Six is standard for most transactions to be considered secure.10 confirmations: suggested for large payments greater than $1,000,000.I hope to see something will be improve technically.",

The thing is that they are both right. It's not just that Bitcoin is both a currency and an investment, it's also about the fact that how the market performs affects how people view Bitcoin.Imagine your local fiat currency is appreciating over time (reverse inflation) and stuff are getting cheaper which means you'd be able to buy more stuff with the same amount of money you had before. In that scenario, you'd stop spending money as long as the appreciation continues. Therefore treating your fiat like an \"investment\".In real scenarios this resembles to what happens when governments raise interest rates.That's exactly what's been happening to Bitcoin. When one day you see 10000BTC can purchase 2 pizzas and the next day 1000BTC does the same and 14 years later 0.0008BTC can buy the same 2 pizzas, you'll automatically not-want to spend your coins and will hold on to them so that next year you can buy 2 pizzas with 0.0002BTC!But here is the twist, when price stops rising up so much (mass adoption) then people won't be willing to HODL as much and they'll start spending more.We can even see this behavior in the past decade while we are before mass adoption. Each time price stabilizes more people are spending bitcoin more regularly.",

And even with other crypto assets, because, based on my experience, the transaction is actually fast. The only sad thing here in our country is that Binance is having a bit of a problem here.By chance, we will again be obliged to use our local exchanges here, which have a large spread that is deducted from our transactions. Unlike when we use Binance P2P, it is very fast, there is no fee, and we have many users here in our country in cryptocurrency.",

Of course, a currency or money will have to be an asset as well, but I think the question here is framed in such a way that asset means something that people invest in or speculate. Bitcoin as a speculative asset is only attractive because of what it is, a P2P currency. I mean, even if you're treating Bitcoin purely as a new asset class, that it is being popularly perceived as such is precisely brought about by its very features as a legitimate P2P currency. We, therefore, can never disregard Bitcoin as a P2P currency. I highly disagree with BlackRock's Larry Fink in saying that Bitcoin is not \"ever going to be a currency\" and that it is only an \"asset class\". He is wrong. Bitcoin has become an asset class precisely because it is a unique currency. It is sought after not because of anything else but because of its features as a P2P currency.",

But as time goes by, the use case of it is becoming more an asset or a store of value. IMHO, there's no need to debate on it. Choose Bitcoin what you prefer it to be, as an asset, as a P2P currency.

Maximalists are known to be the biggest accumulators and holders, so why ask this question as we have a lot of maxis here? There was a time when Bitcoin was considered as a P2P currency and that happened before LN was launched. Why was BTCLN even decided? The reason is that the main chain cannot help with adopting Bitcoin. The forum was once flooded with topics comparing Bitcoin with Gold and even the mainstream media started doing it. Why? Because, after 2017 ATH Bitcoin was never considered a P2P currency even countries such as Argentina treat it as an asset class. The country of El Salvador has already implemented BTCLN with its localized wallet to increase the usability of Bitcoin as a legal tender.",
