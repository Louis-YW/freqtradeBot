I may sugested to use Samourai Wallet for that Operation, but it is up to you. In any case there is no way to do that without lose some privacy, you may try to group them inÂ  groups of 3-4 Utxos:The problem is that you will end with some repetitive TXID. That is a problem if you don't get new UTXOS to mix those",

      "body": "The correct way to do this is via the \"mix to external xpub\" feature in either Samourai or Sparrow.Here's a guide on how to do this with Sparrow: https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html#mixing-to-cold-storage. Simply use the xpub of your cold storage wallet to create a watch only version in Sparrow, and then in your Whirlpool wallet select the \"Mix to...\" button and tell it to mix directly to that cold storage wallet. It will add at least 3 more mixes to each output first, and then mix those outputs directly in to your cold storage wallet at a random time after that. You will therefore not pay any fees (since the fees for each coinjoin are paid by the new entrants), and there will be no consolidation or privacy loss. To an outside observer, the transactions moving these coins from Whirlpool to the cold wallet will be indistinguishable from any other Whirlpool coinjoin.",

You can simply enroll one UTXO now and wait for it to land in the new wallet, and then wait as long as you want before starting the process on the next UTXO. You don't have to enroll all your UTXOs in the process at the same time.You can also freeze individual UTXOs in Sparrow which will pause their enrollment in free remixes for as long as you leave them frozen.

But, as I have said here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470024.msg63151565#msg63151565 if the wallet is airgapped, I think you can't generate the accounts. You need to turn your wallet into a hot wallet as long as this process goes.2. Perhaps OP doesn't want to have equal size UTXOs in the end. If so, then I don't know how he can avoid it with Sparrow & Whirlpool. Let's say OP owns 20 UTXOs of variable sizes from 0.001 BTC to 0.1 BTC. OP will need to choose a coinjoin pool. Whatever size of pool he chooses (0.001 BTC, 0.01 BTC or 0.1 BTC) the final UTXOs will be of this specific size. There is a workaround, if OP chooses to use some UTXOs in one pool (say 0.1 BTC), then repeat the process for another pool etc. This will lead to UTXOs with sizes 0.001 BTC, 0.01 BTC or 0.1 BTC. So, if OP wants to maintain the same amounts for each UTXO (obviously minus the transaction fees), I am not sure he can.He can avoid this size restriction with a WabiSabi coinjoin, you can create outputs with arbitrary values.",

Once I have a UTXO which has had 20+ free remixes and I don't intend to spend anytime soon, I gain very little by letting it sit on a hot wallet an accumulate even more free remixes. Using this method I can move this UTXO to a cold storage wallet, increase its security, and also redirect any free remixes to other UTXOs of the same size in that Whirlpool wallet instead.Quote from: albert0bsd on November 27, 2023, 04:03:40 PMIf there is not need to touch that balance, then is better to wait for low fees.The fees do not matter given my suggestion above. Whirlpool remixes are free. Mixing to an external xpub is also free, since it is the new entrants to each round which pay the fee. Mixing to an external wallet is exactly the same as just accumulating more free remixes from this point of view.",

Are there any very small UTXOs?Â I don't know if you can do coin control and see the UTXOs in Trust Wallet. With a good wallet, you should and as youfriend said , use electrum.

I believe OP wants to ameliorate his setup and I don't believe it is a bad idea. But since two members of this forum found this curious, I can't help but ask, why? I mean don't you think it is a good idea to move the coins to a better setup? Of course provided that the multisig vault will be properly set up. Fully airgapped, different devices, proper backups etc.Yes! a properly set up singlesig wallet, where the seed phrase is produced from a permanently airgapped device, where the backups are stored offline in separate locations, where you add a strong passphrase that provides >128 bits of entropy is safe. But, a multisig vault can have some advantages compared to the singlesig wallet:1. In terms of safety, I reckon that both wallets are impossible to get compromised with brute-force. 2. In terms of theft, then the multisig vault is safer because the attacker will find one backup and they have no clue that you have set a multisig vault with another wallet. They will probably think of bruteforcing the passphrase though.3. In terms of physical disaster, multisig and singlesig are equal if you have backed up the signers properly.4. In terms of usage, signing a transaction with a multisig is much easier, because you can create a PSBT with the 1st cosigner and then sign with the rest of them, bringing the PSBT to the rest of the signers. However, with singlesig you need to get the passphrase where the device is, unless you remember it, but this is highly unlikely with a proper random passphrase.5. In terms of fees, provided that we talk about the same amount of inputs and outputs, singlesig is cheaper.Having said all that, I want to make clear that multisig creates a false sense of security. Multisig is in general safer, indeed, but you must know what you do and avoid obvious mistakes. Multisig is not a panacea. Supposing that OP knows all the dangers and follows all the necessary measures, then, according to the list above, I think moving to a multisig is not a bad idea. But if the only motivation is security, OP must know that a proper singlesig wallet with a strong random passphrase is safe enough.",
