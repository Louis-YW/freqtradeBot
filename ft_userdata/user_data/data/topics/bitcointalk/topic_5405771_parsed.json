However, liquidity did not survive well, in a short time, it was deleted by the token owner. They are just to make a trend there. Maybe you can take a look at LIVE NEW PAIRS.

They are just to make a trend there.You can see how long the lock of the liquidity and if the pool is even lock or not. From there you have an idea how long the token deployer plans to trade the token if you found it short then of course thats a clue that the project might rug anytime especially giving a short stint on the pool. This is case to case basis and depend on explanation why the locked is short.",
