  "content": "More than 2 months ago, CEX.io froze all my funds.They asked me for ID verification, which was completed successfully. Then they asked for showing the origin of the funds.I have sent all I could. At the end they said my case is under review by their complience team. And they will let me know if there is an update. Ever since they said that, 2 months has passed and their complience team still has not made any decisions. What kind of decisions can take that long?",

This is why we always keep telling users never to trust centralized exchanges. Only use them momentarily where there is nee and remove your funds off them for long term storage.Try to send a PM to their representative - CEXThis is their Announcement thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=318010",

This is a bad habit of a site to left their players hanging without updating you, your money is with them and they must release it if there’s no reason to hold it.",

Based on their trust feedback page, it seems contacting them can help your case. Some users have deposit/withdrawal problems and it was solved according to them. Depending on what is actually going on with your funds I wouldn't be too hopeful though, but it seems worth doing compared to hiring a lawyer directly which may not help you at all due to different jurisdictions, etc.They are also quite active here, their last seen is just yesterday. So, there is definitely a chance that they will read and respond to your message.",
