I'm only suggesting security measures they can take to secure their own businesses and websites that accept crypto for maybe purchases, gambling, e.t.c can employ to curb hacking into their sites and making heavy withdrawals that affect their portfolio significantly.",

Because my cell phone company had a major inside job attack.The people got into my account viewed the holdings in it and were attempting to pull out the btc in it.They were stopped because my 2fa was not done via the cell phone that was hacked.They still were able to put in six digit codes as a guess which gave them a one in one million shot at guessing the code. I was not able to shut them out for about three hours time then made 2 attempts every hour with random six digit codes, they got to make eight tries so 8/1000000 shot at my coinIf I did not have a really good 2fa with nothing to do with my cellphone that wasmhacked they would have grabbed my coin.",

The other where the customer has some kind of hack / compromise.For the client side there are a few methods that can be taken, but they all have their own issues.I would like to see the option for having a 48 hour hold on withdraws over a certain amount.Step 1 initiate the withdraw. Step 2 at least 24 hours later you have to put in the address where you want the coins sent. (with some 2fa)Step 3 at least 24 hours after that but no more then 48 hours you have to approve it. (with a different 2fa then from step 2)For small amounts it's fine, whatever, but much like taking cash out of an ATM, you have limits and if you want more you have to go into the bank.For the actual hacks on the exchange. It's really simple, all deposits go immediately into a 3 of 5 multisig wallet. Period.The hot wallet for withdraw never has more then X hours on average of withdraws in it. The cold wallets can ONLY fill 1 address for the hot wallet so even if you get 3 of the multisigs it's hard coded to only send the funds to hot wallet address so you would also have to get access to the hot wallet if you got access to the cold.-Dave",

It was created for you to be your own bank, not to rely on 3rd party to manage your wallet and coins. Just use it what it was created for.",

Sometimes, it does not work if mempools suddenly become overloaded or congested but usually their high fee rates are enough to get a confirmation within next one block.Your suggestion is not make sense, about waiting time for an on-chain confirmation. If the suggestion is for exchange approval on user withdrawal request only, not yet to a next step: proceeding a batch transaction for many users,  it does not make sense too.Taking 10 minutes to 20 minutes, just to approve a withdrawal request is terrible as a service.

I just thought of it this way: When a YouTube video plays in a focused tab, once it ends it stays there and waits for you to make another request. When the same happens but the page is not focused, it automatically plays the next video. OK, but nobody uses that for authentication. That will just annoy the user. What if while they are using the site they get a push notification from their email tab, and then they switch tabs to read the email for a few minutes? Or if they are on a mobile device and briefly switch apps?When you also take into account that there are likely captchas and 2FA on the login page, it starts to get cumbersome for people to use the site.",

This will apply even to the primary login device. This is what one of my tradition banking app does in every second. Once I navigate away from the app it would log me out from app that can't change anything from the hacker. If the hacker has hacked into the website then all those your suggestions are nullified because in that process they are fully in charge of the website so they can do anything. The withdrawal limit can only occurred when the company set that feature for his customers and that will not accepted by many users. Cryptocurrency has unlimited withdrawal system so if an exchange company use that feature then it might loss customers. And the best suggestion so far is the one you only deposit coins to the exchange whenever you want to sell and not to keep your coins the exchange. As it is those who are using Binance is shaking because of what happened, and most of them have transferred their coins out to non custodial wallets. But why some people like keep bitcoin in the centralized exchange platforms is because of the transaction fee that is high. But if it is in exchange they don't have to pay for the tx fee and whenever they want to sell coin, they would only hit the sell button and sell it off. Though you make some points but once hackers penetrate to the website or the account, they would control everything until the whole funds are transfered.",
