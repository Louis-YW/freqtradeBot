So in theory, if you indeed trust that EUR will recover and buy now EUR at current ~1:1 ratio, you may get 10% return when EUR recovers to 1.1.. if it ever recovers.Since we're on a bitcoin forum, I'd add that there are good chances one would earn more and in a shorter timespan by buying bitcoin while current \"crypto winter\" lasts. But please don't take as a financial advice, please do as you think with your money.",

Having a strong national currency while having gigantic multi-trillion dollar budget deficit and national debt seems like complete nonsense to me. The EU countries and Japan aren't any better than the USA in terms of budget deficits and debts.China has a low national debt, but the provinces have big debts. It seems that the global economy won't be getting out of the debt trap.I don't think that the US dollar is getting stronger, it's the euro that is getting weaker. This might be temporary.If you want to trade fiat currencies, just do it at your own risk and don't take any financial advise seriously.",

I do hold bitcoin and DCA into it weekly but I have before and will again give it a haircut when it goes and gets rowdy. Rebalancing my humble portfolio keeps me asleep at night and enjoy a gentleman's \"hobby\"I've gone old school lately, what fits in my safe is actually mine. I can put gold, silver and my ledger in the safe. I will probably start with some euro's as liquidity should be easy. Having lived and worked in the silicon valley from . 1997 - 2004 I learned some expensive lessons then and got a refresher recently. Sure my other stuff like my 401k is a different beast.Like Buffet I stay with what I know and understand when I manage my .0000000001 billion dollar portfolio Thanks, keep it coming pleaseQuote from: _act_ on July 14, 2022, 07:40:05 AMIf I get you correctly, you want to buy US dollar and hold it?

As for the budget deficit, the same story, you can just print more!Quote from: boyptc on July 14, 2022, 09:44:49 AMI've heard it from someone who's focused in forex trading.

So this means you will keep any asset other than USD, whether it's another currency, crypto, asset, etc., right??Thatâ€™s the correct way of taking advantage of your money because inflation can get half the value of your money. But when you hedge it, you can profit more.Be careful with short-term gains because it can get you in the long run if there is a lot of printed money going into the economy.",

However if your primary currency is not the US dollar right now it seems like holding a bunch of dollars in your portfolio might be a good idea, although it might be just as sensible to simply increase the percentage of US companies in a share portfolio to achieve the same effect. For all the bluster that some people around here like to share, it is clear that the US dollar is still relied on heavily by most countries and people as the safe haven of choice when it comes to any crisis. The printing presses have been turned off for now and the supply is tightening up a bit, which is probably what is moving the value up in comparison to other currencies.",

Translating to stable fiat currencies over the long term.Everyone has their favorites. FOREX trades are often leveraged due to volatility being low. A strong dollar is a bet on silicon valley and big tech corporations like apple, google, microsoft and amazon giving the united states economy a distinct advantage over other nations in helping it weather inflation and recession.Switzerland's economy is also structured in its own unique ways. Russia did threaten to invade sweden many years ago. Events like war also affect the value of currencies. It is possible war in ukraine is partly behind the euro losing value.",

I say you should be focusing a bit more towards how the crypto could help you and get you better and bitcoin is the starting point of that.Well I'm in the economic area of the board, I think when you talk bitcoin you also have to talk about your overall position. It would be myopic to only look at bitcoin. Sure I have bitcoin but It's part of the overall package.Part of that package is cash on hand. I want something other than USD that fits in my safe. Other currency is something I never glanced at but with a strong dollar I can make a smartish move. Two birds with one stone. If the euro gets strong again or stays as is, so what. I have value I can get ahold of in a timely fashion. PS: I added some silver today maybe some more down the road in a few weeks if it's the same ish or lower. See I'm a farmer and bought 500 gallons of diesel when the keystone was shut down. Figure I'd hold onto that until a regime change then burn it.",
