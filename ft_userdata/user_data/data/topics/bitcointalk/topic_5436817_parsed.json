If yes, then have you any plans for when you may open this bank? Not exact but timeframe it might be something like within 3 month, 6 month, this year, next year, 3 years, etc.",

Honestly ideaa born right after idea of the fund which was back in 2018Yes the model guess no interest on a any loans. But in respect of concurents I would say that there is nothing to be affraid of. Conversely, Idea would be to offer of making a common register of lenders. In my part I would give a small loans of $5-$25 for exemple, to anyone. And that person would start to work on it's \"Credit rating\". Again if he misleads my offer then others would got a signal about that. Model is not clear or finnish jet but from other things my Ismalic Bank would earn for exemple ads free ads on and from others banks. ( I have to check if that's go on. it was ok last time i checked.)",
