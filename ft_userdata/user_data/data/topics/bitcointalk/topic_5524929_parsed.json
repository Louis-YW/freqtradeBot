Chinese government want to milk as much money as possible from their citizens and they're like Russia, with a dictator like Putin and Xi, don't expect anything fair for citizens from Chinese government.You know?I don't care much about this news, because in my mind since years ago, China no longer has big impacts on Bitcoin market. If they want to get it back, it's too late because Bitcoin has been growing more with time and its decentralization becomes better with time. Many nations already joined Bitcoin mining and other things around Bitcoin, China massive impacts on Bitcoin gone forever.",

People are buying and selling bitcoin.Okay, I was hoping to read that this rule was because cryptocurrency can be use for money laundering and terrorist financing but I am surprised to see that it is not mentioned. Rather a more commonsense reason which is that, it is considered a threat to the country’s financial stability. I am not new to this kinds of rules and crypto transactions restrictions because that it my current reality. What I can say is that the government cannot stop these transactions. There are many legal and innovative ways that people will find to buy and trade cryptocurrency under the noses of the governemnt. I know this because this is also my current reality. Should I now say that the proposal of the legislator who was calling for China to adopt bitcoin as a strategic reserve is not going to fly because of this new rule?",

That has been the reason they did not want people in their country to trade cryptocurrencies.",

But i wonder why Beijing sees crypto assets as threat to their financial stability when they didn't place any prohibition on those that are holding cryptocurrencies, it's really funny though.",

So I don't find it too strange that in the end there will be a lot of regulation changes from this country to achieve their own benefits.",

Anyway, I think this steamed from the fact that they want Yuan or even Digital Yuan to be flexible as China has been losing a lot of money because of capital flight. They are fighting this war since like 2015-2016 as it become apparent during the boom of Bitcoin mining till 2018 and that's one reason they stop it.And the net outflows could still be continuing in the last two years, that's why they are tightening everything, including crypto currency trade and not mining itself. And probably they think as well that those who's into crypto are sneaking out billions out of this method of buying and selling their Bitcoin. So I'm not surprised that they have this another round of tightening again.",

But from some news outlets I have come across it seems Bitcoin mining is still going on in China. But the government is always putting in place strict laws to control it. Bitcoin is decentralized, so miners will always seek means to sell mined coins.",
