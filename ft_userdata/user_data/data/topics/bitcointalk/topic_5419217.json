However, anti-quantum ABC tokens can still be mined at present, although the mine production is not high, it is not completely impossible to mine.This section of the tutorial introduces you to the mining of ABC tokens.Ⅰ. Preparation:A computer, namely a mining machine, needs to be equipped with an Nvidia graphics card, recommended 1060Ti, 1070Ti, 1080Ti, 2080Ti. These are fairly good graphics cards that the webmaster has tried.Ⅱ. Install the Ubantu operating systemThe windows version of the wallet currently only supports CPU mining, does not support GPU, and is less efficient, so you need to install the Ubantu system, either 16.04 or 18.04.After installation, you need to drive the graphics card to command nvidia-smi to display normally.Ⅲ. Mining:The wallet runs the following commands:setgenerate trueThat means mining is started. At this time, you execute the command nvidia-smi to observe whether the GPU utilization rate reaches 100%. If it is, it is already mining.At this time, you need to wait patiently. If you are lucky, you can mine one block in two or three hours, which is 2560 tokens. If you are unlucky, it may take a week to dig one. As long as you have patience, you will find it.Will ABC anti-quantum digital currency be the new “coin king”?(1) What is ABC?Digital currency that is resistant to quantum computer crackingBottom algorithm: Rainbow SignatureDigging program: ABCardO polynomial mathematical equationConsensus mechanism: Proof of Work(2) Information of ABCTotal ABC: 2,147,483,647 dings of ABCABC unit: DingFounding block: 214,748,364.7 dings of ABCBlock height: 0Timestamp: 2018-06-18 03:08:00Byte size: 746A block is produced in approximately 10 minutes. It has been mined for about 90 years since 2018, and in the first eight years, the overall supply accounted for 50%. Instead of halving every four years, the output was reduced by about 25%, namely dropping to 75% of the previous year’s output.The group of ABCCore initiators pre-mined 10% of the genesis block, of which 3% donated to the ABCMint Foundation.(3) How do we obtain ABC?There are two approaches, and one is digging coins.The other is from Over-the-Counter market.Is ABC traded in exchange?Currently, ABC hasn’t been traded in any exchanges.(4) How much is the reward for ABC digging a block?At present, ABC rewards 2560 dings per block.In fact, the rewards are not constant. Since 2018, the rewards of a block are:5-10-20-40-160-640-1280-2563-2560Since 2022, the reward for a block will undergo continuing decrease.1884,1386,1020,751,552,406,299,220,162,119,87,64,47,35,25,18,13,10,7,5,4(5) About ABC mining programProgram: polynomial mathematical equation ABCardOMechanism: PoW (Proof of Work)Pattern: graphics card GPURelease time: 2018-6-18Half supply: 50% mined in next 8 yearsOverall output: 2147483647 in 88 yearsThe ABC digging program employs the polynomial mathematical equation ABCardO (developed by the world’s most outstanding polynomial solution expert Dr. Ruben Niederhagen whom ABCMint commissioned)At different levels of difficulty, the mining method of solving polynomials will enable mathematicians to understand how much computing power can be solved in various polynomials and other meaningful mathematical problems.(6) About the method of how to dig coinsJust like Bitcoins, ABC produces a block in about 10 minutes. It has been mined for about 90 years since 2018, and in the first eight years, the total supply accounted for 50%. Instead of halving every four years, the output decreased by about 25%, which mean that it dropped to 75% of the previous year’s output.The environment of digging system: Ubuntu16.04 + NVIDIA CUDA9.6+ GPU GTX1080Ti / Ubuntu18.04 + NVIDIA CUDA10.2 + GPU RTX2080TiRuben Niederhagen provides a GPU mining program that is faster than the CPU, and high-class miners can integrate it into the ABCMint core.Recommended graphics card model for miningABC mining employs the ABCardO polynomial algorithm. Presently, mining ABC coin can only use Nvidia graphics cards. Other cards and mining machines on the market are not suitable.Recommended 2080 Ti，3080，3090(7) Issues relevant to holding patentsAt the aspect of anti-quantum computer cracking, the ABCmint (Switzerland) Foundation has two patents. The fist one is the “Rainbow Signature” (Patent Time Limits: 2004-2022). The agreement, between NIST and Professor Ding, is that the patent will be abandoned on the condition that NIST selects the rainbow signature as the final standard. The second is a patent to “solve the problem of all anti-quantum signature public keys being huge” (Patent Time Limits: 2019-2040). This signifies that the entire anti-quantum signatures, if employed in digital currencies, will encounter congestion sooner or later because of the huge public key, and it is practically impossible to solve this problem without the application of the second patent.Therefore, it is expected that in the future, all digital currencies will put the patents and signatures of the ABCmint (Switzerland) Foundation into use as long as they are anti-quantum.",
