  "content": "while growing up as a child ,i noticed that i was so closed to my mother more than my father ,and i usually find it very easier to confide in her more than my father, i can easily run to her for financial help without fear even when i wanted to get money from my father i often go through  her to seek financial help from my dad but then i felt that it was an infant mentality even when i see my friends do same in their homes .more so, while in the university i noticed also that 75% of those that use to call their parents, only their mothers  and even when they want to pay their school fees they also complain to their mothers instead of their fathers. however i have tried to make some researches about all these preferential treatments given to mothers than fathers but still i am not convinced about my findings and that is why i decided to bring in the question here in the forum because i know that it will be well explained here and hopefully i will get all the answers that i want here .Therefore my question here is WHY DO PEOPLE GIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMWNT TO MOTHERS THAN FATHERS ?",

Traditionally the Fatter would be out all day at work whilst the Mother would he the one feeding & caring for the child, bringing them up etc. I don’t think there’s any science to it, your Mother has  maternal instincts & I guess they are the one you turn to more than your Father.",

Starting from the period of nine months where the mother is to carry the child in her stomach there is this connection between them that even tells her when the child is hungry right inside her, it is just natural and inbuilt connection.After our mother gives birth, they are the ones to bath us, feed us, cloth us and we tend to spend much time with her where else our Father is at work and when he comes back he has little or no time to play with the child, that is where the Bridge takes place between the Father and child. The child will always see the Father as being strict because he spends more of his time at work and when around our Mother we become too jovial.At a point for me personally, I can be able to cross my hands around the shoulder of my Mother and make funny jokes to crack her up but never can I do that to my Father despite my level of maturity I still accord to him same respect like I was still a kid, it is natural.",

They talk more they share more and get closer to each other with time. Of course, there will be exceptions to this rule or traditional perception of the family. Since nowadays is not uncommon to see women who also work in order to support her household, while the father stays home for some other reasons.",

      "body": "Quote from: JMBitcointernational on November 23, 2023, 02:26:42 AMWHY DO PEOPLE GIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMWNT TO MOTHERS THAN FATHERS ?   Mothers have close relationships with their children right from the womb. They tendered and nurtured the child from infant to maturity. Women are more emotional than men so they can build trust with the children using care, sweet words and patience. They can tolerate what a man can't so the children are more comfortable to confine in them than the father. Due to the strong connection between the child and mother, the latter will always ensure that the former is loved regardless of the attitude of the child. Recently I went to the correctional facility to see a neighbor who was incarcerated and the majority of visitors that came to see these inmates were mothers. Father can easily disown a misbehaving child but the mother will not lose hope on that child. She will keep believing that the child will be restored. I think mothers deserve better treatment than fathers because they contribute more to the proper upbringing of their children than fathers. However, I have also noticed that male children are closer to their mothers while females prefer to relate closer to their fathers. So I think the girls treat their fathers better than their mothers.",

And that is because we boys are provider and we need to provide more time to our jobs and livelihood so we can provide for our wife and child. That is the reason why the bond of stay at home moms and kids are stronger.And I think that special treatment is already embedded to the women and we respect them more than the boys of our own. I believe and still think the traditional woman should stay at home and take care of their family, the husband and their kids. But these times, we are showing on how good they are for being working moms.That is actually hard when they have decided to work and at same time take care of their children. As long as they have money for nanny, the taking care side becomes easier. But is still best for children to grow up with their moms and dads than with the care mostly of their nannies.",

A mother has this strong emotional feelings for her child than the father that makes her to worry when the child is not happy, because of their tender and soft heart. A father believes that if he can provide food for the family and all necessary needs that he has done his best and he feels that is the way to show love. If you look at it the father hardly spend time with their children because they are busy with work and the man can even stay two or three days without seeing his child he wouldn't bother as long as he has provided for their needs. The fact is that a mother can't abandon her child and run away but a man can due to his strong heart and he believes that can do without his child but mother wouldn't dare do such because her pride and happiness is her child.",

We find it easier to explain our problems to our father than to our mother۔ Nature has placed something special in the creation of mother, which cannot be described in words. Although the father also earns for his children all his life. He works hard and strives hard. He puts his whole life at stake to make the future of his children. But nature has given a special place to the mother. And about this he knows best.",

When I grew up, I started to ask less for money, as I was somehow feeling guilt for not taking responsibility. But if say of mother, she is the source of my happiness. Nothing can be compared with her love, care for me. We feel more close to our mother then our father. Maybe that's the reason for us to give preferential treatment to mothers more than fathers.",

I know that in terms of both natural science and spirituality, women always have the ability to have an advantage in things related to psychology. So the way they are close becomes comfortable and brings security, and when it comes to the mother-child bond, I believe it is a strong invisible bond, most of us were raised close to our mothers. Since birth, as it accumulates over time, the relationship becomes more and more stable.",

Mothers are the closest to the child, they feed and do anything for them at the tender age when the father just have to keep providing for the family. For a family that the husband does all of this which is rare, the children tend to like the father more than the mum and give him preferential treatment of that. When a child misses motherly love, he won’t get to know the joy that comes with it. Mother are caring, nice, jovial, soft hearted etc and they will continue to be so as long as they’re the one that will take care of the child and nurse the child.",

On the  other hand mothers are the traditional managers of the home, so the children mainly appreciates who gives them food and pampers them. Well this is a challenge to all fathers to always be around and have quality times with their children to build a lifetime bond.Mothers can be soft and gentle to a fault towards their children, that is not fair to fathers. Imagine when a child is doing wrong, instead of a mother to be strict and caution the child, she'll rather wait for the father to return and complain about the child's bad behavior. She'll expect the husband to discipline the child, in the end the children will see father as strict and wicked, while mum is gentle and good. The children will forever cherish the gentleness of mothers and despise the strictness of fathers that helped to shape them to be responsible adults.
