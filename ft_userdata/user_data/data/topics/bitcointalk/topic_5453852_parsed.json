It will also save you a lot of time when your post.",

I tried to experiment on it by altering the numbers manually but I’m always getting a very odd date which is doesn’t make sense to the number or any pattern that will lead me to understanding the format.Now I can have peace of my mind that this is not an easy fit job.

This is the reason why I can detect the missing number on that date since the bbcode [/quote] is appearing on my preview post. I just quote again the same post then copy the date format on my original quoted post that I already trim.Nice to learn new info in the forum structure.",
