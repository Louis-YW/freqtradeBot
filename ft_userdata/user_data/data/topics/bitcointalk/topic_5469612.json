  "content": "I've noticed a topic in the Bitcoin discussion. I was encouraged by reading the Topic, I thought if anyone would benefit financially from me. Instead of buying an iPhone, if one invests in Bitcoin, his future will be bright.  Now if someone invests in Bitcoin with the same amount of money to buy an iPhone, it is expected that in 2-4 years he will be able to buy 1 iPhone with the investment profit. Also, Bitcoin halving in 2024, investment during this time can be very profitable. With that in mind, I suggested buying bitcoins instead of buying iPhones in my local thread. I searched among my friends to see if anyone would buy an iPhone, finally one of my close friends lives in my country's capital. Working in a good company and getting salary of $500 per month. Buying that friend's iPhone is easy. He came to visit my house a few days ago. My friend had a $200 normal phone, one time I talked to him he said he was going to buy an iPhone 15. I can't knowingly recommend my friend to buy an iPhone. I got good knowledge about Bitcoin, I suggested my friend to invest in Bitcoin thinking about his future development. Given all the ideas about Bitcoin, my friend at one point decided to invest in Bitcoin instead of buying an iPhone. Suggested my friend to invest in Bitcoin by following DCA. My friend bought $200 worth of bitcoins for the first time. It will try to gradually increase its investment growth.",

With close friends, we can easily talk about opportunities to develop ourselves more. I also said to a close friend that he was feeling poor? And of course we understand the poverty of knowledge, spirit, and material,... thereby rebuilding the most basic things. I don't like talking about an opportunity without understanding its nature, that doesn't guarantee sustainability.The journey to a goal requires a beginning and perseverance. Here I see that beginning and hope everyone keeps that fire to have better opportunities in life.",

      "body": "Firstly, I suggest moving your topic to the Bitcoin discussion section since it pertains to the idea of investing in Bitcoin. I understand that the concept of investing in Bitcoin instead of purchasing the latest iPhone has been discussed several times on the forum, but it remains sound advice. This doesn't mean you shouldn't buy an iPhone, but it's worth considering the potential profit from investing the same money in Bitcoin. Buying an iPhone locks your funds into a fixed asset, which, over time, will depreciate as new designs emerge in the market. On the other hand, investing in Bitcoin, especially given the expectation of an upcoming bull run, can yield higher profits. We should all strive to make intelligent choices that can safeguard our financial future.",

In this case, from my point of view, the price of iPhone 15 will go above 800 dollars, in that case, I think if this money can be invested now, in the next bull run, I think this money is likely to triple. Because in the last bull run, Bitcoin touched around 69k dollars, and now if you see the current price around 28k USD. However, no one can guarantee when the price of Bitcoin will increase or when the bull run will start. But if you check the past history, it will be seen that the bull run started immediately after the bitcoin halving. And Bitcoin halving is very close now you suggested to your friend and he accepted it, I think it is a very good job. Hope your friend can buy iphones with his profit in the next bull run.",

When bitcoin fell after it was $60,000, I remember reading the news that a married couple decided to buy it at such a cheap price and sold their house for it.https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/money/2021/08/17/this-family-sold-everything-they-owned-to-invest-in-bitcoin-when-it-was-900/In fact, there are a lot of such stories and often people around do not understand and laugh at such people, but the fact is that it will still be above $ 60,000, and it will grow to 100,000.",

I believe that each person will have their own spending plan and it is normal for them to buy necessary things for their needs. I don't understand why there are so many topics discussing iPhones and bitcoin investments when they are two completely different things. If we think buying a new phone is a waste, then it's best to limit our daily meals, limit the purchase of necessary items and put it all into bitcoin. It's the weekend and I took my kids out after a stressful week at school and it cost me quite a bit of money, would it be better if I kept my children at home and used that money to invest in bitcoin? If we cannot balance our lives, then if we pour all our money into bitcoin, life will become meaningless and investing in bitcoin will become a crime rather than bringing us a better life.",

I was encouraged by reading the Topic, I thought if anyone would benefit financially from me. Instead of buying an iPhone, if one invests in Bitcoin, his future will be bright.Different people have different interests and needs. If you love luxury stuffs, you won't stop to buy them because your life looks more boring at least in your thinking, without those luxury stuffs.In addition, iPhone can be a luxury stuff with me or you but with some people, it's not kind of luxury thing as they are rich enough to buy one iPhone. They even can use money to invest in Bitcoin but still can manage to buy an iPhone. If they can do it, it's not financially wrong by buying an iPhone to use and enjoy life.Your advise is true if a person is poor but want to make a loan for buying an iPhone. It is true with those people, they are doing something bad and very unnecessary spending in their life while they can use the same money for more important stuffs. Learning a course to improve their skills to have better jobs, become more competitive when applying for a job. Using it for investment like in Bitcoin. Using that money for emergency. All those spending types are more meaningful and helpful for them than an iPhone.Quote from: Bd officer on October 08, 2023, 06:16:46 AMif one invests in Bitcoin, his future will be bright.Buying bitcoin is not enough. The rest must be holding it in a safe and secure wallet because if you lose bitcoin after buying it a few days, it's won't help you to get richer or have a brighter future.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts.",

      "body": "Well, it's hard to say whether steering someone towards buying a particular item and recommending Bitcoin is the right choice or not. I often see content creators on YouTube prioritizing their devices to enhance their video production capabilities on their smartphones. They buy iPhones out of necessity for their work, not just to make a fashion statement.The average iPhone user tends to have the financial means to easily spend $1000, and for some wealthy individuals, they can recoup that amount within a day. So, it's not a matter of blindly advocating for Bitcoin without considering other opportunities. Let's be honest, everyone has their preferences and priorities.If someone regrets their iPhone purchase, they may eventually realize that the Apple gadget doesn't hold as much value for them. And I believe that realization might lead them to change their mind, potentially selling their iPhone and investing in Bitcoin.",

But, I can't suggest the bitcoin too, because this is trading and we can't expect what will be tomorrow. In trading a coin can reach any place or any price. As you know the batteries of the iPhone are going to be low day by day, I have used the iPhone I have now, but it is not good in terms of batteries, so it will decrease the price. For example, if he buys an iPhone for $200 and is using it constantly, then after 6 months or 8 months, the battery will be 90% from 100%, which is quite disgusting and it will lose its original price of $200, and now it will be around $160.Comparing these two, bitcoin investments would be a better choice to get some profit, whether if he didn't have that much of the money but he should invest.",

Of course, you will explain to him that Bitcoin will grow and so on, but I don’t know if this answer will suit him. Perhaps you immediately warned him about possible risks and temporary price drops, then you did everything right. In any case, I wish you success",

All devices are like that, and in the end, they really lose their value, except for real estate, gold, and Bitcoin.     Because of the three I mentioned, it can be said that even if a day or year passes, the value increases, and we have seen and proven that because it is really true. That's why if you are an investor who likes long-term investment, just choose the three I mentioned, and the best one is Bitcoin.",
