So it should be trusted. Or do you have other reasons why you are looking for open-source?",

Once there was finally proof that your code actually correctly finds & reports block finds he also now allows it on the main pool.",

If you are the sole owner of the code, yes, you can actually change its license or dual license it, but that is not retroactive which is why some people made forks. Feel free to use those...Required to release source? Sorry Kano that is not how it works. If you touch my code, yes you are, but since its my code, i don't. With cgminer it is not only your code so you can do nothing about it but continue using the same license in perpetuity unless you make your own replacement from scratch or fork the thing making sure no code that is not yours remain.The bosminer community edition was released with that license, so anyone who forked is in the obligation to release code if, only if, it is redistributed publicly (ie github) or in a product like a miner. This is the GPL style rules, not MIT/BSD where you are not even required to do this.",
