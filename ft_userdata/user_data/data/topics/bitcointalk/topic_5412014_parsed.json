  "content": "Hello,It's been a while since a posted here. I know we have a lot of OPENDIME/COLDCARD fans here so I figure I'd share the new projects.Coinkite launched 3 new projects based on NFC JavaCards. TAPSIGNER - The simple Bitcoin wallet in your pocket: as the tagline states this is a very simple, affordable and generic hardware wallet. Like a blind signer, it takes a message digest and signs without your Bitcoin pk if the PIN matches (The PIN is user definable). It has a capability of exporting the PK AES encrypted with a key etched on the back. The usage models we initially see for this is, single sig for medium to small amounts, this is a great solution to avoid PKs on phones. Multi-sig co-signer where the amounts could be quite large depending on the security level of the other keys. Authentication; this could be used to authenticate into other applications/locks/etc... using Bitcoin's signature. Message signing with your Bitcoin pk. checkout the FAQ https://tapsigner.com/faqSATSCARD - Like cash in hand, pass physical Bitcoin along multiple times. Gift. Anonymous. Trust no one. Non-custodial.: This is the evolution of OPENDIME, 10x reusable, very easy to sweep on phones, flat, etc... . checkout the FAQ https://getsatscard.com/faqSATSCHIP - Add #Bitcoin authenticity to your artwork: This product is meant to function like a real \"NFT\", you can sign a message digest with the phical artwork information, pictures, etc... This was born out the OPENDIME Rare Pepe uses. This product can't be backed up. checkout the FAQ https://satschip.com/faqYou can find their info here https://Coinkite.cards and SDK here https://Coinkite.cards/sdkWe plan on making many-many designs as we partner with more artists.Price is also planned to progressely decrease through the years as we test the market and scale productionCheers,NVK",

I know it's NFC and no exposed electronics unlike the dime but it's still an electronic device and it can still die.-Dave",

We have tested a variety of scenarios. However, we just never know what folks will do in the wild and are looking forward to trying to help those who damage it.(The TAPSIGNER has backup capability so this is not an issue)",

Can someone just purchase blank NFC JavaCards, load your firmware code in them, and use them in the same way like new cards?There are some valid reasons why I would choose that, one of them isÂ  not being directly connected with anything crypto-bitcoin related.I would prefer buying bulk empty cards locally and making my own custom design for each card.I don't see anything being mentioned about source code, so I can only assume it's not open source.",

Satochip (~~~ TAPSIGNER)Satodime (~~~ SATSCARD)SeedKeeper (no equivalent)At least TAPSIGNER and SATSCARD should be analogous to 2 of the above products.What's most misleading / confusing is the naming of your 'SATSCHIP' (NFT stuff) device - as there is 'Satochip' which is Tibu's plain hardware wallet (analogous to your TAPSIGNER).",

I would love to hear what license they have...Still didn't get any answer from NVK... he is only contacting me when he needs update or correction in one of my HW topics",
