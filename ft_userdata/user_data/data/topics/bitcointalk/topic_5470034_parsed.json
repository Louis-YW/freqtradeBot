Also you can rent a server from any reputable vendor, install Bitcoin Core on it, and then add your own username and password to it so that once the blockchain is completely synced on that server, you can query it privately.It is not recommended to share RPC credentials because this will lead to the server getting DoS'ed by bad guys. (denial of service attack)",

It has a much smaller blockchain.Yes to the testnet local.If you don't want to do testnet any of the BTC clone / shitcoins wallets should be easy enough to test on so long as their codebase is close to current core.Keep in mind that if you are dealing with peoples money you really should be running your own server, since if the service you are using has an issue then YOU have an issue.-Dave",
