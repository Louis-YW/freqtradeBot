  "content": "What is the fate of mixers in the cryptocurrency industry?Mixers are often seen as bad players in the cryptocurrency industry. They can be taken down by FBI or other agencies at any time. The question is, why new mixers still coming to the industry?For instance, in this recent Sinbad incidence, it is alleged that Sinbad committed many crimes as;QuoteSinbad processed funds from the hacks of Horizon Bridge and Axie Infinity, the release said. It's also moved funds tied to \"sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, the purchase of child sexual abuse materials and additional illicit sales on darknet marketplaces.\"QuoteFellow analytics service Elliptic claimed Sinbad was also used to move some of the $35 million stolen from Atomic Wallet earlier this year.SEE my question,Do the mixers actually know where transactions are coming from, maybe to not allow the transaction if it's from a criminal organisation. For instance, if Mr Bob wants to mix bitcoin he used to purchase arms in the darker, will Sinbad know that the particular coin is coming from dark net transactions? If No, it therefore means all mixers are vulnerable and can be taken down at anytime.",

The government is basically tightening the noise of decentralization leaving only very little room for mixers to operate in an effort to ensure that they can track everything and no one stays off the radar.Quote from: Zoomic on November 29, 2023, 05:44:31 PMIf No, it therefore means all mixers are vulnerable and can be taken down at anytime.Short answer is yes.Also short answer is that to escape the hammer of the authorities mixers may have to become an extension which can be used to track Bitcoin users. This doesn't provide full protection though.",

That's why exchanges works together to block those address used to received from hack exchanges.

In addition, didn't some/a govt/s wanted for mixers to register? and most likely implement AML policies as well which essentially breaks the service.Nevertheless, seeing how new ones are coming up probably means there is a demand for the service.",

But dark related activies i think still hard to findWait a minute, can you back up your statement that most people use mixers to launder money? If this is the case, then all mixers should already be shut down and seized by the authorities. But I don't agree with you. And I'm 100% sure that many who use mixers only want that their transactions can't be traced. And that's not laundering. To erase tracks is not to launder.Anyway, I'm afraid that if mixers' main function becomes to clean dirty money, governments might declare war on them and we might end up mostly with centralized mixers, which isn't what anonymity and privacy are all about.",

But mixers continue to flourish in the crypto world as anonymity is the order of the day. The owners of the mixers that were pulldown by the government today might continue to open other ones, this is not new unless you didn't notice. Some still had the alternatives even before the government pulled it down, then they continued with it and may also open another new alternative, and it goes on like that.Also, there are many of them already, the government can't pull all down unless they trace illicit activities to them. This is even as there are decentralised ones that I've never heard the government pulls down before.QuoteFor instance, if Mr Bob wants to mix bitcoin he used to purchase arms in the darker, will Sinbad know that the particular coin is coming from dark net transactions? If No, it therefore means all mixers are vulnerable and can be taken down at anytime.The truth is that they know at times, but at times too, they may not know, regardless, anyone mixing coins is mainly to be blamed since mixers can't know all intentions.",
