My account was banned because of some error but then I learned about bitcoin forum well. I got many questions like:What is Predict888?How Predict888 is solving problem like trading?How betting platforms like this works?How to make deposit? How bet on the crypto asset?I‚Äôll happy to answer all the questions: Predict888 is web3's first prediction market with real odds. A combination of gambling & options trading where every player can bet on any crypto asset with real-time changing odds. We support bets on bitcoin, ethereum, binance coin, dogecoin etc. We are world‚Äôs first platform who have built real time changing odds on financial markets, we are not a new player in market from past 5 years+ we provide a similar kind of betting opportunity on stock market index because real-time changing odds with our previous brand. Our platform is built for traders & punters where they can bet on the price movement of a cryptocurrency in REAL TIME. About Game:Let‚Äôs say the price of bitcoin is going $20,000: Now users can bet either price is going up from $20,500OrBet on the price of bitcoin will close in between $19500 - $20500Or They can bet for the price of bitcoin is going down from $19500Users can be on different windows like 30mins, 2 hours & so.

Why did not you have your own terms? this is a very serious case since copying content from another place completely knowing that it is not content created by you is plagiarism, but the most serious thing in this situation is that the casino was copying the TOS of another casino, TOS is something that every casino should create it themselves, doesn't it make sense that one casino would copy another casino's TOS, so that casino doesn't have its own idea about rules in its own casino? in this case I'm already wondering how many other things they also copied?OP you need to clarify how you can have the same thing in the TOSI would like to know what is the difference between trading on binance and your casino? example if I buy currency X on binance and then I have to sell it at price Y, I have to see how far the price will go up so that my profit is greater, in the case of your casino if the person buys bitcoin at price X and chooses that will go up to price Z and the person gets it right, does he/she keep the profit? I still haven't created an account at your casino for that reason I don't know, I saw something like 2X or 1.76x and I didn't understand anythinghttps://predict888.com/crypto-games",
