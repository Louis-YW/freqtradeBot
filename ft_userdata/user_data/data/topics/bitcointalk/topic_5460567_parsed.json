      "body": "This is the first time I am hearing this name I never know a cryptocurrency exchange call bundle exist and to say that they have an affiliation with Binance is another thing I am not clear with because Binance has come out some time ago to deny the operation of any subsidiary here in Nigerians so for this crypto exchange to have operated for 4 years and yet unpopular shows that there have a low reputation and if you don't mind sharing the link to this news to that we can check more details about the exchange and its domain. A cryptocurrency exchange is something that requires liquidity to operate and since they mentioned a $ 50 million daily trading volume I don't know what the reason for a closer of the crypto exchange at this point.",

Since you received email from d company, I think other users too will receive d same message unless dey don't take it serious, and anything that happen to their wallets dey will bear it.",
