      "body": "First thing first, the person who helped you create the Bitcoin wallet, does he know your private key? Good people or not, don't trust anyone in this world. If you have learned how to create the wallet, I suggest you to create a new one and get rid of the old one. It doesn't take money to create a new wallet. In order to save your privacy, you should always stay cautious. If you are using a software wallet, I suggest you to move to a hardware wallet. It is the best option to secure your assets. It will cost you some money, but that's just one time investment which will keep you safe for the rest of your life. Second thing is that, do not back up your secret key online, never share it with anyone, always keep it safe and learn how to encrypt those key before backing up. If you do these two steps, then you can move on to buying and storing your Bitcoin. There's no ending when it comes to learning. And slow and steady always wins the race. Learn it little by little and don't rush it. You will eventually get to the top for sure.",

But whatever. I guess it has to be reminded that you should have your private key where only you have the copy and know where you hid it or else you are compromised whether ETH or BTC, you need those private keys or seed. Now that you are reminded that you participated in the bounty campaigns I think you can resume. Thats one way to start.",

I will say, you did find a unique way to say I am new here and help me to learn this forum. I have seen many new members coming here and saying they are new here or referred by some friend and how they can grow here, and ask for useful links or suggestions, but your way of saying that is unique and I liked that.By the way, there is nothing to afraid of, you will learn things if you will spend some time here, if you will not spend some time in understanding the rules first then you might not find useful things. The best way to get familiar with new platforms is to learn there rules by reading then not by disobeying or learning by doing mistakes again and again. Work like a smart man instead of a donkey who don't use his own brain. I am not calling you donkey jusst using it as an example. Which means, you should first learn the rules of this forum to stay here, you can learn them by clicking on help button and then visit each thread or topic to get the most of the knowledge about this forum and after 1 week you will learn a lot about it.",

As this is your learning phase, investing too much is not advisable. Also, spend a reasonable amount on stocking. And coins that have a low market value. And it is likely to increase in the future. Buy it. So that you can earn better profit from it. Also focus on mining and try to learn its psychology and methodology. In this way, I hope you will be successful in future.",

And during that time I started to write articles which was also part of bounties. And to write articles we should have the knowledge first. So, before writing, I started to research about that project, and if I counter any unknown term I simple try to learn as much as I could and then move to other. In this journey you will get to know many terms but you have to be selective while reading them because my main aim was to get enough knowledge to write that article so I did no wonder around more than that. And I will suggest you to do the same.Learn the basics by researching and then keep them remember and then try to engage here with as many discussions as you can and make sure to be of some help, because useless posts will be counted as spam.",
