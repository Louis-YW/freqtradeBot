  "content": "I have about four different multi-wallets that I created with Trust Wallet, SafePal, and Metamask; one is just for altcoins and other cryptos, and the other three are just for bitcoin. I don't have any bitcoin wallets that haven't already been mentioned, and I'd like to know if it's possible to create a bitcoin-only wallet that doesn't require a desktop APP, works offline (because Windows wasn't purchased from a trusted party), and can be protected by a passcode or password. because I want to transfer all of my bitcoin holdings from my trust wallet to a more secure wallet that has higher security. Read-only paper and hardware wallets are the best, but getting my hands on a hardware wallet now won't be fast or easy because of my location. Every piece of advice and suggestion will be highly appreciated.",

Are you talking about a Bitcoin wallet that doesn't need to install on your desktop that works offline?If yes, then a paper wallet is I think what you looking for because most Bitcoin wallet is software that you need to install on your desktop before you can able to use them.

If you create a 2FA wallet, you will actually create a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet and your transactions need to be signed by a third party called trustedcoin. Note that trustedcoin will charge you extra fee for your transactions. Also, if you are going to have the 2FA on the same device as your wallet, it would defeat the purpose of 2FA. Standard wallet is probably what you need.An a side note, don't forget to save your seed phrase in a safe place.",

They offer two batches of 100 and 20 transactions. As stated in the link you shared, you must pay 0.0005 BTC for the batches of 20 transactions and 0.00125 BTC for the batches of 100 transactions.This fee will be charged in the first transaction you make from your 2FA wallet. For example, if you make only one transaction from your wallet and then disable the 2fa or don't use that wallet anymore for any reason, you have to pay around $12 dollars worth of bitcoin only for one transaction.",

I usually suggest Ubuntu because it is a very popular distro and has a general purpose so it is very versatile. The popularity also means you can find any questions you have that are specific to this distro very quickly online. I also prefer downloading, verifying and installing Electrum myself instead of having it come with the distro. The other problem with Tails is that it is designed to not-have persistence (although you can go around that by putting some effort into it) which is something you need if you are setting up your own storage device.",
