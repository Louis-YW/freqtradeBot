  "content": "After the first payment with USDT TRC20 tokens, you can see a second transaction to a similar address from your wallet. The second transaction is 0 USDT. It really surprised me.Then I found out that any programmer who knows how to make such smart contracts can send such a transaction,but he will pay a commission and it is possible to send only 0 tokens.I found out about it today. If you copy wallets from the transaction history, then you can send tokens to a fraudulent address.",
