All staff get paid, but how much is something you should not worry yourself about. But why all this question? Do you want to be a moderator? I see all this survey you are doing is unnecessary, and I doubt any moderator will come here and give you an answer to those questions. The forum admin Theymos selects moderators based on boards he knows they are best suited for. I don't know how it's done, but for the local boards, I think the moderator must be from the local area in order for them to understand what's going on there and know what they are moderating.",

Souds like someone who's interested in moderation job but I don't think you stand a chance to become one for now. Trust matters when such position is involved. You shouldn't expect the forum to be pilot under the care of someone with questionable trust or into the hands of new account who knows nothing about the forum works and the principles guiding it privacy.Concerning their payment, you are asking irrelevant questions. Even the civil servants do not entertain questions about their earning because it's like an invasion of privacy. The amount they earn as moderators is personal and the forum has made it clear that they should be seen as volunteers who wish to sacrifice for the forum willingly not like Forum employees.",

I write from experience as a mod in one forum that has now gone defunct. The method of selection for us in that forum was based on activeness and then those who wanted to moderate indicated interest by saying that on a thread dedicated to such. Qualified members were picked and communicated to.Quotedo mod get paid? who pays to mods and how much they earn? But of course, every labourer deserves their wages. Just like I was paid on that forum, I know mods here too are paid. The only difference would be that I was paid with a shit token created by that said forum while mods here are paid with Bitcoin.",

I assume Mods have that button on every board they manage, and I also assume they have a \"Nuke\" or \"ban\" button on profiles they're allowed to ban.

That's a separate thing.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMQ: Where can I find all the moderators/staff/administrators?A: Just go to the Member search page (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=mlist;sa=search), untick all the boxes and then tick \"Search by position\". To find all regular moderators like board moderators, local moderators or patrollers (site-wide newbie moderators), search for \"Staff\" (without the quotation marks). To find all global moderators, search for \"Global Moderator\". To find all admins, search for \"Administrator\". Quote from: SaltySpitoon on April 29, 2015, 09:10:18 PMHeh, you could add founder to the list of staff ranks. I have no idea what powers Satoshi's account has, I'd say probably adminstrator priviledges, but I'd imagine that has been changed years ago, since administrator accounts aren't left unattended for long. So I suppose it would be more apt to say Satoshi would have admin powers if they come back.Admins: can do everything imaginable on the site. They however can't delete their accounts.Global Moderators: can perma ban, nuke newbies, see and handle reports from all sections, and see reported PMs.Moderators: can see and handle reports from their sections and nuke newbiesPatrollers: Are essentially Moderators but can only do moderator tasks for newbie members.",
