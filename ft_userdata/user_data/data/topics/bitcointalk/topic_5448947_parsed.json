And you'll assign people to teams by answering a puzzle.  . Not everyone is interested in blockchain. You may be right I can't answer without knowledgeable people.",

You don't just expect a project to come to the forum and drop a scattered name of their project or perhaps just randomly typed letters and then wanting to recruit anyone who's s able to solve it. If they want to hire people based on puzzle and not work experience then I'm not sure of anyone will be willing to waste their time looking for a puzzle without any assurance that they would end up being accepted at the end.",
