People always jump to new project that always result to short term pump = big gain. This is what most people always aiming when they are jumping to new project hoping to enter early before everyone jump in then exit on other money.It’s like a ponzi game that everyone knows the project is a pump and dump but still taking the risk hoping that there’s still more will invest after them. Old project already have huge investors backing that makes the price very hard to move unlike new projects that is too volatile to pump.",

I mean there are projects that are not known, like ZeroClassic. Just a bunch of crypto enthusiasts support it and that is all. And it deserves more attention. But no one cares about those old projects. Rather to invest in a shit coin that in few months will be dead..",

These are the majority. They try to suck out more juice and forget about the project, switching to another. To be fair, it should be noted that the authors of most projects themselves pursue the same goal.",

There are plenty of good ones which are runing years unnoticed. It's because the sequence of the new projects haven't been made any pump and that's why many are investing on them in belief that they might pump a lot. That's where the idea goes of having x10 - x1000 or more gain.Quote from: matejbilahora on December 15, 2023, 07:59:46 PMAnd people would love these small projects.Yes, that's why if you're not into these small projects, you can invest into the bigger and known ones than them. There's higher risk in the new projects.",

New projects are often sell for cheap and some of those projects may go big in the future. Remember ethereum used to be a <$10 coin which nobody wanted. Many people made fun of eth (me included) and now eth is above $2k. Of course that doesn't mean you will certainly hit jackpot if you buy these new coins but a wise man once said: \"you can't win the lottery if you don't buy any tickets!\"Also people do some research before investing blindly in these projects. (not everybody sadly) If they find the project believable enough, they invest in it.R. Ver does that all the time. He made shit ton of money with many of his investments. Blockchain.com, Bitcoin.com, btc itself are some of them. But not all of his bets went big. Some of them went big first and went smol later... (like bcash and zcash (111nd bit coin at cmc now). Purse.io > closed down...",

There is more after we will get some stable market. But still mining with gpu is not that bad here",

BTW, what a fall of zero classic, from $230 to 7 cents, I don't know why but if there is such fall I'd automatically stay away from it. In 2017-18 many coins went to undeserving prices, and 99.99% of them will never see those prices again, most of 'em are most likely dead already anyway.",

      "body": "It's simple mate, the rate of return once a new project becomes successful could be life-changing. Compared to projects that already exist in the market and are valued in billions to hundreds of millions. I am not really against it since all of us wanted to gain. But I just hope that these people know and understand clearly that their investments could end up being worthless in case the project fails to get support from communities and exchanges.Of these new projects, meme coins are the worst to invest in. There are hundreds of meme coins created regularly and it is becoming slimmer to be lucky. There's more chance to hit a jackpot in a casino than profiting big from a meme coin.",

If a currency rose in the past from a price of $2 to $10 and the price collapsed to $0.1, it is unlikely that the price will rise again, and if it does, $10 will be the peak, quite the opposite of new currencies. The pump can be very high because no one knows where the future price trend will stop. Old projects are usually dead and require more effort to implement them than new projects.",
