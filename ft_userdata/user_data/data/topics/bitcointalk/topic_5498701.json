  "content": "The world is changing really fast. Nowadays school students starting from 9th-10th students to college level students are indulging in smoking to show themselves smart, nowadays it has increased a lot. When a student is addicted to smoking, he spends about one to one and a half dollars a day on buying cigarettes. A cost per month is $30 to $45, which if converted annually is $360 to $540. A student spends about $2,500-$3,700 on smoking over seven years. If we had saved this amount of money in any investment or for the future without spending it unnecessarily during our student life, then the path in life would have been very easy. The most difficult journey of a student's life begins in the years after graduation, when your savings or investments may come in handy.If a student invests in coins like bitcoin without burning $2500-3700$ in his education life and also while he is busy establishing himself, this amount of money will power the way. Many may say that bitcoin risk has little guarantee of future profits but smoking guarantees that you will die very soon. I want to say that since I took the risk, why am I not in Bitcoin! I have one regret because I have been through this cycle. I know and also know my community who is doing what how. I don't know if there are such members in this forum, but maybe there are many who have grown up or are in this cycle, to them I would like to tell them to quit smoking and start saving money and invest in Bitcoin and ensure a bright future.",

      "body": "They don't know what life is and the money that they're burning through that vice is from their parents. Once they grow up and welcomed to the corporate and real world, they're going to take care of the money that they earn. For now, they're not going to understand it but I see some that are extraordinary and wise with how they take care of their money. Those teenagers that are able to have a grit and able to earn some money, they're wising up on how they can prolong that and wanting to invest somewhere else.The thinking should be like that but not everyone can be extraordinary and they have to learn the hard way before they realize that the money that they have in their possession should be spent wisely. And this isn't just for buying cigarettes but also other addiction and vices that they're burning or putting their money into waste. A day will come that will analyze their situation and will have a contemplation on themselves on how much they've spent already for those things that caused them nothing but throwing money. While the other people that they're inspired with how they're good in money handling and managing it the right way, they're going to realize it. Everyone has their own time to grow, in money, in life and financial knowledge. Those that have learned it through several mistakes, they're the ones that are likely the successful ones and those that have been trying all of the time, they're seeing themselves that one day they'll also be good. So, save up, invest, buy Bitcoin and other assets that they can afford that they shall hold for a long time.",

Indeed if most people should calculate the amount of money they had spend on smoking since they started till now they will actually be surprised with how much they will realize and funny enough not just only on smoking but for so many other things like drinking and gambling, though I'm not saying that gambling is bad but excessive gambling is not advisable because so many persons who has become an addict today has lost so much money on gambling because I no of someone who lost $1000 a week in gambling and that wasn't actually the first time, so perhaps imagine if he had putting majority of the money into Bitcoin he would actually gone far on his Bitcoin investment now, so actually the best thing is that even if they cannot actually stop it totally but at least they should be able to reduce the rate at which they normally do those things or perhaps diversify some of those money into investing on Bitcoin.",

But when we gather the money we carelessly spend for a long time, it can be enough to invest in a profitable venture. So I support op that smokers can quit and keep the money aside which can help them to put it into an investment. I support his stance wholeheartedly because smoking has no nutritional benefits and has severe health consequences. So quitting will be good for our finances and health. If some people calculate how much they have spent on cigarettes for twenty years, they would have been millionaires if they had bought and held Bitcoin for a long time.",

They can seek professional help if it has become uncontrollable. Stopping an addicted behaviour is not easy but it is a worthy task to keep fighting for your freedom. I have seen people who smoke even against the advice of the doctor and it ended up affecting their help and even led to death. I have been their before and I can tell you that it needs lots of discipline and determintion.",

You must now realize how much money you have wasted. If I'm not mistaken, you mean an attempt to save money from student life and then use the money for the later part of student life. Basically, how many people can actually take these challenges, if very high, ten out of 100 people will succeed. Anyway I mean if you have quit smoking then good and if you haven't then try to quit now keep saving money.

If they even invest into Bitcoin before taking care of thier mental health, they will always at some point in time sell off thier Bitcoin and use the money to buy cigarette or any substances they've been addicted into. If you don't take care of some other important aspect of your life, you will end up blowing your investment out when it gets tough.Investing into any meaningful stuff mostly comes to play when you're able to figure out how to live reasonably and worth out your basic need and then you can now make provision for an amount that's going into your investment and then another than can sort out your basic needs as well as serve as your emergency funds.bif you're yet to fix these aspect of your life, the possibility of being able to effectively invest into Bitcoin or another asset will be too slim.",

It's certainly better to invest the money that could go on these habits into Bitcoin.

However, instead of spending for their smoking habit, they should divert that one into learning to save, at least when they graduate from school, they still have savings to buy presents for theirselves or just continue saving to fund their future investment.

Sometimes I do sit and think about what some people see in smoking. I don’t see anything interesting or useful about smoking, all I see is people trying to kill themselves. Some people can do everything in their power just to get money and smoke, and after smoking, they will start doing crazy things, causing problems in society. What surprises me most is that even the younger generation is getting addicted to smoking. How I wish something could be done to stop that. Quote from: Imugen on June 03, 2024, 10:08:38 AMWhen a student is addicted to smoking, he spends about one to one and a half dollars a day on buying cigarettes.

If we had saved this amount of money in any investment or for the future without spending it unnecessarily during our student life, then the path in life would have been very easy. Do you think smokers care about there future? They don’t care about future investments, all they want is to get money and smoke. Don’t be surprised that some smokers end up selling their investments when they don’t have money to smoke, and they will end up spending all the money on smoking. Some of them do say they don’t know maybe they will be alive to see the future, which you are asking them to invest for, So asking them to invest is just a total waste of time.",
