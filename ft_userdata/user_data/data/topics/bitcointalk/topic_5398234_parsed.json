      "body": "Because there is no need to sign up. There is no KYC unless there is a high risk transaction then which it will be done through a 3rd party provider. This is not a scam this is simply a new business. Please dont make accusations that are not true. Also the funds are always stored in your wallet we do not handle any funds everything is decentralized. Also some exchanges or tokens are not easily accessible to certain people such as BNB. An uniswap or pancake swap can not do ETH to BNB cross chain swaps. Hope that helps.",

It is not. Is it not an instant exchange? A buyer or seller will send coin from there wallet to the address you will provide them which is under your control. For reputed instant exchanges, the coins can be freezed, but for new instant exchange like yours, the coin can be stolen by you. All centralized on the instant exchange owner. It is not decentralized at all, you have the control once anyone send coin to the address provided, a means to freeze or steal the coin and the reason it is centralized.",

      "body": "An that is not true. As in we cannot stop or freeze or steal coins. That is the plus side to this. But the down side is just like any crypto or blockchain related transaction is its irreversible. So if you enter the wrong address then yes your coins will be lost most likely unless there is a return to sender protocol built into whatever coin you are trying to send to ect. There are other similar services and I do understand your concerns but again this is a project and service Ive been working on recently and yes it is new. It will take time to garner trust for sure. I am also in the works of a good press release coming out and syndicating on a bunch of popular news and finance sites as well as other offsite SEO and marketing strategies. I appreciate the feedback.",
