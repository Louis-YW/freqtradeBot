Challege accepted ??No do not scan this url with some stupid scanner  The community will decide whether there is any malware or not. You are trying to post the spam link by me to promote your malware link? I will not do that. Just wait and see the reality. If the community says I am wrong then I am wrong. If the community says you are a scammer then you are the scammer. If the link were valid then they would post that on the forum/website/telegram group/telegram chat but the link u shared not published anywhere.",

I took a risk and click on the link posted by CCMS, also accept to open with the Utopia application. as far as I could see, it really only connected me to one channel on Utopia chat. now I don't see anything critical. neither my browser nor my antivirus alerted me that there was something suspicious.Also, the default domain utopia.im (without /78a01fd4c713514d5e2d7d9678851c22) is redirected to the official https://u.is/en/ Utopia website.",

      "body": "I'll open my post by saying that my statements below are all made on the base of assumption because I can't... won't check my theory to cross the t and dot the i, as I've turned off my laptop and it's quite dreadful for me to turn it back on just to check this theory on my mind. I had to rely on my phone and tablet... which, unfortunately, seems has a very different version from windows, given the screenshot provided by dozens of people on their ANN thread compared to what I see on my screen.So treat this as a draft of my theory which I'll check tomorrow, anyone else is also welcome to weight in this theory, though.So, in spite of --presumably-- different UI for android and windows, their website still say the same things cross platform, where one page said this:Quote from: https://support.u.is/guide[...]Promo ReportDecentralized networks depend on users for stability and performance. As a result, public awareness of Utopia is the key to success. We need your enthusiastic support and will reward your efforts aimed at building a favorable image of Utopia and increasing its user base.Here is what to do:Use message boards, create videos, promote in real life among your friends, or unconventionally approach this. As a general rule, there is no limit to your creativity as long as it is beneficial for Utopia. Please make sure that you understand Utopia before promoting it.You are encouraged to use the advantages of Utopia listed below in your promos:[...]I think, what CCMS tried to achieve is a reward for promotion by inviting a lot of people to their channel, thus the alternative website --to ensure they joined their channel through the link-- the \"Don't have Utopia yet? Install it now!\" and a tempting message that the group is for giveaways, which can only be accessed from \"View in UTOPIA\". Airdrop hunter on this forum who are yet to know Utopia would be tempted to join the channel --and by it, CCMS successfully increasing Utopia user base.If my assumption is correct, I think it's a good strategy, and I'm not judging if it's right or wrong nor knowing if it violate Utopia's rule.As for the malicious warning, as there's only one security vendor flagged it as malicious, I think it's probably a false positive, with the reason of the flag indicated on this picture[tried to reupload with a box to show what I tried to point out, but the image was too blurry, if it's unreadable, it said \"multiple redirect\"]",
