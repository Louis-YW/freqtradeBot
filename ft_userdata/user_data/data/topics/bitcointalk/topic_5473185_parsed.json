  "content": "Calvary Greetings from the Nigeria Local Board to theymos and other dignitaries in the forum. The primary reason for starting this topic is to create sub-boards in the LOCAL BOARD. A local board is created for the forum's users to use their native language. Nigerians have been in the forum for about 8 years, and at first we were all in one thread making comments and creating topics, but as the number of participants increased to a point where the thread became congested, a Local Board was requested, and on January 1st, 2023, the Local Board was created as a surprise package for Nigerians.  And as time passes, the board expands faster, and the population grows by the day. We have spent around 11 months since the creation of the BOARD, and the board is growing quickly, therefore we are requesting theymos to look into the board and create sub-boards so we may split up the discussions accordingly. With over 100+ monthly active posters, the board becomes congested, making it tough to browse through a slew of off-topics and copy-and-paste local news pieces generated by newbies. We are not suggesting that local news is not important, but it should be of general interest rather than personal interest. Because this is a bitcoin discussion topic, all users are required to have a basic understanding of bitcoin. As a result, when child boards are created, other discussions will be on their sub-boards, while bitcoin discussions will be on the board's home page.The Reasons for the RequestCongestion. Too many threads and difficult to navigate through and topics are easily buried.To minimize spams: Since there is no local moderator at the moment, the child board will separate the trash, spamming and unrefined posts from the main board.Requested Sub-boards.Naija Politics & Society: Topics that'll be of interest to bitcoiners in relation to politics and the society in general.  Other Discussions: Other topics that might be of interest to bitcoiners.Off Topic Topics that are not relevant in any of the above will be moved to this place. This list is compiled from last month to this month.Some of the Politics and Society's Threads found in the BoardQuote from: Charles-Tim on November 02, 2023, 02:32:12 PMThreads that are related to Politics and Society boardWoman sells her child to repay loanSubsidy removal and all you need to knowBicycle fit be the game changerFG plans to give 8K to poor households.Fuel @618/litre: How Nigeria want take surviveFuel Price do move 4rm ₦537 To ₦617 for one LitreYouths Becoming Reluctant to MarryTinubu's comment on 25% in FCT call for serious concern.The country no de move forwardPresident Tinubu, shakes the entire security sector.CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, suspended!!The future of our children, a concern in a demoralized societyI have just seen this now: Who is to be blamed ?

I can actually attest to the fact that navigating through the local board can be challenging most times considering the way topics and discussions are arranged in the Nigerian local  board. If we have sub-boards, it will really help in organising discussions and accessing information. For a board that is less that a year, the growth noteworthy and should be supported as a way of pushing Bitcoin penetration and the spread of this amazing technology, of which Nigeira is playing a key role. We appreciate the efforts of those who do make it time to check on the Naija local board and also support in many immeasurable ways. We do not take likely, the support of Hugeblack, EFS amongst others. Approval of a few merit sources will also help encourage quality posters to do more to keep the board going. While we hope this request will be considered, it is important to note that we appreciate having a local board in a forum like this.",

If there is a moderator moderating that board, he will not be able to delete many of the posts which some people see as spam, because many are not spam but belonging to off-topic board. Unless the moderator just want to be harsh. It is worth mentioning that moderators have fast response to the posts that I have been reporting on the board.",

      "body": "Thank you Agbe for bringing this up, i see naija local board increasing in activities ever since the approval of the local board, now it's unto the next phase to help see the local board going well organized by how it members post on the board, I've also seen two or more cases of postings that are not perfectly on topic which some of the members take advantage of the unavailability of the sub board to post anyhow topic, now when there's three to five sub boards under the local board, each thread will finds its appropriate board it is well fitted in, else other contrary threads will be moved to off topic because they are not fit in anywhere.If this request is granted, i see it to be one of the means to reduce spamming and off topic threads created indescriminately by some members, this will also encourage for more quality post when each aspect of discussion is having a designated board expected to have all related discussions, it will also be easier to locate any off topic or low quality post to be reported to the moderator if any is found.Lastly, thanks to Hugeblack who had made it a commitment in identifying unmerited quality posts from local boards, this is one of the reasons we also hope that the two local board merit source applications be considered to help encourage other quality posters and also compliment cryptopreneurbrainboss who is the only merit source, while his own monthly allocations too can increase, thanks to all other active naija local board bitcointalk members for the good works on the local board and for bringing this initiative to request for sub boards.GoodLuck all the way.",

Both quality posters and non-quality posters are on the board, so I understand the whole concept of what @Agbe is trying to conclude and, as for me, I do say the same thing as he has already said earlier.Our local board should have a moderator and also a sub-board where the local board moderator can move or arrange every topic to the specific board it is supposed to be (if any users fail to post it where it is supposed to be). It will also help to reduce the rate of spammers and non-quality posts on the board. I can conclude that one of the reasons why many other users (i.e) merit source and all the rest of them normally visit the Nigerian local board is because we have a lot of active and quality posters but what we don't have is a moderator and more merit source.",

There is no free spam zone anywhere on the forum, and BTW, more than 70% of the local use pidgin to communicate, making it difficult for non-pidgin speaking moderators to function successfully. A child board is required to assist in navigating and organising the board for easy reading. We also need a local moderator, which I've discussed with thyemos in the past, and I believe we'll have one when the time comes.",

In the end, it will be easier for you to discuss if your board is spam-free.I beg to disagree. While global mods can still delete spam (having their onw local mod would be of course better), not having separate child boards is imho more important and should be priority. Imagine if on our local board we don't have child boards and instead everything is crammed in one and if it was 10x as active. Regarding them getting their own local moderator, it mainly depends on the amount of spam they have there so unless its a real problem, chances of them getting one are not good. While I am glad to see that you started request topic, choice of child boards seem kinda strange to me. Wouldn't it make more sense to put off topic and politics&society into one child board, while asking for some other boards like \"altcoins\" (once bull market start you can expect increase of intresest in those, or maybe even marketplace if there's enough interest.Anyway, I hope that you get new child boards as soon as possible since you are one of the most active local boards and you are in a real need for at least a few.",

It has been noticed that newbies from Nigeria are increasing everyday and most of them come first to identify themselves in the local board, by creating topics that are not bitcoin related since they are newbies and love posting more than reading. This has made the board to have numerous topics that are scattered all over the board. A sub-board will help us comb this, as topics will be posted base on where it falls into. For OP, to write this, it has become something that is giving us a lot of headache, because Nigerians are people that don't like to complain no matter the situation that we are passing through, because our government have made us strong to adapt to things the way they are.

All moderators in Bitcointalk can use English well and all of them can do this.I think it's a great idea to get local moderators to moderate the board. Despite that the board uses English language as a language, it also uses what we call the Pidgin English. Pidgin English is a lingua franca that is a mixture between English language and other African languages. Pidgin is widely spoken in Africa and every country in the continent has its peculiar style of speaking in Pidgin. For instance, the style in which a Nigerian speak Pidgin English is different from Ghana or Cameroon despite their closeness in borders.Nigerian Pidgin is blend with other major indigenous tribes in the country such as Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo. So, most at times, it takes an indigenous speaker to understand the conversation between them and communicate. Likewise, it will take a local moderator to be able to effectively monitor the conversations in the board as well as sort the threads in the proposed child boards.An English moderator is not a bad idea but for a more effective moderation of the board, you need a local or native moderator.",
