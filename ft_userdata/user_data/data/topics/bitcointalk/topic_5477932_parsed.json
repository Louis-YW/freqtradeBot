      "body": "When you don't have much to contribute or add to others, most times just asking the right question can genuinely earn someone merit that they never expected. Earning merit is as simple as that. One thing is that you can either be a problem solver for others or provide solutions to those who are in need of answers, and if they find your answer interesting and educational, then there is a higher chance that you will be rewarded with merit for your effort. You can also earn merit by just asking questions, which can help others understand things better too.",

I'm assuming it's linked to the quality/usefulness of your posts/replies? Their originality maybe? What are usually the subjects you'd get the more merit for posting about?You can't force nature, merit is nature. It's about people who are finding your posts useful, constructive, or a good contribution to the forum in some way. You can't force this and you will find that you will earn less merit, make less quality posts and hurt your reputation if you intentionally are posting/looking for merit.Here are some tips: Make constructive and informative posts that others have not yet made in the thread. If you are active, you will generally have more chances of providing original and constructive posts before other members. Naturally participate in the forum - join conversations where you can contribute any form of value (knowledge, questions, social value) - There's no point trying to force yourself to provide value. If you can't, learn from other posts instead. Be a good member - don't unnecessarily insult others, have good posting etiquette (grammar, use of bbcode, etc) and try to avoid drama - as a new member, it's probably best to keep your grievances with another member to yourself, there are a lot of children with power here and they will not hesitate to make your forum life less enjoyable and may even succeed in hurting four reputation. If you ever find yourself targeted, DM me and if you are right, I will happily bat on your side.Good luck on your forum journey",

Welcome to the forum I hope you'll learn a lot from this forum.Quote from: ltcltcltc on December 14, 2023, 08:30:44 PMWhat's all about this merit count?It's the number of merits that you get and which people can see on your profile. The number of merits you get for your posts = merit count.Quote from: ltcltcltc on December 14, 2023, 08:30:44 PMHow is it earned?It's sent to you by those users who have sMerits and they send those sMerits to users who make good and informative posts and also to those members who regularly contribute to the forum.Quote from: ltcltcltc on December 14, 2023, 08:30:44 PMI'm assuming it's linked to the quality/usefulness of your posts/replies?Yeah, when someone posts high-quality stuff that contain valuable information then other users send merits to those posts which are somehow helpful for the community. If you make good posts then you'll get merits from all those members who appreciate your work. The better posts you make the more merits you earn. I suggest you to avoid thinking about merits as a newbie and focus on making good quality posts. Try to help others with your posts and then you'll see the merits flowing like air to you. Don't beg for merits as that's not needed at all because if you make good posts then there are so many generous people on this forum who will send you merits.",

Also you can equally go through the profiles of high ranking members with lots of merit to see how they engage in the forum, the kind of posts they Make, the type of threads they create and boards that they engage in then you might find out to earn merits. The only advice is do not force it, because once you force it you might easily break a rule or two.",
