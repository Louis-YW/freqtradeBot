You need strategies to make sure that you do not have loss in trading than profit. Your analysis can not always be correct. I will like to ask. What is smart money? I do not think this is related to trading",

From what you actually mean, I can say smart money are only used by the whales to generates more income fastly, is that true?",

It helps identify support/resistance levels and improves risk management, and helps guide your trading decisions. It has limitations, however, like being susceptible to market manipulation. To truly thrive, combine TA with other methods like fundamental and sentiment analysis.If you have any questions you can contact me via my Discord: https://discord.gg/2TFSrzunK3",

No wonder, you are still new in the market trading, you need more experience if you would stop listening to people so as not to misguide you. As a matter of fact, I have never seen a better and more powerful way to know the trend of the market than the technical analysis and what the sentimental analysis and fundamental analysis can't do, it would do it successfully and even easily. It has been the best light on my trading path and without it, I don't think I can trade this long as my trading system centres on it having tried all possible means of trading. My advice is that you learn about it more and train what you learn about it for your own good.You can learn the price action, Fibonacci and trendline among others, and avoid much of the indicator's trouble and deception. And if you learn them diligently and understand them as well, you will never have issues with your trading anymore, I am sure of that, and it will make your trading management easier for you. By the way, those who are talking about \"Smartmoney\" are only enjoying the excitement of the moment, you will see all of them shutting up their mouths when this obvious bullish season is over. This is where you are multiple times better than them as your time in trading does not have a season. You profit all the time if you fully understand your chart reading.",

Or smart money just a concept that cannot possibly work in the market,As far as I know and what I have done, crypto trading using data Technical analysis is historically important where analyzing market movements looking at charts and other guides that identify patterns and trends in the direction of the type of crypto we want to trade is the thing for meneeds to be looked at carefully.Maybe with the current conditions of the crypto market, speculatively it is a little difficult to rely on technical analysis, because it does not match the price patterns and trends that are seen, Maybe with the current crypto market conditions, measuring crypto performance is difficult to determine future prices, where you can see that currently it is up 1% in the next hour, down 2%, this is a bad sign, I think the crypto trading method in the form of technical analysis is not suitable for now, wait for crypto prices in the market to stabilize, maybe the technical analysis method is suitable.",

QuoteThe populace perceives that smart money is invested by those with a fuller understanding of the market or information that a regular investor cannot access. As such, the smart money is considered to have a much better chance of success when the trading patterns of institutional investors diverge from retail investors.This is from  Investopedia  the page you most likely copied your definition from. Now the only difference between those big investors and the retail investors is that the big investors have more information or understanding of the market. Every investment decision they make has been analyzed properly It doesn't mean those institutions don't do technical analysis, they do but with more knowledge.",

Also they think that technical analysis is not working because it's very old.So basically your are pertaining on calling that smart money is into that kind of sending out your funds and letting other people do handle those funds instead for yourself on making up those trades and other investment decisions? Is this something that you would really be that willing to do so or not? Going back into the first thing that you had said about relevance of technical analysis. Yes, this is something which is really that relevant.We cant really be having a market to have that only on having that kind of news from time to time on which you cant really make use of FA and this is where TA would really be that setting in.You cant really just make out those trading positions without any basis because you are really just that basically doing gambling in the first place.Also if you do really make mention about smart money, then its up to your own choice. If you do really trust them up on making a hold of your finances or investmentand making up some trades for you then its impossible that you wont really be able to know or been wary about the risks involved into this one.",

Yes, as the market changes, we also have to level up our market strategies for some of them are obsolete already. We have to adapt to the situation and never stop learning because this is the only we will survive from trading.

Or smart money just a concept that cannot possibly work in the market,What do you mean first in \"smart money\"? You didn't give the context or meaning of it, and you are saying that it's more reliable than technical analysis? Even if you are learning about technical analysis without enough execution or experience you will never see its worth, you are saying that technical analysis is not reliable but in fact this method is being used by many traders as it could give them insights on what will be the possible movement of the market, although technical analysis is not 100% accurate because in trading there will be no a 100% as the market is unpredictable, still with the use of technical analysis it could give you what will be your next move, where to position or where to do your trade, if you think that technical analysis is not useful then so be it tey using your \"smart money\" method then come back here to say what is your experience, you are still new to trading so its still early for you to say that technical analysis is not useful for earning in trading that is the common problem with the newbies in trading.",

But if we pay close attention on the ongoing movement of the market for sure we can figure out its possible movement. That's why before doing traded a proper analysis is really needed and we need those charts to see the price history of the token and possibly find the best position we can enter especially if we do day trades. To loss on trades is really possible since after all market still unpredictable that's why at least we use our brains to analyze since it can give us more better chance to earn some profits rather than using nothing since it will just ruin our day because for sure we have more huge chance to lose by randomly picking up some situation to trade.",
