      "body": "Thanks for replying lads...now I know my fate!!! Can't work out why Casissus bitcoins can make 3x at auction ie a 1btc funded and mine is close to scrap but eventually I will....emailed that crypto author Elias Ahonen a while back....he said same..close to scrap...jusr needed a second opinion off the experts....will hang on to it....603 Bitcoin showing on Denarium database but they're not updating it if a coin is scrapped Thanks",

But you're the experts...don't really follow cryptocurrency....it certainly wouldn't be worth what I thought it was worth after reading some of the forum posts....but I'll keep it; hopefully for long term...maybe if some of them were auctioned publicly like the Cassucus ones might be worth a little more than peel value ...also didn't know you could buy factory funded crypto items....best of luck in the Cryptocurrency World....",

Casascius is the original bitcoin and will most likely always bring a higher premium. I have never had a issue with Denarium. It might be a little slower right now because we are in a bear market.",
