  "content": "Nigeria is a country colonized by the British which later got its independence ,nigeria is made of 3 major tribes ,the hausa's ,the yorubas and the igbo's ,but the hausa dominated nigeria and has been known to be the most populated tribe amongst this three tribes yet the uneducated and underprivileged for their lack of education,The hausa tribes have been in power ruling the country for almost centuries and believe that they are born to rule and born leaders yet depriving other tribes from attaining this positions due to their strenght in population and always ready to fight till the end, 60% of people who claims to be hausa are not from nigeria but from the neighbouring countries but they share amost the same language ,belief and tradition, it is very hard to differentiate an hausa man from a foreigner ,this foreigners have dominated every part of this hausa land and has a means of identification from the country illegally.This tribes is basically seating on almost every powerful and important position where decision are been made and they determine how the country is been runned and who will rule .90% of the hausa's belong to a religion ,belief and tradition which almost see it as crime for female child to be educated because they believe the female child belong to the kitchen .It is yet another election in the corner after being rules by this tribe for years, they are still planning to retain the positions while the igbo tribes are clamouring for breaking up so they can stand on there own since it has been said that the igbo tribe will never rule the country and 80% of the countries wealth comes from the igbo land and the yoruba's are productive people who believes in peace and are ready to play along with any one in as much as they are being tagged along...Kindly feel free to drop your opinion on this discussion?",

      "body": "If you see it is very unfair for the Igbo tribe to maintain a government like this because as you said that 80% of the countries wealth comes from the Igbo land and it should be for them to be able to join and become the majority in the government and have full power over their own land. Sometimes it takes war to be able to determine who is the strongest and deserves to be the ruler.",

Sometimes it takes war to be able to determine who is the strongest and deserves to be the ruler.War is not the answer to this situation, from my own impression it will only damage a lot of things and waste a lot of life.If the other part of tribes believe they are been cheated on, they can take the issue to the British and file for separation instead of waging war.Having said that, I think there's something fishy though because according to Wikipedia I check the list of Nigerian presidents ever since the country gains democracy.The tribe thats president are as below1) Chief Olusegun Obasanjo (Yoruba)2) Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar'Adua (Hausa)3) Dr. Goodluck Jonathan (Igbo)4) Muhammadu Buhari (Hausa)Therefore, the people of Nigeria can only claim such tribes have been in power ruling the country for almost centuries if Hausa is elected as the next President.",

      "body": "War is not the answer Hehehehe, you think so huh ? War as you've said will lead too loss of lives and properties which will prolly take longer periods ( year's to build up)I have heard stories of the Biafran war, and I wouldn't want to witness another as it's unwise! We're bigger than that now, but the igbo's have them selfish desires, which I wouldn't want the Niger Delta region to be part of! They can do better than this, fed up with talks about this as the problems regarding Nigeria is tiring and Fvcked!!3) Dr. Goodluck Jonathan (Igbo)Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is not from Igbo, but from Bayelsa state (Niger Delta) he took over from as Governor after the late Governor was prisoned for some bad acts. Also succeeded the late president Ya radua ! (Rip) as he would have been the best president in Nigeria.Division, Religion has been major drawback in uniting African's,not just Nigerians, they'll be unstoppable when they realize they need each other's back!",

      "body": "The Igbos are the one's been marginalized since the creation of Nigeria as a country. When it comes to practising one Nigeria, they are the ones that practice it most. They will leave their comfort zone state, to another state where they have no relation, just to strive or do business. Upon that, the Hausa and Yorubas don't know an Igbo man to rule over them.As the war didn't happen in the 2015 general election during Goodluck Jonathan's regime, I don't think it will ever gonna happen. The foundation of the country called ''Nigeria'' is in God's hands cause it's long gone",

      "body": "What makes things more difficult in Nigeria right now is this division. If this division by tribes do not get fixed, forget about other problems, there will never be real progress. This is because each tribe would most likely strive to be better than the other rather than support the other even when ot becomes detrimental for everyone. Another problem would be culture and tradition. Yes, tradition and culture are important and should be preserved but people should also consider whether it is detrimental for everyone or not. Just because it is what everyone has gotten used to, doesn't mean it is right. Everyone must learn to adopt to the changing times if progress and survival is the goal. - a little thought I have.",
