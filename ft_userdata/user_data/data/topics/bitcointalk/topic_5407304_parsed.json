      "body": "were you able to see shared pictures? I also attached the other elements of the system in the album. I use a Hiveos system.My system, 1 antminer s9 (2 hash board low profile) and 5 antminer L3+ miner (normal mod). The consumption of the farm is 3.577 KW/h.The heat energy produced by the farm is 357 kw. (Calculation is simple: 3.577 KW/h electricity = 357 kw heat energy) The system contains 210 liters of transformer oil. The power supplies are located separately. Only the hash boards and the control board are in the oil. I placed the machines vertically in a barrel.https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOkxPgyVHBzTStVsNn5BAMt2GCcS-Wtbeu3xCOknYuWBJjVimalxby7tN3hd65pcQ?key=YzRyVmUzTVhXaEMxbWt5UzUzclNzaFR0SUtTeHZn",

You will have a lot more hot water.Hot water + volcanic sulphur = onsen.Onsen are a very good to health and skin.Search the internet and you'll see that in japan they have packets, sachets of those powders, they are for home or travel use so that you can put them in your bath tub.Now if you can source those locally and make onsen baths, that is from home/personal use to business.You'll earn from mining and you'll earn from onsen.If onsens make you $$$$ you won't have to worry about bear markets.",
