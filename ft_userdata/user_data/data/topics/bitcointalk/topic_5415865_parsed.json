Cause when I was little, I want to my neighbors that have Pentium 4 at that time, when we were playing GTA vice city, GTA San Andreas and also TEKKEN 3. These were our lives. Though now I got my gaming PC That have following Specifications that are described below as follows.  • Processor: Intel i9-12900k• Graphics: RTX 3090• Memory: 32GB RAM DDR5 4800 MHz• Storage: 2TB Samsung NVME 2.0• Wireless: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0 I know I cannot upload pictures of my PC but will do when I might become member or so. So now I have been gotten Into cryptocurrency. And I think it's time to move on. Cause I think I should mine that currency that are worth money. But I also know that GPU mining sucks and that is not got thing. So if any members have secret coins than they can suggest me what to do.",
