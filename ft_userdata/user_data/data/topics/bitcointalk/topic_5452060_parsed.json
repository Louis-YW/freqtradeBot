Or is it an economic process?Well, health care is always been a lucrative industry whether there's covid or none. The industry has always been too active and huge sums of money coming in.Look at how it's managed because of the pensioners that always need to get some check up and their health care needs. And it's possible to have another pandemic but hopefully none will come again until our lifetime.They've said that these health emergencies are always been attached to economy. You see that when there's hit even it's an endemic, too many businesses are halted for their operations.",

Not necessarily but it's still a major threat that has not gone away. It might be in a year, it might be in 50, but it will likely happen again because viruses and bacteria are always evolving as they pass through different bodies. They learn, adapt and overcome as they try to simply survive or even increase their infectability. The climate is also changing which could mean that some viruses that previously did not transfer well could start to exist in new environments. The interconnectedness of the world today means that it can spread on a scale never seen before.",

Or is it an economic process?The healthcare industry is always an ever-thriving industry. Not just because of covid but because humans exist. Also, there is always a possibility for a new pandemic etc., since like humans, viruses and bacteria also have the capability to adapt and evolve. The scale though, that will depend partly on the severity of the disease, the ability of the leaders to learn from past experiences and the way they use the knowledge acquired from those experiences to formulate new protocols that would make the containment of the disease fast and efficient while being as humane as possible or at least making it seem that way in the eyes of the masses to prevent panic, ensure cooperation and maintain order.",

Or is it an economic process?I don't think what's happening lately is anything related to health, because bank crashes and network slowdowns due to piling up transactions are very natural things, but I once thought that bank crashes were due to attacks that they weren't aware of, so it can cause destruction, but when it comes to other things like health and measles, I don't think that's a new attack to slow down the world economy. Because covid is a very different thing from a thousand kinds of things before, so I will never compare covid with other things like what is happening at the moment, but if you have found some indicators that are very consistent with reality, I think you also need to express them here so that everyone can know clearly about what you mean.",

In similar ways to how COVID mutated (or bioengineered?) during late 2020, one can never be sure what is next up in the line. Soon there will be a team of scientists getting deployed for the bioweapons creations by metro countries. They have learned how the entire supply chain can be halted with such bioweapons. How they can prepare themselves in well advance with anti-virus and then go for the \"final\" plan. I am not saying this is the only possibility but yeah natural occurrences of the same pandemic is highly possible now. Gen Alpha is not as strong as millennials or before generation. They already have weak spots in their DNA and it will weaken more in the years to come. It's a health hazard but it will affect the industries, monetary system, infrastructures, and healthy running of the nation for sure.",

Or is it an economic process?@Yanalli adding a source to the claim that there are indicators that a new pandemic is coming would have been great.Most pharmaceutical firms are owned or connected to the government, so they can be used as a political and economic tool. The discovery and production of the Covid-19 vaccine became a competition between world powers. I began to suspect that the virus was not intentionally developed to pursue political influence. Developing Covid vaccine became a source of national pride and global influence that nations openly celebrated their breakthroughs. This competition for influence is far from over, so we should expect more dreaded diseases. The sales or transfer of protective devices, human resources, and the vaccine became a big-time business for many nations. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer,  BioNTech, and Moderna made so much profit from Covid vaccine. Greed might always make them device more means of making more money.",

Also, since the people are aware that a possible pandemic might happen again in the future and they know what it could bring (lockdowns, quarantines, etc.), they’ll be more smarter now and probably resist those things before it can even happen. It will take a new engineered virus (hopefully not fungi) to take the world by storm again. When the ones who hold such power deem it necessary to do another reset, that’s when all of these will happen once more - but not right now that’s for sure.",

Or is it an economic process?1.I believe that this topic should be moved to another forum. This is not a healthcare forum, this is the Economics forum. 2.Yes, a new pandemic is imminent. We live in a globalized world and the people could travel and spread viruses across continents.The real question is when the new virus will strike and how deadly will it be. Another problem is the mass usage of antibiotics, which makes many viruses and bacteria resilient to such medication.3. How can a pandemic be an \"economic process\"? Can you elaborate more on this theory? I think that it is pretty clear that COVID virus was artificially created in a laboratory, perhaps a new artificially created virus will be \"released\" after a while. The \"big pharma\" companies want to make more money, but I don't think that they would create another pandemic just for the sake of making bigger profits.",

It is a matter of being prepared enough to deal with the consequences and try to save as many lifes as possible. On the other hand, I would also like to mention that people being highly skeptical towards vaccination does not help to curve already preventable diseases. I recall reading that in the United States there have been some surging cases of polio, which should not be happening, as the vaccine is available...The pandemic was supposed to teach governments of the world one thing or two about healthcare expending, but that would be just wishful thinking from my part.",

Or is it an economic process?WHO seems to have declared that the Covid Pandemic is over. But I wonder if there are many people in other countries who are starting to get sick easily? So if someone usually gets the flu once a year, now even every 4 months people get the flu easily. The point is people's immune system nowadays seems to have decreased.For each individual, of course, this will affect their work. Because they become more often take time off work because of illness. I personally can be said to be a person who rarely gets sick. but I see many of my co-workers are sick. and this is certainly another obstacle that arises in the current job.",

Or is it an economic process?There is no certainty that the Covid-19 pandemic is completely over. We have heard that pandemic usually occur every 50 or 100 years. Although there is no scientific explanation for this. But impacts on the natural environment such as deforestation can cause major changes in the world. Moreover, climate change can seriously disrupt human health with altered forms of viruses and bacteria. The world population is increasing and new diseases are emerging. Common people will have nothing to do but raise awareness and make the environment conducive to avoid the imminent pandemic.",
