We are at a bitcoin forum where financial matters are discussed and thus anonymity is tightly tied with security.Another side is that in some countries this forum is banned by authorities and it is impossible to visit it without Tor or VPN.

Would really appreciate it.There is no special guide on how to use TOR on this forum or anywhere else, it is a browser like any other, with the difference that by using such a browser you get a certain amount of privacy. Some will say that it is much easier for them to use a VPN, but that is only because they have never even tried TOR - which is not a problem if they have an attitude like yours. Most people generally have no need to protect their privacy, and if you do something very bad, even with the use of TOR, there is a high probability that you will be located by those who have the resources for such things.You can read more on this link -> About Tor Browser",

Yeah having privacy is important, I don't deny it. But for some people, they just don't care. I don't know on which basis, the tbct_mt2 is saying that Satoshi always uses tor. However using Tor for BTT does not make anyone abnormal or normal. Instead many members above already said that people prefer Tor for privacy purposes. As we all know this forum uses cloud flare and cloud flares have the ability to track anyone using it. This means people can be tracked using their IPs as IPs are saved on Cloud Flare. So just to remain anonymous people prefer to use TOR but honestly, I don't think TOR is enough, and secondly, we face a lot of problems while using BTT on TOR. I lastly read a topic about TOR in which people were facing issues using TOR. And after reading that thread I got to know the importance of TOR and gave it a try but on my side, the Captcha loop started. (I think the topic from which I was motivated was also facing the same issue, Actually, I tried TOR after some time of reading that thread). TBH, a lot of people care about anonymity and they really use TOR and they don't use free VPNs as in one of your posts you asked what if the same IPs are allocated to a VPN user and that IP could be blacklisted. I say to avoid that, you should use a paid VPN. This problem is common. As, I also read a topic in which a user was totally new to BTT but his IP got blacklisted and he asked why he was BL and many users said, he might be using the internet from a service provider from which another BTT member might be taking the internet. As, when this happened, sometimes the IP address remains the same but for local area network provider.",
