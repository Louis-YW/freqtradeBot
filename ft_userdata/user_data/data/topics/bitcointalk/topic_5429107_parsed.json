  "content": "How to break into Fiat medium of payment monopoly?In any commerce transaction, the buyer typically has more power than the seller. If a seller is unable to offer the payment method that the buyer prefers, they may lose the sale, especially if they are selling a commodity product or service. To prevent this from happening, sellers often offer a range of payment options, including traditional methods such as ACH, credit card, debit card, and wire transfer.Credit card payment is considered to be one of the most successful financial products in history. It has established a business model that is acceptable to both buyers and sellers. Sellers have factored in the cost of processing credit card payments, including interchange fees and the cost of chargebacks, as part of their overall cost structure. Buyers, meanwhile, have become accustomed to the rewards points and chargeback capabilities of credit cards.Over the past 50 years, the credit card payment system has become so well-established that it is difficult for new payment methods to compete with it. For a payment system like the Bitcoin lightning network to successfully compete with credit cards, it would need to offer an even better business model for both buyers and sellers.One possible business model for the Bitcoin lightning network could involve merchant service providers charging sellers the same interchange fees as traditional credit card systems (around 2.8% of the transaction value). These providers could then share a portion of these fees (for example 230 basis points) with Bitcoin lightning wallets. The wallets could offer buyers a 2% cashback on their purchases, funded by the fees collected from merchants. The wallets could keep a small commission (30 basis points) for themselves, and use the remaining 200 basis points to fund the cashback for buyers.This cashback incentive could be an attractive reason for buyers to switch to the Bitcoin lightning network for their payment needs. The wallets could use their commission fees to support customer acquisition and manage chargebacks. The merchant service providers, meanwhile, could keep a small portion of the interchange fees (50 basis points) to cover their costs related to integrating POS endpoints and acquiring training and supporting merchants.To make this business model work effectively, merchant service providers and wallet providers would need to work closely together. They could potentially form a non-profit organization to help develop, implement, and manage operational processes and best practices for the Bitcoin lightning network.Please provide feedback on the above. It is practical, does it make sense?",

      "body": "The UK made a system like this illegal for credit and debit cards recently (with decent reasons imo). Companies used to be able to charge a flat fee whenever anyone used a card over using cash, it meant a 2% fee the business would have been paying turned into a 10-20% fee for the consumer.Offering and advertising a discount is probably better than offing cashback but it works about the same way. Bitcoin has more protections for the seller than credit cards do (less risk of charge backs that cost the seller).I think this thread has popped up quite a bit before if you fancy searching for other times it's been discussed, you might also find places that offer discounts for buying things in btc.",

      "body": "What you are asking for is already being done, we only need more competition to reduce the dominance of fiat while more initiatives are going on in this regard. However, as fiat payment is stable and more reliable than crypto payment in value, this is not a task that would be most appreciated because BTC for example will always fluctuate in favour or against the holders, and the non-reliability of it might cost the holders and companies dealing with it. So there is no way disparity will not set in, hence the preference for fiat in this regard.And this would always cause extra fees on the path of the companies handling payment. Mind you, nothing like a non-profit arrangement when it comes to money and payments like this, no party would agree to that.",

(they all hit accept at the same time)and then.. realising the system only really works high % of the time for coffee and about 30% of the time for a weekly grocery shop.. you soon learn its not really a effective payment system. and thats before getting into all the drawbacks of the flaws and bugs where your value can become nothing/liquidity available used up without you realising..there is a good reason why blockchain currencies of the 2009+ were invented, as oppose to the silly smart contract networks of the 90's-00's(lightning payments(onion packets) use old tech. not new tech)Quote from: avikz on December 16, 2022, 05:35:02 AMThe only answer to this is - user convenience!

Unless cryptocurrency can provide a similar kind of user experience and convenience, it's impossible to break into fiat monopoly! Otherwise it will remain as an investment! agree, fullyand to add to thisthe two aspects are. the currency thats common and the platforms of that currency that are commonEG once having a venmo/paypal account they were easier and better than the silly chip and pin debit card option. but visa, then upgraded where you can 'upload' your card data to your phone and use qr code/tap and pay to compete against 'mobile payments'as for the currency. breaking fiat where crypto is common requires legal tender status (changing tax, minimum wage, court penalty, victim compensation laws, debt value laws) where by other currencies can be used as the main payment currency required/measuredso without a legal tender status of paying options for bills and taxes and wages. a crypto currency wont become a common utility for every day use of peoples full lifestylesthus would require alot of better conveniences, benefits of use to get people to use crypto for full lifestyle payments that both benefit all the merchants/employers and the customers/employeeswhere by a easier to use app also comes into play to make it desired to use this alternative currency to fiat.. as for wanting to just \"break fiat\"wel that can be done. instead of exchange market a crypto to a rate of fiat.exchange rate it to a rate of say \"minimum wage\" where by the crypto in the Us is $10. but that same unit crypto sells for $0.30 in africa. then sit back and watch arbitrage raid the FOREX market to spin the cycle of trade from US-africa-crypto-us.. repeat and truly disrupt the forex rates of fiat as people take advantage of the new crypto exchange rate mechanism.... but that wont happen. its just a pipe dream to crash fiat forex markets. as nations see that as a national security attack and such exchanges would get removed from the internet quick",

Simply build Circular or Interdependent Economy within the Bitcoin space by supporting & grooming independent businesses and people to create products and services they will exchange for Bitcoin, and possibly fiat/stablecoin acting as alternative currency within its economy. I actually do not fancy the idea of crypto trying to reap where it didn't not sow by stealing or leeching customers off fiats. The relationship should be mutual or Bitcoin should completely create it's own Nation with Citizens that mainly depend on it for transactions in its economy like fiat currencies of other Nations do.. I think survival products and services like Mobile homes, foods, gadgets etc will do great in such economy. Let's stop pretending all is well  and start using Bitcoin for its true purpose : an alternative to survive a failing system. This is a great opportunity for truly decentralized and independent systems like Bitcoin to build a thriving economy by attracting people within its system to create products and services and exchange for it native currency.",

      "body": "Based on the results of my survey of 200 merchants, it appears that the primary motivators for integrating new payment methods are customer demand and transaction cost savings. A large number of merchants (132) cited customer demand as their primary motivator, while a significant number (62) cited both customer demand and cost as factors in their decision. A small number of merchants (6) cited transaction cost savings as their primary motivator. No merchants indicated that they wanted to earn and save in Bitcoin.One issue with the 6 merchants who are only cost-focused is that they may not realize cost savings if their buyers are not using a BTC lightning wallet to pay. A large portion of merchants are payment method agnostic and will integrate whatever payment method their customers prefer, unless it increases their already-factored-in cost for payment methods in their business model.Given these findings, my proposal is to charge merchants at the same rate as fiat charges, but reward buyers with hefty kickbacks. This way, merchants will not be deterred by additional costs, and buyers will have an incentive to use the new payment method.",

It is practical, does it make sense?This sounds very nice and would be awesome if we could implement it in todays world. It would be so much more efficient to have a decentralised payment system that works directly between the buyer and the seller, without the banks sitting in between all the transaction. First of all consumers could cut down on the huge credit card fees. Just imagine how much money would remain in the pockets of consumers, if there were no more credit cards. This is the most lucrative business of banks and they will likely fight hard through lobbying parties to try and stop and removal of the payment monopoly. Another huge saving factor would be on all the bank fees that consumers have to pay on top of the credit card fees. With a decentralised payment system in place we could save a lot of money, but this is also increasing the chance of people not paying their taxes. I think that politcians are too afraid to give up the payment monopoly. Without they can’t enforce easily that all the taxes are being paid directly to the government. We would need some form of oversight that ensure that there is no misuse of funds. So the system would be very practical, just hard to get it rolled out across a whole country, if politcians are trying to sabotage it.",

It's also important to consider the regulatory environment and any potential compliance issues that might arise.Another factor to consider is the overall usability and user experience of the lightning network.
