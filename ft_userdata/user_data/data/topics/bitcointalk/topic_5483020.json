The impact of the dump by Grayscale was slightly felt with the price of Bitcoin dropping significantly. But we have seen some signs of recovery with the price moving to $41k. I doubt if the proposed sale by the US government of about 2,934 BTC ($118 million) of Silk Road Bitcoin would have much impact. Even if there is any effect, the price will still recover within a few days. Thus I totally agree with Steven Lubka that this auction is peanut and I think this news shouldn't give rise to FUD.",

The impact of the dump by Grayscale was slightly felt with the price of Bitcoin dropping significantly. The outflow from Grayscale doesn't mean people sold their cash for coins and just went spending fiat never looking back, also this scenario would ignore the inflow from other ETF which would have tuned the balance positive for the first week, the total balance has dropped just in the last few days.Also, the sum is closer to 2.5 billion if we consider only GrayscaleQuote revealed that Grayscale’s ETF has lost more than 95,600 BTC since January 11, when it went live on national securities exchanges",

It's impact will not be significant as compare to the Gray Scale but it will surely cause some fear in the minds of the investors.I think US government is taking some smart decisions to sell off their Bitcoin holdings and they may continue selling their Bitcoin holdings in small quantities during this bull run. I hope that the decisions that they take may not impact Bitcoin and its value in a inverse way.Although, they can sell off the seized coins within days but they don't really want to dump the market as that won't be a good decision by them. If the market gets a huge dump then they will sell their Bitcoin at loss and that's why they won't do that.",

Much of the $2+ billion of bitcoin has been sold by Grayscale was not moved backed into other ETFs. I'm sure some of it was, but most of it wasn't. FTX alone accounted for over a billion dollars of the Grayscale exodus, and none of that was moved back into ETFs, and no doubt of the other billion of so of the Grayscale dump some of it also wasn't simply moved back into other ETFs. So yeah, the amount that the US govt is planning to sell is less than 10% of the net bitcoin selling from Grayscale recently.",

Anyway, this is just a small piece of news but is being hyped as a serious matter. The calculation has shown the whole scale without the need to panic, even though I am not a long/short person in the market but I know it is also an opportunity/risk for those who participate.",

You are underestimating this market and overestimating the US government. In the past 10 days since the ETFs were approved, Grayscale and FTX have taken turns selling billions of dollars worth of bitcoin to the market, but that only caused bitcoin to drop to $38k. Meanwhile, the US government holds just over $118 million worth of bitcoin, which is unlikely to cause more selling pressure than Grayscale has done in recent days.Personally, I think there will be no impact on the market and no one cares about this.",

The price dropped from $48k to less than $39k over the course of almost two weeks, so almost by 20%. But it's already around $42k, so around it's currently down by around 13% from the pre-sale price. That's the kind of power a strong organization and billions of dollars currently have on the price. Somewhat significant, but also very temporary.
