  "content": "I would like to devote this thread for thoughts about sustainability, broadly and specifically. Bitcoin has come a long way in the last 13 years, and we're likely still on the beginning of something powerful. I think that as time goes by, and most of us are united and consented on the current protocol rules, Bitcoin won't stop thriving in the market. A lot of users believe that the main source of failure in the long run, is network sustainability. Lately, I've been trying to imagine how would a so succeeded network come into such dead end. I have come to the conclusion that the network's sustainability is impossible to predict in the current phase. There are just too many parameters to take into account. What will the price of bitcoin be in decades ahead, what levels of security are considered sufficient, what kind of layers we'll have by then, what other incentives, maybe even nation strategies concerning cryptocurrencies. However, I'm sure for one thing: activity. If there's demand for the network to operate, it will be supplied. And for a network of global scale to operate normally, I think we need to concentrate on one thing: scalability. I don't believe that changing the block size limit is the ticket for a global scaled network. But, neither do I believe that leaving it as is, is too. I'm all in for transaction compression (which is what's scaling in the end), as an off-chain solution like lightning, but the problem with this is that it restricts access to technically incompetent users. It fundamentally does, because no ordinary person who wants to gain the benefits of peer-to-peer cash, has the time to configure a lightning node, a Bitcoin node, and run both. Even if he goes on with pre-installed solutions (e.g., Umbrel), which separate the technical part from the end user, it's still discouraging because the user has to have a computer running every day, all day, which is orders of magnitude more difficult than holding a private key, and more expensive. Big blocks, I agree, throw out a significant part of \"small players\" out of the window, because the cost of infrastructure to run a node rises significantly. Even my Raspberry Pi 4 sort of slowed down recently with the Ordinals overwhelming the mempool. But, ironically, so do small blocks if we take the lightning path (\"small\", in terms of technical competence). Therefore, I notice one thing: the future of Bitcoin's scalability is misty. But, scalability, as per se, isn't only what's concerning me. In fact, it's rather the stimulus. It's what is likely to cause the real problem; discord. As I said at first, as long as there's a consensus around a particular set of rules, there can be progression. If the network splits, the result might not be as desired as expected. So, let's have a talk. Fruitful discussion is our only weapon we, as forum, have to confront this.Here's some questions for debate:Will there probably be another block size war? If yes, shouldn't we take precautions now that we've learned from the mistakes of the previous time? What precautions?Should we rise the block size limit at some point in the future? If yes, how much? If no, what's the appropriate alternative?Can there be progression without backwards-compatibility?Self-moderated. Will not ever delete post based on opinion. Keep things civil. Be constructive.",

If you think stuff like Ordinals are an obstacle to sustainability, then the system is fundamentally flawed to begin with. Limiting op codes will not prevent anyone from spamming the blockchain. Simple example: split the ordinal into x transactions. The only disincentive is the money they have to pay. Anything beyond that will probably do more harm than good.Quote from: franky1 on February 12, 2023, 01:22:51 PMdefining the opcode byte limit makes transactions lean to support less wasted space usage to allow more transactions per blockSo, what you're suggesting is to go on without backwards-compatibility. I agree that doing this might make the system work potentially more efficiently, but I'm not quite sure about this:QuoteCan there be progression without backwards-compatibility?",

      "body": "Yes i agree that there are flaws (or were introduced) in the system. And Ordinals is a clear demonstration of spam attack against Bitcoin that needs to be addressed for any hope of sustainability. It was decent until this happened. Even your idea is with merit, anything to make it more expensive to spammers or deter them in anyway so they naturally go away where its cheaper to do so.I believe one of the reasons for the existence of PoW was designing a system to address the issue of spam in email. It is ironic that we now need to address the issue of spam in the blockchain, as it has clearly gone out of hands.So if we go back to the previous pre-ordinals stage, was is sustainable? I think so yes. Even if you didn't have universal instant transactions, it was still good enough for most transactions and the occasional instant transaction, a system which could be improved still sure, lightning has its own de-merits but at least it was optional and you could just ignore it.",

      "body": "Thank you for starting this discussion on the sustainability of the Bitcoin network. These are important questions to consider as the network continues to grow and evolve.Regarding the block size limit, it is a trade-off between centralization and decentralization. On one hand, larger blocks allow for more transactions to be processed, increasing scalability. On the other hand, larger blocks also require more computing power and storage space, making it more difficult for smaller players to participate in the network as full nodes. This can lead to centralization, where only a few large entities are able to participate as full nodes, while the rest of the users have to rely on these entities to validate their transactions.In terms of block size limit, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, as the optimal block size will depend on the specific use case and the goals of the network. Some proponents argue that the block size limit should be increased in the future to accommodate more transactions, while others believe that alternative scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, should be pursued instead.Regarding the issue of backwards compatibility, it is an important factor to consider when making changes to the network. Any changes that break backwards compatibility can result in a split in the network, potentially leading to multiple versions of the cryptocurrency. This can cause confusion and fragmentation among users, making it more difficult for the network to achieve widespread adoption.In conclusion, the future of the Bitcoin network's scalability and sustainability is uncertain, and there are many factors to consider when making decisions about the network's future. Discussions like this can help to gather diverse perspectives and find the best way forward.",

Do SPV wallets must upgrade their wallet softwares when Bitcoin protocol has upgrades?Users of SPV wallets are simply download, install those wallets to use for their storage, transaction broadcasting. If they can do more technical steps to verify wallet software before using it, it is better.I don't think users are responsible for too depth technical knowledge and codes or steps. They simply interact with good wallet softwares in wallet interface. To help Bitcoin adoption, I don't think developers should force users to interact with wallet softwares by code.Increasing blocksize is great when time comes. If Bitcoin had Segwit upgrade for it in 2017, it can have Segwit 2 in future. Community will support the block size increase and upgrade if it brings benefit in transaction fee and average waiting time for confirmations.",

      "body": "When it comes to scaling I always believed that we need a middle ground to do everything but not rely on one solution alone. For example you can't just increase the block size and call that a solution just like you can't not-increase the block size and say second layer is the solution alone.We basically need 3 things at the same time: increasing the capacity, compressing the blocks/transactions and working on second layer solution.This is also why I liked the idea of SegWit2x although it suffered from a flaw. It separated the hard fork and soft fork whereas it should have done it all in one hard fork.In my opinion we need a hard fork sooner than later. A hard fork not only to increase the capacity (to something like 4-8 MB block size) but also to solve a lot of bugs lets say \"weirdness\" in the protocol that can help with the compression too. Weirdness like the one extra wasted byte that all OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY) scripts must contain, or the couple of extra bytes that are wasted by all transactions with witness, the 4 byte transaction version that is almost completely useless,  the flaws in ways [sig]OPs are counted, the existence of P2PKH and P2WPKH at the same time while they serve the same exact purpose (same as P2SH and P2WSH), and a lot more.",

Right now, we have $21,621,853.65 in income in the last 24 hours and 821,913 active addresses, I choose active addresses because it's better than looking at the number of transactions, so that's 26$ per address used to keep the same level of protection without reward.Would it work if the reward halves two times and the price is still at 20k?

Binance, specifically, charges 50,000 sats for withdrawing your bitcoin to a legacy address. Quote from: franky1 on February 13, 2023, 08:19:06 AMconsensus is code. code makes rules to understand what is deemed a purpose of a txWhat about my other argument?Quoteany rule which would be enforced solely for this purpose would only do harm, because there are nearly infinitely manners to clog the network like thisYou can't prevent every spam attack, if the attacker is willing to pay the fine.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on February 13, 2023, 12:14:20 PMIt should be based on initial (e.g. hardware) and operational cost (e.g. internet connection and electricity) of a node, while also considering future initial/operational cost. In past, only BIP 103 consider this perspective seriously.Isn't it weird that the contributor of this BIP is Luke, when he was the one who proposed 300kb block size?Quote from: stompix on February 13, 2023, 12:41:34 PMAnd let's remember that automatically increasing block size won't mean we will have 4 times as many transactions instantly.Don't forget that rising the block size by a factor of 4, would make spamming 4 times cheaper. Therefore, we'd definitely have more non-currency transactions. I'm guessing that it'd do more good for spammers than for actual users. See the recent Ordinal thing. You should take it for granted that the network will be clogged up 4 times more than now.",
