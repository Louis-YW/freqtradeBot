  "content": "Pancake swap overcomes important resistance area.The next resistance is at the $5.0 mark.Pancake swaps (CAKE) were bullish when bitcoin faced resistance in early February. The crypto market appears stable after a recovery and buyers are getting motivated for the latest investments in the market while CAKE token revealed a break above the December bullish hurdle.Three consecutive bullish candles show strong empowerment of market bulls and another bullish open above $4.1 area will give fuel to hit the next wall near $5.0. For the time being, traders should try to hold CAKE coin for the next rally, but this will again include retracement steps.https://www.tradingview.com/x/dWA2cXCe/The CAKE token is influencing Bitcoin as the correlation remains around the 0.81 level. A further increase in BTC price will push PancakeSwap price towards $5.0. But a minor retracement could happen at $4.5 as there was a sharp sell-off at this level in early November.Amidst the bullish momentum, buyers followed up with buying on the decline as suggested by previous price action. Thus this can be a favorable opportunity for the bulls. Specifically, the recent top at $4.321 could act as an immediate resistance until it breaks.The trading volume is also sufficient to maintain a sustainable move in the market. Impossibly high growth requires more purchasing power, so more accumulation will open the door for retail investors in the market.Final ThoughtsAs long as pancake swaps (CAKE) price sustains above the $4.0 area, the upside potential will increase. And this accumulation may achieve the $5.0 resistance by the end of this month.",

      "body": "Pancake swap platform, many things that are used very frequently every day in the bsc ecosystem. It was smashed at $40 in price, this is one of the last I remember. On the second happening, if it is stuck between 3-4 dollars, 5 dollars will be a sharp intersection in my opinion. But I think the main event ends with BNB, Cake price is also shaped according to BNB. This was the case in the previous rise, and now they are following very closely.",

      "body": "It's fantastic to see that you've been following PancakeSwap (CAKE) and its recent performance. To address your question, it's usually a good idea to do some technical analysis, particularly for short-term investments like pump and dump coins.However, I see your point of view when you claim that examining Bitcoin and Ethereum might provide insight into the entire market trend. In most circumstances, smaller tokens prefer to follow the larger ones' lead.I have to agree with you that hyped-up currencies seldom have a long-term future. That is why it is always crucial to do your own research rather than just following the buzz. Because the cryptocurrency market may be volatile and unexpected, you need be sure you're making educated selections.Having said that, several of these currencies may still bring rapid returns in the near run. However, in order to genuinely gain from the crypto market, a long-term plan is typically more beneficial.Overall, I believe it is always prudent to approach the market with care and to avoid getting too caught up in the frenzy. Because the cryptocurrency market is still new and has a lot of space for development, it's vital to be patient and avoid getting too caught up in short-term swings.",

Well that pretty concludes that if bnb is mooning then pancake swap will eventually follow as well. Plus they are earning from trading fees on their dex surely they will always caught up. It will only depend on bsc network of CZ.",

I meant that i see whole BNB ecosystem irrelevant in the future. Right now people are only using it because it's cheap. That's the main selling point and why it's popular. But BNB is like a lego version of a real thing and with 21 validators it's centralized as a chain can be. Sure, cheap scammers just move to ETH when ever it's going to be cheaper to use but i seriously don't see any other point BNB to exist then having Binance to burn it and binance requiring listed new altcoins to lock bnb, which makes the bnb valuable.",

CAKE will always give a high profit for its investor. for me, the pancake is like the alternative to Binance which i don't also have to submit kyc.",
