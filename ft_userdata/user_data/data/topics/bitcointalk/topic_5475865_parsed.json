  "content": "I installed Electrum Neurai 0.2.0 on my Win10 x64 PC and it won't open. I run as admin, and the wallet never launches.The weird thing is 0.2.0 used to work for me, but then I reformatted my SSD and installed all Windows updates, and now it is no longer working.The previous version 0.1.0 opens however.Here is a link to the github:https://github.com/NeuraiProject/electrum-neurai/releasesAny help is appreciated.",

It is no longer original Electrum wallet and if you need help with that wallet, you must ask in their Github or channels of that project.It is not suited to ask it in Electrum wallet board.Reminder is when you install a strange wallet software, it is risky and your device can be infected and compromised.Quote from: Churchillvv on November 29, 2023, 01:02:52 AMSo I haven't installed electrum before but I would suggest you try reinstalling the app, I do that alot when apps refuse to open in my PC I believe it's gonna work or you check the app folder and make a redirection by moving the app to desktop.But don't delete the app because if you have installed before it must have your wallets files in it.You did not experience it but want to give advice. It is very risky because your advice will not be on point and can not help to solve this issue or can cause loss of the user.With the user description, he run the software a first time and failed so he did not create any seed or wallet file at all.",
