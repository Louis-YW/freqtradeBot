I'm not talking about those early bots where you could play simple blackjack games in a Telegram group; I'm referring to these new crypto casinos like TG Casino, Mega Dice, and Lucky Block. They've created tailor-made mobile casinos for the Telegram audience, allowing players to log in through their Telegram accounts and start playing instantly without the need for KYC.What do you guys think about this new trend? Is it good or bad?",

Is it good or bad?I haven't really try any of the telegram games that are either organized within the group using one not or the other, The reason why I haven't paid much attention to them is because. 1: I already have a few well-established casinos that I can play on,  so I am not looking for any new additions to my list of casinos to play on. 2: I don't trust telegram deals so as that, so I am always sceptical about the telegram and anything that is operated on telegram.",

To be sincere, I have not tried it before, I have only prefer the normal one which you will register and account and play what you want to play. I will like to see what people that have tried it will comment about it.",

Then I saw that TG Casino had 1,200 players and a turnover of $10 million or something, and I had to try it.It took me literally 30 seconds ( NO KYC ) after I clicked on the Telegram bot, and I could start playing my favorite slots.So yeah, I like it. Whether it's the future of crypto gambling, I'm not sure, but it's definitely a cool gambling experience",

Is it good or bad?Telegram casinos are not something new, it’s just too risky for me to even give it a try with my real money. Why I’m already satisfied with the web casinos and which they give a better experience and more entertaining visual and auditory features.The only thing I admire is the betting feature that some casinos offer, where they attach their sportbooks with a telegram bot that allows you to bet with Telegram.In the other hand, once I read Lucky Block I lost more trust of this idea. I have been in one of the same team project, they appeared to be scammers unfortunately and opening continuous scam projects. I won’t risk 1$ with them.",

Is it good or bad?Basing up on the title which i did really believe that those TG gambling games that have in the past which do really sucks, i havent visited on the link above but i might be consider out later on.Talking about specifically on games offered or been seen on TG then it isnt really that something i could say that it would be replacing or would be come a new trend just because of KYCis already that implemented with those known casino platforms that we do have today but its not really that a bad option if you are really that mindful about security of your identity.The thing i dont like on TG games or gambling is that it doesnt really give out on the same experience that you could get when playing on an actual site.I dont know but the feeling is really just that too tight or experience isnt really that something i do prefer. I would rather agree on sending up some KYCrather than finding myself wont really be that enjoying because of that limited space or the overall experience isnt really nice.Its better not to gamble at all.",

I haven’t tried this one and it looks not ok to me honestly because in telegram we all know there’s a lot of scam there and fake sites so why bother to trust it? If you want to gamble then use the best site because you are dealing with your own money and you should prioritize your own safety over other things, gamble with the best casinos and you can have your peace of mind.",

      "body": "I think they could be good, there's the potential in them being very viable as Telegram's been the massive sleeper when it comes to messaging. But at the same time we all know that Telegram also became the feeding ground of hackers and scammers nowadays, so it's like putting yourself to a position where not only are you at risk of losing your money, you're also at risk of losing your telegram account. In any case I would say the biggest selling point of this is how the simple connection of your telegram account to  a gambling site should be enough a KYC already where the user doesn't have to fully disclose his information anymore. I think that's only fair and if that would be the case, oh boy is KYC going to be less of a bummer to people who aren't into it in the first place!",

Just like the suggestions of others here, just gamble on the real casinos instead of dealing with those gambling site because its not safe at all. Telegram are widely used by the scammers and hackers, make sure you wont share any private details on those sites.",

Personally, I have only tried it once. The good thing is that it took about 5 seconds to create an account from Telegram, and no KYC was asked. I made a transfer from a burn wallet, started to play, and had a successful withdrawal.So, the player experience was great. Can I trust that they will pay out my winnings if I win big? No idea. That's why I would like to hear if the Bitcointalk community has something to share.",

It's really hard to trust them with your funds, probably most players who gamble there are those who just want to spend their free time and has limited access to the internet.",

They are the ones who pretend to be casinos or fake but accept gamblers to bring in money for them to gamble with; in short, scammers or thieves of gamblers' money.Why would you gamble on a telegram channel of a casino when there are legitimate casinos online that are legally able to operate correctly in an industry like this, especially if it has a website where you can play properly in the real casino? So, let's be careful because it's a trap for gamblers. That's the truth there.",

I dont think so which we know that most of casino platforms or sites nowadays are really that having their own app or if not their site is really that responsivefor those people who do make use of it on which means that anytime that you do make out such gambling urge then you could really just simply do access those things without any issues and just like on what most people been saying that its not really that something that looks interesting if we do say about gambling experience.Design and overall ambiance or experience isnt really the same.This is why they dont really get that much attention if we do speak about this manner because we can eventually tell that people wont really be that totally interested on playing into this platform or messaging app.",

Is it good or bad?I have never played or bet there, but I visited the TG Casino group several times just to answer my curiosity about this. And indeed, to be able to play in it is quite easy, we only need to click once and it will take us to the TG Cosino homepage without having to bother registering and filling out the registration form.Here I only have the courage to visit it until the homepage, to make a deposit and play there, I personally don't have the courage to do that. Because I have not received any information about whether the casino page is really safe to visit so that we can be comfortable when gambling there.and I think sometimes if something is too easy, then this often creates suspicion and doubt both in the mind and in the heart, and often raises the question of whether this casino is really safe and not cheating its customers..?",

I don't, but trusting the application and installing it on your device is so dangerous because, as the OP said, it is only on telegram, and what we know is that it may be a scheme made by scammers, added with no KYC. That's a bit too obvious. Imagine depositing money from an app that you've got on telegram without knowing who is the developer of the casino app or who's the owner of the casino app.As an IT professional, this is too risky; apps may contain malware that can be used to hack devices. I don't discriminate or talk bad about Telegram; I use it, but online casinos that are based on Telegram are too risky and dangerous. Of course, I don't stop gamblers if they want to use it. You are in your own safety; it is your own responsibility.",
