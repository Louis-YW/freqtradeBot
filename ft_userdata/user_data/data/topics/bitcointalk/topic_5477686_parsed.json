I had no choice or control over over it. Can someone please accelerate my transaction?This is the third case about cash app in the last two weeks for the same issue but unfortunately, you can't do anything unless are willing to pay about estimated cost of $22 to 25 for the transaction via mempool paid acceleration service but considering the transacted value it doesn't worth it.Just wait and hope it confirms or TX gets purged by nodes.",

      "body": "By reversal do you mean the coin sent by CashApp? which I think is most likely because of the low fee used. If you have control over the private key of the recipient address then you can do a CPFP but if you don’t then I think you have to contact CashApp (last I heard they don’t respond to this kind of plies) only them can bump it or you wait till the transaction is dropped from all nodes. Or you use the paid service for acceleration on viabtc. Quote from: Findingnemo on December 13, 2023, 07:58:14 AMJust wait and hope it confirms or TX gets purged by nodes.It really disturbing what CashApp has made their users to face this days. With the purging fee around 12sats/vbyte I think most of the nodes will have drop it but the problem with this CashApp is they will rebroadcast the transaction again and again",

      "body": "The problem with a CPFP is that currently, the output of the transaction is 0.00192571 BTC, which equals about $80.If you do a CPFP, you'll have to cough up the fee for the stuck transaction (about 0.00015) PLUS the fee for the CPFP transaction, witch will also be about 0.00015, so you'll have to pay about 0.0003 in fees (~$12 at current preev rate) just to get your $80 back. A transaction accelerator costs even more... The sender (cashapp) has cheaped out on the fee and only added 6,6 sat/vbyte (basically 30 cents) instead of the 140 sat/byte they should have payed right now. For a transaction of 110 vbytes, that would have cost them 0.000154 BTC (about $6.4). If they would have done the correct thing, this problem simply wouldn't exist.You should complain to them tbh... They're the ones that cheaped out on the fee and caused this problem. If the feerate was to high for them, they should have asked a higher fee to their clients, started batching and maybe switch to taproot... They should, in no circumstance, start sending transactions with such a low fee and pass the problem on to their clients. In some way or another, you payed cashapp to give you $80, it makes no sense to spend $12 on top of what you already payed them to get your money.",

I am having the same problem  He didn't updated but OP's transaction is already confirmed.Based from the transaction's history, he might have paid a transaction accelerator that works with AntPool for it to confirmThat's because its child transaction, although has a very high fee, is included to a different block.The availability of \"fee bumping\" solutions differ per case so it's better if you can provide more info about your transaction and the wallet's name where it's sent.If it's sent to another custodial wallet/exchange, you can't do anything about it but to use an accelerator like OP.",

I WILL PAY WHOEVER CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR ME !!!!There have been many complaints of cashapp reversing funds back to customers, but using a very low fee rate in the tx, which inevitably means it gets stuck, i don't know why they use a low fee rate when reversing these tx's, with almost no chance of confirmation anytime soon. You have to either use a paid tx accelerator or try to submit your tx to ViaBTC's free accelerator, though they have only 20 free slots per hour, but if you want anyone to help you with this, you have to provide the id to your tx.",
