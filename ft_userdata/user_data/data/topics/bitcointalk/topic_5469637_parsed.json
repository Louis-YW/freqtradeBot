Since you’re posting on electrum board I will assume it is electrum wallet and there is no breach of electrum wallet this is a personal breach. And sorry to put it out I don’t think anything can be done if the funds are no longer there, you just need to discard that seed and create a new one and probably have a proper scan of that device for malware.",

Electrum is incredibly widely used, and so if it had a critical flaw in it we would expect to see hundreds if not thousands of reports from users losing their funds.You made several mistakes I'm afraid OP. First, you stored more than you were willing to lose in a hot wallet. Then you ignored the warnings in Electrum which say \"Please save these 12 words on paper\" and \"Do not store it electronically\". By far the most likely way in which your coins were stolen is from malware or similar accessing the text file containing your seed phrase. It does not matter where on your hard drive it is (since malware can just scan your entire drive for words from the public word list), nor does it matter what order they are stored in since descrambling 12 words is incredibly easy and quick on even cheap hardware.The password you remembered is irrelevant - your seed phrase is all that is needed to access your coins. The password only encrypts your local Electrum file.What you need to do now is consider your computer compromised. At a minimum scan with antivirus and antimalware software, but ideally format it and reinstall your OS. Assume any other wallets or sensitive data on that computer are also compromised, including any saved website logins and passwords.",

OP's device was probably infected with a malware and how exactly the malware could gain access to OP's keys is known only by the hacker. If you want to be completely secure, you should create your wallet using a safe tool on an air-gapped device and your keys should never connect to the internet. Otherwise, there's always the chance of getting hacked.",
