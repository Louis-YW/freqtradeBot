If it's about the chance of success, this is like a left behind project.I don't see any more success on it. The prime of it has already passed and there's no way that investors would try to believe and trust it anymore unless there will be whales that would play a big part of just pumping and leaving it again.",

There are tons of other shitcoins and vaporware deadcoins in the market that look less shady than terra classic. Even the telemarketer scammer that keeps calling you every day trying to sell you a bag of finger nails clippings for 100 bucks sounds less shady than any Terra-related cryptoQuote from: masterrex on July 25, 2022, 11:57:09 AMAs far as I know, Mr. Do Kwon, the Terra Luna CEO and founder has been sued, and investigated in relation to the recent Terra Luna Fiasco which involves the old Terra Classic so there is a pending process that can possibly dictate the fate of both old and new Terra Luna tokensIt's pretty crazy that despite all these massive red flags surrouding this deadcoin there are people who still ask if there's a chance of success for this garbagecryptocurrency.",

People hold it and trade it blindly believing it will return one day. However, that is a very unlikely scenario.",

It gets to a point to where too many UST tokens are minted and they cannot be backed or redeemed. Collateralized stablecoins like DAI are a better solution. There may however be a place in the future for a chain like Terra that hosts a fractionally backed stablecoin. Kind of like a hybrid stablecoin like FRAX. That said, I think we should move on form LUNA because now it is associated with a scammer and there are much better chains out there, like Fantom and Candle Chain. These are technically superior chains and they don't have a stigma or angry bag holders attached to them.",

Did you read the root of the cause of terra's downfall? scams are of different levels and from the look of things, you may not be able to identify one even if it stirs directly in your face.If you don't mind my asking what experiment exactly is terrea a victim of? is Do Kwon aware of this so-called experiment? have you ever thought why Do kwon never go with the terra communnity vote for burn when he could instead went ahead to do a fork? Yeah, victim of bad experiment indeed.",

That is some optimism i must say, to be honest i'd not be that optimistic about Terra classic, the coin is basically dead and i think people need to come to grips with that, i know the more people that are trying to show believe are prolly hodling some of it and they hope there can be a pump so they make ROI, but let us be honest, the chances of that happening is pretty low, if not impossible. If you haven't got any Terra, then you would be doing yourself a favor not to get any, look elsewhere, and to other projects, but if you are tired of shitcoins altogether, then just buy Bitcoin.",

Team Terra didn't take any action to save luna but then they released another fork version of luna which is luna classic. The release of luna 2.0 version is not for the purpose of saving the luna community, but, rather, for the purpose of distracting investors so that they can forget about what happened with luna 1.0 version. It is nothing more than an abdication of responsibility. It is not surprising that luna classic is no longer of interest to investors and in the end it is nothing more than a scam project.",
