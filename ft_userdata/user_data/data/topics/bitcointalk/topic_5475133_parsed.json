There are some that require you to trade with less than your trading fund.  But if you are talking about bitcoin, it depends on how good you are but do not go more than 3x.",

I think your position will last longer.",

Your question has a lot of hidden assumptions like your risk profile, your profit target, etc. Nobody can handhold you to do your margin trade with just that information, and you should not rely on some random advice from strangers, to begin with.Maybe you should learn and practice on a demo trading platform or trade with some spare funds to get familiar with how the market works first. Experience is as important as having money to trade, especially in such a risky environment like margin trading.",

So don't trade if you can not afford to lose money.QuoteTo hold position for say two daysI would never let my trading position opens over night or let's say more than 24 hours. I usually close my position after like 4 hours, 6 hours or 12 hours, I don't like to let it opens longer.QuoteAnd which safe laverage to use When you use leverages, it is more risky than no leverage. As I said, trading is risky already and when you use leverages for your trading, the risk is bigger. Don't use leverage!",

Because it behaves like gambling.  With Bitcoin you can leverage up to 125x where if the price moves towards your target it will bring you a big profit and if the price moves in the opposite direction of your target you will face a huge loss which can make your balance 0 and its  Then panic and don't hesitate to invest more and take 2x leverage from the previous period which will gradually lead you to more losses.QuoteAnd which safe laverage to use If you want to trade somewhat safe then never take more than 3x leverage. This may make your profit less and slower but the loss will be the same. So always the less leverage you can take the better for you. Because too much leverage will always keep you tense and prevent you from making decisions with a cool head. Which will always cause your loss",

Future trading is risk trading with potential liquid notification and all your capital loss but have advantage with future trading to earn profit not waiting price coins up but you can earn profit when market dump by opening short position. First time with future trading better use as small leverage and don't try with most bigger leverage until 125x due close with liquidation.Looking for good exchange have lower fees for future trading, regarding Binance have bigger fees exactly when your position more than 8 hours you have to pay funding fees beside with your future trading transaction when opening and close position.",

If market conditions are moving well, you can hold the position for up to two days or even three days before closing the trade.But it will depend on the coin. I usually use small leverage under 5x-10x because trading in futures is very risky. If you can't analyze, it's better to avoid trying in future trading. You should continue learning to use spot trading until you can analyze it well.And don't use $1k to trade but use $1k to invest every month using DCA.

Leverage by its very nature is taking on a lot of EXTRA risk above and beyond the normal risk of trading, which is already high.And I'd say don't do futures, that just increases the risk even further!I've never done any futures stuff or options or whatever, but from what I can tell futures is just betting on the price of something for a specific amount of time. That's riskier than putting in a trade and waiting for your sell order to hit, because with futures there is a specific end time. It is straight up time-based betting.If you want to make money in a lower risk (still not safe) way, spot trade with no leverage. If you are successful you will gradually build up your trading stash over the long term. You should prove to yourself that you are good enough at trading to make money by spot trading with your $1000. If you haven't even proven to yourself that you can be really successful in trading, then your leveraged futures trading strategy is based on you hoping to get lucky which is always an awful strategy and if you're leveraging your money then that could not just be awful for totally disastrous for you. Personally I would NEVER trade on margin. Far too risky. That's how people financially ruin themselves.",

You are not wrong that using leverage is highly risky and that 1x margin ratio is better. But it also depends, because some people may have $1000 but trade with leverage like 0.5x or low. From 0.5x leverage, that means using $500 to trade from $1000. This is done by traders that do not want ti risk too much money on trading.",

If you want to trade, it’s better to trade on spot. From your question, I can see you're still new to trading. You trying to trade on future might lead you to lose a large amount of money. But if you still want to trade futures, make sure you don’t go into a trade with all your money, always trade with some parts of your money, and always use small leverage so that you won’t easily get liquidated. I am not supposed to give you leverage to use, but always make sure your leverage is 5x or less. The higher your leverage, the higher your chances of losing money, so always maintain small leverage.",
