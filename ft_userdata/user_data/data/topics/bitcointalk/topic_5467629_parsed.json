So you can pay less amount of gas fees. Otherwise, I have to pay a higher gas fee for every transaction. Also, I am trying to use the layer 2 networks and try to avoid Ethereum(Layer 1) transactions. Solutions:1. Select the time for the lowest gas fees2. Use Layer 2 networks",

      "body": "The high gas fee is indeed a problem in crypto transactions, especially on the Ethereum network. It has been several years since I last experienced this scenario, back when I was actively playing and making transactions every week or sometimes every few days. I had no choice but to continue with the transactions and pay the high gas fee just to get my tasks done. This doesn't only happen with gas fees; it's the same with Bitcoin transactions. So what I do is monitor the network first to see if it's congested or not. If I'm not in a hurry, I wait for the gas fee or transaction fees to go down. Sometimes, I also use an estimator.The high gas fee is indeed a barrier for many individuals, especially those who are just starting in the world of cryptocurrency. It's challenging if this situation continues every day.",

But if you really want to send your alts to anywhere you want for whatever reason much better to trade your BTC or ETH to those coins which have less fees like XRP and BNB since these coins are famous in terms of dealing low fees also fast to transfer. Just don't get stress about what you see since in crypto there's a solution on certain issue you encounter.",

Now trading in bitcoin does not require more than one dollar transaction fee, while trading on ethereum platform requires about one dollar transaction fee and the transaction fee in other ALT coins that are available has become somewhat normal. At the current level of transaction fees, everyone can easily transact any coin. When we have to pay a transaction fee of $20 to transfer a coin or token, we can call that situation high transaction fee. Since the transaction fee is now one dollar or below one dollar, we can call this transaction fee normal.",

You can only use L1 or L2 blockchains, which have better scalability compared with the mainstream network like ethereum. I do agree with you if the mechanism of defi was not effective, especially on ethereum blockchain which any transcation will be involving very high fees. The only solution to push those developers to work on update in increasing the scalability from the blockchain. If you are willing to get cheap fees for your transaction and i can suggest you to stick with L2 blockchain. https://l2fees.info/You can use some like polygon, arbitrum or optimism. Using L1 non scalable blockchain like ethereum will make you only waste your money to pay the transaction fees.",

You really haven't been into the peak of this \"busy periods\" I guess so that tens of dollars of gas fees might go 10x in the peak periods. Solutions are being made like off-chain transactions by Bitcoin (Lightning Network), and lot of Layer-2 scaling solutions to make these transactions cheaper than it was ever before. I prefer to use the latter considering there are many ways to do it.",

Its actually depend on the network usage and the particular L1 or L2 which you will be used. If you picked ethereum, ecpect its higher than others since tis the most used network and has a lot of dapps and users. Considering the fees might be crucial since its a normal routine now on defi projects. Normally if theres a certain of hype happening on such network, the fees tend to increase due to usage and thats normal well cant give an accurate day or time for that.",

But will it continue to rise, of course not. It only has an impact when the ethereum network is too congested with many transactions. Normally the gass fee is only around $5 and if we switch to another chain like BSC that you suggest, it will be even cheaper, especially if we are on the Layer 2 network, it's only under $1, around $0.1xx. Of course it will be very cheap and no longer consider expensive fuel costs.",

As in the case of Ethereum during its congestion period, many people may have had to pay tens or even hundreds of dollars in fees per transaction, but what they got in return was worth those actions.
