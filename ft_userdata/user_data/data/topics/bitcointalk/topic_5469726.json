For fetching the current btc price in USD you can use this url: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usdYou are good to go with the version of bitmover but here is a version where the API is used from coingecko:Code:import requestsdef get_bitcoin_price():    url = \"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd\"    response = requests.get(url)        # request check    if response.status_code == 200:        data = response.json()        bitcoin_price = data[\"bitcoin\"][\"usd\"]        return bitcoin_price    else:        print(f\"Error {response.status_code}: Sorry, but unable to fetch current price of Bitcoin from Coingecko.\")        return Noneif __name__ == \"__main__\":    price = get_bitcoin_price()    if price:        print(f\"The current price of Bitcoin is ${price:,.2f} USD.\")Implemented check if the request to the API was successful, otherwise they would be following output:Code:Sorry, but unable to fetch current price of Bitcoin from Coingecko.",
