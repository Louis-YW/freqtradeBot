Bitcoin is virtual but has a monetary value which means users can freely send money to each other without dealing with exorbitant fees and without the need for a bank account. As technology advances, so does its capacity to meet our needs. This can be seen through the rise of bitcoin.Bitcoin is slowly but surely penetrating the global economy, and in our modern world, it is a currency that generates less friction than fiat currencies. This is definitely worth a look for those who are interested in such things including Mexico and in my opinion using bitcoin is safer and just as easy in other words a new way for people to send money quickly and securely to each other around the world.",

If in case their politicians will push thru with this initiative, this will give a very good boost with the crypto market, not only with bitcoin.But will the Mexican government ready to abandon their Mexican peso? Otherwise, they can regulate the existence of bitcoin and other alts in their financial market, so the adoption will further increase.Because some of their citizens will see it as positive if the government is having positive approach towards this market and they have laws in place.",

I even see Mexico should've adopted Bitcoin sooner cause the number of remittances from Chicano living in the US was a lot. Especially some of them might not have all the proper paper to get their hard-earn money back to their family in Mexico through legal means.Though, there are always two sides of the same coin. For once, Bitcoin solves the problem above but drug cartels, human trafficking gangs could also benefit from it. They could hide their money rail easier by using Bitcoin and you know how they said 'follow the money trail' to burst criminal activity. Still on the fence about this news.",

Well, it could have worked that way if the said senator was the head of its party and that party would be the leading one, but in this case, it's just one senator from a party that has 7% of the seats, that has lost votes compared to the previous election and they are actually in some sort of opposition to the current government, so her opinion is like nothing, unfortunately.What matters is what the ruling party is thinking, the former finance minister was definitely anti-bitcoin, he was actually the one thinking of a complete ban not just for financial institutions, but the new guy seems more understandable, maybe just maybe we will see some softening in the current anti-bitcoin stance.",

The airdrop distribution is helpful to expose their citizens with Bitcoin but if to say all feedback are good, I don't agree.Months after airdrop distribution plus the bear market, many people no longer want or more hesitate to accept Bitcoin for their business in El Salvador. They have solid reason, if you have a business and also are a long term investor, you can accept Bitcoin without fear that it will have -15% drop tomorrow. If you have a start up that is small and vulnerable enough, accepting Bitcoin is risky for your company.",

But the problem is whether the proposal can be realized and approved by the Mexican parliament which has more votes for its impartiality to Bitcoin. Indira Kempis is the opposition and now on her Twitter, she seems to be showing her alignment with Bitcoin. Or is this just a ride for his political interests? because this is usually to attract public sympathy, especially young people but in practice, the politician does not actually deliver 1% of what he promises. Despite his personal interests, he has been pro-Bitcoin for a long time, and maybe in the next election, he will still declare the same topic. It's just a matter of waiting for the public's response whether he is in a favorable position or if it is the coalition that has controlled the government.",

I think they're the same. In El Salvador, it is not just Bitcoin that is the official currency. The US dollar remains as one of the country's official currency alongside Bitcoin. El Salvadoran businesses cannot abandon the US dollar as a payment option because it is also the country's official currency. They cannot refuse customers who prefer to use the US dollar in buying goods and services. I think this proposal to declare Bitcoin as a legal tender in Mexico is still far from happening.",
