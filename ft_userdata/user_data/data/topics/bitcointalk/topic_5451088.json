      "body": "Those people are firm believers of short term profits. In bull markets when prices are going higher they buy the miners and they will buy when prices of Bitcoin go high and difficulty get a little low. Their main goal is to cover up their initial cost during those times and earn as much profit as possible during the bull run. When they cover up most of their initial costs then if the bear market starts they sell the miners and earn some extra profits.Their main motive is not to add extra-processing power to Bitcoin mining but to earn with the mined coins during the bull run. Their mind is not into long term holding as they want good profits in short durations. They will save the earned money for the next bull run where they will be able to buy more advanced miners that provide more processing power and higher energy efficiency. They will repeat the process over and over.",

They have been doing this for a long time but I am wondering how this is a smart idea because I always advice those that want to mine Bitcoin to never sell their miners in a bear market and that they should keep mining and store their Bitcoin. I think the strategy that you mentioned is a common practice among some cryptocurrency miners. By buying ASIC miner after a Bitcoin halving or when the market is in a bearish trend, miners can obtain mining equipment at a lower cost, while also benefiting from lower competition in the mining space. They then use the miners during the bullish market to generate profits and sell them when the market turns bearish, potentially making a profit from the sale of the ASICs.As for your advice to keep mining and store Bitcoin during a bear market, that can also be a sound strategy, as it allows miners to accumulate Bitcoin at lower cost, potentially increasing profits in the long run. the choice of strategy will depend on a miner's individual risk tolerance, financial situation, and market analysis.",

      "body": "Yeah there is something to be done in that sense, as you say OP.If you, for example, bought ASICs in 2018-2019, ran them and they were already profitable, you would have made a nice profit in 2020-2021 by reselling them.As their price is more or less correlated to the price of BTC, and therefore to the hype generated on mining, there is a chance to make a profit.However, if you have large quantities of ASICs, if they run stably, your infrastructure is done and clean, and your electricity is cheap, it's a bit of a gamble.Why not just let them run? They're already profitable. Why would you want to go through the supply difficulties, the waiting time, the import costs and difficulties again?Especially since you have no real guarantee that the price of ASICs will drop again and that you will be able to buy them cheaper. Even if bear markets always come after bulls, there is no guarantee that you will be able to find good ASICs at good prices after you sell yours.Personally I keep everything, as long as my electricity rate allows it, I even leave old S9s running. At worst, I let them run solo like a lottery ticket, but I can't see myself bothering to ship and manage the resale of dozens of ASICs, with all the potential problems that could cause, when they are already profitable.",

The idea is to sell the Asic miners at a low price and then sell them when it's time for the bull market with a layer or profit, this is probably the strategy they are doing.       Also, the advantage of this method is that miners who love Asic can buy cheap during a bear market, or they can sell Asic miners at a high price when the value of Bitcoin increases.",

Such activities can be done when you live in a city or area where there are a lot of miners. In Russia, for example, these are Irkutsk and the Irkutsk region, and due to cheap electricity, less than 2 cents is mined by everyone who can buy equipment. In other regions, there is not much demand for mining equipment.",

Where did you even get this idea from? Does this look like miners stopped mining?https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html#3yBecause some people invested in gear at the wrong time and need to shut down when the revenue is lower it doensn't mean it's a trend, it's simply economics, the ones doing stupid investments are paying the price.Quote from: KiaKia on May 03, 2023, 11:45:30 AMthey always buy their asic miners after Bitcoin halvingLol, no!Bear markets are when you buy gear as the prices go down exponentially.A s19 used to cost 7k in 2021, now you can get it go $1k.Quote from: KiaKia on May 03, 2023, 11:45:30 AMMy question. Is are people doing this? No! Miners stop mining when the revenue is lower than the costs, a bear market can trigger this but even prolonged periods of up and downs can do the same, rising energy bills can do this also, in my case for example where I downsized my mini farm because my profits were dust.A bear market can be the trigger but at the same time better prices don't always mean better revenue, 2020 or 2023, 10 or 27k now, and the income per th/s is still 8 cents in both cases.",

Although it favors those who bought bitcoin for less than 100k$.      So it's better to mine in these times when we're still in a bear market because it's still far from 100k$ for every Bitcoin to happen. It turns out that rich people who are open-minded in believing in Bitcoin are really an advantage",

The price is always changing for the devices and it's tedious job, since you do not even recover the investment that has been done on the  machines and you would end up selling them in the losses. Something really does not add up here and perhaps such miners are short term gainers. May be they can turn it off, let the bitcoin price go boom and then fire up the machines again, that might add up something. However, as far as I have played around the BTC mining profit calculator, the picture is entirely different. People are literally requiring the miners to work day and night for straight 2-3 years to have ROI + some good profits. Definitely not sure how they are going with it.",
