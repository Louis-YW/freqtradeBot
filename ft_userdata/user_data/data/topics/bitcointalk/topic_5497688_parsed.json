  "content": "My Trust In You is Broken is a new documentary that was released yesterday. It tells the story of BTCPay Server, its origins, and where they are now. Get to know Nicolas Dorier, the creator of BTCPay Server (who has an account on this forum), who explains his reasons for creating the service. You will also meet other enthusiasts who love the project and contribute to it in various ways.The documentary touched upon the block size war in 2017 and why BitPay needed to be replaced with something trustless, free, and better.It's an interesting watch for bitcoiners, and I recommend you take a look.I will end this with the words of Nicolas Dorier toward BitPay: \"This is lies, my trust in you is broken, I will make you obsolete.\"  You can watch the documentary here:MY TRUST IN YOU IS BROKEN | BTCPay Documentary",

As an advocate for open-source software the documentary resonates with me. I am more comfortable using a software when I notice that is open-sourced than when it is closed source because of course the trust issues, security. Everyone should see the documentary as it encourages the community to become more involved in the bitcoin community. After watching this documentary, I'll have BTCPay server as one of the top options when crypto restrictions is lifted in my country and I am looking for an open-source bitcoin payment processors for by business.",

I became more curious to watch till the end as I saw a place where the documentary captivated on my country's (Nigeria) one time big situation where the trust in the government broke down to pieces.. it was called the #Endsars which I think was very brilliant idea to feature it in the documentary as millions of Nigerians lost interest on third parties and wants to be responsible for their well being since the government failed us.Quote from: Pmalek on May 24, 2024, 07:10:59 PMmy trust in you is broken  This is where best fit to the area which he features Nigeria. My trust in you is broken. It's very interesting I also subscribed to their channel I guess I'm looking forward to seeing more of the updates. Freedom is the goal and bitcoin is freedom without this third parties.",

Watched part of the documentary, will probably finish it this week.However, this constant hatred BitPay is getting ridiculous.They wanted to do their own thing and pushed it (so did a lot of other people) it's over they lost, move on.They are now processing thousands upon thousands upon thousands of transactions a day for people. They have decent service, decent rates, and for a lot of people don't give a shit about cryptocurrency or Bitcoin or anything like that but just want to get as much money or as many customers as possible it's a good service. People send BitPay crypto, and BitPay puts cash into people's accounts. All these self sovereignty services obviously can't do that. And recommending things like BTCPay to people who don't have the time or want to put in the effort to deal with crypto is ridiculous. They want to make an API call, just like they do for visa or MasterCard or discover or any other credit card get a verified payment and move on.-Dave",

Why they are being heavily criticized and regulated by the government is just because the government wants to profit off of these exchanges. They are going to ban it but then after these exchanges give them all they require then they can continue business in the country. The government wants to protect but it will also do anything that can be beneficial financially and economically speaking.",

Using BTCPay means you don't need to wait for someone to allow you to use it. In fact, wherever Bitcoin has been banned or restricted to \"permissioned\" use, this is where people have turned to P2P -- the way Bitcoin is best for using. That's why Iranians turned to Bitcoin, Hong Kongers, Venezuelans.Nigeria has also been the country with the fastest growth in P2P usage for Bitcoin -- so this trend continues. Besides, these laws and licenses and bans, they've never targeted the user, just businesses (read as corporations). You should have as little to worry about as using Electrum.",

It's a fair point that it's easier legally (for countries where Bitcoin is an asset that should be taxed as such). But pushing for Segwit2x when the block size was (and is) such a sensitive topic wasn't a nice step. And I suppose an open-source free alternative (BTCPay) is a nice development. I must say I was unaware of this option until watching the documentary. If I heard of BTCPay before, I probably confused it with BitPay.",
