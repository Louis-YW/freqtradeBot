  "content": "Todays afternoon I was on my bed for rest, in the meantime Royse(the imposter) knocked me by telegram, asking for a favor, so I gladly took interest and then he asked me to send some invoices for him.Then I thought Royse is asking and his Telegram username is also correct, so I went to my wallet and asked his wallet to send money.  But in the main time, I remember if Royse would have asked then she/he would have signed the message.Then again I went to visit his Telegram account,  wait wait!! What I am seeing, this is not username it's just a text linked on the bio.I would like to tell everyone, especially to beginners, be aware beforehand, because nothing could be done later.Always verify or confirm with BitcoinTalk during on any type of transaction, regardless of how well-reputed members are.It will be best to use message signing optionFollow up these things also incase of known faces, as it is possible that his device is in someone else's hands. 1. The starting of drama  2. To make more realistic this drama he(scammer) also created a groupHere those tel address, already changed his user name to tokaiishere *** I would like to say to those scammers- nice try, but it won't gonna be able to harm  Royse777 's reputation and also don't get me into your trap. And the main purpose of this post is to make you aware of the drama of scammers.***",

I sincerely hope that no one will fall into the trap, especially newbies, but I don't think it will work. And apparently, he already switched to another personnality on TG / another scam  This will not affect Royse's reputation in any way, as everyone will soon be aware of the deception and most people dealing with Royse are regulars on the forum and know about this type of scam.I would have liked to give you merits for this useful post, I don't have any more smerits at the moment, but I'll add your topic to my list of topics to merit",

The conversation in the group he created is really so funny  It's good that you were aware of it that helps to not lose the money. The best thing is to avoid them as soon as you know that something is wrong. Just ban them to reduce the same things in the future because I assume they are the same guy/group who is trying this way to make people fool. If they know the way is not working for you they will not come in the future.",

There are lot of scammers impersonating people on telegram. That's how I won a prize in a telegram group and the admin drop a message that winners of the competition should send a DM with his or wallet address. I was not online when the announcement was made, a scammer quickly changed his username to something close to mine and collected the price.The admin felt really bad that he was scammed and wanted to pay me from his pocket and I told him to forget about it.",

Or it's another attempt to ruin Royse777's Reputation?Since the scammer knocked Crypto Library and tried to frame Royse777, he is undoubtedly a forum user. His English is not bad. He must have a good rank forum account since he writes good English. Royse777 is making more enemies every day. You have to be careful, dude.",

The original Royse777 is well known to many people on forums and has a telegram account that is familiar to users who have worked with it (https://t.me/R7BountyQA)The valuable lesson from this kind of fraud drama is never trust anyone who asks anything from you. There are so many scammers posing as established people in forum via Telegram or other social media to lure victims into their traps. Before doing anything you should double check their telegram profile, you will find something wrong there if they are scammers.",

They did get the usernames from his bounty group. A couple of users get the same message from those scammers. One of the victims shared that he got scammed by them. The amount was $11 only. But it could have been bigger than that. https://t.me/R7BountyQA/27322. I hope this was the only Victim who has fallen for their trap. No one else has shared anything yet. I hope nobody else gets scammed by this attempt.If I am not wrong, Royse already removed them from the group. He has to be careful with his clients as well. I suggest Royse777 talk with your client who works with you. Such as Sinbad, Raul, Mixero and others as well. Please make sure they are aware of this situation. They should double-check before they respond to your messages. It may not affect a general user. But, It's a threat for a campaign manager like you. You don't want your client to get scammed.",

If scammers knock me from a different telegram account, I can easily detect it because the old messages are not there anymore. This should be the first red flag. In Telegram, more people impersonate the real thing and then knock on the PM asking for help because of emergencies and we often see this, but for those who already know, it might be easy to detect that a fraudster will definitely knock on the PM first rather than discussion in the group, but the important thing is vigilance we are not to easily trust anyone especially if he sent PM first.Quote from: Findingnemo on April 14, 2023, 04:20:07 PMSo the take from the thread is don't do any trades related to bitcointalk members outside the platform because it's easy to impersonate via telegram like apps so anyone really want to send any message will make us of PM feature available on bitcointalk and then proceed using chat apps for convenience purpose.It's true that it's safer via bitcointalk because it can be verified with the original account rather than outside the forum, obviously it's more of a trap because the fraudsters are ready to prey on who they know or other popular names, even trading on forums is better than other chats, only to keep from prevention only.",

Fake Royse let me know that John Doe asserted he was the one that sent the token yet needs verification. I just shrug it off by asking why someone would be interested in a $10 fraud. After that, fake Royse kicked John Doe and asked if I could send $10 in ETH too, to which I agreed because I was at my computer at the time. So, I sent the ETH, but I started to doubt when he asked if I could pay his invoice too while he was still away from home. This was the only time I made an effort to verify the identity of the real Royse by looking at my chat history. Furthermore I was a victim of that cheap scheme. Perhaps I was not extremely careful because it was just 10 bucks. Fake Royse is currently hiding behind a different profile, which could be the administrator of Fortune Jack. Additionally, I do not like why Telegram allowed its users to share the same username, as opposed to other social media platforms.",

It is very low that they tried to pocket 80 bucks while trying to damage the reputation of a campaign manager at the same time.Stay safe, people.",
