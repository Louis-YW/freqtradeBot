Heard about dogechain but not sure how that sh* works, will have to check them out and get my money out before they get \"HACKED\"Trading in meme coins and NFT may be very risky because the price can pump and dump so easily. But, high risk, high return. Sometimes, if you have been familiar with how these kinds of shitcoins or meme coins working, you can really take the advantage of the dump and pump price. Moreover for this may be promising enough for short-term trading, but not recommended for long-term, because this is too risky. Once more, this way of trading is only for a high-risk taker. Not all people are brave enough to take this such risk. Many people may say about only investing in Bitcoin or top coins. I also agree with this thought. But, I also annot balme the one who take prfoits from day trading or short term trading on meme coins or otehr shit altcoins, because in fact, they can earn so much money from it. However once more, this trading strategy may not be suitable for beginers, because this is too risky.

So far, if that's the amount that you've made then you're doing great.I have never been a fan of these kind of challenges and the reason is that we cannot dictate the amount of profits we can get out of the markets like that, what if the market remain almost static during that time? The only way to reach whatever goal we set for ourselves will be to increase our exposure to the market and use a bigger portion of our capital or to use leverage.Not only that even if it is possible to produce profits as high as the ones as the OP wants to reach this only creates the image that something like this can be done at will and it is not true, so while interesting I would advise against anyone following the footsteps of the OP.",

Even the best of traders cannot make 10x their money in a matter of 20 days. In fact, the best would say that the Average ROI per month would at a max range somewhere around 50-60% for best traders and here you are challenging 10x money in 20 days. Sounds more like a wishful thought to me. As a lot of people have mentioned can you please put up screenshots and information about each of your trades? because then it still looks believable otherwise even I can update edited screenshots of me making 10k in 10 days.",

Try shilling somewhere else please.Meme coins and NFT's may be riskier but it also opens up a bigger opportunity for profits. It's why it's rather famous for newbie investors since the pumps and dumps in those markets are big, so taking advantage of them can prove to have profits in the short term (but ofc, not in the long term). Additionally, I think OP is just joking or memeing around since it isn't exactly weird for an altcoin to rugpull saying they got \"hacked\".
