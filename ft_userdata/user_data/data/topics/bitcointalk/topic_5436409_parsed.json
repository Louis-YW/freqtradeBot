Just need to wait for my vip host to send the bonus. That’s why I said 48 hours.It’s not possible to lose the balance as I am not gambling.

Wish you will get your money back at your desired time. But it is highly risky. Have good luck both of you. I will follow this link.BTC price is currently around $22 900. So 0.017 btc is worth $390. 390 / 220 = 1.77At the current prices that's a @1.77 bet of $220. If Edwardard thinks there are more chances than 1 / 1.77 = 56% to be paid, ie a little bit more than 1/2 chances, that could be a rather good opportunity. We'll see that in 2 days. Personally I'm little bit surprised that a VIP diamond 3 needs a loan for a such small amount. Anyway good luck to tem.",
