It’s so unfortunate to see a scam with mining materials, be careful guys and always DYORyou have a big issue reading english , I never said you shouldn't lookup the domain name ownership and the phone number you talking about is non of ours and that number doesn't even show on other domain lookup website , so double check you finding before accusing other of something you can't even prove  , and the fact that we left the information public it proves that we are legit , as i mentioned in last comment , if we were to hide our company details , then it cost $10 to purchase domain name privacy service , and could you explain the reason calling me a scammer without a proof ? if there anything more secure as an online payment than Credit card and paypal ? how can you call me a scam when customer  are eligible for a refund up to 6 months ? the only thing you showed people here is hate toward others , having no clue what you talking about , trying to police the whole internet , grow up man",
