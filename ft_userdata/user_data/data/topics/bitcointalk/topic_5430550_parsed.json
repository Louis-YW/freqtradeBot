I still do not know clear about the Wrapped token but I think that Wrapping a coin allows it to be used on a non-native blockchain. Wrapping a token is essentially swapping one token for another token in an equal amount via a smart contract, or code on the blockchain that can store and send funds. but still I do not know the clear cut meaning and also use of The wrapped Tokens.",
