If you do want to shill it is fine, but you should be upfront about it.If you truly want to look for more information about it, better wait until it becomes popular and has a decent amount of users before you start considering using them. At the very least, you should check out their legal information. As of now, you can at least confirm that it is a website/app published by Exechain. This company is also not popular as far as I'm aware, not sure if you can even trust their public filling information.",

They use some fancy blockchain magic to make sure everything is out in the open and can't be messed with. And get this, you can even buy some crypto using regular ol' bank transfer or with your trusty debit or credit card.Quote from: dr.hopkins on April 04, 2023, 06:01:16 AMOne of the downsides of forex is the high fees and commissions charged by brokers. XGo, on the other hand, offers daily interest on my assets with zero fees.",

Why did you say that it is safe? Where did you get this conclusion? For me, I prefer the 100 popular exchange platforms in CMC or CG, as there are many popular exchange platforms that contain trading on the margin. I think you have chosen the XGO platform by seeing one of the advertisements about it. After I reviewed this platform, I did not find a large community of it on Twitter or Telegram, there is only one updated article about the platform on Medium, and I did not find enough articles and reviews about the XGO platform in the search engines. Me, I never take a risk on an unrated exchange platform like this.",
