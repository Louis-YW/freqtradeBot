  "content": "2009 when Bitcoin was new, I mined some Bitcoin, then on XP. Now I am using W7. I still have the XP disk, it is intact and all data is backed up. Q1 How can I move this to my W7.Q2 How can I convert some Bitcoin to national currencies. I am a pensioner now and need the money.I live in China of medical reasons, but all my fiances are outside China so I have no problem with China regulations, but I have to use a proxy.",

I don't remember the issues in detail anymore but I had to use some intermediate versions of Bitcoin GUI/Bitcoin Core to finally migrate my old wallet.dat to a current Bitcoin Core version.@kiwino1, don't rush it and do the migration only in a safe computer environment, definitely not your daily internet machine. I don't know how tech savvy you are but you don't want to risk loosing your BTCBTC due to poor computer safety. Assuming you mined solo early in 2009, that means if you hit a block, you hit 50BTC at once which is a lot in today's fiat!If my assumption is correct, be careful of what kind of help you are offered, especially when you receive private messages in this forum.First learn how to manage a wallet in a safe computer environment regarding the potential value of your coins in your old wallet. It's good you have backups, keep it that way. Never work with your wallet file without having multiple backups.",

I followed the advice from nc50lc, fond the \"wallet.dat\" and get the message. \"Fel Unsupported Chainstate database format found. Please restart with -reindex- chainstate. This will rebuild the chainstate database\"I dont understand it, and what do I do now. Bitcoin Core stops with this message and I can not go on???The message is instructing you to add that command line parameter to rebuild your UTXO set that is somehow unsupported.Have you updated from an old version to the latest version?Anyways, to start Bitcoin Core with --reindex-chainstate in Windows7:Before doing so, make sure that you haven't enabled \"prune block storage to\" settingbecause it'll require you to redownload the blockchain. (as well as when importing the wallet.dat file)Go to the directory where Bitcoin-qt.exe is installed, Hold 'SHIFT' and right-click on an empty space in windows explorer ('Bitcoin' folder) to view an expanded right-click menu,select \"Open command window here\".A cmd window will appear, type: bitcoin-qt.exe --reindex-chainstate and Bitcoin Core will start.Let it finish the reindex process, then proceed to import your wallet.dat file.You can also follow these instructions but use --reindex-chainstate instead: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405156.msg60550646#msg60550646",

To my knowledge there's a forum rule that doesn't allow this and there's particularly no need to do it either. You can edit your first post and simply add what you would've written in the second post. It's not rocket science...I'm aware that you might have a pressing problem with your old wallet, but breaking forum rules won't help you in that matter. Just a friendly advise for newbies.",
