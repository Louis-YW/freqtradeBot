Â In fact, a net score of 0 inclusions is all that is required, for example: Â If Alice and Bob are both on DT1, and Alice includes Claire while Bob excludes Claire, Claire will be left with a net score of 0 DT1 inclusions, but that's all that is required for Claire to gain DT2 status. Â In this example Claire's reviews will be displayed as \"Trusted Feedback\" if the user viewing the forum has the default Trust System settings.Of course anyone can change their own Trust System settings, including the trusted depth of your included members' inclusions. Â This is a good way to customize how you see \"Trusted Feedback.\" Â However, this is not something most newbies do when they first join the forum. Â I don't know what percentage of members use custom trust lists, but I suspect it's on the low side of total active members.I have mentioned my opinion about this in the past, but I'd rather not sway the voting by expressing it in this post. Â I do encourage anyone with an opinion to share it here.",

      "body": "What does DT2 mean?We know how it works. If you list someone in your trust list, they are DT1 for you regardless of who have distrusted them. If they have someone on their trust list, they become DT2 by default (keep the default trust depth apart). So, your 1 inclusion is enough to make someone DT2 for you unless they are on your distrust list.The same also applies here. But with net score as zero it doesnâ€™t make sense but you need something in between +1 (DT2), -1(off DT2). I don't think this makes a lot of sense. You can't make someone DT status as neutral, something like neither shown nor hidden by default. I donâ€™t know if I was able to make sense but that's the case here in my opinion.",

Â You obviously know that the Trust System is customizable, or you wouldn't have customized your own. Â This wouldn't change anything for those of us who've customized our trust lists, it would only have effect on those who have not customized there's, i.e. newbies and those who've yet to bother.Here's an example of why I think this is worth discussing; I recently included a member into my trust list who's not very active but has been here for a significant amount of time, and seems to have a good head on his shoulders. Â He came to my attention when he questioned me about a tag I left for a suspected scammer, suggesting that I may have jumped the gun. Â His concern was admirable, and showed restraint. Â I've had the same concerns in other situations. Â After looking through the reviews he left for others, and reading some of his posts I decided I wanted to see his reviews in my custom trust system.Since I'm on DT1, now that I've added him he's on DT2. Â My actions have an affect of the trust lists of the majority of forum users. Â I don't believe that I alone should have that power. Â If some other DT1 member feels the same way about said user, then great, I'm not alone.Also, if Bob believes he should have that power, that would make Bob specifically the type of person that I say shouldn't have it.Quote from: LoyceV on June 24, 2022, 06:00:01 PMCode:-1: 2723WTF?@LoyceV, any way to tell how many members have a custom trust list?",

Really appreciate it.Have you asked hilarious about this? Considering the 2 years between feedbacks, he might not even have noticed he left feedback from 2 different accounts.Since hilariousetc has DT2 strength (8), DireWolfM14's proposal isn't going to change this.",

      "body": "Here is another nuance with the new proposals: DT1 lottery.(double check the math below before making long-reaching conclusions, as it could be completely wrong because Saturday and... you know...)If there are 125 candidates to select DT1 from (AFAIK typical these days), the chance of any candidate to be in DT1 in any given month is 80%. Under current rules, that's also the chance of a DT2 member to be in DT2 if that DT2 member has bare minimum of inclusions (one).If we bump this up to two inclusions, then even if a DT2 member has the required minimum of inclusions (two), their chance to be in DT2 is ~64% since they need both of their \"includers\" to be in DT1 at the same time (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).Of course it gets more convoluted once you add exclusions and/or more inclusions. For example someone with one inclusion and two exclusions (barely out of DT2 under current rules) still has a ~16% chance to \"sneak\" into DT2 if one of their \"excluders\" is not in DT1 (20% chance) and their \"includer\" is in. Adding two required \"includers\" drops that chance to ~13% (0.64 * 0.2 = 0.128).If the DT1 candidate pool is 150, then the numbers above change from ~ 67% to 44%, and from ~ 33% to 15%, so a larger pool appears to make the proposed rules even tougher. But this doesn't consider the increased chances of someone being included or excluded by a potential DT1 member because there are more potential DT1 members.",
