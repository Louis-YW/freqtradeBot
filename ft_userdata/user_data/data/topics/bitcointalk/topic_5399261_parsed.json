  "content": "NFT? ü§∑ No! üî• NRT (Non-Refundable Tokens) and Barter Anti-Crisis Economy (NRT MarketPlace). By developing a real people's currency that cannot be stolen, we must abandon the individual property and speculative assets like NFTs and other coins. Since the value of real assets should not be based on faith. Therefore, when issuing non-speculative assets, users must transfer the asset to the common ownership of the social corporation Umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è and issue a unique token (NRT) or NarCoin currency (NRC$). And leaving behind a virtual property that will be used to transfer property between people. Therefore, we will accumulate the assets of all participants and make a closed ecosystem. In which we will build a stable economy of common sense that will not be subject to crises.Share your thoughts and ideas.Let's Make Economics Great Again!",
