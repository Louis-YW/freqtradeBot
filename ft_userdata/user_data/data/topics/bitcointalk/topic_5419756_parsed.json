  "content": "I am going to create another poker game, this time simpler, and I want to pay with some funds I have in the casino.They are about 0.0016 Bitcoin and the doubt I have is if I pay the winner directly from the casino, or will it be better to withdraw those funds to my personal wallet and from there pay the winner. The disadvantage I see to this second option is that there will be two transactions to pay and two fees. I don't see much disadvantage to the first one but I don't know if you have something to say about privacy or something. AFAIK when you deposit in a casino, they create an address for you but those deposits are consolidated in one address (or several) where they centralize the funds and from there they pay, so I don't think there is a privacy problem.Do you see any problem to pay the winner directly from the casino?The reason for wanting to pay with some casino funds is that in the first game I created at the end I wanted to give a second prize that the winner did not want to receive:Quote from: tokeweed on November 06, 2022, 01:27:35 PMI don't care about the prize tbh.... Just make a football bet with the prize or something and we watch the match.  That'll be something that's going to make us happy.  Quote from: Poker Player on November 06, 2022, 01:48:47 PM...If I win the bet, I think the prize will be around $35 in Bitcoin. I could create another game about poker but this time much more simple: It would consist of a hand but instead of making an analysis, it would be a matter of guessing that hand, the opponent's hand. That way it would be more fun and people who do not have much idea could participate, being able to perhaps guess correctly if they say a random hand. So apart from asking for your advice, I encourage you to play when I create it, probably next weekend.",

That should be nothing compared to casino withdrawal fee.Just note that you should use a non-custodial wallet that allows you set the fee rate yourself and with 1 sat/vbyte, your transaction may take a long time to be confirmed. (You may have to pay more fee if you want your transaction to be confirmed faster.)",

Provided they give you a brand new address if they want to then there is no risk to their privacy, and they can always just mix the coins after they receive them if they want to break the link to a casino.For you - maybe. Depends on the casino. I know there are some which state in their terms that you should only ever deposit or withdraw directly to/from your own addresses, so you would need to consider the risk of having your account suspended. Would also depend on if the casino uses blockchain analysis and the address the recipient gives you has previously been linked to a darknet market or something like that. You are probably safer withdrawing to your own address first.You have to pay the casino withdrawal fee regardless. As pointed out above, a second additional transaction will cost less than 200 sats in fees.",

After the comments, I think it doesn't really matter, but as the fees are low I'd better withdraw to an address of mine first.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on November 07, 2022, 08:11:07 PMFor you - maybe.

How are they going to know if the address is mine or not? Do some casinos really use blockchain analysis? I know you are more concerned than I am about privacy (although I am to some extent) and you reminded me of something I said in another thread;Quote from: Poker Player on September 25, 2022, 06:46:24 AMQuote from: yhiaali3 on September 20, 2022, 07:43:10 PMWe, Europeans, aren't really worried about privacy...It's funny because I was thinking that, regarding the privacy debate, which is very much in vogue. It probably has to do with history and culture. The American settlers had a lot of privacy when they lived alone with their family, bible and rifle, and no one else for miles around. What they didn't have was a social life. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.",

Or they might see the user posting the address on a public forum such as this one. Or perhaps after your competition the user signs up to the same casino and deposits from that address, leading the casino to conclude you are alt accounts. Or their blockchain analysis firm has also linked the user's address to a different set of KYC data via an exchange or other centralized service they also work with.If the casino is strict in this regard (although they may well not care), is it worth the risk for the sake of a second transaction costing <200 sats?Quote from: Poker Player on November 08, 2022, 04:26:14 AMDo some casinos really use blockchain analysis?Absolutely. Depends on their jurisdiction obviously, but various governments still mandate that they have to enforce AML compliance just like centralized exchanges, which pretty much by definition means they have to take part on blockchain analysis.",

The vast majority of crypto casinos, at least the ones that advertise on the forum have a license from a tax haven, typically Curacao, and some are not even licensed. Gradually they have been implementing more KYC/AML measures, at least in their ToS, but I think this is more to save face than anything else. I say this, because for example I have read the ToS of a casino in which I deposited and bet, that said they required KYC for if you have in the account more than $2k or total movements for more than $2k but then they allow you to create an anonymous account and bet whole bitcoins. At that same casino, someone closely associated with it confirmed to me by PM that he had not seen a single instance of KYC in several years. And that casino is no exception.Quote from: LoyceV on November 08, 2022, 05:47:18 AMIsn't that to avoid complaints, given the fact that some exchanges (such as Coinbase) don't allow their users to interact with casinos?After your comments in the thread, it is clear to me that I will first withdraw to my wallet and then pay the prize. But about this I want to say that I have cashed out from several casinos in signature campaigns and I have also deposited and withdrawn in some of them, I have never had any problem in spending those funds. I'm not saying that it can't happen in the future, and I have never thought of putting them in Coinbase or similar site.",
