These young Lads could think and put up a system that raked in billions of dollars and not just that they came into the picture and challenged Binance and became the 2nd largest exchange in the world. If you ask me, this folks are highly intelligent and have further challenge my thought pattern 🤔. I'm here raking my brain 🧠 what I can do differently 🙃. Be challenge folks and stop playing small. Cheers ❤️",
