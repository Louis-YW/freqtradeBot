You will read many criticism or just hilarious and jealous comment that Bitcoin investors got profit because they were lucky.In this thread, I simply give you two charts of Bitcoin and Gold.Let me emphasize, it is not a comparison about Bitcoin and Gold, but my intention is to share a fact that intelligent investors got profit by their intelligent knowledge and decisions for investments, then good capital management. They did not get profit simply because of luckiness. Their profit did not come to them like airdrops without any knowledge and their own serious efforts with time.See two charts and discover a fact that intelligent investors bravely buy in bear markets, when most serious tests on their belief and mentality. Price did not hold if there are not strong believers and investors. It's not luckiness for Bitcoin, Gold and their investors to hold price in bear markets and tested in many bear markets in history. Their cycles can be longer or shorter but you can see how psychology of market cycle works.People say Bitcoin is too volatile but see the chart, and discover that Gold gets a correction about 40% and it needs about 10 years to have another bull run.Each market has its own cycle and discover powerful effects of holding your bitcoins as you can see there.Bitcoin market is like other markets, has its cycle. Focus on its cycle!HODL bitcoins, you can do it! Look at HODL camp map to build up strong handsChoose All to zoom out these chartsCoindesk Bitcoin Price IndexGold continuous contract",

Well, Kudos to Bitcoin Maxis like Natalie Brunell ..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViqK_N2qIMGemini Summarization:“This video is a debate between Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin enthusiast, and Peter Schiff, an economist who argues for gold. The debate is about whether Bitcoin or gold is a better investment.Brunell argues that Bitcoin is a superior investment to gold because it is:Not controlled by any one entity: Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, not controlled by any government or bank. This makes it immune to manipulation and seizure.A hedge against inflation: Bitcoin's supply is capped, which means that inflation cannot erode its value over time.Easier to store and transport: Bitcoin can be easily stored in a digital wallet and transported anywhere in the world.Schiff argues that Bitcoin is a worse investment than gold because it is:Volatile: The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in recent years.Not backed by any intrinsic value: Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by any physical asset.A bubble: Schiff believes that the price of Bitcoin is currently in a bubble and that it is likely to crash in the future.The video also discusses the recent rally in the price of gold. Schiff believes that gold is a good investment because it is a safe haven asset that tends to perform well during times of economic uncertainty. Brunell acknowledges that gold has a long history of being a valuable asset, but she believes that Bitcoin is a better long-term investment.Overall, the video is a good overview of the debate between Bitcoin and gold as investment vehicles.”BTC>",

In my early days, I read several documentaries and news about the volatility of Bitcoin; what I learnt was how skeptical most people were... ain't gonna lie, this Somehow made me retract - until the worst happened when I decided to HODL for the first time...First of all, I made a wrong choice of wallet...Imagine HODLing some coins - out of doubtfulness and DES-peration - in a centralized exchange! I enjoyed the last few weeks of the bull market and boooomm, everything reduced in half! What a terrible way to start..and yes, I bought and HODLed during the bull market.Edit: I've learnt alot ever since I joined the forum, honestly  Edit 2: Quote from: The Cryptovator on April 18, 2024, 08:34:58 PMWithout proper knowledge and marker research, we shouldn't make any kind of investment decisions, either on Bitcoin or in real life.

I don’t think they say it because of jealously, it’s just the truth. Gold is also volatile, but you can’t compare it to Bitcoin in such context. Imagine how much Bitcoin flew this year, meanwhile Gold is taking it slow and steady. There are people who don’t like Bitcoin because of spontaneous price movements. Because in actual sense, if it can go up so fast, it CAN come down even faster. And certain people who don’t like the thought of that rather prefer to invest in assets like Gold.",

How is Bitcoin resistant to manipulation? Even its capitalization is only 1/10 of gold's capitalization, if gold can also be manipulated then bitcoin is nothing. Just one fake news about war causes bitcoin to be dumped, if that's not manipulation then what is? The smaller and unregulated the financial market is, the easier it is to be manipulated, don't stubbornly deny it. I also do not deny that many people have high professional qualifications, they have very good vision and can somewhat predict part of the future. But that doesn't mean they don't have luck on their path to success. Even Satoshi did not dare to say with 100% certainty that bitcoin will be successful, so no one is talented enough to know what the future of bitcoin will be like. Predictions are just predictions, there will be people who predict correctly and there will be people who predict wrong. If the prediction is wrong, they will be silent, but if the prediction is correct, they will scream and start showing everyone that they are good. Do you see anyone who dares to affirm and swear that what they say will definitely happen, or do they always say it's just speculation and not investment advice? If it's not based on luck, then what is?",

They can start generalizing that bitcoin investment isn't profitable, while their delayed action is the cause of their misfortune.",

A piece of land was detected by a farmer near my father's farmland and it was filled with Gold, I wish this never came out but to my surprise the rumor leaked out and just few days later the government people came and take over the land even while the farm paid fully for the land.To me this is a day light robbery, but anyways, when a precious stone or gold is detected in a land it automatically belongs to the country, I did screamed out land saying they should try doing this same act with Bitcoin, I got angry but controlled myself later.Every Bitcoin dip is a blessing, if people don't see it this way they don't understand what they are investing their money on, I am used to longing for a last bear market so that I can keep buying, but it gets harder to buy when the price just keeps going up and up.",
