  "content": "I'm not sure why we are not talking it here while its about to go China vs US war already because of Nancy Pelosi trying to visit Taiwan. The Chinese government will always assume this visit is to convince DPP to fight as US are trying to arm Taiwan.  Xi had warn US telling: \"Those who play with fire will perish by it\"Should she visit or not? This is no a poll though  or something we can bet, Just want to hear some reasons from you whether we are expecting another war or not.",

He didn't really add a reason why Pelosi should go.One that most are aware of is that there are already fleet out there like a stand off. And China will look at this as invasion to Taiwan knowing that US has no business over there. But a diplomat and goes there along with the military fleet, this is way beyond playing fire. Remember there is a warning. I wouldn't look at it as a bluff when Orientals says this to someone they know are always offensive to them.",

The USA has been sending their troops all around the world to maintain their training from actual war and to get ready once a major war will broke out. This is what China lacks and their main goal is to reach 2035 to become the most advanced troops all around the world, they might be taunting the USA now, but they cannot execute any first move since they don't really idea how will it end up.",

Because of her history of holding a memorial for all the victims who died at the hand of China communists in the Tiananmen Square 1989 right in the place itself, in 1991 (pic).No wonder China feels so insecure and against her trip to Taiwan. Now, she landing in Taiwan safe and sound. I never knew Pelosi was this based. A milestone victory for Taiwan's independent movement and democracy around the world. After Russia invaded Ukraine, many people believe in democracy, in a country's sovereignty shocked by how blatant it was. A big country can bully and force their way, invasion another country if they want without anyone to stop it. And we talked about how China might do the same with Taiwan. But this is like a quell of thirst in the desert for those who believe in democracy, in the free will of people to decide their fate.",

You can't find a date about it because 180 countries out of 200 recognize it as part of China including US government.  They tried to confuse the people the Biden as if not supporting Pelosi going there and its just Pelosi's decision. Of all people, its this lady who had not done any right thing. But this is a template just as how they did it on Ukraine that after Kamala's visit  Russia goes for Ukraine. Taiwan reunification will also tart soon.its just a moment if US attacks first when China Taiwan unite without a fight.But China isn't stupid to attack, they've got more to lose than US as recession will crumble itself.",

Of course, we all know Taiwan is already gone. This trip just delays the inevitable. I strongly doubt that insinuation because President Tsai sees her coming in a different light and looks honored to have been paid such a visit. For her, Nancy's visit means that democracies can still stand together amid challenges. Taiwan only seeks to be recognized by the world as a country and not some renegade country as Beijing calls them or a bounty as China sees them. And should the US get involved in this, China will find it difficult to crack Taiwan.",

This could be a similar incidence tryna repeat itself since such has happened before in 1995. (Although there was no Pelosi back then), but the US countered such an attempt then. What I'm most worried about now tho is should China decide to get serious, can the US make good on their promise of 'solidly' been behind Taiwan as Nancy's visit was meant to imply?At present, China wields enough naval power over the US and seem to have marked their territorial hold over Taiwan. What mistake can Xi make that Biden can take to his advantage?",
