All these BTC prophets of doom will be gloating should a thing as tragic as BTC crashing should ever occur. I doubt it would fall although investors will be panicking, thinking that another Feb, 1st 2011 wants to repeat itself.

I read their comments and shake my head at their ignorance. I've gone passed that age of caring anyone. It was in 2018 that their jabs gave me a second thought about this industry as I was virtually new then. Now, I'm made of steel. I know Bitcoin won't disappear that way. Various financial institutions and governments know that. If ignorant individuals refuse to up their knowledge on Bitcoin, that's their kettle of fish and their loss.Even if I get to read, \"Bitcoin finally dies\" or in a worse scenario \"Bitcoin, the world antichrist\" I will be the least moved.",

I think this advice is not for beginners alone, it goes to everybody who is into the cryptocurrency market, you can not expect to get positive results every time, especially in bitcoin, the market is in dip you have to endure so when everything gets better every investor will also be happy. Most people who panic when the market is in dip are mostly those who may be used their life savings hoping that Bitcoin will make them millionaires overnight, good advice the bull should be for those who endured the dip.",
