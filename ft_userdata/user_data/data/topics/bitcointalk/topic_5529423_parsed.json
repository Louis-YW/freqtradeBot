I'm not sure I understand that part.If by taking \"your investement to another level\" means you're going to be investing more as well, then a hardware wallet is definitely what you should go for here.Now I'm assuming what you mean by \"even my wife and children\" can access is after you pass away, or in case of an emergency? If the meaning is that you want them to have access at all times, and use the wallet, then I'm not sure a hardware wallet is what you want here. Not if they'll be spending from it on a regular basis.",

Don't bother storing your funds on centralized platforms as you should remember not your keys not your coins. They literally would give you a digit of your balance but they indirectly own your coins. Paper wallet is good but old and if not properly store might be lost to damage.. about sharing your BTC holding with family..Though it would get to a point where you have to tell someone you trust about your BTC holdings, for now I'll advice you keep it to your self for security reasons. Even though you trust your family so well, you can tell just your wife so she would be aware of such assets..",

Make sure you protect the seed phrase. About wallets, the safest are paper wallet if you operate it offline, and wallet on airgapped devices. Next are reputed hardware wallets which are also secure.

I always tell people that buying a hardware wallet for $100 is like buying a steel safe to hold a similar amount of money. Don't spend more than 10% of your investment on security or it will make no sense. If you hold $1k or less, don't waste time on hardware wallets just buy yourself a decent mobile wallet that allows you to store a seed phrase. Personally I use Electrum, but I've tried other options like Blue wallet. If you're investing more, like $10k+ get a hardware wallet. It's worth spending a few hundred to protect a few thousand, right?",

I recommend purchasing a hardware wallet. Exchanges are not wallets. Using a centralized exchange to store your bitcoins is a big mistake because then you don’t have access to your keys which means you don’t have true ownership of your bitcoins.  Recent events should make everyone withdraw all their coins to their own wallets",

If you're not investing in altcoins, Electrum would be sufficient as a Bitcoin wallet. A hardware wallet is not an absolute necessity. Don't forget to back up your Electrum wallet to a flash drive or a hard disk. Don't leave your funds on central exchanges, as there's no secure side to that.

It's tricky since you want to consider durability and whether you can spend those easily in the future. At very least,1. Avoid centralized exchange since they may be hacked, close their business, perform exit scam or doing shady stuff (e.g. charging fee for idle fund).2. Whether you choose software, hardware or paper wallet, make sure to write very detailed guide and make multiple backup (including the guide).Although looking at past decade, Bitcoin Core and Electrum may be good choice since they still active in development and have good backward compatibility.",
