The designation, a form of sanction, will require special reporting for any financial transactions.The Treasury Department’s action, using one its most powerful weapons to combat illicit finance, represents a significant regulatory step meant to shape the future of the global financial system. “Today’s action underscores Treasury’s commitment to combating the exploitation of Convertible Virtual Currency mixing by a broad range of illicit actors, including state-affiliated cyber actors, cyber criminals, and terrorist groups,” said Wally Adeyemo, deputy Treasury secretary. “More broadly, the Treasury Department is aggressively combating illicit use of all aspects of the CVC ecosystem by terrorist groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.”\"___The games are over.

Now the owners of cryptomixers face a very serious charge, for which in the USA you can get a life sentence in a very harsh prison.Does this have anything to do with the current war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel? I mean, has it really been revealed that Bitcoin mixing operations were carried out by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad?In any case, the United States has been seeking from the beginning to link Bitcoin mixers with terrorist groups and money laundering, and now it seems that this is a very good opportunity for them.Of course, no one denies the possibility of terrorist groups using mixers, but sentencing life imprisonment in a harsh prison simply for using a Bitcoin mixer seems extremely cruel and far from justice and logic.",

But there has been pressure from some lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren for the crackdown on privacy services providers to curb the perceived flow of funds.  Quote from: hugeblack on October 24, 2023, 11:25:15 AMQuote from: zasad@ on October 23, 2023, 09:41:39 AM\"The Biden administration is set Thursday to designate international “mixers,” cryptocurrency exchanges that provide customers anonymity, as money-laundering hubs that threaten national security.

For them, ousting Palestinians and funding Israel's genocide is something that has to happen fast, because they know the tide is turning against them. The new generation, be it from a conservative or progressive upbringing, they are all against war abroad. Younger people don't want all this military spending, they don't want soldiers abroad, they don't want a military industrial complex. And more than anything else, they don't want billions spent on a murderous state with criminal leadership. In 10 or 20 years, unless Israel moves away from its murderous Zionist agenda, it's going to lose all support. So it's really vital for politicians to rile up crowds by re-creating the ghost of \"terror-financing\". Just as they did with iraq, then touting weapons of mass destruction...Deep inside they know that crypto is the most peaceful form of money. They know that throughout 74 years of NATO's existence we've only seen more terrorism, more dictatorships, more destruction and overall more violence and conflict. So they're really afraid of crypto gaining more momentum, because it has the potential to pull the rug under politician's feet if people decide to rise against them and their blood hungry agendas.",
