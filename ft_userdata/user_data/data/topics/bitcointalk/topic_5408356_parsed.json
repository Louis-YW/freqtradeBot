  "content": "Whale Whale is one of the biggest acquatic mammals which has respect,prestige and guided by other aquatic animals. In this context of crypto currencies whales are big boys and girls, that is the wealthiest people in crypto currencies, or those who own the highest crypto currency in their custodian are called whale.                       Individual Whale   In my research on crypto currency (Bitcoin) whales,I discovered four persons including Satoshi Nakamoto, who is the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi's BTC is estimated at the rate of one million bit coin which is approximately value as $4,500,000,000 as of the current bear market.    The remaining three whales (Billionaires of bitcoin) are from (1)Binance  (2) Bitfinex with another wallet that the identity is unknown. The three addresses are estimated own more than 575,000 bit coin.Nobody is an island. The others are Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron. Whales influence the market for Bull and Bear.  Whale  Companies:Institutions,corporations, organizations and firms own the second stage of bit coin. Such firms are (1)MicroStrategy (2) Tesla (3) Galaxy Digital Holdings.  There are two companies that exist and own bitcoin,they are public and private companies. Public Companies: These companies are own by the state (countries) government in the world. Public companies own over 216,038 BTC.Private Companies: These are companies own by individual or group of people. Private companies own over 174,068 BTC. Governments: Government am over the world own bit coin estimated about 259,870 BTC.   These are the whales in the bit coin Eco-system in the moments.  The total amount of bit coin mined is 21 million.                  BULLBull is a land animal that has horn. Bull market,why bitcoiners use this animal in the crpto space is because it fights with its horn from downward to upward. It is because of the downward attached to the upward (rising) attached with its opponents, that is it fights from lower level to upper level,therefore,bit coin investors start from the lower to the upper level. Therefore,when the bit coin market is going up it is called \"BULL\" At this stage people laugh.               BEAR Bear is one of the powerful land animal on earth. Why bear is used in crypto space ? Bear fight with its opponent from upward and press with full force. So bear in bit coin that is in bear market means, the price of bit coin is coming down drastically from top to down.At this stage users cries but even at this stage some people rejoice because they will buy it at a cheaper rate. Finally in all stages of Bit coin market some users are happy and some users are sad. When it is higher (BULL) some can't buy again and when it is lower (Bear) the big investors will not be happy, therefore,it is vice-versa",

Better yet, I will post it here for you:Code:[list][li]The coin is called bitcoin, not bit coin.[/li][li]It's cryptocurrency, not crypto currency.[/li][li]It's ecosystem, not eco-system or eco system.[/li][/list]Quote from: Frankolala on August 01, 2022, 03:53:40 PMFinally in all stages of Bit coin market some users are happy and some users are sad. When it is higher (BULL) some can't buy again and when it is lower (Bear) the big investors will not be happy, therefore,it is vice-versa The value of bitcoin shouldn't demotivate you from buying it. Think about it this way: if you have faith in the coin and what it represents, buying it when it's dollar value is lower than it was a year ago means you get more satoshis for the same USD value. No matter if we are in a bull or a bear market, bitcoins are constantly traded. But it's interesting to observe that when prices are falling, most people don't want anything to do with Bitcoin and forget to load up. Once it starts rising again, they start buying at much higher USD values than they initially intended to. When bitcoin falls, they don't want to buy out of fear that it will fall further, but when it goes up, they buy out of fear of missing the ride to new highs. People are weird that way.",

That's what I think op meant with custodian instead of \"in their custodial wallet\" but I know that some people don't want to use custodial wallets because of thereason your keys not your coin.

I'm just seated at a corner trying to analyze how anyone (individual, I meant) hodling that amount of Bitcoin will feel. Their financial security is guaranteed, I can tell. That's really huge in today's value. It's the same way I see what value BNB is giving to those who discovered it early in 2017 and are still hodling till date. There are also more altcoins that will do same in future. The problem is how to discover them and then trust to hodl them.",

Having 1000 BTC to 4999 BTC is not a small amount of bitcoin, while also humpbacks are one of the whale species, having them together still make the statement correct, but bitcoin is not easily manipulated.",

I also thought that whale is the highest group that have bitcoin. For the custodian. I think OP was trying to say the people that have the highest bitcoin in their custody or have bitcoin in their Wallets. The OP should also take the corrections made by Pmalek whenever he or she is using the terms.",

Well, dude, I'll give out a Merit for your effort. And for the LULZ.   Maybe, you can add one more entry to your \"Symbolism\" list: LAMBO  Lambo is one of the most esteemed cars out there (competitor of Ferrari and Bugatti) and of course, every crypto investor is looking forward to purchase one. By saying \"when Lambo?\" people are figuring out (guessing) how long it will take to HODL until a LAMBO can be bought. The usual answer to \"when Lambo?\" is: \"soon\"Maybe you can also add MOON and write a nice explanation.",

      "body": "Aside from the explanations why certain cycles of the market are symbolized by bears and bulls, perhaps it is also interesting to share how the two animals started to represent certain market conditions not just in stocks but also in crypto. As for the bears, accounts unanimously pointed to the time when bearskin business was thriving. Middlemen, also known as bearskin jobbers or simply bears, used to sell bearskins they don't have yet. So they're hoping that by the time the trappers arrive with the skins, their selling price is low.As for the bulls, there are numerous accounts. It could have something to do with the bloody and brutal bear and bull fighting. It could be traced to the early stock speculators in London as mentioned in Thomas Mortimer's 1769 edition of his book Every Man his own Broker. But the poet Alexander Pope had actually made use of the bear and bull reference in one of his poems as early as 1720.Sources:1. https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/bull-bear-market-names/2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_(stock_market_speculator)#History_of_the_term3. https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-origins-of-the-bear-and-bull-in-the-stock-marketQuote from: 1miau on August 26, 2022, 11:51:45 PMThe usual answer to \"when Lambo?\" is: \"soon\"Well, probably not very soon. Perhaps we need to wait a little more, probably many months after the next halving?
