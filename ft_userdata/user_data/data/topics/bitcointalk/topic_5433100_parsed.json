  "content": "I sent a message to the admins (theymos & Cyrus) a few days ago requesting a username change for a few private reasons we discussed, and I'm glad I got a quick response from Cyrus to make this happen. Igehhh was more than just a username; it was a brand that needed to be safeguarded. I've officially changed the name on all of my Brand documents, both online and offline, and I'd like to use this medium to state that all outstanding bets, legal contracts, Pool and feedback remain valid. I am now officially Igebotz.
