For my clarification, first of all I am a crypto blogger, so I write articles and publish them on different platforms like publish0x. Some days ago, I was banned for publishing an article titled: \"What Is Your Ultimed Goal In Crypto?\"This article was published long ago from my leofinance and publish0x profile.

After that, I tried to follow all the rules and regulations of the forum. In the unofficial rule no 25QuoteBan evasion (using or creating accounts while one of your accounts is banned) is not allowed.[e]Quote If you get banned (temporarily or permanently) and create a new account to continue posting/sending PMs, it's considered ban evasion. The only exception is creating a thread in Meta about your ban.I tried to ban appeal to recover that account. After that I don't create any multiple accounts, I just followed to build only one account at one time and just keep my writing as rules regulation. Your second accusation about the Twitter accounts. See, I build Twitter accounts and vend them in the different marketplace as most of us know, Twitter plays a vital role in marketing in the crypto industry. These Twitter accounts vend in two/three hands before reaching the main client. I don't even know, who the people you mentioned in the thread are. On the other hand, I can give you enough proofs that I've not any kind of link with these accounts. I think your 2nd accusation is just based on hypothysis.",

Now I'm working with only account and focused on only making better posts. Others accounts, I dont even know them.  I think, they just brought my created twitter accounts from different marketplaces.",

Don't prove negative feedback why?As for the twitter accounts, both of those wtsimis quoted tweets now have been deleted after I created this thread and sent DM to all three respective users earlier today. Apart from that I admit that I used \"Possibility\" in my title because the quoted post by wtsimis shows he was owner of the mentioned twitter accounts, any real meme creators would reserve the right to at least watermark his/her contents before handing over his/her accounts to new buyers which were used for meme competitions. In that sense, yes I used \"Hypothesis\" to show possibility of connection between wtsimis, Abdullah56 and Chitar123 . I have learned that transactions often between wallets can't b justified for a valid accusation of alts using but in this case both  Abdullah56 and Chitar123 's wallets are also connected. https://bscscan.com/tx/0x25d8dfe3cf64fad55de9423d8aa805ae6262e9354d9d2e5eca4d44e15eed87e4",

As I told before, I created those accounts and sold them in different marketplaces. They are now handled by many peoples that I even don't know. Basically, I created those accounts and build them until reached a number of followers I used them for my works or needs. Then sell them on different marketplaces. I have proof that I sold those accounts a long time ago. For meme competitions, I submitted my memes through publishing on Twitter. At that time I was building my accounts for future selling. After gathering qualitative followers in Twitter, I sold them. Quote from: invincible49 on May 12, 2022, 11:18:55 PM any real meme creators would reserve the right to at least watermark his/her contents before handing over his/her accounts to new buyers which were used for meme competitions. In our local community, very few memes are in the local language. So, I don't add any watermark, so that anyone from the community can use it openly. I think you don't read the whole translation, which tells that Quote from: wtsimis on October 07, 2021, 07:51:05 PMকোনো মিম তেই লোগো বা কোনো ওয়াটারর্মাক ব্যাবহার করা হয়নি, যেকেউ চাইলে,যেকোনো জায়গয়ায় ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। আর উত্থসাহ পেলে আরো বানাবোTranslationCode:In memes, no logos or watermarks are used, anyone can use it anywhere. And if I get encouragement, I will make more.However, thanks man, for sending me the remainder. I would never know about the accusations if you never send messages. Again, I do have not any kind of link to the last two accounts. And again I'm sorry for my past mistakes.",
