Commentary team is good, stadiums are not that full like the IPL but has a lively crowd and hopefully it will be a great success.Edit: Beth Mooney is struggling with cramps which is not good for GGW and she is walking off the ground.Edit: Disappointing one sided match",

The start of the match is really enjoyable as the score went high above 200 runs. Though it hadn't gained the crowd as the IPL there is good support overall and with more seasons we can expect better progress in terms of crowd as well as in terms of players performance.Gujarat Giants failed to give the tough fight and lost every wickets for just 64 runs. Saika Ishaque bowled well taking 4 wickets. Expected something around 160 runs from Mumbai Indians had good start from Hayley Mathews followed by Harmanpreet and Kerr scoring good runs made Mumbai Indians reach such a good target.",

Gujarat Giants have scored 201/7 with the best performance coming from Dunkley 65 runs and Deol 67 runs. Royal Challengers started good to reach the target and missed by just 11 runs. Though it is loss, the performance is classy with Devine scoring the top runs and runs have come from every bat which is the best of them.",

Mumbai Indians team tops the table based on the net runrate. This match is going to be one of the best matches as the winner will be the topper on the table. Both the teams haven't won toss in all the matches played. With Delhi Capitals, in both the matches opponents won the toss and decided to bowl. Delhi Capitals scored 200+ runs and won both the matches.Mumbai Indians team too lost the toss and in one match it bat first and scored 207 runs and won by a big margin. In the second match won chasing the target of 155 runs in 14.2 overs. This way both are at their best and today's toss have got importance.",

Lanning and Rodrigues have done what is being assigned for them. Rest of them are just numbers to the team. What a worst performance, At 84 Delhi Capitals have lost four wickets. Rodrigues fell at 84, then Lanning, Janessan and Minnu Mani. The team predicted to score big runs finds hard to reach 100. Once again Mumbai Indians confirm its win earlier.",

But that said, a thread on women's cricket was pending for sometime and thanks to Vaskiy for taking the initiative. Women's cricket has become very popular within the last 2-3 years in most of the full member nations. It has come a long way, and until very recently women's cricket used to be confined to England and Australia. And all this was achieved without much help from the ICC, or from the national boards such as the BCCI, PCB, ECB and CA.",

I was really disappointed by her innings in the Semi Final match during the World Cup, now also she isn’t doing anything better. Hope we see the OG Smriti back very soon. On the other hand, you need to praise Harmanpreet for her wonderful captaincy. She knows the task well and doing it with proper dedication and skill. As far the matches are seen, I am guessing Mumbai will take the trophy for sure. Let’s see what happens next.",

She has scored 76 runs from 3 matches so far. Everytime she got in to good starts, but couldn't convert those starts to half-centuries. And to be fair to her, she hasn't received much support from her team-mates. A lot was expected from Ellyse Perry, but she also couldn't contribute much to Royal Challengers Bangalore so far. And the capped RCB players, including Richa Ghosh and Renuka Singh seems to be out of form. RCB are at the bottom of the points table, with zero points from 3 matches. Hopefully they will perform better in the upcoming matches.",

A separate thread for discussing a particular league is a very good imitative. Normally in T20 threads where various t20 sports will be discussed. I think sooner or later everyone will join here. Many may have missed it as the Womens Premier League is not so popular yet but I hope everyone will join here soon. In the next session it will definitely become familiar to everyone. But I think time is not over as there are still many matches left. Sooner or later everyone will come.",
