Please let me know your thoughts.People invest in altcoins because they can give higher returns than bitcoin, and what prevents people from investing in altcoins is the risk, the higher the return, the higher the risk. For me, I view the altcoin market as a gamble where we create projects to pump, dump and then disappear. I don't believe any technology is introduced from pre-alt projects, they are just trying to clone real world technologies. For example, the recent AI trend, when the world technology world went crazy for Chatgpt, the crypto market created hundreds of AI projects that time. While as far as I know, Chatgpt has been developed since 3 years ago, but with current AI projects, it only takes 1 month to complete. And the purpose is just to sell tokens, they don't develop anything.",

Please let me know your thoughts.I'd say more downs for altcoins if Bitcoin will continue to go downhill. Well, the hesitation might be because of the fact that when bear market hits altcoins are the one to be hurt the most. I don't have anything that holds me back from investing into altcoins since I do hold altcoins but I hold back on those who doesn't have strong fundamentals that will make it out for the next bull run.",

Most of them don't develop anything as you said and I am sure most people are aware of this. Simply put it: it is our human greed (yield for higher return) that forges the altcoins development so why can't we just accept it as it is. I am neither going for nor against altcoins and just want to figure out a rational way to deal with altcoins. Anyway, I got your point clearly and thanks.",

The confidence of the market is where they're investing in and that's why that's one of the reasons that holds them back in investing in altcoin and even me, I don't have the confidence currently as they're the most volatile thing in the market, even more volatile than bitcoin.",

Please let me know your thoughts.My fear about altcoin investment is that in as much as it gives a high level of profits, It could also give high level of losses within a short period of time. Again, I do not have good knowledge of the chart and information of which coin to buy and the ones that will not do well. So since I don't have this information, I respect myself and simply invest in Bitcoin where the losses will not be much and there is always the sound believe that even at the losses bitcoin will surely return to profits.This cannot be said about altcoins because so many altcoinsdisappear from losses over a short period of time. But the King will always be there.",

While with bitcoin we know it's going to do well within time, since it's not replaced by other cryptocurrencies, the same can't be said about an altcoin in particular, as they are constantly fluctuating in ranking positions on the market. The currently top 10 cryptos won't remain the same in 1 or 2 years, with the exception of bitcoin and probably ethereum, but all the rest is likely to change. So, altcoins lack solidity, that is a big cons.",

The risk is relatively bigger in investing in altcoins compared to Bitcoin (imo), and projects not really doing anything to fulfill their end of the bargain and is only there to suck up the money of their initial investors isn't really helping me in actually being invested to doing altcoin research. It's also why I'm mostly going for well know altcoins already, it may take a longer time compared to investing into a completely new coin, but it's relatively safer in comparison.",

The thing which would more likely give doubt to people who are planning to invest in altcoins is higher rate of market price volatility compared to Bitcoin. It has something to do with market supply, volume and demand. Most of the newly released tokens' price in this industry are falling upon public or token sale which is a threat for those who are not aware of such possibility or in particular with new investors. Also, it is hard to determine which coin to invest given that not all projects are succeeding in a long run unlike with huge names already which endures market price pumps and dumps.",

Please let me know your thoughts.The most important reason: Coinmarketcap historical data (https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/).Except for some major altcoins, no altcoin can be a long term investment. Most altcoins in the market are trying to fool investors with false promises. Maybe a small part of them set out with good intentions but fail to achieve their goals. Another small part cannot reach its purpose due to the global conjuncture. However, as a result, the vast majority of them are disappointing to investors. In my opinion, investors who do not have enough experience in this market should not invest in altcoins long-term.",

However, I do believe that there are some altcoins with a solid foundation for the next bull run. As an investor, I choose to be cautious and make informed decisions about where to allocate my funds.
