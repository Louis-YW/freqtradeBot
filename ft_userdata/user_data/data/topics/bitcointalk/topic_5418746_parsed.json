  "content": "hey everyone, i'm starting to get more into mining (currently using nicehash) tried both cpu and gpu on the desktop i built. i'm wondering if anyone has any other platform recommendations?i think i would like to try to build a small 6 gpu home rig using 1080s, ant minerÂ  and asic miners seem to be very popular. is one type prefered over the other? what's the difference between the 3 types? if im thinking about it correctly, 6 graphics cards can mine individually not as in a group? and the asic and ant miners are just one unit? any advice is appreciated thanks!",
