In some countries the withdrawal is limited to specific amount which you can't exceed to that amount. But in BTC wallet, any amount can be moved out. And the money in the BTC wallet is very accurately safe without missing any figure or decimals points. Fiat banks are frustrating people in their various countries. But BTC in the wallet safe even in the bear market and the bull market. The only disadvantage of keeping money in the Bitcoin Wallet is the time of purchase and the time of sale. If you buy in the bull and sell in the bear. But if you can endure the bear and enter the bull market again. Then you sell.If you have enough Fiat currency I will advise you to keep it at home, if you don't want to invest in BTC because Banks will frustrate you by cutting your money every week, every month without even doing any transactions.

Keeping fiat money at home means that if the home burns down the money is also gone. Even more, at least in Europe, fiat kept in banks is \"insured by the state/government\" until a limit of 100k/person/bank.What I expect bitcoiners do is to keep in bitcoin the money they afford to hold for more than 4 years and maybe keep in fiat the rest. But everybody should make his own decision whether / how much to invest.The rest, if they have big bucks, they either afford those peanuts the banks are taking, either diversify in gold, art, real estate, stocks, bonds and maybe other things too.",

Precisely it will help us to be able to store our funds more safely than keeping them at home, because they are more prone to theft, unless you have a secure underground bunker. Moreover, most digital banks nowadays do not charge monthly fees for their users and they even provide interest for their customers and protection directly from the government. This can provide relief to customers. The point is using a bank is not entirely bad, but you shouldn't keep all your money in the bank, save some where you feel safe or you can invest in Bitcoin and watch it grow in the next 5 - 10 years or in stablecoins if you want more stability.",

We all love bitcoin here but that doesn't mean we will become negative toward the banking system! There's no need of doing that! Fiat money will anywhichways lose its value over time. But if we keep that in bank, at least some values will be filled in through the interest. The loss will be less if we keep the fiat in the banking system. It's a bad proposal to keep fiat at home.If you don't like banking system, invest that money into stocks, mutual funds, businesses, and whatnot! Why to keep idle money at home? What's the use of it? We will get zero return and the value will decrease over time. With the banking system, you will get whatever return which will help you to cut down the losses. That's an acceptable situation.",

I agree that keeping bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet is the safest way to keep it. But with regard to other types of investments, it's not bad after all to diversify your assets. Why keep your fiat at home when obviously it will be eaten by inflation? And it is the worst way to keep a high amount of money at home. Possible fires, robberies, and all the other possible risks. At least in the banks, fiat is insured up to a certain amount and there's very little interest at least. It is very common if we listen to financial advisors and those rich people on top that we need to invest our money in order to grow or at least fight inflation.",
