The kidnapping — orchestrated by a 65-year-old man identified only by his surname, Yuan — was first reported by the Shanghai Law and Rule Journal. The legal news outlet didn't specify when the incident occurred but wrote on April 18 that Yuan had just started serving his prison sentence.Yuan kicked off his plan by picking up his four-year-old granddaughter from her kindergarten and taking her out to eat and shop without her mother's knowledge, the Journal reported.[1] https://www.insider.com/shanghai-man-kidnapped-his-own-granddaughter-for-72000-report-2023-4[2] https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/grandpa-in-china-kidnaps-own-granddaughter-demands-ransom-so-he-can-continue-gamblingmany gambling addicts have lost their minds because their desire to continue gambling overpowers their common sense, hence the importance of \"gambling responsibly\"QuoteThere are three licensing objectives which support the whole basis of gambling regulation:- that crime should be kept out of gambling- it should be conducted in a fair and open way- children and other vulnerable persons should be protected from harm or exploitation from gambling.[1] https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/social-responsibility",

Keep in mind that gambling should be viewed as some stuff you do for fun, not a way to avoid responsibilities or even as source of your bread and butter",

Since you mentioned there is not much enough details reported by news so we can't really conclude that is the reality or not but at the end of the day the person committed violence is paying back now in prison probably for the rest of his life.",

There's a famous case of a guy who murdered his whole family, including 2 little girls, because he wanted to be free and start a new life. Gambling can be one of the triggers, but it's not the most popular one. Bottom line, there's a lot of insane people out there and many will kill you for your phone or whatever money you have in your pocket. Don't blame their actions on gambling. If they are insane they will steal and kill for whatever reason, gambling just happens to be there when they flip. Stay safe out there!",

I have seen people in some casinos that gamble with all their belongings until they go home with just underwear. But kidnapping his grandchild is going to the extreme. I think he needs to go through some psychiatric tests to check if he is really mentally sound. There might also be other reasons why he decided to commit such a crime. Greed can also contribute to it. Maybe he wants to stake big so that he can win big. It might also be possible that he is indebted to someone and he needs to pay. He should face the consequences of his action but he needs to go through rehabilitation.",

Addiction itself should be consulted to professional especially if daily living is harmfully being affected. Problem is, an addict won't be aware of the state of addiction he/she is into. It is a subconscious response to a drive. Gambling is an addictive activity and the best way is to be preventive, espwcially for the new ones. Everyone wants to be rich and that is an understandable intent in this industry. But keep in mind that in every winner there are thousands or millions of people who have lost too much. And this should be an enough warning to everyone who are having the dame desire.",

Gambling should be enjoyed and it shouldn't be a reason for us to commit crimes. If gambling is already giving us reasons to make mistakes or even commit a sin then it's time for us to quit. As much as possible, we should seek professional help in the early stage of gambling addiction.",

These sorts of devastating and horrendous crimes happen on a much regular basis when it comes to things like drug users. Not that it excuses it in any way and we should always be striving towards making sure no addicts are created if possible, or they're given the tools to self exclude if they get so lost in the addiction. This sort of person is in the league of murderers, that in normal neighborhoods are extremely rare and only achieve media notoriety because it happens so infrequently.
