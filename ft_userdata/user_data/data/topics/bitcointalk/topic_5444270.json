But if bitcoin can decrease to $17000 next, I am buying big amount, it is a good buying price. If it falls back below $16000, I am using the 100% money to buy. This is more than DCA because that price is the list price if bitcoin. Likely bitcoin is not going to $14000 ever again.If the price of bitcoin is still at $18000 to $25000, I will continue DCA.",

I personally find DCA quite boring especially if the price keeps back and forth that result to breakeven even if I’m doing DCA since 16K to 25K. This is what I’m doing now to find a perfect opportunity to purchase at the current trend bottom and not the real bottom because no one can really predict that sweet price for entry.",

You cannot predict whether or not bitcoin will reach $14,000. We are yet to understand the direction of the bearish market, taking the bitcoin price to. Whether we are to witness a $14k price or not. Nevertheless, many investors will be expecting that bitcoin will drop in price to $14k or even less. So that they will have a great incentive to invest more",

So there is still a possibility it may drop to 14k or lower than that.Anything can happen, but that is based on my analyses and how the price of bitcoin has been in history. But let me put it like this: if the price of bitcoin get to $16000 again, will you not buy enough? If you did not, it would only be a missed opportunity of the next bull run, although the price may still fall again and reach $16000, but getting below $14000 is highly not likely at all.

The price crashed from $46000 to $29800 at that time. Did you remember the one that happened during FTX implosion? Bitcoin price crashed from $22800 to $15500. I think that is what OP meant. During the FUD, the price will fall significantly. After the FUD, you can still wait, but you will notice that bitcoin is not going beyond certain price again after massive bear market.",

For example market sentiment and the ongoing trend plays a very important role. 2017 is the best example of everything since we saw literary everything in that year. After SegWit was activated there was a massive FUD campaign telling people that they will lose their money by repeating a keyword called \"anyonecanspend\" lying that anybody can spend your SegWit transactions trying to push the price down. It didn't really work and price went up.On the other hand there was another FUD campaign before SegWit activation where everyone was spreading FUD even some of the US banking cartel joined in talking about the \"end of bitcoin\" and it caused a considerable crash.2 different FUD campaign at 2 different times had 2 different outcome.",
