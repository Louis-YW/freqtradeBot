I think it's just a few years away before more streamers catches on with this technology so it may be a good time build your bag on that. This is just a suggestion and you don't have to follow it blindly.",

      "body": "What about adding some like GALA and PYR? As far as i know that PYR will have its own node for its own blockchain. You will be getting passive income from the node. GALA was also doing the same thing like that. I can say that if gala and pyr can be a potential node in the future if the bullish will come again and those gaming blockchain based play to earn will be massive again. You have a lot of nodes but you must also focus into some kind of projects that based in the different field. GALA and PYR nodes will become a potential nodes for sure.",
