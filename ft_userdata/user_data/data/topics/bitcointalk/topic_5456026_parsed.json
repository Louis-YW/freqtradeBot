  "content": "I distrust him because he give a positive feedback to bbigtart who was previously busted someone wearing double signature. Firstly he didn't give a positive feedback, but the first one is robelneo, I suggest him to change his positive feedback to neutral feedback, but after few posts I realized rby sent a positive feedback to and disagree with my point.But two weeks later someone busted bbigtart was using AI to post, this make robelneo delete his positive feedback and rby change his positive feedback to neutral feedback.Quote from: rby on May 30, 2023, 02:57:49 PMI remember someone warned both of us, but we still proceeded to hand the positive feedback to the user for bursting scam I didn't delete my positive feedback, rather I turned it to neutral while being able to capture the AI writing as a reason to change feedback from positive to neutral. I don't to be hard on my trust list, but I just want to wait for few months to see their progress either they will start to change their habit to leave a positive feedback to a worthy user or not. That's why I not exclude them when they already delete/change their positive feedback before.Now the funny thing rby distrust me, without any solid reason!Quote from: https://loyce.club/trust/2023-06-03_Sat_05.07h/2793139.html~Helena Yu's judgement is Distrusted by:1. NEW rby (Trust: neutral) (336 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)He didn't reach my PM to talk about the reason I distrust him, so I'd better to open a new thread and explain it here.Did I distrust or trust wrong user? did I leave an inappropriate feedback or flag? did I support or oppose a flag? show me.This is retaliation distrust, can this be said as abuse of trust list?",

Him distrusting you wouldn't bear much effect to your account and forum's experience. [No offense, rby]And to answer your question, I think this is the correct way to use the forum's trust system. Though Loyce advise --as you've quoted, so it's established that you're aware about the thread-- to not distrusting someone solely on retaliatory purpose, the trust and distrust list is there to facilitate members of the forum to express their trust toward someone's judgement. Rby did not trust your judgement, and you did not trust his --hey look, you both are backscratchers, congratulation-- he didn't think you leave an accurate feedback and so do you. End of story.Quote from: LoyceV on October 10, 2019, 03:37:17 PM[...]You should add users who left accurate feedback and have good Trust lists to your Trust list, and you should exclude users who leave inaccurate feedback.This means your Trust list should be based on how you value the users' judgement on others, and it should not be based on whether or not you Trust those users (with money) or traded with them.[...]",
