He neither mentioned cryptocurrency nor bitcoin. But when such emphasis are not given, it is safe to assume it is bitcoin. And the most friendly coin for any newbie coming into the crypto space is bitcoin. Even as old as I have been in the market, I do not bother myself to know when and how the big boys (the market movers) enter the market. I have not interest because I am not a day trader, neither I'm I planning to be a whale .My best strategy is to buy and continue to buy with DCA until bitcoin is upto $50k, I'll stop and once a new ATH is recorded, I am selling off. I won't be among those who are going to enjoy bitcoin @ $100k",

Because indeed at this time economic upheaval and all kinds of it and also even political movements can also be one that has an impact on the crypto market. The same is true for the impact on the stock market and other investment assets.and analysis of these matters is included in the fundamental analysis. in which we also monitor the release of economic data for every country and every big company.for beginners a simple advice is to learn technical analysis, fundamental analysis and then sentimental analysis.",

From your points, it shows that you are new into trading and don't understand how the market works. It is better that as a newbie, you should know the fundamental and technical analysis before you can start trading. At first,you should start with little funds that you can afford to lose to have the experience.I will advise you to be careful when you are going into trading because it is as risky as gambling, if you are not a professional. Buy at dip and sell when the price is high,but it will be more nice if you buy and hold for long.",

I don't sure worth following whale signal in cryptocurrency trading, but if the early entry with some altcoin has chance for earning profit but when you late actually floating are waiting for you and need longer time for recovering. I stop following with other trade about signal or their recommended because too risk and some whale publish about their investment after few hours investing and price have reached up.For the beginner better check and research by your self, don't follow the whales signal about coins for trading because has chance for losing your investment and they have ready for getting profit than holding. Beginner should learn more every day and always check about which one potential coins have to buy and coins event for upcoming time to see potential or not for investing.",

Invest on top coins, that way you're sure you're in good hands, hold that until you want to sell it for a certain price where you are happy from the profit you're going to make. Don't rush things up, because it's worth the wait. Don't put all of your money in cryptocurrency, since you gotta have something to spend in your everyday needs.",

Listening to news maybe good strategy but always do our own diligence on our set trades.Agree with your discussion. But, being a newbie in trading you need to have a lot of knowledge and understand the techniques before you start. Take the time to learn about the fundamentals of trading, including different markets, trading strategies, risk management, and technical analysis. First determine how much amount /capital you have spare or surplus to invest, that’s because you might face losses if some of your decisions are not good. Create a well-defined trading plan that outlines your strategy and risk tolerance also. Trading is a continuous learning process where you gain knowledge from your mistakes. Keep up of market news, follow experienced traders, and engage regularly in trading communities where you can learn a lot from the experts and identify your own areas for improvement.",

Buying and selling is not that easy, you should know when to buy and when to sell because some are greedy and forget to take profit most of the time. This can be a very simple strategy but it doesn't work well most of the time, I believe timing and right knowledge is still the key for you to succeed. Trading is not easy, it can be very stressful so make sure to spend some time for this, even DCA can make you stress so be cautious and be responsible with your investments.",

Knowing the rules of the game will take a lot of practice and time to have an in-depth analysis of the market. Going for an in-depth analysis signifies that you’re going to be a regular trader that needs all the knowledge in the market to be able to gain profits. If that’s not the case, just learn the basics of the market. Buy and hodl bitcoin for a long time and don’t panic to sell because of the volatility of the market, at the long run you’ll reap the rewards of your investment.",
