What is the correlation of gender \"diversity\" and Bitcoin?Just give me one good example of \"outside the box\" project other than Bitcoin, though Bitcoin isn't just outside the box, it actually torn the box to pieces, so there is no box anymore to think outside of.",

It's how people lost their money in many scam altcoins. Don't think out of Bitcoin box as many scam altcoin boxes wait you to fall into.How many cryptocurrencies failed?",

Anybody that is thinking out of the box has to bring something better than Bitcoin and as far as the cryptocurrency industry is concerned, nobody has been able to manage that. Most people that try to outdo Bitcoin just end up making an inferior version of Bitcoin.Most innovations that seem to be on the level of Bitcoin can't withstand the test of time. We saw it with NFTs. NFTs were like the new Bitcoin because of the hype but look how it turned out.Blockchain technology is a very interesting one too, perhaps more innovational than Bitcoin Lightening networks and Bitcoin mixers are nice innovations we can talk about when talking about innovations. But when we talk about coins and tokens and NFTs and whatever, nothing has come close to Bitcoin.",

In all these numerous useless altcoins, there is very little innovation and no real use. If you want to open new horizons for yourself, start studying bitcoin, its technology and use bitcoin not as a means for speculation, but as a payment instrument.

But I think most are not decentralized. Despite of it, many people seem to not care at all. Cryptos have gone too far and there are now those so-called \" expansions \" you said which are also known as NFT's. This is great to witness but as expected there are also those scams. I only feel sorry for those who lost big money on them but it might also be their fault for not taking precautions.

Can't you see, there are now bunch of L1 and L2 projects? There are also ZK but IDK if they are different. All I know is they solve scalability issues.",

We haven't seen any specific projects that seek to address the issue of gender crisis because that aspect has nothing or little to do with crypto space since coin development is more of a financial activity rather than it is a gender thing at most.",

That's already a part of shaping the future so there's no doubt we are in an era where more people are getting used to this type of technology and it's not stopping anytime. One thing that inspired me the most is how fast an investment could grow in this industry. I have tried saving in banks and investing somewhere else but you cannot even compare it to how better it is at investing in cryptocurrencies. Risky, that's true. But if you find the right choice then you can multiply your money by 10 and maybe more without hard work.

Being the manager of your own investment is something I just wished for before and now we can really do it by ourselves.During the global bull run, you can randomly invest in any coin you come across and it makes a profit. Noticed this in 2017 and in 2021. Works the same way. The problem with such investments and their investors is that they can't stop and lock in their profits. Want more profits and they keep holding on to their coins without selling them. Then it turns out that when they thought they didn't get enough profit, it was the peak of their coins and it was the best time to sell. Many altcoin investors suffer from the fact that they are unable to lock in profits from their investments in time, they are consumed by greed.",

If you post your own song in SOMESING, a song wallet will automatically be formed, and $SSX will be accumulated in various ways, including gifts, supports, and events in this song wallet. After a certain period of time, you will automatically distribute the coins that you have accumulated in your song wallet to the participants who have enjoyed this song and have contributed to it through smart contract. You can send the token to an exchange who has the token listed and convert it to USDT, just of recent the token got listed on Bitget exchange.",

Not thousand but lower than it. It's hard for the many to be convinced with Bitcoin back in the early time. The price skyrocketing and the adoption from big names is what helped them. BTC is a currency. This is it's primary use but there were also lots of people who use their BTC to activities that you said.There are still people who tries to stop it but they aren't really a big threat anymore. So, there is no need to worry about them. Cryptos may be fast growing but what about when dumping? While other investments are seem to be more stable than it. There is a hard work here.
