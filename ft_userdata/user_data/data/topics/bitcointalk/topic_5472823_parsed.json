  "content": "I'm a big fan of slots and I have two or three favorite slots that I play usually. When it comes to RTP and risky slots I prefer Pragmatic as the provider. One interesting thing I have noticed is the difference in winning chances between playing in demo mode and live mode at casinos.For example last week, I played several bonus buys on the popular Sweet Bonanza slot which is known among gamblers. I played on Coins.game but unfortunately, I lost my entire balance only getting returns of 10x to 120x at the most. To put it simply since maybe it'sduffrent than other slots, when buying a bonus with a minimum of $20, it effectively counts as a $0.2 entry and getting a 100x return means you win back $20 which is just 1x of your initial buy.So because of this, I decided to try the demo mode on the original pragmatic website multiple times, (running over 100 sessions) and in all of them I have got at least one 200x returns every 10 bonus buys. Which is so different than live mode.My question is, why does the demo mode seem to pay more than the real mode, and has anyone else noticed this difference?",

      "body": "I am not particularly slot super fan as you are, but to me it would make sense slots offer more chances to win if played on the demonstration version than the real version, when one is playing using real money. We could argue it is an strategy for potencial gamblers to be incited on gambling with the real software/game after trying the demo version. Though, if we want to be fair with the providers there is also the possibility of them increasing the chances of winning so any potential gamblers or clients interested in acquiring their services can see the special animations and visual effects which are supposed to be played on the screen when the player gets a high multiplier. The latter is a pretty good explanation if you asked me. I am not sure whether providers have some page or official message in their websites where they offer some clarification about it, though.",

I have not tried the demo mode before, I only go for the games that I know how to play in real life and which are also simple to play, so I do not know if what you are saying is right or wrong, but you know that demo is different from the real gambling. That is enough for us not to talk about the winning chances of both because demo mode is not gambling.",

Just my speculation but I think it's on the demo algorithm that makes them appealing so you would try a real account sooner or later but I think for those who tried online gambling would skip a demo account.",

Maybe this explain everything since demo mode on the provider website is probably tweak to increase RTP for user encouragement to try the game by winning too often. This common practice by provider when they want to market their product since no one will be interested to play a demo game which they are not frequently meaning.I believe the demo mode on the provider website is different to the casino demo mode since I don’t experience easy win n casino demo mode just like what you said. I usually spend multiple bonus buy just to hit more than the ROI multiplier.",

And the games I often play there are Olympus, Moon Princess, and others that I have forgotten the names of. It's just that every time I gamble here, I always go for slot games.In other categories of casino games, I haven't tried them often, rather rarely, because the others that I have tried are the Baccarat game and sports betting, but it's just too little, and I don't care if there's a demo because it's real slot games. I'm doing it right away.",

Demo works just like how real slot works however the difference of the two is that, you cannot access the money that you've won in demo slot and you have nothing to lose unlike in real slots that you need to use real money. Gamblers may use demo slot to get to know the game before playing the real one. Real slot is much risky than the demo one because as I have said, Money is involve when playing the real slot, Also when it comes to gaming experience, both are offer the same features.",

And let's take for example, original games of casinos such as Stake, they allow you playing with 0 balance to testing so they should have the same winning rates. It's not logical to set the same settings for a game and then gives different results.I didn't find any article or clarification about this matter, and that's why I'm asking users for more details about it. Maybe I will learn how this thing should work.",

I do this too most of the time but not when my balance is zero but rather when I’m too pissed off on my slot games for not hitting any bonus game while I spend a lot of spin already. I always use demo mode to satisfied my cravings for hitting bonus buy instead of buying it with real money since I know that bonus buy is very volatile.",
