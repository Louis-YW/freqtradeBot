So my suggestion is to move it to the altcoin discussion board. Casino token are also classified as altcoin but during your investments you should be very mindful with your decision on how to acquire those tokens otherwise invest what you can be able to risk.",

Two big casinos with tokens are Rollbit with $RLB token, you missed its pump months ago. Another casino is Freebitco.in with $FUN token that has yet pumped latest months.I really recommend you to follow the $FUN token because the quality and reputation of Freebitco.in casino is undoubtedly. I would like to note that Rollbit casino is more actively with their product developments so their token $RLB can have more waves than $FUN token.Both tokens have inflationary issues but their team are trying to use part of casino income for Buy back and Burn. A bigger capital used for buy back and burn as well as more new demands in next two years can lift two tokens to higher prices.",

I will advice you to go for just normal coins, like bitcoin. See casino tokens as for other things that they are used for which may not be beyond the casino. It will be better to start the DCS now and continue. The main reason for DCA is to buy a coin or some coins at different prices at different time as time goes by, do not let it be too late. After halving, be expecting profit.",

I also have a few BFG and OWL tokens but it seems like BFG tokens are better judging from the price.I think the price has not yet received a pump for the three tokens and is still waiting for market conditions to recover.

In purchasing crypto, you must be careful and do it with an established coin. This rollbit token is just growing and its performance is questionable, regardless of the number of users or gamblers who are investing into the token. Like you said casino token is risky, the whole point of pumping rollbit token is to keep it on a trending radar, for buyers to see. And you, op, fell on same category with such buyers, that's why you feel the pump is a lost opportunity. Why not invest now and see the result for yourself. At first, when you saw the coin's growth, the bearish season ran across your mind. That would have been the best time to invest, then participate in the profits that followed afterwards. Every coin is risky and unpredictable, not just casino coins. Personally, I don't have any plan for casino coins because it's mainly dependent on the casino, if the platform has a problem in future their coin will suffer too.",

      "body": "even though you said that you know the risks of investing in casino tokens, I will still talk about the benefits of these tokens, see what the rollbit team did so that the token was useful and created a lot of attraction for people so that people If they invested in this token and the price of the token would go up a lot and ask yourself: if other casinos copy what rollbit has already done, would that attract people too or would it just make people not pay much attention because they see that it is an idea? that already exists in another casino and that for this reason it would be more practical for people to buy the token that they already have in another casino that was the first to have the idea.Now think that if people don't want tokens from casinos that copy pasted the rollbit idea, then what do people want to see that is a new idea in a casino token? When we ask anyone what they would most like to have in a casino, the most likely answer will be: getting a big bonus without having to go through many wagering requirements. but when we ask people: what would they like to see in a casino token? Most people will not be able to answer this question and may even say they want to see the token listed on large exchangesAnd talking about casino tokens being listed on major exchanges, see that RLB is also not listed on major exchanges like Binance, I only saw them listed on Poloniex, but the question I ask myself is why the casino tokens team doesn't do it. effort to get your tokens listed on major exchanges? probably the reason is because they don't want to spend money on listing payments and they also don't want to run the risk that when the token is listed on the big exchange it drops a lot in price, while the token is on a very small exchange, with very low volume, people they will buy the token because they will think that in the future when the token is listed on the big exchange in the first few days the price will go up a lot. my conclusion is that if you like risk then keep buying these tokens, but they are not things to stick with for 5 years, they are high risk investments",

Good you are aware that investing in casino tokens is a risky move.In my case, I had considered to invest in some before, but I am afraid I have not decided which one. I would probably just stick to Bitcoin and DCA on it.I have not heard anything about a reputable casino lately on launching a token, I have discussed about Stake before on taking such step, but it is doubtful they will do it in the end, because it would be translated on problems with regulators and authorities.",

Do not advise me about how risky they can be, I understand the risk and I am willing to accept any losses. I have never been a fan of altcoins talk more of casino tokens, no shade but it doesn't change anything because 50% has been lost from the all time high it was traded and right now, no good exchange listed it despite all the fugazi pump, in addition to that the token is been traded on Ethereum chain which means people with low available funds will end up wasting all their resources into gas fee. I will say people who risked it were lucky but on neutral ground many will have ignored it because it was a token meant for benefit in the casino, it is not known outside the exchange, it was when the pump started other traders rushed in and you know what happen when whales decide to play with the rest of the traders, there is going to be a nice ride of tides in candles.I wouldn't say people should not go for casino tokens but in every 10 casino tokens that you see on the market, 9 of them will fail and only 1 will succeed, if we go buy example, rollbit is the only successful token that has proven that. However, there were also speculations about the token after they changed the smart contract of RLB, so many people couldn't convert their RLB from the first smart contract to the new contract and that is why the pump was so easy because many couldn't sell, they are speculations and Im not sure if that is valid actually.",

I don't think OP needs any advice because he stated clearly that he knows the risk involved and he is willing to take it. Some people are high-risk takers and in some cases, they have massive profits but in most cases, they lose all. Maybe he wants to start DCAing because he can't afford a lump sum purchase. Some persons are skillful in predicting these tokens and have made a fortune from them. But altcoins are a no-go area for me since I lack such skills. I suggest that OP should do his research to get some vital information.",
