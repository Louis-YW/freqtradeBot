Will i thank the person or send him back the sendible?First of all, no go let your imagination finish you bross, as you dey see am so, no be say e no dey possible o but the chances dey very low. If that kind thing sub, the person no go dey happy with e self. And you thanking the person go only fit make am vex but what is done is already don. You don't go thanking someone for merits.if you receive that kind merit just happy and move on. I no see any reason to con dey thank the person. Secondly. For the tweak wey @ PowerGlove don drop, I go prefer the approach b Quote from: PowerGlove on November 03, 2023, 11:15:22 PM Approach BThis approach would add a bit of JavaScript that \"selects\" the value whenever it's clicked, that way, whatever you type in will replace whatever was already there.That would look like this (after clicking):The HTML would change to: <input type=\"text\" size=\"6\" name=\"merits\" value=\"0\" onclick=\"this.select();\"> (that is, onclick=\"this.select();\" would be added).That na because, e go dey easier to avoid those kind mistake of sending wrong amount of merit give person, and also with the blue highlight,(java script) wey dey that one, u go fit dey notified of the particular amount wey u dey send before u send am.",

While I was still a newbie if I may remember, I have merited some people by mistake, first of all, I wanted to send merit to a quality post that I came across then I didn't check the name of the person that I wanted to merit.So I merited someone else, however, while I was about to send the merits I did not check the name, so after meriting the post before I realized.The second be say as I send the first merits, I still refresh the page instead of me to click the back button, and that nah my last Smerit way I been get, the only thing way pain me be say, I no get any other merits to give to the profile way I been one merit before.But as e dey so,,, nah only newbie fit do that kind of mistakes,",
