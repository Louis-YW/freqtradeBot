  "content": "I had a dream the other day where I wasn't able to log in in there. The site was basically 404'ing as I refreshed. I went into Google and looked up news. \"Bitcointalk.org website has been seized by some supranational authority\". Basically some agency with a fancy acronym coerced theymos into giving away the database for tax purposes. I eventually woke up.This has made me think what would happen if all the information here was lost, and thus I would like to make a copy of the entire website with a handy little software called HTTrack which allows you to get pretty much a 1:1 mirror of a site. And you could keep updating the offline copy from time to time, kind of like keeping up with the blockchain as you sync.My question is: Is it ok to do this? Im assuming theymos wouldn't care. I would like to ask, how big is this website? just to see how long it would take to have an offline database. This site is mostly text, so it shouldn't be a lot, however, there's lots of text, and all images from external url's would be saved too.I just wouldn't like to wake up some day and see the site is gone for some reason. There's a lot of stuff to read in here that has been written for 10 year already, so it would be difficult to catch up. Just reading all of satoshi's posts would take a while. And I like to read things from source, so I guarantee nothing was modified. I've seen satoshi misquoted or even modified posts with inspect element.",

      "body": "The forum is big for an archive. There are archive sites that scour this forum and archive a lot of details.There are 5411334 topics (according to when this one was created). There are a lot of user profile pages if you want to archive those and many pages to a lot of threads.There are projects to archive this forum though too so you'd just be adding to that. You could also try doing a day of scraping the forum for number of users online so you aren't hammering the servers while they're already being hammered.The forum bans multiple requests that are sent within a 1 second period - from the same host - so you'd be best off only making requests less than that.",

Also, there are many threads that are full of spam and useless or not necessary for the future (bounty thread, altcoin section, gambling, speculation, etc).You can archive sections like bitcoin, project development, and economics if you really think those will be useful in the future. HTTrak is a great tool by the way. I have used it several times and works fine if you know how to do it.",
