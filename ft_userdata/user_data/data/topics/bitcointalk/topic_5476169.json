  "content": "I don't know if this has been discussed before, I hope its not exactly in the same perspective as this one, I will sure lock the thread if a previous thread/discussion is exactly same lines as this one.I believe we all are aware that OFAC-(office of foreign asset control) have recently sanctioned Sinbad - a bitcoin mixing service that was being promoted/advertised on this forum by users through their signature ad spaces.https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=44437Now, the escrow bitcoin address which held the fund used to pay Sinbad signature ad campaign participants has also been blacklisted by Binance, and they are also investigating the transactions carried out through this same address.Now again, I did a little research on how possible it is for authorities to trace Sinbad services to this forum, I started by first searching the keyword.. \"Sinbad\" - and there was no mention of this forum all through, no result even showing sinbad as a mixer. I decide to search the keyword.. \"Sinbad bitcoin mixer\" - and there was no mention of this forum in the search result until the 15th result which mentioned this thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445243.0And the 21st result which mentioned this thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450517.0I proceeded to doing the search with the escrow bitcoin address which was provided by @Royse777 in the Sinbad signature Ann thread, and the Sinbad signature Ann thread came up second in the Google search result, after blockexplorer.one.Now, my concern is, wouldnt it make sense to remove the Sinbad escrow address from this forum? And also remove anything that could make it easy for authorities to trace transactions from that address to this forum, and it's users?Is this forum not going to be in danger if authorities trace transactions with services they have sanctioned down to this forum?Maybe this is nothing, either way, consider me being over curious and conscious  .",

Of course, they don't declare them illegal until it gets declared illegal, chipmixer for example started in what year again? 2017 or 2018 I think, and operated till 2022 or early this year (sorry, I am not a record keeper) before it got declared illegal and seized, same thing have happened with Sinbad, and one after the other, all mixers will keep getting seized, and the more this forum keeps promoting them, they more dangerous it becomes for the continues existence of the forum.

I don't completely disagree with the question you raised here, but I also do agree in some part because you already provided a screenshot of a signature participant who was given a notice by Binance. These don't put a person completely in danger, but they are causing some temporary harassment. Moreover, suppose the law enforcement agencies come to your home with a search warrant or take you into their custody for questioning. In my opinion, these are also one type of harassment.Moreover, if we talk about the forum, theymos already mentioned some things.Quote from: theymos on December 01, 2023, 02:01:03 PM~~~~~It wouldn't be illegal to continue allowing mixers here. That's why we're able to offer a 1-month grace period. But allowing them has become too risky/problematic, and it's only going to get worse. Imagine 5% of all active forum users being sanctioned due to being paid directly by mixers, or all participants in a big signature campaign being targets of a search warrant, or our service providers suddenly banning us due to being \"associated\" with mixers, etc. I think that the crypto community is near the start of a multi-year squeezing campaign against mixers; similar to the cannabis industry in the US, or Operation Choke Point, or what happened with Backpage, or the deplatforming of Parler. ~~~~~~~",

Investigative authorities are always interested in the \"head,\" and they probably know who and where could be guilty of what, excluding simple advertising of mixers. The users advertising this, to sane people, look like people just making money. Moreover, in terms of the volume of the mixer itself, the earnings look meager. Considering that the one who publicly writes that he is selling “dirt” has been alive and well for many years, and they simply do not pay attention to him, will anyone delve into the posts of people simply communicating on the forum, sometimes on completely distant topics from mixers?If this is really so important and is a crime, then very soon the world will turn into the novel “1984” by George Orwell.",

Don't you think it will look shady?
