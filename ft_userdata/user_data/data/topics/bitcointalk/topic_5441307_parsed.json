  "content": "Hello everyone, I am RainbowKun, and I'm back.It is an honor to return to our Bitcointalk forum after nearly two years. This forum is always the holy land of communication for the Bitcoin community, and it is also the place where I express my faith in Bitcoin.Perhaps most people don't remember who I am, but that doesn't diminish my love for the Bitcointalk forum.In July 2021, I first proposed the concept of \"Bitcoin Civilization\" here and subsequently wrote over sixty articles on Bitcoin philosophy to explain my understanding of \"Bitcoin Civilization\". To this day, I still believe that my philosophical thinking is of great value and it guides me to continuously create and innovate in the crypto world.Under the guidance of the \"Bitcoin Civilization\" concept, I founded the RainbowCity Foundation in Singapore over the past two years, and led my technical team to create a multi-chain DAO infrastructure protocol: the RainbowDAO protocol. The RainbowDAO protocol has won multiple hackathon championships and has also received Grant funding from the Polkadot Web3 Foundation. These are all recognitions of me and my team by the crypto industry.At the same time, I am not alone. On May 10, 2022, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and others published a paper called \"Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul\". In this paper, they jointly proposed the concepts of Decentralized Society, Web3 Soul, and Soul Binding Tokens, which have sparked widespread discussion and a huge impact in the global crypto world.Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soulhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763The idea of the Bit Civilization that I proposed is essentially consistent with Vitalik's idea of the Decentralized Society, except that it involves a wider scope than the Decentralized Society.I have always believed that Satoshi Nakamoto did not just create a currency with Bitcoin, but rather created a new human civilization.Bitcoin represents not only a decentralized society but a thriving decentralized civilization. Bitcoin will be a new advanced civilization built on the foundation of mathematics and algorithms, representing the liberation and freedom of all mankind. I call it the \"Decentralized Civilization,\" or \"DeCiv\" for short.Because this civilization originated from Satoshi Nakamoto's creation of Bitcoin, I also refer to it as the \"Bit Civilization.\"In order to continue to promote Bitcoin and expand the spread of the \"Bit Civilization\" idea throughout the entire crypto world, my team and I have decided to launch and create the FireDAO project as the basis for conducting a social experiment exploring the Web3 Soul.Here is an article about the origin of FireDAO:https://twitter.com/FireDAOKun/status/1623936581253074947\"FireDAO\" is a social DAO organization based on PID and FID soul-bound accounts. It is a community-driven on-chain autonomous economic entity, and a Web3 native DID identity system built on blockchain technology.Currently, the first product of the FireDAO protocol, FirePassport, has been launched on the Arbitrum One mainnet, and seed community members can already mint PID. Within the next three months, we will also launch more than ten native protocols of FireDAO on the mainnet, truly creating a Web3 native DID identity protocol based on blockchain.https://twitter.com/FireDAOlab/status/1626466276716732416To pay tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto and the Bitcoin community once again, I will choose to serialize the FireDAO ecological white paper in the Bitcointalk Announcements section, further elaborating on the economic model and top-level design of FireDAO, and also welcoming anyone interested in FireDAO to become OG members of the FireDAO community.I hope that after reading the FireDAO white paper, you can provide me with valuable feedback to further optimize and improve FireDAO, and I also welcome you to follow my subsequent updates!",

      "body": "FireDAO Social MediaFireDAO is a social DAO based on PID and FID soul-bound accounts initiated and established by the RainbowCity Foundation. It is a community-driven autonomous economy on the chain and a native Web3 DID identity protocol based on blockchain technology . On the basis of PID, FireDAO is centered on soul accounts and FID, combines with different types of soul-bound tokens, calculates the \"on-chain reputation\" score, and finally builds a set of native DID identity protocols on the Web3 chain.As FireDAO develops to a certain stage, any native Web3 project can integrate into FireDAO’s DID identity system, carry out various types of on-chain financial services based on On-chain Reputation, and carry out various types of soul airdrops for PID and FID owners, making FireDAO's identity system truly become the infrastructure of the whole Web3 world.Here are the official social media links for FireDAO.

In this Paper, they invented the concepts of Decentralized Society, Web3 Soul and SoulBound Tokens and triggered a global discussion and impact in the crypto world. Thus, we are inspired by this Paper and decide to launch and create FireDAO, in the hope of initiating a social experiment on Web3's Soul.As stated in Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul: Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel financial system with unprecedented flexibility and creativity within a decade. Cryptographic and economic primitives such as public key cryptography, smart contracts, proof of work and proof of stake have led to a sophisticated and open ecosystem for expressing financial transactions.However, the economic value in financial trades originates from the human relations and interactions. The lack of social narrative makes Web3 fundamentally depend on the extremely centralized Web2 structure.The lack of a native Web3 identity makes today's DeFi ecosystem unable to support ordinary activities in the real economy, such as under-collateral lending or simple contracts ,like an apartment lease.",

They collectively refer to these use cases and the diverse ecosystems as \"Decentralized Society - DeSoc\".The core of DeSoc are the accounts or wallets holding  non-transferable  Soulbound  tokens (SBTs) which represent commitments, credentials and affiliations. All these will ultimately shape DeSoc's vision - a co-determined sociality. In this society, most participants have a Soul which stores a series of affiliations, memberships and credentials related to SBTs. Souls and communities gather together from bottom to top to create a diversified network world within a certain social scale.We highly endorse the ideas of Decentralized Society, Web3's Soul, and Soulbound Tokens put forward by Vitalik Buterin and others, and it was these ideas that inspired us to initiate and create FireDAO. Founded by the RainbowCity Foundation, FireDAO is a social DAO  based on PID and FID Soulbound accounts, a community-driven on-chain autonomous economy and also a native Web3 DID identity protocol built on blockchain technology. Hence, we would like to express our deepest respect and heartfelt thanks to thought leaders such as Vitalik Buterin, E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver  and others.",

This is also the concept first proposed by FireKun, the core initiator of FireDAO, on the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcointalk Forum in July 2021.Bit Civilization will distinguish itself from the existing civilization system of human society, which is a more advanced civilization built on the cornerstone of the blockchain. In this Bit Civilization, all human assets such as currency, stocks, certificates, real estate, all information such as  business information, transactions, learning and life information, all activities such as business behavior, life cycles, communication will be recorded in the form of data on different blockchains. The segmentation and circulation of value, therefore, are to be realized in the form of different Tokens, and thus a brand-new identity verification system and value circulation system are constructed.All human activities can be recorded on blockchains in the form of data, and the exchange and transmission of data can be realized through code, algorithms,rules, and smart contracts. This is the essence of the Bit Civilization and also an expansion and upgrade of the concept of decentralized society.",

      "body": "1.3 The Creation and Mission of FireDAOIn the history of human civilization, no invention has ever had such a tremendous impact on human beings as fire. From  Suiren’s wood drilling fire in the East to Prometheus stealing fire in the West, fire has witnessed each stage of the evolution of human civilization. Fire is one of the most important tangible tools for mankind to achieve civilization. It is said that without fire, there would be no human beings, let alone human civilization. Fire provides human beings with warmth and light in the dark nights of winter. Food processed with fire is easier for humans to digest and absorb,  and further promotes the development of human brains, which ultimately distinguished humans from animals. Therefore,  fire is the driving force behind human wisdom and brings human beings to enter the era of civilization.Whether to use fire has become an important symbol to distinguish human beings from other creatures on earth. Fire created human civilization and guided mankind to move forward. From the moment humans began to use fire, humans went on a path that redefines themselves and shapes the world. Fire has promoted the development of civilization, culture and technology, and promoted the evolution of human beings. Fire has not only changed us, but also given us the ability to change the world. Fire is no longer an attachment to human beings, and guides the continuous evolution of human civilization.In ancient Greek Mythology, there was no such thing as fire on earth to illuminate or grill food. Humans had to spend lives in endless darkness. Prometheus saw the plight of mankind and decided to steal a tinder from Apollo,  God of the Sun, and brought the world light and warmth.Because of this, Prometheus was punished by Zeus, the Lord of gods, being chained to cliffs of the Caucasus Mountains. Since then he had suffered from hunger, bitter wind, scorching Sun, brutal rain and eagle attacks. It was the fire  stolen by Prometheus that filled human beings  with warmth and light.1.3 Bible Genesis 1:3 :And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, when the Genesis Block of Bitcoin was dug out, an advanced human civilization based on the cornerstone of mathematics and algorithms was born. Human society is bathed in a new light of civilization. This is what we call the Bit Civilization today.The Bit Civilization is fundamentally different from the existing civilization of human beings and leads to the Web3 world we are exploring today. The Bitcoin created by Satoshi Nakamoto is like the tinder that Prometheus stole, bringing a new light to the evolution of the existing civilization. Satoshi Nakamoto put Bitcoin on the earth, igniting the fire of a civilization full of wisdom.In our opinion, Bitcoin is the tinder that ignites the Bit Civilization of human beings and the Web3 world we are building now is the soul of this Bit Civilization , and DAO organization is the soul of Web3. In order to keep the civilization fire burning continuously, the more prosperous and longer the burning, the more supply of civilization fuel will be.The FireDAO that we launched  and created today is the fuel for the fire of civilization. We hope that through the creation and continuation of FireDAO, we can provide a steady stream of fuel for the burning of Bit Civilization and thus inherit wisdom and prosper civilization.",

      "body": "Chapter Two: FireDAO Overview2.1 FireDAO's PositioningFireDAO is a social DAO based on PID and FID soul-bound accounts initiated and established by the RainbowCity Foundation. It is a community-driven autonomous economy on the chain and a native Web3 based on blockchain technology DID identity protocol. On the basis of PID, FireDAO is centered on soul accounts and FID, combines with different types of soul-bound tokens, calculates the \"on-chain reputation\" score, and finally builds a set of native DID identity protocols on the Web3 chain.As FireDAO develops to a certain stage, any native Web3 project can integrate into FireDAO's DID identity system, carry out various types of on-chain financial services based on On-chain Reputation, and carry out various types of soul airdrops for PID and FID owners, making FireDAO's identity system truly become the infrastructure of the whole Web3 world.",
