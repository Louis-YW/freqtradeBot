  "content": "we know the economy is bad when gas prices have already gone up and all the rest of the stuff we usually buy in the grocery store is up 15%. and because your salary is just what it was the last 2 years, your situation is just as bad as the rest of us. we are in a recession. one reason more economists wanna be think we are in a recession is because we hear it on the news too.but here are indicators to confirm we really are in an economic downturn.1. butter popcorn index - people go to movies regardless of how bad the movie is. they just go see movies to just get away from their problems. but when the economy is bad, just sit and watch netflix. 2. diaper rash - parents wouldn't mind if their kid's diapers are already full during an economic crisis and are not neglectful when it comes to the diaper turning yellow during an economic upturn. 3. plastic surgery index - plastic surgery index is generally down during rough times as women wouldn't mind how small their boobs are than when the economy is booming.  4. lipstick index -  women wouldn't spend much on expensive lipsticks so sales are gonna be bad for lipsticks compared to the times when economy is great.5. japanese haircut index - during a good economy, more people in japan will take care of themselves and get their looks neat and they're not doing this during bad times. women don't go to beauty parlors.6. bike fatality index - during an economic crisis, people use bikes often or can't afford cars so more bike accidents happen.7. men underwear index - men especially singles don't mind wearing underwear with a couple of holes in it, no one sees it anyway. men buy less underwear during economic downturns.8. garbage index - less garbage because people buy less when the economy is bad and buy more when times are good so more garbage everywhere.9. unclaimed body index - during a bad economy, dead people are not claimed in the morgue. horrible index to look at how bad the economy is. i'm sure people take care of their family when they die. can't believe this is happening.i'm sure there are some more, there is also a \"beer index\" where people prefer to just buy 6 packs and go drink at home rather than a bar. a few months ago, i bought my kid a secondhand laptop rather than a new one because it's expensive, i think this is also an indicator. and i know he'd break it sooner.",

But the above is rather funny to me and I don't know if it has gotten to that.Anyway from ny end, people still claim their people's corpes for burial especially when it is an adult. I'm yet to be aware that people leave their people's d body in mortuary because of the hard economic realiality.",

Patterns are drawn by people on every economic movement, as they try to align their money and capacity to spend with it.There is also that Happy Meal indicator if I can remember it correctly that certain companies often reduce their freebies aimed towards children to cut costs and still be afloat during an economic hardship. There's lots of them out there, and you can even create your own and see whether it will be aligned with the current economic conditions or not.",

At some point, people need to become creative on their own so they don't rely on the government to survive for a while. I guess this is where natural selection comes into play.

Inflation can't be stopped, especially when the economy isn't progressing.I used to watch a movie once a week with my mom and grandma before the pandemic, but now there are no more free movies for them. Fortunately, I have the internet and share a Netflix account with a friend.Getting a haircut is important to me; I get one every month because it's hot in this tropical area. There's still a place where I can get a haircut for 1 to 2 dollars, so it's still affordable.Bike accidents are not common here; motorcycle accidents are still more prone.To save money, I don't wear underwear, especially when I'm just at home. I'm used to it. But I prefer boxers over briefs.The garbage situation is given, especially in places with no proper rules or laws for garbage disposal.In today's time, if you're not practical, there won't be any positive change or progress in your financial status.",

Things are getting expensive.I agree with your opinion, if people have to be more independent in making their economy better, because by hoping that the government can help our economy, it doesn't necessarily mean that the government can channel it appropriately so if we don't think for ourselves then we won't be able to meet our own needs. ourselves, so it would be better for us to do it ourselves to improve our own economic situation.I think everyone has a different way of using the income they have, but if we have enough income then it would be better for us to take care of ourselves so that we don't become a conversation among other people about our appearance.",

After all if the people are suffering because of the economic downturn then you can be sure governments also have their own fair share of problems as they are not getting as much money in taxes anymore, so it is not like as if they have the money on hand to do this.And if they were to print money to pay for those subsidies then that is only a short term solution, as sooner or later inflation will take place, eroding the newfound purchasing power of the people in just a matter of months.",

Yes. strange but True. If this is what is conveyed there is no word about inflation, especially when it comes to cigarettes and drinking coffee, we as men, especially active smokers can at least endure it, especially if we try to stop because of inflation, at most we can only last 1 hour. ..he, he, I really avoid the two things above, gambling or alcoholic drinks that you mentioned and don't do the things above.",

That's because if they admit recession they'd have to do something about it and they don't know what to do. For one they need the energy prices to go back down to $30-$40 for oil for example which is not in their control and they are too incompetent to think of any other way!",

One key indicator is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate. A decline or stagnation in GDP suggests an economic slowdown. Unemployment rates are obviously clear. An increase in joblessness signifies a struggling economy. Stock market performance, consumer spending, inflation rates & business confidence are important indicators to consider. Monitoring these factors will give you a better understanding of the overall health of the economy.",

During economic problems, we have more out-of-school children because parents will not be able to pay school fees. These children will be seen on the streets hawking wares to assist the family economically. There is also a high rate of beggars on the streets. When people don't have jobs due to unemployment, they turn to begging to survive. The crime rate also increases because of unemployment. The rate of armed robbery, kidnappings and even killings increases because unreasonable people want to survive.  There is also a low marriage childbirth rate. Singles prefer to remain alone because they cannot afford to take care of wives or children. Many bachelors in China are single because of the high cost of living. A high migration rate is another proof that the economy is not favourable. People will prefer to move to countries with better economic conditions when their home economy is facing challenges. Professionals like medical practitioners, IT personnel and other specialized skilled individuals will move to other countries where they can earn higher or get a higher standard of living. Public unrest is another cardinal pointer of economic downturn, there is usually protest and strike by workers to express dissatisfaction about the economic hardship.",

Children are the most important thing we have, and even if everything is five times worse, then good parents will give the last thing they have just to make their child feel good and comfortable. Any parent knows this, and everyone who has children agrees with me. A sufficient indicator of the poor situation in the economy is the rise in prices.
