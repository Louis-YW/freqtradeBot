The reason for the request was the gambling had the good reach now and many people getting rich using the gambling sites.The most important thing was most of the crypto based gambling site was in good reach now.The first thing you need to convey your friend was the gambling was based on the algorithm,So their was risk in the gambling site.Until you had created the tactics match to the algorithm,it may completely leads to loss.The luck in the gambling only for the gambling made with random bet in the gambling sites.You should confirm that she is rich person or the person with monthly commitments.If she is rich person,you no need to worry to share and introduce her to gambling sites.Because she will have some free money for the gambling sites and get entertainment from the same gambling sites.",

She must might have heard, read or seen how people were able to win a huge amount by engaging in gma king activity and that’s what made her interested in it, to her she believes that if she just learns the basics of gambling she would be able to replicate such results which we all know that it’s not guaranteed. And because of why she has chosen to gamble it will be difficult for her to even have fun while gambling all her attention would be fixated on how to get “the right prediction” that will land her the millions she’s looking for” making her more vulnerable to gambling addiction.So if I’m in your shoes, I don’t think I’d want her to take part in gambling, not with the current mindset that she has… For now just try to see if you can get her to understand the risks involved in it, and that instead of her winning she could end up losing her money to the casino and if she wants to earn passive income she should sacrifice her time to learn a skill that can be monetized online.",

I hope that your friend has actually understood this and does not look for other ways to \"learn\".Second, even if it's just for entertainment, someone's ideal game isn't the one that seems \"easiest.\" The best game is the one that she will like, so you would need to introduce her to several types and variations of games, without delving too deeply into each one of them and only when she feels interested in one in particular should you deepen her knowledge of the game. chosen.",

It’s good she’s looking to earn extra to add to whatever she earns in her main job but with gambling, she will find out rather quickly that she would spending more money than she ever thought on gambling in a bid to win big. Asides all of that, if she starts gambling in a bid to earn more and it doesn’t pan out like she had hoped for, and she ends up having some financial troubles. In a bid to avoid taking responsibility for her actions, she may fault you for introducing her to gambling conveniently forgetting she asked to be taught in the first place.",

Gambling is not for making money because that mindset will only make her lose and later likely lead to addiction. Let her know how bad gambling could be for those that are desperate to make money from it. We should always follow the rules of not to gamble with the amount of money that we can not afford to lose. But if she insists, teach her and tell her to follow the rules and not letting her gambling budget to be more than 5% of her weekly earning.",

Firstly, I think she is going about it the wrong way, if she wants to have an extra source of income then she should invest and that investment doesn't involve gambling cos GAMBLING IS NOT AN INVESTMENT.Let her invest in herself by acquiring skills that will give her more sources of income or invest in a project she doesn't need to give too much attention buiding if she hasn't got time for it.Do not teach her how to gamble else she'll have you to blame when she gets wrecked. Remember, her motive for gambling is already wrong...as gambling doesn't substitute for an alternative source of income.",

If yes, what's the easiest game she can stake in and also enjoy while gambling?   In the first place, you know yourself that when gambling is made into a mindset that is a source of income, it is not good to be a gambler's perspective. Especially in the case of your female friend who is thinking of becoming a second source of income, this is where it is wrong because she may also think that she might get lucky in gambling, which is also wrong.  How can you explain that gambling is good or can be a second source if the belief is that winning gambling is only based on luck? Right? It's better that you tell him the truth.",

What if she loses more money and then her eyes will turn on you for introducing her to a gambling platform? You would not like to be in that position. Just hope that she will not find out herself too. If you are a real friend then you don't want her to be in big trouble. Plus, her goal is not the right path. Making money? We all know that's not how it goes with gambling, it's actually the other way around. So if you want what is best for her then don't do it. Why not just talk about investment (cryptocurrencies) maybe that way she will be happier and she will not be learning how to gamble. Risk is still involved but not too much if we are on the right investment like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Just keep on telling her there are other ways to make profits and it's not just gambling. If she is into sports only then I might reconsider, but she better know her sport too.",

It's weigh out of track line, do you want to know why? Because gambling have become one of the activities that have drained most of our youths and will continue to except for the ones that knows earlier and quit while some are still battling to leave, and introducing her to the system, ofcourse you're killing her slowing because all her attention to the stable means of incomes will be distracted, she will channel it to gambling and the slightest chance of becoming an addict is very close.",

If yes, what's the easiest game she can stake in and also enjoy while gambling? No, you did the right thing by not suggesting gambling to her, because based on your statement, she is looking for a second source of income, and gambling is not a right decision or a good recommendation because in gambling you could lose money, and if she really is looking for something that could make her more money, then do you think gambling would fit for it? No, it's a good decision that you keep her from entering something that could worsen her situation. Instead of gambling, introduce her to something with a low risk of losing money. It depends on what suggestions you make, but gambling should never be considered.You could introduce her to investments, especially in crypto currencies; it's much more worthy than teaching and learning about gambling. In investing, she has a low risk of losing money. Yes, there's still a possibility, but it depends on how you guide your friend and how she is dedicated to learning to earn. There's no easy way to earn now; everything should be dedicated to effort and time. If she thinks gambling is the shortcut, then she only has two paths: first hit a jackpot and have a good life, or worsen her current situation. Anyone who would suggest any gambling games or platform should first justify why it is an option to gamble for a source of income.",

On the other hand, you can tell her that it is not good as she will be addicted and explain everything, as if you want to discourage her and see the reaction.And her reason is very bad in the beginning, gambling is not a second source of income, will not be for any gambler here. We play most of the times to be entertain and have fun. Maybe we win some games and lose some, but to look for it as a like a second job, we have discussed it many times already here.",

I commend you for doing like that, yes, you shouldn't encourage anyone to gambling, specially friends and families as it could ruined their lives. And for what motivates here, it's flawed, gambling is a risk, 50/50 chance that you can make money or not. Perhaps your friends have seen or heard other stories that someone won big in gambling and that se wanted to try it herself to replicate what those people did. But then again, every individual is different as far as their luck on gambling and not everyone has it. Maybe the closest that she can become a gambler is to bet on lottery. But not like going to online and offline casino, very confident that she will take it as a second source of money.",

I am not against anyone getting into gambling but if you start it as fun, it will guide you from investing serious amount into it that you might not be able to loose. Secondly, I don't normally feel comfortable introducing gambling to women or ladies, and this is sincerely my personal stuff. I had a female friend that told me her friend introduced a gambling site to her and that she is considering going into it, I wasn't happy with her and I had to stop her from even trying it out. There is a popular saying in my locality which goes, \"don't start what you can't finish\" if you introduce her into gambling and she isn't guided enough to gamble responsively and end up losing a whole fortune in the process, you are the one that would be held responsible and fingers would definitely be pointed at you.",
