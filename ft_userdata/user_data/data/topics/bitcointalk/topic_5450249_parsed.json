If not, send me a DM here with all the details of the work (if you don't want to disclose them here) and if I find it useful, I'll vouch for you here and also work with you.",

These offers are like a trap, try as much as possible to know the guarantees before diving into it.Quote from: loabiti33 on April 26, 2023, 12:48:00 PMThanks for the help. Wish no troubles will happen if any!",
