It was really BlackRock starting the real ETF storyline hehehe. Did anyone also notice Forbes magazine has suddenly become supportive for bitcoin?In any case, it will begin with 1 ETF approval then it will be a cascade of other approvals. Slowly then suddenly hehehe. I speculate that we might witness one of the biggest pumps on bitcoin once BlackRock and the other institutional investment funds twap into bitcoin. In a recent interview with CNBC, former SEC chair Jay Clayton said a Bitcoin ETF approval would be “hard to resist.” Moreover, Clayton shared his perspective on how far the digital asset industry has come, and why developing regulatory standing would make an approval favorable. In recent weeks, a host of traditional financial institutions have come forward with Spot Bitcoin ETF filings. Among those are asset management behemoths like BlackRock and Fidelity, which each submitted their proposals within the last month. Now, the industry awaits the SEC’s decision on what would be their first approval of the like.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/former-sec-chair-says-bitcoin-etf-should-be-approved",

This financial institution isn't like anything else. This is BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world. This isn't just another financial platform trying to convince the SEC that Bitcoin ETF is something the US should have. This now is a multi-trillion international investment company. We're not even speaking of how powerful and influential it is especially behind the scene.",

Otherwise, this can be a very good opportunity missed by the USA. We know that right now, SEC is waging a \"war\" with cryptocurrency players...without even laying down the clarity on regulations first which is to me kinda of absurd. Hopefully, the approval of BTC ETC can open up more possibilities and opportunities for the crypto industry - an industry that is so willing to work with the government and not against it.",

Those negative arguments have run their course and lost, we are movingforward it seems. An ETF approval will be the confirmation.",

Right now, as if he's using the market, the market and the people will also use his stance. As it's like a give and take on it and if he change his drive going with the shilling with some altcoins, then that's showing his true colors. I remember that JP Morgan has something like this as well before and that's like with their own altcoin but that didn't get a lot of attention.",

Coinbase seems to play an integral role in Bitcoin market in the US, having roughly 56% of dollar bitcoin trading.Granted, they believe that Coinbase can't be trusted since they lack transparency hence the lawsuit they were slapped with but I doubt that's the main reason. Meanwhile Galaxy CEO has a strong feeling that adoption of Bitcoin ETFs can be possible especially as BlackRock have filed for a spot.",

That can mean using connections to push favourable articles into the media, creating a perception that an approval is just around the corner, which can put additional pressure upon the SEC. I don't see why they wouldn't be able to pull some strings, find people who'd speak up positively about their ETF. But IMO all that doesn't mean that they'll actually get an approval. I still think the SEC isn't willing to review their policy, but if BlackRock manages to succeed, I agree that other ETFs can easily follow, and the SEC's approval could drive the market up significantly.",
