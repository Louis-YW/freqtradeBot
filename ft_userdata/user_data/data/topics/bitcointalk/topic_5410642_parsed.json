      "body": "The “HourlyLotto” is a Dapp that allows users to participate in an hourly lottery using the BNB. After connecting the MetaMask wallet, deposit amounts range from a minimum of 0.01 BNB up to 10 BNB for the upcoming hour's lottery for each wallet address. More extensive deposits increase the odds of winning. Participants may increase the value of their participation wagering block in 0.01 BNB increments.A drawing is conducted at the end of each hour (GT) on the blockchain to determine the winner. The winner receives the deposited amount and 50% of the hourly pot remaining.Every hourly winner (up to 168 wallets) is automatically entered into the weekly lottery. Every week, a lottery winner wins 5% of the collective remnant for the week.Those who win the weekly lottery (up to 4 wallets) are automatically entered into the monthly lottery (conducted every four weeks). The monthly lottery winner receives 5% of the month's collective remaining.Note that each pot requires no less than five participants and a collective amount of at least 0.1 BNB to be drawn; if not, the wallets are automatically entered into the next pot, retaining their shares.",
