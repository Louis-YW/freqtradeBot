It's less than $1, so I don't see any reason how you don't want to pay such number if you're want fast transaction.I believe you're using a bad wallet like Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet that has a very bad fees estimator or even an exchanges which take additional fees from you. You need to use a good wallet at least Electrum, even better you can use hardware wallet or Bitcoin Core.",

My advice, next time check the condition of the mempool before making a transaction because it will help you get a quick confirmation on the network . Choose your priority, is the second step that you must do every time you want to make a transaction.Can visit here: - https://mempool.space/- https://blockchair.com/bitcoin- etc",

I just registered to get answersThe fees are very low now, and every transaction should be confirmed in about 30min to 1 hour You can check fees where OmegaStarScream suggested, mempool.space 30 minutes isn't a long time to wait,  considering it is a pseudo anonymous transaction, permitionless,  that could be sent to anyone in the planet. And fee is indeed very low. Compare to an international transaction price and time, such as swift.If you need to get into the next block , I.e. 10minutes, you should use your wallet recommended fees",

Not just blockchain wallet has the option to set the transaction with high priority Mycelium also have this option and I think also the Android Bitcoin wallet developed by schildbach has this option from low to high priority. The only problem is that if the receiver does not use a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet but instead uses an Exchange wallet he can't be able to do CPFP to speed up the transaction. If you are right he is using a Blockchain wallet and he has full control of that wallet with a backup seed then he can able to use the Electrum wallet and perform a \"Bump fee\".",

The time space you complained of isn't even anything to make you get upset and stressed out, waiting. If you were around in this industry a few years ago (even a few months ago) you would've understood what I'm saying about even 2hrs delay not being able to cause anyone panic. I've had my Bitcoin transaction delayed for over 48hrs before it was finally confirmed. During that period, I came to realize that all I needed to do was exercise patience and wait.",
