  "content": "Similar to not keeping your currencies in centralized exchanges, stay away from centralized password managers. One of the centralized password managers was hacked in August 2022,¬† although they claimed that no customer data was accessed during the incident, you should never trust in them. You cannot rely on the company to keep your seed/recovery phrase secure or prevent unauthorized access to the password vault on the company's end. You can trust them with your email passwords and other personal information, but not with your seed/recovery phrase, which will cause your bitcoin stolen from that address right away if it is compromised.Additionally, I would advise against saying your seed phrase aloud if you use voice-activated devices like Alexa, Siri, or Cortana. I don't want to sound paranoid in saying this. It's impossible to completely rule out the chance that these gadgets are listening in on our chat and that, in the event of a hack, your seed phrase will be stolen.What to know how to secure your seed/recovery phrase? I found this post Securing Your Seed Phrase with Washers by fillippone very helpful.That's all for now. Thank you for reading.What do you think about saving your seed/recovery phrase in a centralized password manager?Refs:https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DuvCh6Ql38https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/06/alexa-has-been-eavesdropping-you-this-whole-time/",

Seed phrase should be kept offline and never to be exposed online like when you trust a centralized password manager, because you are giving them permission to steal your funds indirectly. Yes, you could have engrave it or write it and keep it inside your vault, but should never rely such centralized exchanges for its safety. And these voice-activated devices will never be helpful at all as it would not be a secret anymore if you are making your voice loudly that any people around might hear it and save it for themselves too.",

Companies put that to work just to collect data, but hackers can collect them and catch you off guard with your important information.

Hackers might be able to gain access to your system's camera, mouthpiece and other accessories that can help transmit audio or video data in such case they can easily get some of your information if you're the type that read out loud your password when inputting them in your system.",

I have a laptop with broken LCD but all my backup I can still open it and connect laptop to external monitor so that I can still access it and all my backup are there and safe the only problem is that it is still Windows 7 I disable/remove wifi/internet connection of this laptop to make sure I never use it to any online activity.",

Even here on the forum, it has been written a thousand times that simply trusting the Chrome browser is the same as walking naked in front of an open window, so you also trust him with something that should be stored very carefully.I will explain more clearly. Hackers need a little. You just need to follow the link they need, and it can be disguised as a completely decent and useful site. By clicking on the link, you will get something similar to an error; you will be informed that you did something wrong, then you calmly press the \"OK\" button and think that you have calmly left. But you have already sent the hackers all the passwords that were saved in the browser.https://www.doyler.net/security-not-included/xss-password-stealing",

Unlike browsers' in-built password managers, they store sensitive information in encrypted containers, which is decent protection in case of physical access to your device. If someone were to find your phone with the google chrome browser installed, he would extract all your passwords by clicking two buttons, but he would have a hard time trying to hack your encrypted password manager application. However, all this doesn't mean that password managers are the right place to store seed phrases because there is no such thing as an unhackable application.",
