Approximately a little over a year ago the website was down again and remained non functioning long enough for alternatives to start popping up. No explanation was ever made, not that he owed us one, but there was never any communication from his behalf, which was quite odd if you ask me. I don't think he has logged in the forum for the past few years either. It's no surprise that it's down again, even though this is likely to be some error from the hosting's end, the domain isn't expiring soon either.",

Few months ago the site was down for weeks I think. The site created a good brand and receives a lot of traffic. It seems the owner have investment issue which he could resolve easily if he was running a simple ad. Not sure why don't he run any ad or look for investments. A project like this really is a great help to the bitcoin community.",
