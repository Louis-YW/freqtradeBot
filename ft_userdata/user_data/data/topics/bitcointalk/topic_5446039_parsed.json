Scary or Nah???No, I am not scared because I am not Justin Sun or Coinbase CEO, nor am I in any way related to them; I also don't have any of my funds entrusted into their hands, either through their exchange or any of their coins or tokens. So I am not scared; the case will only cause a few panics on the market, which won't last for long, as Tron and a few other tokens under them are already experiencing a few drops in price.",

The last we know was when United States SEC targeted Kraken. SEC and Kraken reached a conclusion after Kraken accepted to stop its staking program. People should know that staking defines any cryptocurrency to be a security and SEC likely do not want staking program for US citizens.Edit:Quote from: Nwada001 on March 23, 2023, 12:14:36 PMThe Tron CEO case already has a thread that is still open for discussion; you can join the discussion. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445962.msg61959553#msg61959553I did not see this before posting.

He is known for hyping the market and draining the money of his project investor for his self interest.  He surely commit fraud for being connected with Tether unli print machine. Their fall is necessary to make crypto market more organic.Tron and USDT are a ticking time bomb that slowing down crypto growth due to the uncertainty that given by these project. Many project are exposed on these shady so I’m sure that many will be affected like when FTX and LUNA downfall.",

Maybe the market will fluctuate again like before and I haven't imagined the worst scenario that could happen later. Maybe it will make the crypto market experience another correction or nothing will happen. Or maybe later, there will be another case similar to FTX. And I think later, there will be a lot of speculation related to that news. We'll just wait and see.",

However, if that isn't a rumor and something like that is going to happen, maybe we should be careful and use another stable coin for the time being so that we can stay safe from anything that might happen in case the news creates a lot of FUD in the market and things start going wrong.I'm saying that only because we know what happened to BNB when Binance and CZ were in the case with the SEC. BNB lost a lot of value during those times and it took a lot of time for it to recover from that because investors weren't confident and didn't want to buy BNB until Binance and CZ got a clearance from the case.",

I think the SEC would do everybody a favor if they throw him into a jail cell.Will it going to affect the markets?

It is somewhat a legit exchange and it will definitely harm crypto but coinbase is the bitch of the SEC so nothing will happen to them so no worries.",

However, it reappeared in the news this month because TRON's asking to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the SEC isn't a global regulator and doesn't have jurisdiction over foreign nationals. I don't think it'll work, but nice try.The SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase is almost a year old (it was filed last June), but there's been an update in that case, too: the SEC decided that the claim about Coinbase's unregistered sales of securities \"could be heard by a jury at trial\".It seems that, in both cases, the SEC has an upper hand, but things are moving quite slowly.",

Scary or Nah???Not scary at all. It's known what kind of guy Justin Sun is. He's got a lot of projects aside from Tron and that's why we shouldn't be worried at all. But wait a minute, when did Justin Sun became a part of Coinbase? I can't remember that he became one and he's more focused with Tron and his new acquisition of Poloniex. But with all of these drama that's happening in the market, all I can say is that if there's no drama, there's no thrill. So with this, there is nothing to worried about if your assets aren't in poloniex, BTT, TRX and other platforms and projects that he's part of. He's grown big on this market from the very start and he knows how to market himself. And I was surprised to see that's got the title now of \"permanent representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization in Geneva. He's got a lot of achievement and based on his bio, he's left being the CEO of Tron for that permanent representative post. Anyway, with all of these things that SEC is doing for each of them makes the market more colorful.",
