      "body": "Its good to see loads of evolution in the space but the rise of ordinals still remains a mystery to be unraveled in my own view. Looking at the Aeon project, I was hoping to get a more comprehensive detail about the project and also when and where we can get the native currency. Being an early investor in projects such as this still remains the best approach to investment but can we know the VCs behind, if there is any.",
