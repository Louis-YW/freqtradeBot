Let's take a real example.In this mini rally we're having, I've noticed Illuvium is one of the few tokens that is in the red( less than 1% on the daily when this was posted )1 ILV is $119 on my CEX... but the sell price is $116 and the buy price is $123Doing a simple trade using USDC to buy one ILV token would cost me $10.40 in ETH Fees on EXODUS. If I was doing it from my CEX, it would probably be cheaper, but I'd end up paying just as much ( sometimes way more ) if I want to take my new ILV token and deposit it in a hardware wallet. So either way, even if I buy ILV and it makes me a 15% gain in less than 24 hours, I barely break even !So how do I make a profit ? Do I need to buy 30 ILV to maximize my gains ? Or is there any other way ?",

Or is there any other way ?To my understanding, what you have explained above is simply an arbitrage example, where you buy cheaper from platform A and sell for a higher fee on platform B. It is a separate type of trading entirely different to day trading.Day trading involves you watching and studying chart movements for particular tokens and aim to trade atleast 1-2% profits more than 2 times a day from each single pair. This involves good knowledge in TA as well as trading psychology. Be sure to understand that the 2 methods of trading differs so you do not rekt your capital.",

      "body": "No my friend, I think you misunderstood me. It's true I mentioned two platforms, but I'm just comparing the cost of trading on two platforms, the whole trade could have been done in either platform beginning to end, no need to go from one to the other.What I meant was:  Buy ILV while it's in the red. Wait till it goes up 15% in price. Sell it into USDC.That whole process would barely break even for the reasons I explained before.And one other thing, both EXODUS and my CEX ( just as an example ) allow swapping one token for another, so I normally don't need to look at pairs. Just buy using USDC or Tether, make a profit, sell into USDC or Tether. Not that I have done it like that though, I trade in longer timeframes.",

Day trading is very risky, it seems like you gamble your money, though it is profitable it's also easy to wipe out your money if you will be made a wrong decision. In gambling, it is a high odds which is possible can make a high profit.However, if you are good enough at trading it becomes very easy for you, you need skills and knowledge before you will become profitable in trading.",

You either make it or break but most of the time, you'll break it. The risk that day trading has is also the same as gambling because emotions are involved. And if you're too emotional with your trades then you're unlikely to make it.At least for trading, you can do it by studying and gathering experiences and ideas and strategies for you to win without luck on your side and that's the opposite of gambling.",

What you can do is just deposit a specific amount on the exchange like 100$ then use that to buy and sell crypto. Any amount beyond 100$ will be considered your profit, it's up to you if you will withdraw it on a daily basis or maybe weekly.Since crypto market is very unstable, getting profitable in day trading is difficult to do. Even expert traders still prefer their job or other source of income rather than just focus on trading.",

Or is there any other way ?There's basically no point of day trading when you say that the fees would cost you around 9% of the trade.The volatility of cryptocurrencies is good for day trading but you will have to move to another platform like binance.So that you don't have to pay such a huge fees. You can target for 3% to 5% gains where the fees is around 0.2% on binance.",

But a newbie who jumps quickly into futures without having to try with spot, really are risk taker.They're blinded by the leverage that others are setting and doing and think that they can just easily do it without anything to worry about. That's how the newbies today, they won't mind the risk they're taking at first tries but eventually will realize that they are doing it wrong.",

Day trading is profitable depending on the strategy that your using in order to navigate the volatile market, and can equally be stressful unlike swing trading.  Using like 15Mns -1 HR time frame is good if you prefer going into day trading while the Bigger time will be for direction. The most profitable way of trading is swing trading with that way you don't need to keep your eyes on the market looking for possible set ups and opportunity to take a trade , this where the biggest money is made and less stressful.
