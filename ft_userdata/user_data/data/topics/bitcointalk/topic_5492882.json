I personally predict the BTC ecosystem will go mainstream in the upcoming bull season, so we won't see transaction fees return to normal levels anytime soon, we need to get used to paying fees high.",

Another part is more important, how many people want to pay expensive transaction fee even their transactions are very small. By paying expensive transaction fees, they convert their small bitcoin value to dust. If there are more people like this when mempools are congested, transaction fee will be expensive. If there are less people like this, transaction fee will less likely be very expensive, just higher a little bit.",

Sell off? Since Bitcoin dipped just recently and is now in recovery mode again, it should be more about buying pressure because people buy more when the market dips and when they buy and withdraw their funds from centralized exchanges to their wallets, this could be a reason for why the network has got congested a little bit and the fees are high due to it. A massive sell-off takes place when the market goes up and every rushes to sell their Bitcoin or a part of it so that they can take some profit but that's not the case here.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on April 15, 2024, 08:38:39 AMAlso is there any transaction booster that still works today?

So, it's not the case that the fees get higher when the price of Bitcoin gets higher, and it's also not the case that the fees get higher when the price of Bitcoin gets lower. Sometimes people sell a lot, and this means an increase in transactions, leading to higher fees. Sometimes people buy a lot, and the same thing happens.

Since the value is dumping in the past days I expect the transaction fee to keep its low as well. Or this has something to do with the massive sell off? Can massive sell off be thr reason behind the transaction fee spike? The only clear explanation for a transaction fee hike is mempool congestion which means many people are moving their bitcoin to somewhere, there is no indication that people are selling. It is one of the FUDs spread to affect bitcoin that when you see the pool congested people are selling, which is wrong. A transaction movement can also be from an unsafe wallet either exchanges to a safer one. Maybe many investors wanted to take advantage of the low fees then to move and it caused the hike in fee. So it’s not about the price drop because even in a bullish period fees too can get high QuoteAlso is there any transaction booster that still works today? Like ViaBTC?

Bitcoin is at a price that we don't expect but still the transaction fee is high.If the fee is as high as this when the price is dropping what then will happen if the price gets to let's say $85k, that means it will completely damage business for both investors and traders because no one would want to lose more than what is in his or her wallet.This is the second time this is happening and I believe it will get back to normal before the halving and is best to hold than sell for now that the fee is high, nobody wants to lose but to gain more in this coming halving period.",

      "body": "Well, I did look on the possible reasons, and based on this website:Quote4. The Bull Run Effect:During Bitcoin bull runs, when prices rise rapidly, and there's heightened interest in Bitcoin, it's common to see higher transaction fees. For instance, in 2021, there was a significant increase in Bitcoin transaction fees within a short period. From March 26, 2021, to April 21, 2021, the average fee rose from around $13.57 per transaction to over $62. This was a massive 362% increase in just under a month! There are some reasons as to why, but it seems like the upcoming bull run has an effect as to why we are seeing an increased transaction fees out of nowhere. I mean Ordinals hasn't been the reason of this surge in fees. I guess the best thing that we can do right now is to make a transaction during weekends. History shows that the average transaction fees is lower during weekends. Of course, this isn't the case all the time and there are times that the fee is still high even in the weekends. Using a coin that has a lower transaction fee might be another option as well. Quote from: Crypt0Gore on April 15, 2024, 08:38:39 AMCan massive sell off be thr reason behind the transaction fee spike? I don't think so.I believe that the current happening between Iran and Israel is the reason why we are seeing the market going down. It's also possible that the upcoming halving event and the bull run are the reason why we are seeing a price correction. Anyway, this is a healthy correction and investors are given another opportunity to buy Bitcoin.",

Compared to bitcoin, ethereum dumped even harder and its fees have been on the lower side the last couple of days. Ordinals part 2 are going live on the Bitcoin blockchain. Monkeys are again looking for their bananas.Honestly it looks that way because when it first started I think early this year, as Bitcoin price is going up the fees became high. I started thinking, if that's the case then Bitcoin price should go back to $40k, not until some corrections was made or something like that before the transaction fee came back to normal.I also thought if it was because we're on the halving period, things started going through my mind. Does it have to this way every two months in this year? If so then is really not helping in any way.",

From what I know, bitcoin’s transaction fees depend on how much transactions are waiting to be confirmed so if there are many who wants to sell their bitcoin then many are also waiting to get their transactions done.Hence the spike in transaction fees. If you want to join the mass movement then you’d have to pay for them.Obviously high transaction fees should be as a result of more Bitcoin transactions, that's ofcourse the logical reasoning behind it, so in this case that price is dipping, perhaps many holders are frantically selling off. Although it's ironic that investors are supposed to be buying more during price dip than selling, maybe as some are panicking and selling, others are rushing to buy, but whatever the case is, miners are having their hands full in confirming transactions, so inevitably transaction fees will hyke.",
