  "content": "Customer DIY key generation with TrezorDuring brunch in NYC, Krog and I were discussing issues faced by the collectible community.  The fact that a buyer has to inherently trust the keymaker to remain honest is a flaw. Polymerbit attempted to test how the market reacts to an alternative by releasing those DIY triangle notes in A4 format. Our findings were clear; only one buyer actually reported adding keys on the note. The fact that most people do not have an air gapped printer, meant that few were willing to go ahead with DIY keys. This stopped the DIY project dead in its tracks, forcing us to scrap the rest of the series. Korg suggested to try something new that may be useful to various coin makers. All coin makers are welcome to test this as well. In theory, this should allow Trezor holders to easily request custom keys for works issued by Polymerbit and others. A unique test print was made using this process, with the note being shipped to Korg. These notes would not be resold, but would be useful as gifts or for a personal collection. -------WARNING: Run a malware and antivirus program prior to starting.Reset a Trezor hardware wallet.      Write down the 12- or 24-word seed clearly on a piece of paper in the right order       Create a long passphrase, at least 16 characters long using letters, numbers and symbols. The longer the better.       Copy the public address given for the passphrase hidden wallet. Copy the QR code as well by using a screenshot if need be.      To verify correct transcription, you can confirm the backup via the Trezor “CHECK BACKUP” option or reset the Trezor, and input the seed and then the passphrase. If the correct seed and passphrase are input, then the same public address you have copied will be shown again. If not then you made a mistake and need to try again to confirm that what you wrote down is correct. There can be no errors in this procedure. Once they match, then send the public key to Polymerbit.                           Sending the SEED and the PUBLIC KEYS to POLYMERBIT              A different device should be used to send the seed to Polymerbit. This is so in the event the computer where the Trezor passphrase is being created is infected or has a keylogger, the only item the hacker will get is the passphrase, which will be useless without the seed.For additional security, the seed could also be mailed physically. ADDITIONAL INFO:       So, as a precaution the seed should be uploaded to Polymerbit’s website via a different device. The passphrase and the seed should never be seen on the same computer at all to ensure there is no vulnerability.   In the event the seed is compromised, it will be useless without the passphrase and the same if the passphrase is compromised, it is useless without the seed.The passphrase should be made of alphanumeric/symbols and be at least 16 characters long. Customer should be made aware to never share it and to place in secure spot. As the only way to be able to redeem the notes is with that passphrase and without it, then the Bitcoin will be lost forever.",

      "body": "Hi all.....Initially I did suggest using BIP38 like I used on my online stamp in 2017...its been loaded with 0.02 BTC since then and also the private keys exposed and the BTC still not stolen!      http://www.crypto-stamps.com/private3.html   But in order to do that...The person would need to get a program to create the BIP38 keys and also have an airgapped computer as well.That program can also be created maliciously by the coinmaker so you are vulnerable.   So this new idea dawned on me....the buyer would never need to have an airgapped computer at all or download any program and trust the coinmaker.   By using a well known wallet like Trezor, this will make a physical loaded item completely trustless!    Also it being a hierarchical deterministic wallet, you can actually create an infinite sets of keys as well.      The whole idea with this is as follows…     If polymerbit or any coinmaker came out with a certain note or coins….say 1 limited edition of 100…then they can still be created with my idea…the owner can still display his loaded physical item…in a limited edtion polymerbit…or coin and never ever have to worry his BTC will be swept!    Also the items can be loaded to face value by the maker as well…making the item loaded by creator and keys generated by owner!     Below is a sample made....all the seeds here are exposed and the addy is loaded with $200 worth of BTC. SO take it if you can crack it!     In a sold version the seed would be under a security hologram.     Another amazing thing is, you can then reset your Trezor and use it for another note or to use for your personal BTC stash.",

Would that put any of these seeds/keys at risk? Or is the passphrase sufficient? I simply dont trust hardware wallets.  Very good question....First of all, the hacker needs to have custody of your Trezor...THEN...the attacker must possess a specialized hardware tool, strong technical knowledge, and physical access to bypass the protection! How many have that knowledge and tools!    So there is a way around it....that is guaranteed that even if your trezor falls in a person with all this knowledge and tools....Simply, reset your Trezor!This will wipe away your seed and passphrase you have generated for your physical collectable device!  Its like it never existed at all! And you can then generate a new seed and use the wallet in whichever way you please!   BUT, for arguments sake...LETS SAY....you did not do that and the right people and equipment stole your trezor.     Even though they get your seed, they will not get your passphrase for your hidden wallet. They cannot tell if you ever had a hidden wallet as the seed only gets them to the first wallets that are used with passphrases. And the passphrases I am talking about is for the hidden wallets not the passcode to open the Trezor!        SO as per Trezor below...      How does it work?As part of the initialization process, your Trezor device generates a random number which is converted into a recovery seed and stored in the memory. Your Trezor uses this string of standard English words to generate your private keys, serving as a kind of 'master access key'  for unlocking access to your Bitcoin funds.By default, the Trezor Model One creates a wallet with a 24-word seed phrase, whereas the Trezor Model T generates a wallet using a 12-word seed. This is referred to as your 'Standard wallet' in Trezor Suite.By using a passphrase, you're effectively adding an extra word to the seed phrase, creating a brand new 'Hidden wallet'.In fact, you can generate as many passphrase-protected hidden wallets as you like, but you must be extremely careful not to lose any of your passphrases. Remember, if you lose a passphrase, you lose access to any funds stored in the hidden wallet!Essentially, whenever a Trezor device is used, it derives a cryptocurrency wallet using the following (extremely simplified) formula:           recovery seed + passphrase = hidden walletwhich can be summarized using the following schematic:",

Or I hope at least.    Trezor is 100% open source unlike some other wallets. Also any BIP39 wallet seed can be used on any other wallet that is BIP39...regardless if the company goes bust or not.    As per Trezor..    Trezor hardware wallets use open-source designs so security experts and researchers can audit every process. This means your device is kept updated against threats, both real and theoretical.When security is transparent, backdoors and potential exploits have nowhere to hide. Trezor is trust-less and decentralized, exactly like Bitcoin.       In the unexpected event that the company Trezor becomes insolvent, your device will continue to be the safest place for your coins.      This means that you can recover your cryptoassets on any BIP39 compatible wallet. For example, if you have cryptoassets on a Trezor One and the Trezor One gets lost or damaged, then you can enter in the recovery seed from the Trezor One into a Trezor Model T or a Ledger Nano S and recover all of your cryptoassets.",

GeoYes I like this and commend both Polymerbit and krogothmanhattan working through a solution to a problem which has been looming and brought to light by Yogg.Quote from: cygan on June 04, 2023, 10:31:34 AMi also find this idea very interesting and have already talked about it with polymerbit, how we could implement this in Icarus and when exactly.it would also be very helpful to know if you can do this procedure with other hw-wallets like bitbox2, foundation passport and so on - because not all crypto collectors own a Trezor. but i think there should be no problems here either i will meet with dan this week, then we can talk/discuss further about bip38 - looking forward to itIf this solution works along with other open source HW wallets it will cement the trust back into loading collectibles. It might also be fitting to have the Icarus project be thefirst to impliment a >HW wallet customer DIY key generated collectible<",

If I did one and I knew the Passphrase and the pk and seed are on the collectible in plain sight - does that not render the piece useless for selling? Maybe that was addressed above but I dont think I saw that.and would that slow down production? waiting for 200 customers to provide the information?its like doing every collectible the same way the Ballet Pro series was done.",
