Because I'm still finding my feet with reporting, I'm careful to (mostly) only report things that are objectively against the rules, and don't contain much (or any) of a subjective component to them.I'm not ruling out that I made a mistake, but I doubt it very much [1], and if I have then I'd like to learn from it, instead of being left in the dark.To the mod that handled that report (should be easy to find, I've only made 197 reports so far, and this is the first bad one): please PM me. (I'll obviously keep our conversation private, I just want to know how to avoid this in the future.)[1] Unless it's an older \"unhandled\" report that was revised; all my recent reports have been no-brainers, and I've carefully avoided the \"old post\" warning.",

      "body": "Reports as \"bad\" doesn't mean bad at all. As hard as mods try to be objective, they still understand the forum rules from their perspective and will handle reports their way. So, I don't think any evaluation should be given because I'm sure you're very careful with that report.Your chances of getting a bad score will increase as you report more going forwardd, and it's actually good that time told you too earlier (if you think so) so you don't have the awkwardness of reporting more as your report score is no longer perfect",

Especially when reporting you get the message: QuoteDo not worry about your accuracy too much; one accurate report is worth many inaccurate reports.It may have been reported wrongly by you or even an error by the moderators in rating it, but it's okay either way. I don't know if any moderator will PM you or give an explanation in the thread but I imagine they wouldn't want to give explanations every time for the ratings they give to the reports.",

And yes, bad ratings are annoying, but I stopped paying attention to them, and basically, I'm glad when my opinion coincides with the opinion of the moderators.This question has already been raised by Ratimov, but all he heard was that do not be discouraged and move on.I'm more annoyed by raw reports, and there are usually more of them than reports rated \"bad\"",

But when a high rank or respected user make a mistake, I report it and there's no action by the moderators because his post is still exist.The case is subjective, about bumping an old thread or replying on a deleted post. I guess there's a privilege for a high rank or respected user, that's make the moderators scared to delete their post.",

I've been there, it used to feel like a slap in the face for trying to help the forum. Until I changed my view on it: recently I \"proudly\" made my 100th Bad report (out of 9666).Quote from: PowerGlove on May 21, 2023, 02:31:49 AMBecause I'm still finding my feet with reporting, I'm careful to (mostly) only report things that are objectively against the rules, and don't contain much (or any) of a subjective component to them.That means you try to avoid border cases, I like to report them too to see where Mods draw the line. A \"Bad\" is basically a calibration of my reporting style. I made most of my Bad reports a long time ago, nowadays it's rare I make a Bad report. So \"calibration\" works QuoteTo the mod that handled that report (should be easy to find, I've only made 197 reports so far, and this is the first bad one): please PM me.If you reach 300 good reports, you can see which one is marked Bad. But the history goes back only 30 days, so there's a bit of a time limit.Quote[1] Unless it's an older \"unhandled\" report that was revisedI don't think that happens, I expect older reports to disappear from the Mod's list too.Quote from: Helena Yu on May 21, 2023, 04:18:05 AMwhen a high rank or respected user make a mistake, I report it and there's no action by the moderators because his post is still exist.It varies per board: on the Meta board, posts are rarely deleted. It's almost the same on Reputation. Mods seem to be more lenient on those boards, even for posts that are 100% off-topic.",

So when we saw one of these reports denied, we were kind of disgusted that we had \"failed\". But of course we didn't fail, we had a different criterion than moderation, and we hadn't realized it yet.Something similar has also happened to me, which has hurt all my good and bad reporting averages. At first, I was somewhat indignant, but then I realized why. Now I just have to be attentive, to improve that average.",

I doubt the mod will PM him regarding this matter because the topic is very subjective to the actual interpretation of the forum standards. We don’t know exactly what’s the post so the only thing we can do is watch in the sideline.Also, A moderator already addressed his uncertainty on the post below. Quote from: hilariousandco on May 21, 2023, 06:14:08 AMThe one for multiposting looks to have been incorrectly marked bad. This might be a relief since a reputable mod already gave verdict on his report.",

Others may also feels there's a need for their own report to be rechecked for inaccurate judgement2. The person or post you reported will likely be brought to discussion which should be only for the moderators to handle3. I don't think anything of this has ever happened before, questioning your mod on his judgement on your report.4. Filing a report is by choice and same is the judgement you received which does not have to be 100% accurate before it's important.",
