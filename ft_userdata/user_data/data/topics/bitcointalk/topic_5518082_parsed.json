  "content": "Before I start highlighting the issues with Bitcoin and its progress and development so far, let's first of all understand why it was created in the beginning to be able to determine whether or not it's progressing at the right direction or at a pace it ought to be progressing.In the past during the Bush/Obama era, there was a global financial crisis that necessitated the creation of a different financial system that is based on predetermined rules or protocols hardcoded into the it and difficult to change especially without community consent. This is to make it difficult for unilateral/unchecked decisions or changes to be made by few individuals that affect everyone who is part of the financial system.  For this to be possible the whole system has to be monitored and controlled by the community or participants, so that the unilateral changes become almost impossible. This would mean running the system in decentralized, transparent and trustless manner continously, otherwise it eventually becomes centralized for the unilateral changes by few corrupt individuals to be possible, which could possibly ruin the system and lead to financial crisis. This is what Bitcoin is about, to give control back to the community. Unfortunately, if not done right, a thing like Bitcoin, controlled and supervised by the community can be slow in progress or development compared to few people taking decisions without supervision. Much of the good ideas proposed to help develop Bitcoin without violating the important principles that enable it to be supervised and controlled by the community have not been implemented. This has kept Bitcoin poorly developed and slow in progress causing it to become somewhat outdated, slow, clunky, difficult to use, etc. By now, it should be possible to use Bitcoin in decentralized peer-to-peer manner with very cheap fees and really fast transaction on a very advanced system that can handle alot of things imaginable, but so far  very little to nothing has been achieved. Whatever advanced solution or progress that currently exist, actually deviate from the original goal of Bitcoin and could lead to crisis.Poor, deceptive and centralized alternatives have emerged, with solutions that seem to solve the Bitcoin issues, but underneath the whole thing is nothing but scams administered by greedy overlords who lack principles and have little to zero idea (or don't really care) why Bitcoin was invented in the first place",

Much of the good ideas proposed to help develop Bitcoin without violating the important principles that enable it to be supervised and controlled by the community have not been implemented. This has kept Bitcoin poorly developed and slow in progress causing it to become somewhat outdated, slow, clunky, difficult to use, etc.Do you compare Bitcoin to certain altcoins here, which market themselves to be \"faster\", \"easier to use\", etc.? These altcoins register different tradeoffs. A \"high throughput coin\" like Solana for example isn't superior technologically to Bitcoin. They can't escape the blocksize/decentralization dilemma, so SOL for example has enormous requirements for full nodes (128 GB minimum RAM, for example, while Bitcoin can run on 8 GB).Bitcoin deliberately choses to preserve decentralization, because decentralization is the main advantage of blockchains. For a highly centralized system like Solana, you don't need a blockchain really.And Bitcoin is not \"poorly developed\" at all. There are many real innovations taking place. The BIP process is quite straightforward, and good ideas without risk to harm decentralization, like Taproot, get implemented.In some phases some altcoins indeed can look like they developed \"faster\", but often once they reach a certain milestone, they tend to stay in a quite static state of development.Quote from: Ucy on November 13, 2024, 02:08:07 PMWhatever advanced solution or progress that currently exist, actually deviate from the original goal of Bitcoin and could lead to crisis.I think you refer to solutions like Lightning here. Why do you think it \"deviates\" from the \"original goal\" and \"leads to crisis\"?If not, then please clarify Quote from: Ucy on November 13, 2024, 02:08:07 PMPoor, deceptive and centralized alternatives have emerged, with solutions that seem to solve the Bitcoin issues, but underneath the whole thing is nothing but scams administered by greedy overlords who lack principles and have little to zero idea (or don't really care) why Bitcoin was invented in the first place Here I partly agree, centralized L2's are among these solutions. But there is also progress in this area. Projects like BitVM and even some L2s like Nomic and tBTC (Threshold Network) actually do solve problems and push Bitcoin forward.",

The problem is, majority of the people are still uneducated and unaware about the true potentials of bitcoin. Bitcoin is not actually the government’s enemy, but it could be the only key instead to promote financial sovereignty of the country’s economy. I think the best preparation for this is through educating and raising awareness thru public education campaigns that will highlight on financial inclusion. When people finally understand about bitcoin, then it’s easier for them to adapt and adjust, and take progress with bitcoin.",

More people are embracing Bitcoin. Bitcoin has one major problem: high network fees. If other payment systems are cheaper and faster than Bitcoin, that would be a big problem. This issue can be fixed, although it has refused to be fixed.  Aside from that, I don't see how bitcoin is becoming obsolete compared to other coins. Currently, bitcoin has a 60% market dominance, a \"slow in progress or development\" coin won't do that considering there are thousands of other coins out there.Bitcoin has its issues, but slow in progress and development isn't one of them in my opinion.",

So, it wasn't the 2007-2008 financial crisis that necessitated the creation Bitcoin. Perhaps it's the fiat system, the kind of money built upon debt, that necessitated it.
