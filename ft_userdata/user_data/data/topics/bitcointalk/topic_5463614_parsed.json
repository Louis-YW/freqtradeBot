I had a similar thought when I saw this post. It took me some time to understand what op was trying to convey. I understand the message you're aiming to share, which could be helpful for newcomers. However, the way you've presented your post gives me the impression that it's a newcomer advising other newcomers. Your explanation of why they shouldn't invest now and how to navigate the process is lacking. At first, I had doubt this is from a high ranked member. And On checking your profile and post history, noticed you primarily focus on the altcoin section of the forum. I'm sorry to say, but I'm aware that many users from that section often make low-quality posts. I strongly believe you should improve your posting skills before creating content of higher quality, which is expected from someone of your rank.",

I know that many experience investors usually say one should just invest in bitcoin and leave other cryptocurrencies because bitcoin doesn’t have risk of losing. But even with bitcoin one still needs to calm down and learn mostly on security of bitcoin like which wallet is reputable to be used, how to set up the wallet and how to safeguard your keys.

Quote from: Jocuserious on August 17, 2023, 05:56:34 PMDo not trade to soonI agree with this one because trading is a very scary thing to consider especially when you know that you can loose the money you are trying to get. I do not even see it as necessary for every newbie to cryptocurrency to learn to trade, you can just do like some of us are doing which is to buy and just keep the bitcoins.

It’s more profitable to invest early and hodl to see a bull run. We saw how successful early investors in bitcoin are, it can be said that investing early is the best strategy after doing your research on the project.

Then you can get an idea of ​​when and how you should proceed.Agreed. It’s not advisable for newbies to venture into day trading without having sufficient knowledge of the fundamentals of trading. Crypto trading is so complex that watching YouTube videos and reading books online do not do enough justice to the subject. I always recommend the easy and safe strategy, which is buy and hodl bitcoin until the market rises above your buying price.",

Even not a newbie wouldnt invest early when he doesnt have idea of the project, the team, concept and sense of legality.  But if someone able yo review all details and its looks good. Dont invest late and just jump on the ship early since the road to gain is much sweetet when you have already invested so early.",
