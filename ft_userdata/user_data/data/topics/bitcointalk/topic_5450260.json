That's more than 20x isn't it?So when people make that shit ton of money, they start investing in shit projects which don't end up good and that leads to destruction which you might have seen in 2022.Also, a 70% correction after a 2000% pump is inevitable. It's just whales playing the game, that affects clowns which leads to bad news.I hope it makes sense now.",

I'm quite confident that there are articles that came out after halving but it's most likely that the noise coming from the hype is louder that any of these \"ban\" and lawsuits. I bet nobody cares about SEC and central banks when you see a lot of long green candles.",

That's the reality, right? it's not only about Bitcoin, but the other event is same. Any articles never discuss about banks collapsed and it's not safe to hold your money in banks, but when Silicon Valley Bank was collapsed, there are many articles discuss about banks collapsed, advice anyone to hold that the maximum amount FDIC can insure and recommend to diversify to other investments.When bear market happen, people will panic, so to make people more panic they're create FUD or bad news.",

Although I am not an old bitcoiner just like you have stated but I wouldn’t say that during bear market we experienced the bad things, but rather what I have observed is it is this bad news that actually bring up the bear market. When there’s restrictions or ban on cryptocurrency then many people just withdraw their funds and not the other way around. Also if an hack happens to all this big exchanges we experience bear period as more funds are withdrawn. The government actually reduces there restrictions during fiat problems like bank bankruptcy or should I say they have seen how investors were patient during the bear market and they would just have to reduced the restrictions just to find a way to regulate it since people are moving towards it at a higher rate than in the bearish period",

It's just in a bear market, bad news are considered as really bad but in bear market, bad news are easily ignored by people. The same for good news which is considered nothing in a bear market but is something like a nuclear bomb for Bitcoin explosion in a bull market.If you need examples, see the Bitcoin obituariesBitcoin is dead chartBitcoin obituaries",

Media manipulation is worst before than this especially when China is still involved in Bitcoin. It’s normal that news outlet create a news that follows the trend since that’s what most user wants to read due to current condition. It’s easier to sell a bad news on a chaotic market than bullish since no one will be interested to read it if it’s against the current market condition.These news bad and good are existing in daily basis. Mainstream media just picking the specific news that related to the current thread to attract viewers. They are getting profit from traffic. I’m they will not gonna sell news that is not approprite to the trend.",

That is why it is difficult for someone who does not understand what BTC is to use the dca strategy, that method is for strong hands and for people who know what BTC really is, weak hands only want to fomo buy and sell out as fast as they can. Market manipulations happens in the industry, but it does not affect BTC to much because of how decentralized it is and the lack of decisive control in the hands of anyone or group.",

It depends on how you look at it, because even if what you say is true, then it is still somewhat \"normal\" for someone to play you once or maybe twice because you are young, naive and inexperienced. But it's not normal if you don't learn anything from it, and for anyone who turns on their brain a little, the rules of the \"game\" become clear - so instead of someone \"playing\" you, why not use the rules of the game to your advantage?\"Play me once, shame on you. Play me twice, shame on me\"",

Bitcoin does have a tendency to create perfect storms quite often. No idea if these events are orchestrated to help create these peaks and valleys or if it is just a side effect as people scramble to find explanations for the price movements. All that really matters is the four year cycle though. Zoom out, ignore the news, and stick to your plan.",

You do not sound stupid @OP,Life is a series of events, Good sometimes and the other time events that are bad. Nobody is playing you, just know that at times when the positive events are more than the negative events, there will be a bull, and at other times when there are more negative events, the market will be affected. When there are positive events, it doesn't mean that there is no negative event with the potential to affect the market that has happened, it just means that the events are not negative enough to overshadow the positive events, this goes the other way as well too.",

Both during bear and bull markets, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general become trending topics that even those who have no clue about them read about. I even caught my father a few months ago reading and commenting about an article about the so-called collapse of Bitcoin, when it reached a low of $18,000. My father is quite old, knows nothing about cryptocurrencies, and hardly does anything more complicated than browse the internet.Do you see my point? Cryptocurrencies are easily become viral topic, because some people praise them while others hate them, and this is what journalists take advantage of, it's news that anybody would possibly read.",

My view During a bear market, investors may be more risk averse and therefore more sensitive to negative news. In addition, they may be more likely to report negative events during a bear market because they are perceived as more newsworthy. This can create a negative cycle reinforcing the bearish sentiment.I think market cycles and media coverage are closely linked but in this moment i think  the investors are very smart now, I guess it's easy to see it is just a matter of correlating then adjusting the data to the facts only Although it is possible that some entities are deliberately manipulating the market through the spread of false information in order to avoid getting caught up in fear or hype and making investment decisions based on research and good analysis.",
