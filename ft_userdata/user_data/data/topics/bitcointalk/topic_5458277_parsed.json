What do we humans have to change about teaching to face a future with much more powerful machines and sophisticated AI?I think that the way we teach today has completely changed in the sense that we learn much more complex topics than those presented here,we use online tools,online exams,we learn a lot about network,servers and all the related IT staff beside basic programming which needs a lot of logic applied that we get from math.I know that AI is becoming more and more popular but I highly doubt that to put at risk our jobs or to hinder our advance in technology when in fact it should be the complete opposite,AI should help us move further faster.Therefore we have not that much to improve in teaching,what we have to improve is to provide this education to a whole lot more people than we are providing it right now and that can make a change.",

What do we humans have to change about teaching to face a future with much more powerful machines and sophisticated AI?Those days we went to school, we would have to go to school with books and pens to copy notes from the blackboard. We have to spend so much time learning multiplication tables and some mathematical formulas. Using the same strategy in this dispensation will be a total waste of time. Children now shouldn't even go to school with books and pencils because all they need is a tablet or laptop. Installing certain computer application and some AI tools in the computer will be all the child need to connect to the 21st century learning tool that will transfer the current learning experience needed to contribute to society. But the problem we have in my location is a lack of quality teachers. Most teachers are not exposed to technology which limits their ability to guide pupils. Poverty and lack of computer facilities are other major challenges. So many families cannot afford some of these technological tools making their children backward in the current educational environment.",

This is more of my earlier response. In the past it was a pride that a little boy or girl in a family has started going out in the morning to school but because of some failure in education system of some countries, that zeal for learning is falling. Most homes don't have that push to go to school because they expect employment to be the end result unfortunately that is not happening as Al techniques are taking over the job space. The class of parents that are committed to still see their children to school are those who are educated themselves because they know education is an asset. The government has to fund education more and restrategize on the curriculum where it will capture sound teaching techniques and practicals because practical is fast disappearing.",

What do we humans have to change about teaching to face a future with much more powerful machines and sophisticated AI?and I'm not sure a different approach in teaching will bridge the gap needed tostay in touch with the pace that AI can learn.Learning tables has to be the foundation to every math problem. The only alternativecould only be starting kids of with their tables at age 1 or 2 instead of 4 but realisticallyhow much benefit could a child earn from starting 2 seasons sooner when the potentially reach the limit 2 seasons earlier.The human brain can only compute so much right?https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a28943849/unsolvable-math-problem/",

AI has brought laziness to pupils and students to learn and solve their simple arithmetic on their own. I think that the education system should be rebranded to make students pick interest in learning. We have seen how AI has stolen a lot of jobs from people this makes people see that we AI anything can be done easily and they no longer value education.",

At what level of education should machine learning and AI be introduced? I believe the teaching curriculum should be improved and I feel it has been improved to an extent, the problem is some countries have refused to develop (no offense).Forcing little kids to learn complex AI text is not the way forward, besides not everybody has an interest in things like that. I don't believe the world has gotten to a stage where you can't live without advanced tech, it would definitely get there, but it's not there yet. So what should happen from my point is view is giving young kids kind of an introduction. Keep their minds open and let them choose when they get older.",

What do we humans have to change about teaching to face a future with much more powerful machines and sophisticated AI?Progress in the development of artificial intelligence technologies requires adjustments in teaching methods, at least in the part that focuses on the fact that students will do their homework on their own (because this assumption is often false). However, the value of traditional classical education in itself does not decrease with the development of artificial intelligence, but rather increases. And in many ways, it is the care and responsibility of parents to ensure that their children make efforts to master the curriculum on their own, and do not resort to digital assistants for help. Because along with the problem of \"digital inequality\", which is often talked about a lot, there is also the problem of \"digital dementia\", which is less well-known, but no less acute and relevant. The bottom line is that by relying too much on digital assistants, children don't give their brains enough work and become dumber as a result.",

What do we humans have to change about teaching to face a future with much more powerful machines and sophisticated AI?This question should raise a serious concern. Humanity really need to change the way they teach and learn, not necessarily to contest with AI but for advancement. AI isn't a threat to humanity because AI is also a creation of humanity. Teaching should be divided into two;1. Learning of bits on 000 and 111 001101002. Learning of other things of lifeWith this, we could produce more people that knows about digits and will comfortably suit the evolving world of tech.",
