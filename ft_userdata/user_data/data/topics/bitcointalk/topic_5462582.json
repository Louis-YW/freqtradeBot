Do not get it wrong, your friend did not invested in bitcoin, he was trading which is another thing entirely. Bitcoin ATH is $69000. Bitcoin today price is $29800 now. Even if he invested in bitcoin at ATH, he would not have lost everything. And bitcoin will still get to $69000 and increase above the price, only what is needed is time.If he invested in bitcoin, time of profit will come even if he invested at the wrong time. Anyone that wants to invest in bitcoin can gain more if they are able to make research about bitcoin price, bitcoin halving and following the latest news like spot bitcoin ETF in United States.",

And doesn't matter how experienced you are on crypto market, trading will be always a risky deal. The market is too volatile and you may end selling BTC cheaper than you bought, if you aren't a patient investor who forgot drawing long term goals when planning the investment.",

It's actually possible for one to invest and earn profit from bitcoin without having trading knowledge, as what is just required of you is to buy and hold. When it is time to sell, you can contact someone whom you can either do P2P with or who can help you sell it in an open market.Quote he went and sold his property to invest on Bitcoin without been knowledgeable about it. This is the end result of being misinformed about something. Misinformation always leads people to make bad decisions that usually end up affecting them. If the person who invited the person in question was wise enough to explain to him that Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme, I don't think the person could have hurriedly rushed to sell off his land just to invest as if Bitcoin is running or they have seen that the price wants to pump in the coming days and they want to take advantage of it.But by the way, how did the buyer eventually lose everything just in a short period of time, as just holding bitcoin without trading it will not liquidate your assets; instead, the value will only reduce, which you can still sell off anytime and take what is left? Or did the guy in question buy the bitcoin and decide to use it on future trading, which I believe is the fastest way for one to lose everything within a short duration? Or could it be possible that the story is just an illusion?",

Investing in any business without proper knowledge will ultimately lead to losses. I am suspecting that your friend was driven by greed so he invested in a Ponzi or scam scheme that claimed to be a Bitcoin investment scheme. The reason for my suspicion is that you said he lost all his money, meanwhile, Bitcoin prices have not dropped to zero. Many scam schemes promise huge gains and pretend to be Bitcoin investments all over cyberspace. So one needs to verify the genuineness of any scheme before investing.

This not only happens to you of the OP but a lot of newbies have these misconceptions as well.

Even though your friend has to start from a defeat. But fortunately he chose to study in the end. And what I can say about bitcoin is that it is more suitable as a long term investment. And it is better to avoid short-term trades. Especially if we don't have enough insight and experience about trading. And between investing and trading there is a big difference. And it looks like your friend made a trade and maybe he panicked when the price crashed and started selling. Maybe you should start teaching about investment methods that are simpler and more measurable, such as the DCA method. we don't have to invest a lot at once. We can start investing gradually little by little with cold money that we can save for the long term. And remember if the initial intention is for a long term investment then it is better to avoid checking the market too often. Because it can affect our mentality in investing. Unless we are traders, it is natural to always check the market.",

Without considering the other side of the story, they let stories fill their heads about how people make money from trading and constantly view trading as a get-rich-quick scheme. They fail to realise that every successful story also has an opposite side that involves the struggle and instead assume that the successful individuals whose stories they have heard simply woke up one day and began making money. New traders frequently believe that they can start trading right away without any prior knowledge. Even if you have adequate information to trade, you still need to be careful how you go about it or you could end up losing money because trading involves a lot of dedication to understand the market and techniques to follow to minimise loss.Quote from: Smartgoat on August 08, 2023, 10:53:36 PMHe came and told me everything. i feel pity on him, and started teaching him how Bitcoin is been trade and invest.

He is fortunate to have you nearby because without you, he might have run to the books to learn how trading is conducted. Many people encounter a similar situation because they believe they can skip the learning phase and jump straight to the profitable part, but they all end up returning to the books to learn. Since nobody is born knowing everything, there is always a learning phase in life from which we cannot escape if we are to succeed in anything.",
