  "content": "I own some Baikal X10 Miners. Most of them work like they should and mine GRS for me. For some reason 3 of the miners that i recently bought does not let me choose the groestl algorythm to mine and I do not understand why. I flashed PiZero_GX10_190623_V2.2 to the SD card but that made no difference. Is there anything else that needs to be updated?",

      "body": "It should be just a FW difference. Compare the rigs that work vs the ones that don't and note all differences, hardware, SW everything.You could try clomning the FW from a rig that works to one that doesn't to see if that makes a difference.It's a matter of identifying the point of deviation, the one thing that makes the difference between working and not working.Then it's whether it's something you can fix like FW, or not like HW.Sorry to be so vague but I've never got my hands on one so I can't be more specific.",

      "body": "Sorry can't help you with specifics. FW can mean a few different things like the bootloader, networking, management etc. But it's also the part that directs the ASIC chips to produce thedesired hash. The Baikal is basically a x11 miner and Groestl is a subset of x11. If the chips can do x11they can also do Groestl, Quark, etc with the right FW telling the ASIC chips what to do.Theoretically the HW should be the same and you only need the FW that knows about Groestl.I don't know how Baikal packages their FW and whether it's in seperate files.Hopefully someone more familar with Baikal miners can help you out. Good luck.",
