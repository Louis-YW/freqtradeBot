      "body": "I agree with you on your argument, as I have also been taught about those two trends, which are the so-called metaverse, as some also call it, or argumentative reality—things we actually can't see. In the aspect of the NFT, which took the internet by storm, and those in the crypto space were also pumping in their investments in that direction; they were all short-term projects that couldn't last more than a given period due to their lack of use case, as you have already identified. Whoever can get the most marketing also has the highest bid in the market. In fact, what I noticed in the aspect of the NFT was that most of the sales from the onset were even completely scams in the first place. What they did was mint an NFT, place it in the open market, and make it open for a bid. Now, the same people in charge of the project will use another wallet to make a bid for the NFT with a higher price, which they can agree to sell and transfer to the buyer. Now, the same person will place the NFT for sale in the open market, allowing them to gather another amount of money a bit higher than what it was exchanged for before to buy it again. This is just the same circle of people trying to manipulate the price and make the transaction visible in the blockchain. Now, they will have to make headline news promoting the same NFT to attract other investors who will fall victim to their trap. Most art works that were bought for millions of dollars during the time when NFT was trending can't even be priced for $10,000 again by anyone who knows what they need in crypto. Most people don't know what they want; they just follow hype and trends to make profit, which usually ends them up in a scam trap.",

NFT and NFT real estate had became a trend before and I think it is not different from other trend before like ICO, IDO, gamefi projects before that has little to zero value today. The survival rate of projects on crypto is very low and around 90% of the projects doesn't last a cycle before they got abandoned. I guess it's normal for me that NFT became useless, it's proven that majority of NFT doesn't really have a utility and only for display or clout. Sooner or later it would be normal for you to see it that way.",

The concept behind these innovative solutions may not entirely be wrong but the players found therein are the reverse of the solution those innovations presents.Also, the tech did not find its way into mainstream properly, thereby making it premature in nature. Not that it does not have the ability but the abuse by fraudulent players made investors pull out of the space and that has left people with the notion that it is a total failure.",

I'd admit that the major reason why you feel NFT are the way they are is because some founders and so called creatives of those NFT projects only made those NFT projects out of the sheer motivation of money and majority of them were outright garbage. What's interesting is that, the market doesn't care. As long as there's a possibility for the price to go up easily and they can rinse, repeat and move the liquidity to another shitty jpegs, everyone's good with it.As someone who has dabbled with code and experienced (on a granular level) how NFTs work and how they can be created, I'd say it has much more better use cases than it was used for in the past which was obviously pump abd dump. Use cases like  soul-bound tokens, Gated experiences and more.As for Real estate based project, I've seen plenty of those especially during the ICO days and I've come to the conclusion that not all real world assets can be tokenized. I know Real World assets (RWA) is a word easily thrown in crypto these days.",

You are talking about that tech linked to some images. They can be linked to anything. Also, i am quite concerned that people are using same arguments about nfts as nocoiners are using about countless tokens and cryptos. That they are a scam and have no real value, except when people decide to give them value. Just like with most cryptos out there. Only difference being that they represent unique assets and are illiquid. But most cryptos out there are illiquid and dead.",

But the thing is that decision to invest in NFTs or real estate projects virtual or physical is personal.

In reality, I also find this redundant.Before that, in the period when people viewed it as a trend, the exaggeration of features could be applied to life, but it never showed its true value. I remember in the last bull cycle, there was a lot of money flowing into this sector, and that's part of the reason we saw so much crap being traded. I can imagine NFTs as an inapplicable trend that will continue to fade into memory in the crypto development journey, similar to the ICO boom of 2017 and everyone not paying much attention to it after that.",

It was designed afaik to create a system where artists could sell their art online in a way that duplication wouldn't be possible (or even if was, legitimacy can easily be proven) and there was also a mechanic for resales iirc? The idea was nice really, execution well idrk how much better ir could've been but you can see what happened when it was executed, it went horribly bad. And well, fools are a dime a dozen when it comes to places where there's the possibility of a get-rich-quick scheme, regardless of whether it has a use case or not. Most people don't even look at that and just look at how much profit they could gain instead.",

What of those NFTs that were sold for a lower (yet a lot of money) amount? Starting from $1,000 to $5,000, $10,000 you also think it’s all money laundering? In as much as I do not really buy the concept of NFTs and have never and will likely never purchase an NFT, I believe that there are people who see value in it. I do not let my own thoughts overshadow the truth. Some people may be using it for money laundering but there are others who actually are invested in this; I am talking about those people who really buy and sell NFTs",

Not actually the biggest since there are more larger than that, but for sure one of greatest scam created by those persons involve in that scam business so maybe we should forget about investing on those things since there's no proper usage of those NFT's and they are just presenting us something that still in their control. Before where NFT is new maybe for other they can say its profitable but at current condition then maybe not since there are just small number of groups just hyping it and maybe they still want to earn from those NFT's or simply they want to recover the money they lost then they want to use the newbie so that they would buy their NFT holdings or rather believe that NFT still alive and it just experiencing a down trend just like other potential alts so they need to worry about that.
