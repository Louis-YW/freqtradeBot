      "body": "Usually this happens when two blocks are mined within a few seconds of each other.Let's say you mine Block A and broadcast it. When I receive it, I need to verify it, verify all the transactions it contains, go through my mempool and remove all the transactions which are included in your block, and then go through my UTXO set and remove all the UTXOs which have just been spent in that block and update my set with all the new UTXOs created. I then need to pick a new set of unconfirmed transactions to place in to my candidate block which I am going to attempt to mine on top of Block A, and calculate the necessary Merkle tree. All that takes time - usually just a few seconds, but time nonetheless. In the meantime, do I just have all my miner sitting idle? No, that would be a waste of money. Instead I have them attempt to mine Block B, which builds on top of Block A, but only contains a coinbase transaction to myself. They will only attempt to mine this block for a few seconds, until I update them with a new candidate block which is filled with transactions, but very rarely they are successful and find a block within those few seconds.The timestamp of the block you have linked to is also quite interesting, since it is later than not just the next block, but also the block after that.Quote from: barrysty1e on May 15, 2022, 09:06:49 AMThe majority of it stopped around April last year (2021) *cough*.I count 208 empty blocks since April last year: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=transaction_count%281%29%2Ctime%282021-04-01..%29",

The miners have an incentive to maximize their immediate revenue because their equipment has a limited useful life. Including an additional transaction into a block does have a cost because the miner needs to validate the transaction is valid, and for each additional transaction included in a block, it will take an incremental additional amount of time for the block to get propagated to the rest of the network. Based on orphan rates of under 1%, and according to BlackHatCoiner above, a ~1.7% rate of total block rewards being made up of transaction fees, the theoretical maximum cost to include any transactions is below the revenue generated by including transactions. As such, including transactions is EV positive.It is difficult to know with certainty if the timestamps of the block in question and the prior block are accurate. Timestamps can be up to two hours off and blocks will still be accepted.To answer the OP's question, for whatever reason, the miner that found the block in question, ViaBTC, was unable to construct a block that includes transactions after they received and validated the prior block, prior to them finding the block they found.",

Anyway, it was probably an accident that occurred in the meantime.I wouldn't call it \"faked\" in the usual sense of the word, since there is very little incentive for a single miner to fake a timestamp, and actually no punishment for doing so within the consensus rules. What constitutes an acceptable block timestamp is actually quite broad - anywhere between the median time of the last 11 blocks (plus one second) and 2 hours in the future (based on adjusted network time). Most miners keep timestamps fairly accurate, but they are free to vary them within the (on average) 3 hour window these rules stipulate. Sometimes miners have latency issues (which might also explain why they are mining empty blocks), and some may vary the timestamp as an additional nonce field.It's not that uncommon to see a block with a later timestamp than a subsequent block, but it is a bit more rare to see a block with a later timestamp than the two subsequent blocks.",

You cannot possibly manage to trick and mislead the pool or miner for long enough, and if you do then the costs of which is far too much (>$190K per block). It is the same principle as an attack on an SPV client, unless your opponent is a small time miner that takes virtually no precautions, then the chances of success is not high at all. Any reasonable miner would be as well connected as possible with multiple redundancies.Just to reiterate, I don't think anyone is purely SPV mining without any validation but this attack would be as pointless as a 51% attack on the network.",

I mean, you've put yourself into buying all those hardware, build a mining rig, make effort to ask questions/read answers, trying to do this as much efficiently and profitably as possible, and you can't just do the only verification that is vital in this system?",

Actually almost all the time it is another pool that miners the empty block because they are \"spy mining\" and get the successful header before the block is even propagates and start working on the next block right away. Otherwise if it is their own block they don't need to \"collect transactions\" since they already know what transactions were included in that previous block.only true at the very second you win that current(first) block to know to base the next block on YOUR previous block, because obviously you dont know to build a second block based on a first, until you know you won the first.. obviously.. then you can use a template that includes transactions you might have picked for the next block while making the previous block. but the chances of winning 2 blocks in a row didnt warrant the inefficiency to be building 2 templetes(parent and child) simultaneouslyhowever. if you are not lucky to have made the current(first) block then you have to scrap that block(parent). and scrap your blocktemplate of what you hope to be the next block(child). because someone else solved the current(first) block before you.so most pools dont even bother pre-empting they will get 2 blocks in a row by having a second template filled with TX's ready. as thats more time consuming.especially when they have to have lots of different templates per asic to make sure all asics have different 'work' to churn throughmost pools dont SPV either. instead they know every X seconds is a round of nonce/extra nonce churning a bunch of asic go through, meaning new headers are needed to be sent every X seconds within the average 10min window..(many many rounds).in short. pools do/will correctly validate all the rules apply and all data apply to the rules. they dont avoid full validation. they just know each step takes time so they build on it as they go through the steps  by building whilst going through the rounds of extranonce changes to the templateso in the first few rounds. they start with empty block.. and start adding more transactions per round. (much more efficient this way to start with 0tx and add a few every extranonce round)its just lucky that they solved a second block quickly.. meaning because they solved it within the first few rounds of churning through extra nonce of XXX many rounds per ~10min. in those first rounds the transaction count was lacking. because they were lucky to get a block solve quick...i know you will try to suggest that a block solve of a second block found in the very first round of extranonce churn would be a 'spv' which is conversationally correct because that few milliseconds of the first round they probably have not done all the verification.. but these empty blocks are not solved in the very very first round(out of all empty blocks the chances of them being solved in milliseconds is super small). its normally a few rounds later.(long enough to do the checks but not long enough to purge the mempool and collate new transactions)..spv mining is not a large cost saving to just avoid doing all consensus checks on all the block data. nor time saving just to avoid validity checking all the block. but if they were to avoid checking completely, this can cause alot of reject risk if they blindly build ontop a block they dont check throughout their block solve attempt.. so with huge cost at risk vs negligible saving. they see no point in SPV mining, as the saving is not worth the risk.the real reason for empty block has nothing to do with spv mining. and everything to do with making a basic block template without transactions where the only variable they need to add is the previous solve hash. and then do checks and then purge confirmed transactions and then add new transactions to the next round of extranonce churn..i remember some time ago someone looked at all the blocks that appeared to be solved quickly after a previous block, and seen not only were there empty blocks but also partially filed blocks. whereby they could roughly guess how quick (in physical time) that second block was actually solved. based on how full the block was.it was not an exact science. but it did reveal some interesting things.",
