      "body": "There are limited data that can make us know that Binance is the most successful exchange in Nigeria. Or if anyone can provide the data needed by showing each crypto exchanges trading volume from Nigeria, that will be good. Although, Binance is the largest exchange in the world. One of the reasons Nigerians are using Binance is because on most crypto exchanges as at then, to convert directly to naira was difficult or not possible, but Binance made it easy.When CBN banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, many exchanges that Nigerians were using suspended operation for a while, example is Luno and Quidax (not recommendable). Because of that, some Nigerians look for other exchanges at the time, Binance P2P has been existing at that time. P2P market price was better than time too, than on some exchanges like Luno and Quidax which later found a way to continue to operate in Nigeria.Another reason are the altcoins that Binance accepted. People just like altcoins and new new projects, even as dangerous and risky like gambling as they are. Centralized exchanges that are supporting bitcoin along with altcoins are the ones existing now. You can see some like Localbitcoins stopped operation.Binance is advancing with the latest crypto advancement existing. They do not slow to adopt what are the latest, like the time of altcoins, blockchain tokens, NFTs. I have heard that Binance started Ordinals and BRC-20 token marketplace or something. I may not be totally correct about Ordinals and Inscriptions because I have limited knowledge about it and not following the latest new about it.Trading fee on Binance is kind of cheaper and also withdraw is kind of cheap. Binance follows the way to attract people in the world and Nigerians were among the people because they know how Nigerians are interested in cryptocurrencies. Binance make crypto more accessible to those that wants to buy with naira.Binance support BTC/NGN, USDT/NGN, and P2P NGN which nearly all other exchanges are not supporting up till now.",

I have equally seen the flexibility and accessibility, especially the p2p functionality, that Binance offers and I think this should be the reason for the acceptance. However, I feel that the p2p aspect of Binance that makes a lot of Nigerians go for it still have it's associated risks.",

As dem be the most popular exchange globally na so dem carry trapped Nigerians as we sabi follow follow and since Binance noticed a lot of Nigerians were using their platform dey decided to capitalize on the Nigerian market. Make I shock you, binance never do any major promotion for Nigeria, na we dey promote binance ourselves. Our top influencers for the crypto world they worship Cz feet na him dey invite them to all the shows wey binance dey sponsor for free and as him dey get those influence in locked na so dem dey promote am. Also Binance begin offering services wey go encourage Nigerians to use theirs platforms as Charles dun outline.Binance success na because dem sabi seize opportunity when dem see am. Before Binance we get other exchanges both home and abroad wey dun stand ground for Nigeria but dem no survive because dem no get international backings (like dem no popular globally) and we Nigerians we sabi value oyinbo package pass our own. Binance no too strong like dat for other African countries and dem dun try wan enter the market and conquer Africa as a whole. Them be follow among the last sponsors of AFCON and dem dey steadily support projects then wey get to do with cryptocurrency for the continent and Nigeria been the largest mean say dem go get interest from many people for this side to they use their exchange as na the exchange wey dem dey see be dat.",

They gained prominence through their exchange pairs at first ie direct trade or exchange with the Nigeria naira which made Nigerians embrace them speedily but before then, KYC verification was a problem between Nigerians and other exchange which was making it difficult for Nigerians but binance came in and resolved it with ease through easy verification and requirements process and that alone made them the number Crypto exchange in Nigeria.  Lastly, i believe binance operates with a team of seasonal financial experts because so far, I have never seen any exchange that can counter binance opetational measures not to talk of near competing with them.",
