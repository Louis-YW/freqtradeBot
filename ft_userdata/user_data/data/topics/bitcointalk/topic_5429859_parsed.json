I Why they cant recognize that facial thing? If this is really your account then it shouldn't really be a problem on trying out to verify if you do have the needed information, like emails used, number or something like that, because if it was your account then it wont really be that a problem on providing on whats been asked.As for the question if you should be pulling off your long time locked funds or investment stored in Binance then its up to you.I wont be surprised that majority of peoplenow had already the doubts towards Binance after that FTX incident.",

So what could have been the beginning of your woes?Regardless try to recover your funds as fast as possible. You don't want to wait until Binance and BNB collapse.",

The reason why is because without 2fa it’s hard to prove you are the true account holder. Hence why it’s a very long process.",

Look at the mess FTX made, yet It wasn't even the biggest exchange. Now imagine something similar happening to Binance with the so many small, promising start-ups they have acquired along the way. Damn, it would be massive!So far so good for them, I understand it's business, but people gotta watch their backs.",

I don't really understand what the OP's problem really is, but if it's just the password then obviously the account can still be recovered some time and is only limited to making withdrawals within 24 hours.I thought the problem was completely different, but I don't know because the OP hasn't responded to anything after a few days.",

I think that simply means that he is doing shady acts inside the platform which resulted for his account to get locked and now binance is asking for some verifications for him to prove that he is the real owner of the account. If he truly buys it then his last resort would be to contact that account seller again and let him do the KYC process. He will only need to pay that guy again though.Almost 4 years have passed already and the OP seem can't move on yet. I wonder if how much is the money that is trap inside that account but I know the reason why he should up again though I think he can't join those who withdraw their BNB because his case is a little sensitive.",
