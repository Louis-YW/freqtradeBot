The major US banks are still there and running. So...Has Bitcoin the potential to replace the banking system? Yes, of course. That's what Bitcoin was invented for.But will it happen (in near future)? I really doubt that.Quote from: Greggry on March 15, 2023, 06:14:37 PMWill the world now truly appreciate Satoshi and #Bitcoin?No, we're still early.",

Buying and selling of stuffs by easily ease stress.Bitcoin is not some sort of AI that can do human jobs, Bitcoin itself is a currency, and i don't see a way it can help develop the traditional banking system as they both operate in a different way. Having said that, in traditional banking these days everything isn't done over the counter, there is of course mobile/internet banking and a lot of digital stuffs that makes banking quite easy.Quote from: bullrun2020bro on March 15, 2023, 06:26:04 PMHas Bitcoin the potential to replace the banking system? Yes, of course. That's what Bitcoin was invented for.I'm afraid Bitcoin does not have the potential to replace the traditional banking system, neither was it created by Satoshi for that purpose. Bitcoin was created to be an alternative peer to peer currency that would function/work without any third party, it can definitely co-exist with FIAT and the banking system.",

Probably they are just way off threaten what crypto can do financially thats why they make some news or noise about financial restriction, or fud about it. Maybe its hard to accept that banks are being overthrown in terms of a systematic system and transparency made by blockchain. Well on the other note. Most stablecoins arent gonna crack down by feds or issues so let them buy bitcoin.",

      "body": "According to Jack Mallers' tweet, he believes the US financial system is failing as a result of the Federal Reserve's actions, and that this might herald the start of a new era in American finance. Mallers contends that Bitcoin should be recognized as legal money for digital marketing in order to increase the efficiency of financial institutions and facilitate buying and selling.It's worth mentioning that perspectives on the present health of the US financial system and Bitcoin's position in it are mixed. Some regard Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a potential answer to existing banking system problems, while others see them as a hazardous and unproven alternative. As with any complicated situation, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and gather information from a variety of sources before making a judgement.",

I recently watch Johhny Harris youtube the tittle is \"Your Bank Account is Lie \" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_VKZ6dzauo after watched the video you might will understand. From economic crisis 2008 that major bank is collapse gov will bailout the bank, the circulation is like that.",

Legalization of bitcoin will have been better but the government lack of control of it will always be a big problem for them to think. That is why we have the CBDC been introduced by the government. Will bitcoin replace banks now? No, because of its volatility the fiat is still much needed for daily transactions",

Bitcoin can replace banking system when majority of people tend to use it as a currency, but currently it's not.",

They can interact with each other but none of them will kill the another and they will continue to exist together to serve people.Bitcoin has its advantage to serve people with enthusiasm on privacy and freedom. You have keys and you have coins or in other words you have your own bank. You can broadcast your transaction anytime without need to wait for bank system to check AML, KYC to proceed your bank transfer. When your bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it won't be charged back. With bank transfer, charge back, account seize is possible.",

Most of us don’t even realize the world is shifting and can only react to the change, we now have AI for almost everything while we are focused on that marvelous invention, CBDC may just take us by surprise.  Long-awaited Fed digital payment system to launch in July",
