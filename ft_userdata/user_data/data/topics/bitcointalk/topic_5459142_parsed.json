So everyone is advised to be manual as much as possible by checking your last post history to know if your comment has been posted or not.",

So everyone is advised to be manual as much as possible by checking your last post history to know if your comment has been posted or not.Exactly, the forum server has been really slow since yesterday, to the point where I suspected it was a problem with my network. I even tried using a VPN to see if it would make the network faster, but it did not; also, if you write replies, it appears multiple times.This forum server problem is becoming more complicated because it began some months ago when the forum server would go entirely offline for a period of time before returning to operation.  I think something should be done about this whole situation.",
