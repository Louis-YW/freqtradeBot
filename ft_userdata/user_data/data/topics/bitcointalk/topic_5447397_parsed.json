      "body": "Banks fail occasionally, in some periods more than in others, but it doesn't generally make people believe in a world without banks. Banks are so tightly integrated into the economy in many countries that I don't think they'll go away soon. I hope banks will become more regulated, required to actually store the majority of funds of their customers. As for Bitcoin, it is an alternative, but it comes with many inconveniences like being unable to pay for most things directly in it or how a bear market can significantly decrease the value of one's salary or savings. As for centralized crypto services, they can fail pretty much like banks, which we've seen most recently with FTX.",

I wouldn't get too excited about it. If the financial system does go bust, I hope it does so slowly because it is the ordinary, working people who are going to suffer. The banks, especially the people at the top, are going to suffer very little. They may see their net worth reduced by half, but those who are going to lose their jobs, have their houses repossessed, and have many other problems will be the working class.",

Banking is a business and like any other business, it can fail too. However, in many countries, governments usually step in to revive a failing bank by providing them access to liquidity and by providing them provisions to write off bad debts. This is a part of the economy and this is nothing new. I wonder why US government didn't come to rescue SVB. Probably they are saving budget for another war against another oil rich country.

      "body": "Of course. The recent bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank and the pressure on European banks highlight the challenges the traditional banking system faces in today's rapidly changing financial landscape. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have gained popularity due to their decentralized nature and their ability to maintain value without relying on a central authority.I think maybe it's important to know that cryptocurrency is very volatile and comes with its own risks, such as hacking and fraud. In addition, while banks may use people's money to invest in businesses and generate profits, they also provide essential services such as loans, savings accounts and financial advice. In conclusion, it is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of traditional banking systems and cryptocurrencies when making investment decisions.",

Anyone using a bank should by now understand the needs to change to the digital currency with preference on bitcoin because when you consider the whole lot of risks associated to using banks then you will see more need to change the entire system to a digital decentralized technology or currency, if you're having your bitcoin in a centralized exchange then you're unsafe, if you're having your bitcoin on a decentralized exchange then it's yours and you own your asset.",

Bank is one thing that can never fail because they have the backing of Reserve Banks which are whole and sole of printing the money in any nation. The amount of money that moves in the national and international transfers is just unlimited and can not imagine the income from it for any particular bank. In the case of SVB or any bank that failed, there was some spurious activity or a person who led it in the wrong direction and failed at the job. I highly doubt that the comparison given in the OP is valid. You can't compare it with the crypto at all. Two different domain for sure.",

You're the only one I know who doesn't do it. Well, who says he doesn't.It has become a bragging thing, nobody uses banks, nobody uses CEX, and everyone is keeping his coins in cold storage but the moment you change the question everyone has 3-4 accounts on CEXs and do daily wire transfers to cash out profits! I always laugh when I see those kinds of statements and the silence that fallows the question of how they have bought their coins or how they pay for p2p deals.As much as we would like to dream cryptos haven't put any kind of serious dent in banks' profits, more over they have allowed them to earn millions in fees.Quote from: Maxre on April 03, 2023, 01:36:54 PMthat was Disaster for the banks world Disaster? No!

They have turned into something different and are no longer that much of a place where to keep your money safe and more a combination of payment gateway, quick loans cc provider, and every other kind of service with less and less focus on safekeeping. No, with the current model banks can't be made fully one hundred percent safe and they will never be, so either trust them at most with a sum under the FDIC limit or not put a single penny in it if you're that much concerned.",

Also, with some changes in economic policies and alliances, we'll get to see a certain huge change in the near future.That's the reason why if anyone who's longing to invest in bitcoin still don't have it but eager in having it, don't waste any moment now and start buying bitcoin.",

Bankruptcy is never new to us especially in banks where they can’t be revived anymore, and can’t never serve its clients purposefully. But I believe before they end up like that, there are also some measures taken to recover the lapses but maybe in this case, the bank has totally gone out wrong. However, that does not mean that if ever banks are closing, crypto is on high. It’s just that some banks were unable to meet the requirements, and so they end up failing and eventually closed.",

One of the things that makes a bank collapse is government intervention which is increasingly irrational, it will affect the psychology of customers so that many people withdraw their money from the bank.I think there is a good correlation as to why bitcoin has had a positive impact from bank failures. Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto that allows users to maintain good financial privacy. Bitcoin is also not subject to ridiculous government intervention so that on the one hand bitcoin is well regarded as a store of value asset. But I don't think everyone will regard the same thing, especially when they consider price volatility to be the underlying risk.",

Now the governments are making it even harder for the banks to continue, by throwing rocks at them in the form of rate hikes. Then there was that FTX scam that banks were financing which created some strong headwinds for some of the US banks. I feel like it would be great for bitcoin if the financial system underwent a purge, the dollar became much weaker, some more banks collapsed and scared people away from the traditional fiat system. I don't want people to lose their money but this could wake up some of them and start thinking that the money isn't safe with the banks and by holding fiat you're exposing yourself to government manipulation.",

Some companies that are not ready to adapt will encounter difficulties so that starting with many companies going bankrupt, unemployment is also increasing and the economic crisis is also exacerbating the situation plus the issue of a recession. Those are the triggers in the first place. And grow big. so many people withdraw money from the bank. even coupled with the economic crisis caused by the war also made people or small companies more careful in maintaining the value of their assets. so many of them decide to withdraw large amounts of their money from the bank and maybe change their money to assets that can better retain value. and here many banks are increasingly short of their liquidity. and currently people's trust in banks is also decreasing. so that every day the bank must continue to serve the withdrawal of money from their customers. and some banks that do not have sufficient funds in their safes are caused perhaps because the business that runs behind the bank is not running smoothly. so that the Bank does not have sufficient reserve funds. and this is what will be the beginning of an indication of bankruptcy for a bank. and it is true that now more and more banks are showing indications that lead to bankruptcy. even we all might not have thought at first that big banks like Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank would be in a situation like now. and actually there may be more small banks that have also collapsed but are not exposed to the public.and when Many Banks collapsed. so be prepared for the gold price to be a positive trend and I think this will also be a good impact for the bitcoin bull market. but on an overall economic basis then this would also be quite bad. because behind the bankruptcy of a large company it will certainly make more and more people lose their jobs.",

Bitcoin investment may be a viable solution for them because it is transparent, does not involve a third party, and will provide you with more financial freedom, particularly if you do not keep your Bitcoin in an Exchange that can perform the same functions as banks.",
