Because I just went through the CEO and another persons Facebook and Linkdinl officials page, which have been receiving a recent update, and their is nothing about any project that listed their, which is a red flag.  If these Scammers wanted to create something unique, they could have used people who are not popular or even with a different name. But this makes it very easy for a person to identify, if the project team is real or not. We don't know those people who are part of the team, but a quick search on Google shows vital information about them.",

If that was really the case investors would be fighting to get a share of these tokens and everyone in this crypto space would have known about it.It is not uncommon for scam projects to put up famous people/established professionals pictures on their website and run it. We often have to detect these scams by contacting that person on LinkedIn to verify if they actually know about this project.If you open a flag, I am sure a lot of the users here will support it. That is how we can save some newbies from getting scammed apart from a negative trust rating.",

I have supported the same, but I am not on DT, so it wont activate yet.It would be even better if you use the reference topic as this topic rather than the scammer's topic - because the scammer can delete their thread in future but this thread would not be deleted so easily. In such case, you need to start a new flag, if you do, post it here once done.Edit:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=988147@Rikafip Please check the above link.

The project team is not interested in continuing the campaign so we have suspended the campaign for the 4th week. SOURCE  | ARCHIVED2- CIRTUS.TECH BOUNTY:Quote from: repear7 on March 06, 2023, 09:10:37 AMFirst of all I am sorry to you.The reason is that the project manager promised to escrow tokens within the first 15 days. But you sent me a report that the project is not getting any improvement from the campaign.For this he avoids our bounty manager charges and token escrow.And he told me he wouldn't pay any bounty hunters for it.Hired participants are not working properly. SOURCE  | ARCHIVEDIt appears that this bounty manager is not an expert and lacks competence in choosing projects he promotes, and he might even be part of them. Therefore, the flag and feedback serve as warning signs for bounty hunters to refrain from participating in upcoming bounty campaigns this BM manages, avoiding involvement in promoting scam projects and wasting their valuable time.",
