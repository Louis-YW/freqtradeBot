Many gamblers experience this since there's a risk of money involved that gives an excitement to gambling. You can highly experience this if you don't have other things to do in your life besides gambling and sleeping. I once become addicted to gambling by the time I'm newly losing my job. I focus my attention on gambling and dream that I can get a steady source of income by just gambling on a daily basis.With that in my mind, I usually experience some fantasy when sleeping after a session of successful gambling since you will never forget your winning until you lose it all. The sad part is when I hit rock bottom by losing all my savings in a single hour of gambling games just to chase my loss. Until now I can't still forget my winning days and I'm just playing safe when I'm gambling as a lesson learned.",

I've always tried to keep the mentality of getting over it whenever I lose since back then, overthinking \"what if\" scenarios were the norm for me. So while doing that (and gambling sometimes here and there), I eventually got used to doing it in most cases. Ofc I still get those \"what if\" mentalities sometimes, but I quickly get over it after a day (which is honestly a pretty long time so it can become rather painfull still).",

It doesn't mean 100% that you are addicted but it is a clear symptom. Other reasons could be that you've been playing for long hours, or that you're remembering some exciting games, where you've won or lost a good amount of money.

It's not really possible for me to turn off my brain after a few intense hands. My mind keeps focusing on things like making the correct read and if I miss played a hand. For me the best thing instead of trying to sleep is to drink a glass of wine and try to clear my mind. Gambling is very fast and we can't always make the correct decision. It helps a lot to tell myself that I played the best to my abilities and should be proud of my winnings. Losing sleep over gambling is a bad sign and it needs to be addressed. One thing could be to stop gambling a few hours before sleeping to get some distance, or like me limit it to 2 times per week.",

But if you are playing these games that depend on luck then I would say the situation is different and complicated.I have no idea if I ever thought about a bet after I lost, but before I make a bet I think about a strategy and when I fail I think about where I made a mistake, I don't think about the outcome of the game I think about the possible mistake I must have made to correct in the future",

It will because of the addition you have in gambling that makes you restive over it. One of the reasons for being addicted to gambling is not just that you want to play for the fun of it but because of the money that involves in it either you want to win more adding to what you have already won or because you are chasing to win back the money you have lost and that makes you locked in the casino, in fact you remember every trace of the way you played and lost. I have known this with experience lol, not always a good story with addition, you lose more rather than the fun in it.Quote from: Oshosondy on May 23, 2022, 12:45:43 PMI have been gambling since 2014.
