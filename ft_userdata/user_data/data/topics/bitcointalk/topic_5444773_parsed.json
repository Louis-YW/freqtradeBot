Good you've already formed the habit of writing down important information like passwords, as that's the safest way to secure details you would need at a later time using Bitcoin.

Although there is really no difference between you using an old \"brand new\" account and creating a new account, since both accounts will have no single post or activity. But it's still nice you got the old one back. And with that been said, I'll advice that you check out this thread Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQ it contains most of (if not all) the dos and don'ts of the forum. If you really want to enjoy your stay here and avoid having any issue with you account then you probably should take your time to read through that thread.",

Typical newbie post, celebrating everything by posting a new thread. By the way, welcome back OP.Some person might not post anything in forum because they are more interested in reading and learning about Bitcoin. Hence, not having any activity might not be a yardstick to judge a person's commitment to the forum. Everybody were newbies and fascinated by little wins or success. For me I think it is not necessary for the OP to create this thread. But as we can see, this thread is also dishing out some vital advice for not only the OP but to other members. It's is very risky to write your password or other vital information and keep them carelessly. Your password can grant anybody access to your account which can be disastrous. In this forum we promote privacy and security. Your are welcome to the forum and I hope you stay and learn all you need to learn.",

Now that you've found your login information and returned to the forum, I hope you'll take advantage of the time you now have to learn everything you can about the forum and bitcoin. I'm sure that's why you opened the account in the first place, and your joy shows how happy and interested you are to be here. Make the most of your time here before returning to school activities; it will be difficult to combine school knowledge and learnings here.Quote from: _act_ on March 13, 2023, 08:32:33 PMWhat is the difference between your old account and if you just create a new one?

Thank you for revisiting the Bitcoin Forum. But I want one thing to be clear from you here, did you get back the old bitcoin account. Or got your wallet back. Anyway you work with honesty here. You will see that one day you will also get success. If you work hard, you will definitely get the results of hard work. So here you go nice nice high quality post.",

All I can say is that welcome back Op and also were  glad that you've found your old account here in forum.  For me if I am in your case then it's better to create a new account  rather than chasing a brand-new old account which is don't have the difference interms of contributing to the forum  and the only difference is your old account created last year and when you create a new one then that's leteraly a new account.  And I think as I observe you've treasure your account and that's the reason why you decided to find it rather than creating a new one.",

Seems like now you've got more time on your hands. Well, just like the others have advised, it'd do you a world of good to get abreast with the rules of the forum and try making constructive posts so you this doesn't get boring for you or we don't get to hear of another \"glad to have found my account\" situation.

Why it's matter? there's no difference between a new account without any merit or activity and an old account without any merit or activity, after all there's nothing wrong if he want to use his old account. Maybe if he create a new account he will not able to post due to restriction of evil IP address, he can solve it by small amount of Bitcoin, but it's better for him to not spend any money if he have an option.",

Congratulations on that. During the growth of ICO and bitcoin fever, when all the prices of cryptocurrencies were growing at a fast rate, I started so many accounts that I needed a whole excel spreadsheet, because I realized that I couldn't remember all the passwords. Not to mention where I registered, where I invested money, on which exchanges I entered a deposit. I recently looked through all my accounts in projects and found a lot of tokens!",
