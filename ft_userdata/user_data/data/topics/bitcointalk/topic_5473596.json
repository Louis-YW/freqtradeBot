The legislation now needs formal approval from the European Council, a body comprising the 27 member nations' heads of state.\"__Nowadays, most smart contracts have blocking and kill switch functions, and after official adoption, most projects will be no different from centralized exchanges.

As I read:QuoteOrganizations linked to blockchains like Stellar, Polygon, NEAR and Cardano expressed their concerns in an open letter at the time.Some of these blockchains work on the principle of proof of stake, which means that there is a certain number of validators who can reverse the transaction and do whatever they want, and a judicial order can easily be directed to these validators.",

If Ethereum worked on the old algorithm, then companies would have to migrate to new smart contracts if they contradict European legislation.Quote from: hugeblack on November 11, 2023, 04:10:31 PMSome of these blockchains work on the principle of proof of stake, which means that there is a certain number of validators who can reverse the transaction and do whatever they want, and a judicial order can easily be directed to these validators.This is very rough work. If validators interfere with consensus, they will destroy the ecosystem and the price of their assets.Therefore, the regulator acts more delicately, and soon all large projects will have white lists and KYC.",
