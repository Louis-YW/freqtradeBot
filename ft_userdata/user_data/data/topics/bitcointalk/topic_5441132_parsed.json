  "content": "I been dey think say obi get strong supporters but today  wetin  happen shock me. There is this man who claims to be a strong supporter of obi , an igbo man for that matter  who has been shouting obedient disturbing our neighborhood and environs for long now. He has been singing the praise of Obi talking and convincing people to vote for Obi but just today few hours to the general election he goofed. He is the type that talks too much and any how, just this evening I saw him coming with a half bag of rice 25kg to be precise and I asked him he did not say anything, he walked into his compound later on I overheard him telling someone in his compound he saw some people sharing rice in the market and people gathered and was collecting so he went there and he was asked to deposit his PVC to collect the rice he gave them and collected the rice after collecting it he demanded for his PVC and they told him he has already collected the rice and they would not give him back the PVC just few hours to presidential election. What a pity he sold his PVC already that means his voters card and votes throughout this election is gone and these are the people shouting obedient! Obedient!!What a pity.",

The fact remains that \"Peter Obi\" has the much crowd, and as such both APC and PDP are willing to do anything just the cut short Obi's vote comes tomorrow's election.So right now, it's left for you and me to refuse to sell our vote just like your neighbor did and vote for Peter Obi come tomorrow.",

      "body": "So this is the trick they want to use to rig the election. Nice one. I’m have always maintained my position that the new naira design did not and cannot stop electoral fraud. So far it has enabled it because people are hungry and do not have access to their money in the banks. There cannot be rigging without the involvement of the people. It’s a shame that when it comes down to doing the right thing, we find ourselves still falling for the same old trick. I saw a video going viral in the early hours of the day, a house of rep member was caught with $500k cash in his custody and he confessed the money was meant for electoral fraud. It pains me to see all this happening at a time Nigerians have decided to trust the system and cast their vote even Nigerians in diaspora came back home just to vote. What’s your excuse not to have? I have my pvc and I’m not afraid to vote. https://punchng.com/breaking-polls-rivers-rep-member-arrested-with-foreign-currency/?amp",

He sold his vote that can change his present situation to a better one just to satisfy one or two days hungry,it is sad to know that some peraonst only think of today and don't think about tomorrow. Down here in my hood,politicians bought over the INEC officials and they couldn't carry out their duties. Only God will help us in this country.

Just take for instance I traveled home for my grandma burial and then few people approached me asking me assistance with at least little that I can help. As I tried shared new 500 note to 6 persons, omo see as them rush me and even those who manages to collect the just 5h was appreciating me like as if I given them millions. Oya compared someone they offered 25k of rice worth about $50 with the hungry at hand. Don't blame them very soon people will bring their children for exchange of food because of the hardship in the country.",

People are really going through lots, if they see any opportunities they do not mind compromising so as to sort things themselves. Most people do not really have that control over themselves and can not resist situation in which they find themselves in. In this case, I would not really blame him to have taken such decision OP because I believe there are things going on which must have prompted him to act that way. That aside, looking at the current situation now it seems the vote counting has gone wrong as there are many complaints coming in from different polling units in respect to the results so looking at all these things put together how would one be encouraged to vote? You vote and your vote does not count how do you explain that. I would not blame him for the decision he took though maybe he has foreseen what might likely happen so instead of him wasting his time  he just decided to do the needful at the earliest stage.",

You see ehn even normal human being or make I use business man for that matter wey go market go buy goods to sell after you buy them transport them to your office, you no go gather your expenses put for the price wey go make am a bit increase in price? Na so the political business be so after the politicians Dem win, Dem go begin to gather back their investment that is the money wey Dem spend for the campaign, electioneering, vote buying and to settle their boys wey work for them etc so that them no go loose. So tell me how Dem want to take concentrate then do their work? The other wey round country man wey dey reason to collect him share of the cake wey the politicians them dey give because once them enter office, them don forget them coupled with this rigging wey person vote no dey count at all so why you think say them no go  collect wetin Dem see then go their way go hustle after all them fo say them no loose.These keeps repeating every election period and it seems now that it has become the culture of Nigeria politics.",
