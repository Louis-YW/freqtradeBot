  "content": "This trilogy Juan Francisco Estrada Romero vs Román Alberto González Luna was planned on March 5, 2022 before, but it's got cancelled due to Covid-19 and Julio Cesar Martinez replacing Estrada position. Now the trilogy of Estrada vs Chocolatito has been planned on December 3, 2022 and it seems high likely would be happen considering Covid-19 case are keep dropping and the rules are not stricter than before.The first fight Estrada vs Chocolatito, Chocolatito won via Unanimous Decision. The second fight were controversial since many people saw Chocolatito clearly won, but two judges score favor on Estrada, especially there's one judge score 117-111 while their fight are really close.This trilogy will prove which one is the best here, looking from the odds Chocolatito is the favorite with 1.50x odds while Estrada is the underdog with 2.48x odds.",

And he is targeting Chocolatito already, but let's see first this great fight and maybe Donaire wil l be just waiting at the side.",

Chocolatito is the harder puncher for me and as the rounds go further, we will see him out punch Estrada in terms of volume, so this will end on the card and Chocolatito with majority or split decision win.",

      "body": "It looks like another rivalry has to end this year.  It is quite interesting how Chocolatito will adjust after the controversial decision that makes him lose his WBA (Super) super flyweight title.  I think his camp is planning to let the judge handles the decision and would go for the knockout if possible.Quote from: Jawhead999 on October 03, 2022, 02:19:37 PMThe second fight were controversial since many people saw Chocolatito clearly won, but two judges score favor on Estrada, especially there's one judge score 117-111 while their fight are really close.There is a possibility that the decision is to set up a trilogy since I believe the 2nd match is quite close (possibly can go either way) and decided to give the fight to Estrada and somehow make it a bit controversial to open a path for a trilogy.  With a controversial decision, it will be easy marketing for the boxing promoters.",

Others say that Roman is also past his prime because of his age, I disagree though, for me Estrada is the more damage one even if he is the younger between them.",

For Estrada, he will have to do a better and more convincing job if he is going to win Chocolatito who is a more experienced fighter with higher KO's because the judges may not be able to favor him this time. Chocolatito will be many people's bet to win but the underdog in any fight can be highly underestimated which can be an advantage for them. Estrada may most likely win this time again, maybe clearly without doubts.",

But it seems he had met his match against a tough Mexican in Estrada. Of course, we will support trilogies as boxing fans, recently we just saw the Canelo vs GGG fight although it seems that GGG is already past his prime as he was dominated by Canelo. But this fight is still 50/50 in my opinion, although Chocolatito seems to the betting favorite, but not going to be easy match for him.",

Or it doesn't make sense out of it, they should be back to 0 and train as hard as they can?In any case, Donaire could be their biggest threat and I agree that maybe Estrada will be a good test for him before going against the veteran as well in Chocolatito. But we will wait then, they will face each other first and Donaire just chillin and waiting for the winner.",

Estrada is a very aggressive fighter, with a great timing, I think Chocolatito could finish him. Lots of good fights this coming December, hopefully I'm wrong with my prediction so somehow could I could enjoy this fight.",
