EVM as in Ethereum Virtual Machine? So he's trying to make an Ethereum hardware wallet. Then the topic would belong in the Altcoin section. 'Development & Technical Discussion' would be wrong either way; as we have a dedicated Hardware Wallet section inside of this board.I would advise @ToujoursAuTopLeKhey to move their topic to the best suited board to get the best answers.",

It's a new program with fewer applications and users. Now, OP can start by creating a wallet with other features for people to interact via sending and receiving messages through the XMTP server. It works fine with EVM, Smart contract wallets. His wallet users will not only transact funds, they, too, can send messages. XMTP has a simple procedure, The wallet user only needs to request a signature from XMTP that signifies he/she is from a specific blockchain app attached to XMTP, for instance, OPs wallet. Though, like I said; they're new, we are to expect some loopholes on the web3 based project, and their problem is that the encrypted keys generated for users are stored on-chain. So if a malicious App, which I hope OPs wallet is not, gets attached to XMTP, they can access their users keys on the XMTP servers by providing the exact signature to XMTP, which will grant them access. Their programming team, currently, is working on such a problem, and a password-hashing app like Argon2id can solve this dispute for them.   Therefore OP can achieve such a goal if he's working on a commercial wallet business, he has got metamask, coinbase wallet, Rainbow wallet as competitors, yet the competition is not much compared to the general wallet market. https://xmtp.org/docs/dev-concepts/signatureshttps://github.com/xmtp/xmtp/discussions/16",

      "body": "Quote from: ToujoursAuTopLeKhey on November 23, 2022, 04:36:35 PMAnd i want to make a project of building an hardware wallet (something like Ledger )The thing is that the linked DYI wallets don't have secure element chip. Ledger does. I think that this makes implementing \"something like Ledger\" could be a significantly more difficult task.However, Passport also uses secure element. So my take is you can try to learn from all of those and make your own.I am not that knowledgeable on the internals of HW, but maybe even Satochip DYI card and the related Git can be of help: https://satochip.io/product/satochip-diy-and-developer-card/ (although it worth mentioning that the advanced users tend to avoid the HWs that don't have their own screen)",
