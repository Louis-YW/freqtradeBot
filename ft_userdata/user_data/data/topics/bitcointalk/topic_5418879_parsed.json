      "body": "I think a healthy mixture of both indoor & outdoor activities are good for you. You can take part in both with family & friends, depending on what time of year it is & what the weather is like etc. it’s important for mind & body to do at least some form of outdoor activity semi regularly. You can watch movies & stuff like that with family indoors too so there is a healthy balance.",

      "body": "I enjoy spending my time doing outdoor activities because it makes me feel young and remember when I would go camping with my grandfather. I also enjoy going on walks to feel the fresh air and being able to set up my BBQ grill to cook hot dogs and hamburgers. By the time I am done eating, I like to catch up on a few chapters by reading my favorite book called, “ A Travel Guide To Heaven” by Anthony Destefano. It’s a really good book that I recommend to anyone that believes in Heaven and the afterlife. Another type of outdoor activity that I enjoy is running. I literally can work up a good sweat that has me jumping into a lake just to cool off and feel relaxed when I come out of the water. By the time I dry myself up, I'll sit down to appreciate the sunset while watching a good movie on Netflix with my phone.",

Another outdoor activity activity I so much like is going to new and exciting places and making beautiful videos and snapping memorable pictures.  But I wouldn't be writing off indoor activities because playing video games like COD and PES is one indoor activity that I do almost everyday with my friends.",

Plus, there's something special about being surrounded by nature and all its beauty.On the other hand, I think indoor activities can offer a sense of comfort and security. Sometimes, it's nice to have a quiet, private space where you can be alone and do your own thing without being bothered by others. And with so many options for indoor entertainment these days, there's really no shortage of things to do.",
