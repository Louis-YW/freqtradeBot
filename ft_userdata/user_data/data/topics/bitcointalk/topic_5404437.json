  "content": "I'm looking to write articles and content in exchange for bitcoin. Please review a 200-word example of my work below.there's a little over 200 words but this should be enough to sample my ability to write, please let me know if you are interested in my services, I deliver completed work first and then you review and deliver payment to my bitcoin address. Updated Bitcoin casino sample article.Over the last 5 or 6 years, I've played at Bitstarz on an on-and-off basis when finances have allowed. I still remember my first time learning of them, bitcoin was still only worth around $475 a bitcoin at that time and I used a 20 free spins no deposit bonus with them my first time playing, at the time those 20 free spins were allotted to your choice of a slot game called Fruit Zen or Boomanji. I played both usually 10 of my free spins on each and ended up falling in love with these two games over time, Fruit Zen has a bonus that gives you a solid column of wilds on a single free spin that continues and expands if you're lucky enough to get another bonus symbol during the first free spin, it features fruits and relaxing music as its gameplay aesthetic. Boomanji is almost identical except it incorporates various depictions of fireworks and firework audio as its own theme. the bonus symbol is just a very satisfying-looking crate of all of the previously mentioned firework depictions. I've had highs and lows with Bitstarz at one point winning a massive 4.9 BTC( at the time fairly small value however I had only deposited around 20 MBtc to get it) one thing is for certain though, I've never seen another online casino beat the time to process a cash out with the average time being less the 8 minutes before the withdrawal becomes initiated on the blockchain.",

These are the kind of articles that are mostly going to be needed by article sites. Probably with SEO in mind as well, the competition in the space is already restless.You may really have a good chance. Did you know that writers are paid way higher than you ask even on Fiverr? Having BTC however is finer.",

I must say that I believe you are a little out of line here, also can you please define spam? last I checked when you spam anything whether it is a message or a link the very definition indicates that you are over-posting it to multiple places.If your purpose is to knit pick other's posts then from what I can tell you shouldn't be allowed to post at all.I'm not very patient when it comes to toxicity even when done in a sly manner, for your own sake please move along.I'd advise you not go out of your way to cause trouble with others in the future.

Do not see this as criticism but just a way to learn how you can prove if truly you can write article, but I am still doubting that. If you want to be writing article, you need to have a fascinating opening post that will contain your profession, the type of article you are skilled at writing, the amount you want to be charging, the amount you want to charge may not first necessary. Lastly, if you have some articles you have written before, you can indicate in the OP that you can provide them some articles work you have written before for them to chec how good you are.But keep being rude instead of thinking about how to make things better.Good luck.",

That shows me you have no idea how to figure out who someone actually is. Also why wouldn't I have gotten annoyed with someone immediately jumping on to a topic with no motivation other then to immediately knit pick? Sorry but believing it's okay to look down on others doesn't mean you won't see push back when you set in on doing it with someone who has had ENOUGH with judgemental people. I really just don't have the patience to deal with someone who assumes the people they are talking to are beneath them, I'm an adult and I've had to fight from the minute I get out of bed until I get back in bed for literally everything and that's only when we're talking about things I need and want, I fight myself everyday so I can make damn sure I'm doing right by others even if it's not what's being done to me so when I get online and I'm making a post and you start acting like I'm an idiot for how I originally wrote my post and act as if I'm in the wrong for taking advice from the first person to give me feedback and actually hearing what they were saying... Yeah I'm gonna snap at you because I go above and beyond to do right for others and it's nothing but a slap to the face to see someone strutting in and being an ass for no fucking reason.",
