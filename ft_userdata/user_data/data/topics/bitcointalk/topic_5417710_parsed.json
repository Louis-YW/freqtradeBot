Below is the summary of the findings:34% of Americans are delaying major purchases like a home or a car29% are paying down debts28% are planning to reduce holiday spending24% are allocating more income to savings24% are staying in a job they do not enjoyIf ever a recession hits, there is likely to be a downsizing-i.e., a lot of workers are most likely to lose their jobs. Experts have suggested that emergency savings would act as a financial cushion. Here are their recommendations below:Dual-income families should save at least 3 months’ worthSingle earners should put aside 6 months or moreEntrepreneurs should set aside 1 year of expensesIn addition, from a personal standpoint, investing in a cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin, acts as a buffer against the harsh realities of a recession.Please share your personal experiences on how people in your country are preparing for or dealing with a recession.",

This is why everyone shouldn't spend too much money for unnecessary thing like holiday, major purchases, branded clothes etc. If they're learn a good money management before potential recession happen, they will have idle funds to invest in Bitcoin when the price will cheaper than before.Quote from: Davidvictorson on October 20, 2022, 01:46:22 AMDual-income families should save at least 3 months’ worthSingle earners should put aside 6 months or moreEntrepreneurs should set aside 1 year of expensesIn short have a lot money, have a lot job especially passive income.",

Many occupations get affected, maybe doctors is one that isn’t affected but many jobs are not recession proof.So people are holding back and preparing which is smart. Very crazy how back in 2000 and 2008, everybody was caught by surprise but now everybody is preparing for the recession. The way it’s looking it seems there might not even be a recession.",

It's better to face a recession having prepared for it in some way than to spend like there's no tomorrow, go into massive debt, without even being aware that a recession might come, and then run into it and end up being foreclosed on.

Of course, we had already been warned, and if you followed the economy a little, you could see that at some point in the near future we were going to have another crisis, regardless of the war that is happening, because the solutions to the 2007 and 2020 crises were a flight forward by the central banks by flooding the markets with liquidity.",

Whether this survey was conducted throughout America or just part of America and little population does not matter. What matters is, every bit of the answers above are true. In fact in my locality we have already started to get feel for recession. At least 3 in my family circle are facing employee lay off in their IT company. Daily expenses such as buying grocery/veggies are doubled or tripled in their base prices and common man could already feel that. If I turn on any news channel then farmers are crying for their lives because:1. Their crops have been hit by unwanted rain and floods. 2. There leftover crops are so costly that people are switching to cheap junk food and thus farmer is not even able to recover farming expenses, how they can survive the families?3. Most of the labour workforce has been reduced by large companies to cut down expenses. I can see their groups over news everyday asking and literally begging for the Governments Help!!4. As the time is passing things will escalate to whole new dimension of cost per household - too costly to survive. These are the time to follow the rules in OP. Sadly not everyone gets to enjoy them since many of them are under common man line and loosing hopes from all side. Tough times ahead, just hold on and save as much as we could.",

Given the inflation that has realistically increased the price of many basic products by at least 20% (and much more), how will someone manage to save anything when there is not enough even for basic living expenses?Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on October 20, 2022, 07:04:08 AMMeanwhile 42% of US citizens have less than 1000$ in their savings account. 58% have less than 5000$. -https://www.zippia.com/advice/american-savings-statistics/They might be delaying big purchases and reducing debts but there are nowhere near being ready for potential recession.If the data is correct, then it looks very bad for the average US resident, even though we all know that people keep some extra money under the mattress or in a bank deposit box. Besides, the US government has been very generous with those checks in the recent past, and although I'm not aware of any similar measures, that doesn't mean there won't be any again.Quote from: Gyfts on October 20, 2022, 09:53:54 AMNot exactly.

Institutional traders won't be putting their money in assets that are volatile during a recession.At the moment, the cryptocurrency market seems quite static, but we have seen this in the past in a certain period after each halving. Although inflation and the recession that follows have an impact on more or less all markets, if we look at the price of Bitcoin, we can say that it resists the current challenges very well. What many have already learned is that there is a time when you should expect profit (in the short term) when it comes to Bitcoin, so they adapt their strategy accordingly. Few have the courage and money to invest in the long term, which means that they will wait for the time as close as possible to the halving or even after that.",

People aren't likely aren't new to seeing quotes imo and it'll have put people off getting those assets (especially since cars lose their value quickly).I've always seen the 3-6 months of emergency funds being a recommendation in the past although it's a bit late to say it now if people can't save up that money quickly (the 3 months is possibly achievable before a recession hits - though with rising inflation that's probably unlikely). Its probably best for entrepreneurs to take on other employment too if they can't afford their business expenses from their income and have some time to take on something else. Also depending on the figures being used, the US might already be in a recession.",

Whether it's reducing unnecessary purchases or adjusting the investment portion not to exceed 20% cash funds. Indeed, many experts have been doing this for a long time and those who are rich should be aware that there is a recession or not the fact that they have to fulfill their basic needs to survive. I think that anticipation is important and indeed needs to be considered from now on. A recession will trigger an increase in the price of goods and services to become more expensive.",
