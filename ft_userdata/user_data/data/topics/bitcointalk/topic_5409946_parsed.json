I was mining this coin on Rx 474 and my video cards overheated, but they worked well on other algorithms.to do raven mining with polaris graphics cards, try my mod. after editing the bios of the card and writing exactly the numbers I have entered, then select the ocC settings. with this mod, the consumption will drop to 50 watts per card in the kawpow algorithm, and the temperature of the card will be close to 60-65 degrees. the hashrate will be a little above 13Mhs. I have also made an operating system for the polaris cards, but I am preparing a new version with multialgo on zergpool and I will upload it later.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZMJ7LENK5QTchnTLKzmKruas1PqLPvld?usp=sharing",
