  "content": "Looking back at how I started on this forum, after registration I left the account for some months with the fear of what to post and what not to post, before I made a move and dropped my first question, which lots of DT members and others helped me clear my fear of, and since then I have been learning day after day in this forum without feeling reluctant about how to post, new technologies, the blockchain in general, and all that.Without much expectation, I was able to see my member rank, which I sometimes believe is difficult to achieve, but I achieved it by just being myself, just as I was advised to be.My first Signature My application was on my Junior Member rank, which I was accepted for, and the pay was supposed to be the project token, but due to not meeting the required post count and other circumstances, I missed the entire two weeks.¬†My 2nd and my first Signature pay is  SellDefi  managed by @Royse777 which the campaign lasted for about 2 weeks, which I fully participated in, after my first week payment, which did not arrive on time but later did after I created a thread regarding a bitcoin deposit that had not arrived, and I learned a lot from the thread too.¬†I am a Bitcoin holder, which I bought on different occasions and for different purposes, and which I am also holding in different wallets.¬†¬†This is my first Bitcoin payment that I have received since learning about crypto. I have received other forms of crypto payment though. I'm just happy about this, and to me, it's worth celebrating.To some degree, I am still a newbie and my learning process is advancing to other levels, especially in the aspect of post quality improvement. @Royse777 never complained about it üòè, but within myself, I know I need to work a little more on these.",
