Any information on who collects taxes (and how) for US residents on crypto is much appreciated.I know that in the USA there are licensed accountants who, under the contract, will make you tax returns. It is better to start with the help of professionals and study the articles of laws on your own in order to understand the numbers in the reports. A licensed accountant is liable for errors in tax reporting. Subsequent declarations can already be submitted independently if the services of an accountant are expensive for you.",

In which they taught how to pay taxes and on which thing (token, NFTs and security) you have to pay how much taxes. And how you have to register with IRS to pay taxes. Because tracking transactions and making them paying taxes is also a difficult task for the authorities. Let me share that article with you here:How to track and report crypto transactions for tax purposesAt that time, i just gave it a mere glance because i knew this article is of no use to me as i am not a US citizen and in my region i have to pay no Taxes as our government has not implied any.",

The broker keeps the money and pays this money to the tax from each profitable transaction at a rate of 13-15%. But this is only for exchanges, although derivatives or crypto funds may appear there. The trader does not need to worry about this.In the US, there is a capital gains tax, so you will have to fill out a declaration yourself or hire an accountant. But there are services on large crypto exchanges that help you fill out the declaration automatically. But these exchanges are not tax agents.",

And answer to your first query is also no, as exchanges cannot directly collect taxes on behalf of governments.

The point is, not everywhere we have the opportunity to ask from lawyers so to get a universal idea of how things should work. Then these articles came handy.",
