      "body": "I've written this before, but I don't have now the patience to look it up, however, there are plenty of tutorials for this:If you want faster initial sync, it's not only the dbcache, CPU, internat speed that are of help. You can make use of your SSD too.Yes, since it's a small SSD you can't store the blockchain there, but you can store the chainstate there (7.6 GB now) and if you use indexes then those too (indexes = 43.5 GB, but you probably don't want txindex).I've used symlinks for the job, but maybe there are other options too. And yes, after initial sync has ended I've moved the data from SSD to HDD onto the correct locations.",

Just gotta download this and it won't work this by this speed.Don't worry too much about that displayed 0.03% per hour rate, it tends to underestimate a lot.For reference, when I'm catching up my node to the tip with about 7 days worth of blocks to download, it'll show me that it would take 2 days to sync at a rate that's close to yours,but in reality, it always only takes less than an hour to finish.But aside from that, your setup is really getting a bottleneck with that external hard drive as others have mentioned.Follow their suggestion if you want faster sync speed.You may also want to check if you're connected to enough peers to download the blockchain from since in some cases, nodes cannot connect to others.",

Considering the size of chainstate, I'd say 8192 MB dbcache is better, but OP doesn't have enough RAM for that.Quote from: nc50lc on November 05, 2023, 07:25:56 AMDon't worry too much about that displayed 0.03% per hour rate, it tends to underestimate a lot.My experience is the opposite when I start from scratch: the rate is quite uptimistic for the first hours, but becomes slower Â once it reaches more recent years of data.@OP: syncing Bitcoin Core is more than just downloading the blockchain. It includes verifying every Bitcoin transaction ever made, which is very demanding for your hardware. An external drive is far from ideal, and it's risky. If you ever accidentally unplug it, you risk corrupting your data.My advice: decide what you need first. You've also opened a topic about Electrum, which works great on your hardware. Or prune the blockchain if you don't have a specific reason to keep all data, so it fits on your internal SSD.",

The exact same spec hardware with a Samsung is not having the same slowdown.However....the Samsung was probably 50% more expensive so there is that....-Dave",

Just gotta download this and it won't work this by this speed.Best regardsHi mate.The fastest way since you have an SSD in your machine is to copy the Chainstate directory and the Indexes directory to your SSD and create a symlink to look at those directories.Here is a video with instructions. I saw a huge difference when I followed those steps:https://youtu.be/q3zY9BbyfEU?si=DaRyT0cXRD7QbPzcKeep in mind to copy the directories back to the original location when you are done with IBD. Also remove the symlinks.If you need further assistance, let me know.",
