But how to stop this war, I see no sign that either side is willing to negotiate to end this futile battle. Tensions escalate as Nato is trying to cut off Russia's oil revenue so that Russia can no longer fund the war, but that doesn't seem to affect Russia, Ukraine won't have any deal because they are fighting to protect their country, their citizens.Inflation will continue to rise and the Fed is poised to raise interest rates higher.",

There is logic to the argument, but to begin with, NATO countries are not in direct conflict with Russia, they are providing arms to Ukraine, and that in their total budgets is not a very large amount. So I don't see the correlation between rate hikes/liquidity withdrawal and the war having to end.",

We have the right to defend our land, we have the right to live, we have the right to choose how we live and with whom to build relationships, and we have the right to destroy terrorists and their accomplices. This war will end with the victory of the people of Ukraine and its friends! Our grandfathers destroyed fascism, we will destroy rashiZm!About Venezuela, Cuba and other countries - a very good joke!    Venezuela, in agreement with the United States, sends its oil to Europe to replace the oil of terrorists.Cuba has chosen a pro-Western vector of development - the ideology of the poor and lawlessness, which the USSR and then Russia imposed on them, has ended - now the population of Cuba will receive all the opportunities of the developed world and will be able to live like people! I am sure you have not been there, but only heard propaganda programs, I recommend that you go and see this \"socialist paradise\". Eastern countries - they themselves buy weapons from NATO countries and enjoy their support. In a word - do not fill your mentality with propaganda crap",

Its a country so far, no Taiwanese probably ever visits there. If they are concern about chips, its not like the Chinese will not sell every products they have to anyone. They sell whatever they have to make money. But its good that US and China's defends minister are in talks in the Asia's premier security summit.

But this was 100% acceptable in the Middle Ages, when the kingdom went against the kingdom, and the one who was better armed, who had more supplies, who was more cunning, won. And having money was almost the key. Ukraine can hardly be called the richest country in the world  Although not the poorest, so that the Kremlin propaganda does not lie from the TV screens. In this case, the picture is slightly different - the aggressor is Russia, and it turned out to be a stupid and primitive aggressor. Why ? Because they lied to themselves that their army is \"the second most powerful in the world\", \"in Ukraine, most of the population loves Russia\", \"Ukraine will not last 3 weeks.\" For 5 months already, the “second army in the world” has been suffering huge losses, losing all its potential, and very much dependent on money, which it has every day, or even an hour, less and less. And Ukraine, which does not have the world's largest hydrocarbon reserves, is conducting effective defensive, and already offensive military operations, due to the support and assistance of adequate countries. The modern world is not the \"isolated kingdoms\" of the Middle Ages! Although some are just trying to isolate themselves from the whole world, these are countries such as North Korea, Russia ....",
