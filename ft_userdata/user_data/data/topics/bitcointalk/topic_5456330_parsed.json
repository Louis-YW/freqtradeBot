I'm thinking about closing my key positions for the time being.It will affect their confidence very badly because many of the traders will give up on crypto-currencies when the exchange like Binance is close down. But, I don't think that Binance is going to shut down anytime soon because the CEO of Binance CZ is quite capable to handle big problems and the current issue with Sec is also almost fixed. There were some chances that the exchange will take exit from United States, but now the things are in favor of Binance and Sec have made the agreement to work together and the Binance won't be freezing the assets.Let's suppose if Binance was to shut down then in that case many investors of the crypto-market would lose their confidence of all crypto-currencies and its markets. Thousands of investors would give up on it for rest of their life and they would also promote some negative news about the market by calling it \"Ponzi scheme,\" and etc. Social influencers do everything to earn bread and butter, and they would promote fake news regarding Bitcoin and crypto-market. However, the prominent Bitcoin enthusiasts would still favor Bitcoin and crypto market even if Binance takes an exit the won't be disappointed form Bitcoin and its features.",

Please share tips.I'm thinking about closing my key positions for the time being.Investment or trading funds? You can use your noncustodial wallet for your investment. If the amount as grown big, buy hardware wallet like passport or Trezor for it if you can not use airgapped wallet for it. As for trading, I will say you should not still panic. Know that binance.com is not affected.According to what I am reading on news, Binance.us may not be affected, or at least for now, until tomorrow June 15. But if you are from US, close your positions and move your fund out of Binance.us until the judgment is declared. The judgement may favour or unfavour Binance. If Binance asset is frozen, that would likely be the end of Binance.us.",

Yes I know that Binance is one of the popular exchanges, but it doesn’t mean that, if it shuts downs, then the Bitcoins will collapse. Your investment is safe, as far as you have stored the coins in a hardware wallet. Yes there might be a price drop due to this Binance and Coinbase lawsuits, but after few months, everything will be back to normal. So just don’t panic and I will suggest you to hold your coins also for long time.",

Please share tips.The only reasonable thing to do in order to protect your funds is to make sure it does not stay in the exchange, it is not so hard to know that. Even if Binance wasn't going through all these troubles, it is still unsafe to store your funds in their wallet that they control, they can lock it without your permission or lose it in one of their trades or investments, because they function through a fractional reserve system. As for investors confidence, i don't feel too many people should be shocked if another exchange bites the dust after all the recent events of the last months with centralized exchanges and services.",

Binance.us has only 35 mln daily volume what is a f.king joke compared to binance.com with $5B daily volume on spot and $25B on futures. So the recent FUD relates only to 1% of binance volume. The bigger problem for crypto market is SEC calling altcoins a securities ... but it only affect altcoins (mostly POS after ICO) as bitcoin (POW without ICO) is already clasified as commodity. So all this fud is bullish for bitocoin.",

Please share tips.I'm thinking about closing my key positions for the time being.It's certain that the closure of crypto exchanges will largely affect the price of Bitcoin and other crypto coins in general, especially those exchange coins, whose value might be reduced to zero. But those will just be a temporary movement in price; real investors and Bitcoiners won't have to worry about those price differences.If you are not certain of what will become of the market when you suspect any large crypto exchange is about to be shut down, the best thing for you to do is to convert all your holdings into stable coins so you do not have high blood pressure over how the market might turn your holdings into. Then,  after the market price has dropped to a level where you think it will not go down again, you can try buying back your holdings. But in such a process, there is the possibility of you not getting equal to what you were holding before or getting more.",

Please share tips.I'm thinking about closing my key positions for the time being.You can safeguide your hodling by taking off your coin from Exchange to a non custodial wallet. having it in a non-custodial wallet is better even if the fall of an exchange becomes a serious effects on the price of the market, it is better of when you have your coin to yourself in a wallet you alone and nobody else have access to the seed phrase and by holding it it will definitely hit to a good value. If banance is to be no more today and your Bitcoin is in the right wallet no matter how the price is being affected it does not mean you have automatically lost your Bitcoin, but you can still get it back by hodling.I don't trust any exchange because anything can happen to an exchange at any time but I think the matter on ground concerning binance exchange it is something that's can be solved by Binance.  Binance will not be easily shut down, they will look for every means to resolve their presents challenge",

Please share tips.I'm thinking about closing my key positions for the time being.According to \"coinmarketcap\" Binance is rated to be the number one best crypto exchange in the whole world, with over 385 coins and an 24hrs trading volume of over $5billion, of which I think any attack or effect on it, will literally affect the morale of all crypto users across the globe and likewise affects the price of Bitcoin and all other coins. But due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, it's paramount that it's value will always fall back on track, which is why it's always good to safeguard your funds in a non custodian wallet such as Trezor or Electrum for mobile users, because with the look of things, Bitcoin is currently at $25k and there is a high probability it's price is likely to fall to $20k before it bounces back.",

But in order to increase the chance of not loosing your hard earned bitcoins, you can follow the below steps. 1. Use cold storage to store your coins. There are multiple options available in the market. 2. If the above is not possible, use wallets with 2FA authentication. Which means any transaction will require a separate authentication before moving out of the wallet. 3. Avoid keeping your bitcoin in any exchangesThis will increase your chance of not getting hacked.",

The first risk is obvious: centralized platforms can mismanage funds, be hacked, have their assets frozen, etc. Solution: use a non-custodial wallet. As a bonus, if your money isn't on an exchange, you're less inclined to engage in panic-selling because it's now much more effort to sell your BTC than when it's already on Binance or something. The second risk is, IMO, safeguarding access to your wallet, while also ensuring you don't lock yourself out of it.
