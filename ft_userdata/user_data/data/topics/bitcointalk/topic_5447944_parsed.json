Why don't you try to ask if a good computer to mine crypto includes bitcoin, for me crypto mining is only effective and meaningful when it gives a profit for the investment in equipment and machinery. So each time is different we cannot say which new thing is worth mining.And maybe you should put this in Mining",

But mine only if you don't care about your graphics card or your processor. But as price of electricity has risen with everything else, you might be better of just buying the coins and to mine only if you want to support the chain. I wouldn't mine random coins just because they would be slightly profitable.Short answer is: google is your friend: https://whattomine.com",

So I will like to know which altcoin is better to mine with pc? After Ethereum change to PoS from PoW, There’s already lack of interest on mining using computer since most of the available PoW tokens that can be mined using GPU are unprofitable or haven’t promise any price growth in the future unlike Ethereum.I think ETC and RVN became the target of the old Ethereum miner. This might be the best possible option for computer mining instead of gambling on new token that doesn’t have any guarantee if it will still alive for a couple of years.",

I have known since 2016 when I joined this space that it is waste of time to try to mine BTC on your own PC, it was not even profitable to mine Ethereum on your own PC then unless you have your own mining rig. So 7 years later why do you think it is going to be profitable after the hash rate has gone up significantly? The death of good POW coins has not helped a lot of miners before projects used to go for POW but now most of these new coins are POS, there are still some coins you can mine and with time if they pump you have your good reward",

If you are not build mining rig and just trying a mining with original CPU/GPU it's not gonna profitable and only wasting your time. Not gonna to get profit, just at least make your hardware getting worse.Due they getting extra work.",

It's already a given fact that you can't no longer mine bitcoin from your pc long time ago.You can check this website to see which altcoin is profitable, and which is good to be mine:https://whattomine.com/",

      "body": "Indeed, Bitcoin mining on PC is currently not an efficient way to make money. However, there are many altcoins that can be mined on a PC using the CPU or GPU. The choice of cryptocurrency depends on many factors, such as your PC hashrate, mining difficulty, coin value, transaction fees, etc.Some of the more popular altcoins for PC mining currently include:1.Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency that uses a mining algorithm that allows it to be mined on the CPU. It is one of the most popular altcoins for PC mining due to its high privacy and anonymity.2.Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin. Ethereum mining requires a GPU and its mining algorithm is called Ethash. However, the difficulty of mining Ethereum is high and it is necessary to have a powerful computer to mine profitably.3.Ravencoin (RVN) is a cryptocurrency that uses the X16Rv2 mining algorithm, which allows it to be mined on the GPU. Ravencoin has a low mining difficulty which makes it attractive to miners.4.Grin (GRIN) is a cryptocurrency that uses a mining algorithm known as Cuckoo Cycle that can be mined on the GPU. Grin was created with the goal of providing maximum privacy and anonymity.5.Zcash (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency that uses the Equihash mining algorithm, which can be mined on the GPU. Zcash was created with the goal of keeping transactions private, and this makes it attractive to miners.",
