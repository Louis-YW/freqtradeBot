And what are the differences between extended keys and mnemonic seed?I brought it up since I don't understand these. Thank you It helps to speed up the work, you could generate 1000 private keys with a master key or seed, doesn't matter if you lose 500 of those keys, you could just use your seed to generate them again.For example online wallets, exchanges use such wallets, if they give you a private key, it means they can regenerate that key by using a seed or a master key.You could use a seed/mnemonic seed as your master seed, some wallets use the seed as an entropy source and the wallet can be encrypted with a password, some wallets allow you to carry only the seed instead of 1000 private keys, you could enter the seed into the same version of that wallet on another computer and regenerate all your keys.I'm also confused because there are too many different wallets and each operate by their own standard.",

Before HD wallet exist, user have to backup their wallet file periodically since private key is generated randomly rather than on deterministic manner.Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on April 07, 2023, 10:42:32 AM2 Is it a more stronger wallet than the one we all typically use?What exactly do you mean by stronger? Security wise, HD wallet which use non-hardened key has security concern where your Bitcoin (in that wallet) is compromised if the attacker manage to again your master public key and single child private key.Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on April 07, 2023, 10:42:32 AM3 how does these HD wallets works.If you're looking for detailed technical answer, check BIP 32 at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki.Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on April 07, 2023, 10:42:32 AMAnd what are the differences between extended keys and mnemonic seed?In short,1. mnemonic seed is used to generate HD wallet.2. extended keys (along with other information) is used to generate child keys.",

What other wallets are you referring to? What is the wallet we all typically use? Perhaps you don't understand what a HD wallet is because nearly all wallets are HD wallets now.",
