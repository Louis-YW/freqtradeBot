      "body": "Sorry about the loan, it is disappointing.According to what I found out, his account was registered on April 22, 2017. He has only earned 10 merits seven times before. Definitely he woke up not quite long ago. The first merit he received was on 27th March, 2023 and the remaining 9 merits in April (the last on April 11th). He requested for a loan on April 12th. This makes me think that he did this intentionally to scam. I am surprised that Royse777 even accepted him into Sinbad in the first place. But that is not the problem because campaign managers can accept who ever they want.Sorry to say this, that he is not worthy to be borrowed money. He still do not have the kind of activeness and merits that supposed to let you borrow him money. Try to do more research before borrowing people money.Sorry. I hope other DT members will give him negative trust too.",

I  suggest shasan should take note of this aspect if any borrower is requesting a loan with a campaign avatar and signature, there should be a proper verification with the campaign manager as to know the genuinety of the identity of the borrower as regards the campaign they are involved with. This can be able to reveal if the borrower is still working with the campaign manager or not as to know if truly he or she could be able to pay back at the appropriate time as specified.",
