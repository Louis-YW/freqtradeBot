  "content": "For something that just kicked off some 15years ago and have come to be headed of gold that has transcended centuries and used by several generations as money, store of value and beautification, it shows what Bitcoin could mean to our world today.1kg of Gold = $82.3k1BTC = $88.3kWhy is that;The long existence of gold and its wide adoption should have made it the more valuable than Bitcoin but no, it’s hardly more rare or let me just put it straight, not very rare. What could be the reason why Bitcoin is ahead todayMore and more gold mines gets discovered the year, lost golds are found, published and reintroduced into the market which increases supply.While,Bitcoins is capped and could never increase further which makes it very rare,Lost Bitcoins are gone for good and it’s a contribution to rarity as we have it,It’s a new means of finance that transcends continents,It’s decentralized and serves both monetary and asset purposes,It holds promises in a global adoption.What would happen if it does happen that, countries shift there focus for reserves towards Bitcoin,Are we going to have well enough Bitcoins to use ourselves?What could be some of the results of the inactions and actions of governments of the world for a shift towards Bitcoin?When it eventually gets more valued than gold as it’s gradually proving.",

So this is not possible unless gold increases in price in trillions times which is not possible. There would have been a cheaper way to get gold. Only the gold beneath the surface are mined but there are still more gold than that. The gold under oceans which are even more have not been mined before because the modern day technology can not achieve that but we do not know the future. Another things is that if humans are able to explore other planets, there is possible of detecting gold there.",

This is a somewhat biased comparison towards bitcoin and unfair to gold, and that doesn't make bitcoin any better than the world. If bitcoin is really better than gold, why do governments still prioritize gold in their national reserves, gold is always the first choice whenever the world is unstable...? Not to mention, try telling gold investors about this comparison, what would they say?It is clear that each asset has its own strengths and is used in different use cases, we should choose the asset that suits us based on our own preferences. There is no need to make such biased comparisons as it does not help the world have a better view of bitcoin.",

What could be the reason why Bitcoin is ahead todayAdditionally, we need to take a look at how convenient bitcoin is from buying it and storing it. Since bitcoin is digital, it makes it easier for a lot of us to buy (given that we have the money) compared to gold where buying it digitally is not exactly that preferred although there have been some buying gold digitally recently. The decentralized nature of bitcoin also adds to the appeal because you can buy it anonymously. QuoteWhat would happen if it does happen that, countries shift there focus for reserves towards Bitcoin,Are we going to have well enough Bitcoins to use ourselves?Bitcoin is limited and there won’t be enough for everyone and if it becomes a nation’s reserve, there will be less and less bitcoin but more and more demand from the people. Low supply, high demand results to even higher prices.QuoteWhat could be some of the results of the inactions and actions of governments of the world for a shift towards Bitcoin?When it eventually gets more valued than gold as it’s gradually proving.We see more and more countries getting into bitcoin. That’s because they know bitcoin is the next new thing while other countries will be left behind as they continue to ignore or ban the existence of bitcoin in their countries.",

But the demand for gold is not just for use as a hedge against inflation or for jewelry, it is also used in almost every industry...It is safe to say that there will not be enough gold for us to use in the future and that gold is still a very rare precious metal.Both assets are good and worth holding, investing in gold is considered a form of asset diversification for us, we don't need to be biased.",

There are rumours of the US thinking about having a Bitcoin reserve, It might only be speculation and nothing real about it but it would be a big steps for this rumour to be true. Bitcoin was created to be scarce hence there wouldn't be enough when it gets adopted by the government of countries. Only few big companies adopting Bitcoin is already making the price to be too expensive for many people to buy and when big countries like the US starts to adopt it, there might not be any left for us to buy or it would be too costly by that time.

      "body": "While Bitcoin has an intrinsically inelastic supply, gold is continually mined, with its supply increased every year. Such scarcity is one of many reasons why Bitcoin has been believed to be a hedge against inflation. More classically, though, everybody trusts gold as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty that date back centuries. Growing institutional and retail confidence in Bitcoin after the election shows Bitcoin ETF inflows jumping to a record in the post election week to $2.6 billion.That said, the volatility in Bitcoin is a serious drawback to the stability in value that gold offers. Large reserves of gold are held by governments and central banks, while the movement of Bitcoin as a reserve asset is only just beginning. Of course, in the event that countries turn to Bitcoin for reserves, the higher price this could drive may benefit the holders but also make it very difficult for everyday transactions. But the possibility of Bitcoin ever wholly replacing gold is slim, more likely, it may complement gold as a strategic reserve asset, and experts stress its increasing yet not leading position.",
