      "body": "-Â  Maybe you ran a miner with the same machine as your node, where it could use up valuable disk as well. So I advise you to check the settings and miner's configuration, try to look the other way to move anotherdata in another location. Moreover, another key to solving your problem is to use a disk clean-up utility, why? due to the unnecessary files will automatically be removed, like system logs, and those files that are no longer needed. But of course, this could only be done using the command \"Sudo apt-get autoremove\".",
