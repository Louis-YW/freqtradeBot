Many people buy bitcoin simply to see if they can make a profit, from their mobile phones, and sometimes they buy a substitute product that replicates the behaviour of the price of bitcoin without knowing that it is not really bitcoin. This happens in banks like Revolut.Add to this the number of people who buy bitcoin from centralised entities such as Coinbase or Binance, or the fact that more and more bitcoin casinos require KYC.In this context, I am not surprised that users who buy bitcoin at Coinbase or a derivative product at Revolut say that they prefer to keep their bitcoins in a bank, because they have no idea what this is all about.",

I wonder what not smart people (among bitcointalk users) will vote for their readiness to entrust their crypto currencies to banks?OP, you should add exactly the same poll to this topic.Regarding your question: I think 30% will already be enough to consider that bitcoin has failed.

How did they conduct the survey to get that result?Survey methodology is important to use the sample as a reflection of the whole Bitcoin owner population. If the methodology is bad, the result will be not a good representation for the big population. The figure surprises me as I am so doubtful about reasons of those people, how did they decide to own and use bitcoin. With them, central banks are not risky and they are readily to use both central banks, their cryptocurrency storage service in future without fear that their bitcoin will be stolen.But probably they see similar risk from centralized exchanges and central banks or even consider central banks are safer than centralized exchanges to store their cryptocurrency.Bitcoin will not fail but those people fail with their choices and lose capital. Their failures won't be Bitcoin failure.",

Just as some might like the same future that Wind_FURY is afraid of or even dislike his own vision of utopia. For example, I'm quite happy with all CEX going bankrupt and then in the trashcan with Binance leading the pack but when I say something like this in the forum I get one hundred angry #SAFU followers screaming at me!In short, it's not me or you or even this forum that decides failure and success, it's the world, and the world is saying that they would love their coins in a bank! Their keys, their decision! What are you going to do, seize their coins?",

So that makes it slightly less bad, in a way? Except it shows as disconcerting disregard for Bitcoin's core principles.So accordingly I'm afraid to some extend Bitcoin already has failed. Not in the sense that it's really in danger of being under centralized control, but rather in that it has failed to convince people of trustlessness, permissionlessness and rethinking monetary sovereignty. But maybe there's still hope that folks will learn their lesson before they ruin the space for the rest of us.",

The community has tried their best to convince them to have self-custody of their own coins rather than relying on any third-party solutions or custodial wallets, but those people are truly dumb and they won't listen to anyone other than their own stupid instincts or we can say their own traditional belief systems.I'm pretty sure that most of them already know that exchanges aren't safe for their Bitcoin but still they still trust those exchanges blindly and keep their coins in those custodial wallets. We have seen many of the exchanges in past that were attacked by hackers and the assets of the users were stolen during those attacks, and those people have also learned about those incidents many times, but still they won't learn any lesson and keep their coins on those custodial wallets.Those people will only get their lesson when their coins get hacked or the exchanges go bankrupt or show bankruptcy only to steal their coins. Most of them have heard about case of FTX, and still they act like sheep after seeing the game that the founders of the FTX played with their users. Even if we try 100 methods to convince them they will still do those dumb things until they learn their lesson when getting robbed by those exhanges.",
