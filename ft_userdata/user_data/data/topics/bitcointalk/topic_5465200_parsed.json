If really im go follow di rules many people wey don apply e don already offend di rules. If one dey apply as Charles-Tim said it, you have to read di rules very well. Some of di naija people wey I see say e don go apply were too hurry abi dem no real di rules. Make una calm down and read the rules before applying. Make una use dis opportunity very well.

I understand your thought when you said until no need. 1: possibly because when we have 1 or 2 merits sources in the local board there won't be a need for too much merit searching outside the local board. That is just my thought anyway,  but with all sincerity, this thread will help a lot of quality posters to redirect them to the thread and this is highly needed for almost everyone here since everyone including merits sources also needs merits too.",

No, leave the thread open it will help newbies to get access to helpful threads,  I bet you also that this will encourage more quality posting in the general forum because what I have observed lately is that we have more high-quality newbies in the 9ja local board who are going to take advantage of of this window to maximize the needed merits to keep them going in high motivation. So e makes sense we all go once,  once follow put mouth for the thread make we for keep the top of the board and easy visibility.",

I think many people would find this thread of his very much deserving because so far there have been lots of application by local board reputable members In becoming a merit source as their various local boards are lacking merits as most of them do not comment on global thread where some merit sources do more activities than the local board. Just like us here, we lack merit Source and with this initiative most locals that  are lacking in merit would be encouraged to do more because they would start seeing the results of their efforts here through this little medium created by hugeblack pending when we get our merit source approval from Theymos.",

I also noticed that most of the applications there are mostly from our local board, and that shows that other members of other local boards have enough merit sources that have been distributing and doing their voluntary task for them as usual. When Theymos is accepting new merit sources, I hope he considers our local board merit source applicants too.",

I just realized that most members might also be thinking and picturing things the same way you viewed them in regard to others thinking they are reporting the post from their alt or something of that nature, but those shouldn't really be a limit or reason to not report it as everyone has different opinions over things, and you being the users who reported those posts knowing fully well that they are free from such allegations shouldn't bother you at all.",
