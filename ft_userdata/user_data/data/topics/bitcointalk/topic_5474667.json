  "content": "Hi there!Someone kindly offered me the paper version of the book Mastering Bitcoin translated into my native language. Since I already own an English version of this book, and I don't like having things lying around unnecessarily, I thought I'd organize a little raffle and give it away for free to someone on the forum.The book is free (please note that the book is not new).Shipping is free within the European Union.Shipping anywhere else would be at your expense, in the case of the US or Asia I think you would lose money compared to the value of the book.Unfortunately, I cannot ship it to Russia, Ukraine, Kosovo or Serbia.Information about the book: Mastering Bitcoin, 2nd Edition, written by  Andreas M. Antonopoulos, June 2017If some of you don't know, you can find this book for free here, it's a must read: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbookRules:There are 6 spots and we'll do the draw with Bitmover's tool to make it fair and transparent: https://bitcoindata.science/giveaway-manager/Only Bitcointalk accounts registered before the 1st September 2023.List of participants:Code:1 - bitbollo2 - Gazeta3 - StackItUp 4 - Remsjack5 - krogoth6 - aoluain",
