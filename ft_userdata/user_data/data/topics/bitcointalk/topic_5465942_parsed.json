  "content": "So I was thinking just to ignore the feedback left by JollyGood, it's been long days and I thought it isn't gonna matter. I have enough in my portfolio to continue my business without the effect of the feedback. But it turns out I still get refused by clients because of the feedback he left on my trust page. Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=366632 JollyGood    2022-06-23    Reference    Read previous feedback or click link for details about the Bitlucy scam. Unacceptable conduct from a campaign manager. In this situation negligent management cannot be excused by mitigating circumstances or previous forum post history.I will review/revise my feedback and support of flag if compelling evidence or statements come to light.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=366632 JollyGood    2022-08-04    Reference    Feedback updated: This user has serious anger management issues and avoids answering questions about their full involvement in the Royse777/Bitlucy scam.Has refused to return funds to all victims citing fake KYC requirements and was campaign manager and self declared \"Co-Partner and Marketing Director\" in the Royse777/Bitlucy scamThere are nothing to discuss about what happened at that time but do you guys still think the feedback deserves to be on the page?(Q1) I have a campaign management business, these feedback cost me a lot, effects me financially, several times I was asked about this feedback and projects were not given to me.Two example with evidence I can share you.When whirlwind came to the forum, their first contact was me. I was guiding them every pros and cons, assisting them to understand the benefit of advertising on the forum, guiding them in everything. They were ready to start the campaign. Quote from: whirlwindmoney on March 17, 2023, 12:30:07 AMYou know how to sell, I'll give you that. I really like your ideas and am quite sure we would have a great collaborationNow today I see this.Quote from: WEB503 on September 06, 2023, 10:32:33 PMThank you for your advice. The first guy you mentioned we probably won't connect with as he has negative feedback and we don't like that in the campaign thread he also advertises his services.These clients on the forum are new, they have no idea who left negative feedback for what reason, their only justification is the negative feedback is there and it's visible, they believe a negative feedback is bad for their business (it make sense when there are others who does not have it, it's the first thing that they see before everything else when they do their home work). There should be no argument that the feedback were left because JollyGood was felt insulted of the response I had when he was trying to show his usual bossiness to me that he shows to other members all the time to destroy their reputation (people who does not go along with him). JollyGood failed to destroy me entirely though but his action is effecting me until this date.Do you guys (who have him in your trust list) really think a controversial user like JollyGood should be in the DT area?(Q2)I will be grateful to hear some justified response from you for the both questions left for you.Cheers,JollyGood's judgement is Trusted by:1.

Which was totally immoral and unexpected. You were not able to prove it that you did not do that. All evidences, suggestions lead it to you only. To be honest personally I suspect you and JollyGood (only you two) are two direct threat for my business, you both intentionally harm it and feel good when you are successful. Difference is JollyGood have this bad ass attitude to do it publicly by manipulating the DT system with his scam busting image and you are coward enough to do it via private communication.As for not accepting you in signature campaign. Tell me a manager's name who did not accept you for this feedback. I will personally talk to them about it.",

You let your emotions control you when you were replying in that thread. Might have needed to take some time before responding is all i'm saying. JG is not the only neg you have either. efialtis has also neg tagged you over the same issue. Just in case you missed that. I really don't think the neg trust is hurting you all that much. You've picked up quite a few campaigns over the last 1-2 years. I see you self promoting in darn near every new opportunity that pops up. You're not going to get them all, I can tell you that from past experience. You can be the most popular person on this forum and still not get them all. Jollygood is not going to have 50+ people remove him from their lists. He might be open to revising his feedback on you, but I doubt he ever removes it completely.

I still have enough evidence and reasons to believe that it is you who sent PMs to my clients and eared them negative things not to hire my service. But anyway, I ate it all. Hope next time I will not see and experience any such thing anymore.Quote from: yahoo62278 on September 07, 2023, 06:34:56 AMJG is not the only neg you have either. efialtis has also neg tagged you over the same issue. Just in case you missed that. I just had a chat with efialtis. It seems he believe at that time he was right and I was wrong, he believes I was supposed to take my decisions based on his warning. It seems he does not understand a situation may take longer time for someone-else to evaluate before making a conclusion. According to his feedback Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=366632 efialtis    2022-06-22    Reference    Promoting and even being part of a shady crypto casino. Poor management, poor excuses with various withdrawal requests not having ever been executed for weeks.Which all were true at that time until I was able to sum up everything to approve it and stand against the brand. It's not always easy to stand against a brand just like a third party because a brand trust us (campaign managers) to do everything to bring positive value to their projects. A third person can make mistake and justify it but when I as a responsible person tell something very quickly and then it become false later time then I bring huge loss to the brand. So when I speak against a brand I am promoting I need to be perfectly convinced that nothing is coming towards me to prove me wrong. So acting in a case for a third persona may take just a second where it will take few hours or even day fors me and managers like us.Quote from: yahoo62278 on September 07, 2023, 06:34:56 AMYou let your emotions control you when you were replying in that thread. Might have needed to take some time before responding is all i'm saying. I should, If I remember I was bad also towards you too. Sorry for that. Someone needs to be on my shoes before to understand what I was going through at that time.But anyway, a negative feedback is not a prescription for anger management or I am wrong?",

But you subsequently asked very much to remove yourself from this list, which I did, but not at the first request. I want to say that I respect both of you, and I respect your opinion and your firm position.

Do you consider those people less important than another forum member who left you a negative review?Fact is I am still surviving because of those feedback I earned though my contribution to the forum, these are approval from people for the years of contribution I have in the community. I believe feedback system should be organic.But these negative feedback from JollyGood are not organic. It's about his personal dis-likeness and he expressed by using these feedback. Something that came out from his personal dis-likeness is hurting my business which I am conducting with the HIGHEST standard (no one can question the quality of conducting the campaigns I have). The monthly transaction volume of my business is minimum $25K, yearly minimum $300K but still I get reasons like \"We are not going with someone who have negative reputation\". It's not fault of these new people, the potential clients who are overlooking others feedback. They see all but when they see the negative one, obviously it creates a doubt in their mind, that doubt leads a change of mind. I am not saying I will have every projects that launch in the community, the other managers are as good as me if not better than me but when a project miss out of hand just because of the reason of having negative feedback, it's hard to take.Feedback system especially the negative feedback is not to use against someone who you don't like. You can give a positive feedback to anyone you like, it does not harm but a negative feedback can have many negative consequences and one should not just give it when he does not go alone with others.There are no question JollyGood is not comfortable with me. It's not complex to understand why he left these negative feedback. It's not just me, you will discover majority of his negative feedback are towards the people he does not go comfortable. Is this a good reason to have him in your trust list?Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on September 07, 2023, 07:58:19 AMthis has been working since the conflict with The Cryptovator, and this may be your main problem with other users who have given you red tags.Conflict with with The Cryptovator, is it about TMAN leaving negative feedback to Best_change because they did not have an escrow? Do you see defending them was a wrong reason at that time?Look where is Best_change now. They needed this defense from someone (I am glad I was there for them) or they were not here now. If I was joining TMAN and how JollyGood reacts, then Best_change would be destroyed so far and you were not wearing their signature today.It's easy to support a positive reason but before supporting a negative reason, one really needs to consider so many unthinkable consequences especially when it is about a business. A business is not just a living tool of one person, many people depends on it. If Best_Change was ruined at that time, then thousands of people currently who are depending on them now would have different story.",

If I remember correctly Royse also gave JG a negative rating and as of now it has been removed.",

If you did not have access to the vault or wallet storing the players' funds, and it was not your responsibility to manage that as part of the co-operation (and you also do not have a percentage stake in bitlucy or derive any profit from it outside of the signature campaign), then you legally have no obligations to reimburse them yourself, as that should've been the bitlucy guy's job but as everyone has seen already, he was a scammer.",

This should be settled and the negative tag should be changed to a good one or be erased, but this can not be done with them fighting each other.

Poor management, poor excuses with various withdrawal requests not having ever been executed for weeks.This was all true. I think I've said it before: You fucked up! But, I also hope you've learned from it: be less trusting and more careful. And there's this:Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PMAll that being said, I still discourage retaliatory ratings, and with these changes I encourage people to try to \"bury the hatchet\" and de-escalate rather than trying to use any increased retaliatory power you now have. Also, it's best to make your own custom list, and you must do this if you want to be on DT1.@JollyGood: I think you should consider theymos' quote too.",

A trusted feedback, that's all they see. Of course a little research could prove their idea wrong. I have many campaigns who are TOP brands and thriving in the industry like Sinbad, Yo!Mix, MegaPari etc and they could see these brands are in right direction). It's very unfortunate that whirlwind.money pulled the scam, I don't think Hhampuz is to be blamed or any of us who helped, deserves a negative promotion. We are just managers, not some people who came from the future. We know nothing more, we know as much as you know from public domain.",

This is a credit to you. Quote from: Royse777 on September 07, 2023, 06:39:58 AMI still have enough evidence and reasons to believe that it is you who sent PMs to my clients and eared them negative things not to hire my service. But anyway, I ate it all. Hope next time I will not see and experience any such thing anymore. I too have long since given you the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad you did. Just to reiterate that I never contacted any of your clients, and, in fact, I thought you had made it up, somehow manipulating the screenshot (I was not the only one who thought so), but seeing according to joker_josue's analysis showing that the screenshot had not been manipulated, I ended up believing that, indeed, a client told you that I had contacted him, when I did not contact anyone.If it happens to you again, please send me a PM and let's somehow confront whoever told you.Lastly I wanted to give you some friendly advice. I would spend my energies on building the new and not fighting the past. Continue managing campaigns as well as you do, make your business instead of a serveral hundred thousand a year business, a $1M one. Most likely scenario is that you will continue to accumulate positive feedback and if you get to a point where you have 50 or 100 positive feedbacks, the fact that you have two negative ones from a long time ago will be completely irrelevant. And since you talked about Best_Change, I think it's a good example, because as of today the only negative feedback and from someone who is no longer on the forum is buried under 25 positives and it doesn't matter.",

You've picked up quite a few campaigns over the last 1-2 years. I see you self promoting in darn near every new opportunity that pops up. You're not going to get them all, I can tell you that from past experience. You can be the most popular person on this forum and still not get them all. Didn't Rouse777 meant that he would have gotten Whirlwind campaign if not for the negative tag? That means the company told him he is not going to Emily him because of the feedback. I may want to employ a campaign manager, if I see a campaign manager that is having no negative feedback and bad neutral feedback, I will prefer the person to someone that has one negative feedback. I mean, with the way Whirlwind's reputation imploded at the end, it was good that Royse ultimately did not manage that campaign (and have a new scam accusation to contend with).It was lucky indeed for Royse to not manage that campaign, I'm not sure if Royse would have asked the WW to escrow 40k worth of DAI.

I get that you don't like airfinex sending a PM to your client, but it looks like the message itself was correct.I don't think this justifies a \"trading with the user is high-risk\"-warning. See this:Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.If anything, warning someone against a potential problem could even be considered doing the right thing.About the wording of your feedback: maybe he did it to cause you financial damage. Or maybe he did it to save your client from that damage. Either way, it looks like you're blaming the messenger for a message you didn't like.",
