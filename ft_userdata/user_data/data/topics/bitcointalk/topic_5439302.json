      "body": "PhysicalBitcoinArt - Thank you for posting the auction here. I really do like this item, but hesitate to place a bid because the auction terms are extremely vague, I'm not even sure if the auction is being held here in this thread or on twitter? For example, statements like this make it hard to determine an actual winner if there is not a determined end time:Quote from: PhysicalBitcoinArt on February 10, 2023, 06:07:49 AM...The auction ends Saturday evening or so!...Unclear terms only leaves you and any bidders open to arguments, scams, and manipulation of the auction. I would hate to see it devolve as this seems to be a legitimate item and auction. I would recommend reading this thread on how to buy/sell/set up an auction (there is even an auction template) and be sure to include things like:Start and end date and time including time zone.Minimum bid increments.Payment details and/or expectations, payment address in OP, timeline etc.Sniping rules, auction end terms.etc.I hope this helps your auction. More clear terms may result in more interest, it would from me TBH. Geo",
