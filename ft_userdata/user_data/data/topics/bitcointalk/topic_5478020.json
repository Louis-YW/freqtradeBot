First of all, you talk say your friend recommend this forum for you and now you dey ask wether you go fit run am lol, I laugh because I go say you know know watin you done miss so far, because looking from the very first month way you register for this forum, if to say you really dey serious to learn about crypto currency (Bitcoin as number one) you for done go far ajd still gain enough knowledge too. Although, no be everybody go join something one time but as you done come back, you really dey welcome bro, here as long as say you are ready to learn about crypto currency, then there is nothing to worry about because you are on the right place.Many people done come here get Bitcoin knowledge and so many other good stuffs too.",

You have registered in the forum for a very long time and this is your first post in the forum, welcome back from exile. You didn’t make any post since that period till now, hope you are now back to learn and grow your knowledge in the crypto world? If you’ve been here all this while since you registered, you would have become a better bitcoin enthusiast by now with what you would have learned through this forum alone. Welcome back, you have not missed anything if you are really looking to learn as you’ve said, everything starts in a day and how you put effort into learning a new thing determines how long it will take you to be better in it. The forum is all about bitcoin (firstly), every other discussion are secondary to it. Read, learn, understand and ask questions anywhere you’re lost and that will help your journey here faster to know more about bitcoin.Quote from: Abu-Naim on December 15, 2023, 05:05:09 PMThe problem we are having is that, after been introduced by our colleagues, some of us go ahead and be violating the forum rules because if I am not mistaken, our Nigerian newbies that get banned through plagiarism are much, so make you try abide by the forum rules, avoid plagiarism and also make sure you are posting good content that worth attention. Never abuse someone and always ask questions when you need more explanation.The key to success even when you’re been introduced by someone is seeking to learn more and abide by the rules guiding that place. If they want to always do it the smart way without following the due learning process, they end up violating rules that will make them be penalized immediately. Involving in plagiarism is claiming to be wise and when they are caught, they are immediately penalized for it. Those that introduce them may have told them about the rules but some of them seeing it as a strict rules tends to unfollow the rule, some are warned not once because they are newbies, while some learn from it, some continue plagiarizing which is why they get banned for it.",

      "body": "You will never miss anything from a lively platform like this Bitcointalk forum. Na anytime wey you come join, na him be your own time, so you will only need to build an understanding around the order of the day and get yourself acquainted with the rules and regulations of the forum so you don't find yourself wanting of breaking rules in the forum.Since you been talk say na your friend bring you come here and no be say you just read about it somewhere and decided to join, I don't think you need to ask this question here since your friend already understands virtually everything and is up to date, you should journey you through all that you need to know about the forum. You fit use the Help navigation bar and the Beginners and Help board too. You just need to understand the way the crypto world operates which I think you already know.You fit ask your friend about those things wey forum no they tolerate which includes Shitposting, Spamming and/or using derogatory languages amongst other things so that you can last long here. Also, you need to maintain originality and avoid being a copycat as you can be banned permanently if you're found wanting of a copyright infringement.Goodluck!",
