  "content": "QuoteThis past year, 39% of American professionals participated in freelance work, either part-time or full-time, according to Upworks new survey of 3,000 adults. Thats equivalent to 60 million Americans, up 3 percentage points since 2021 and a record high since Upwork has performed said survey starting in 2014. In 2021, only 36% of the workforce was freelancing. But in 2022, as people continued to want flexibility, freelancing became more appealing and essential. It all represents a shifting mindset in the workforce, Margaret Lilani, VP of talent solutions at Upwork tells Fortune.Now, more than ever, professionals are questioning the old and traditional aspects of work and looking for something better, she says. People want to do what they love, have more control over their careers, and determine where, when, and how they work.The autonomous nature of freelancing becomes more evident as more companies usher in a return to office. While remote work opportunities might be waning, the desire to have the freedom that working from home granted remains appealing 73% of respondents said schedule flexibility was a key reason they pursued freelance work, and 69% said the same for location flexibility. The idea of being ones own boss was also appealing to many (0%).But, the real appeal to freelancing is quite simple: Money. A majority of respondents (83%) cited earning extra money as the top reason for freelancing, and 73% cited control over ones financial goals and future. Dealing with inflation and stagnant wages, more Americans are looking to side gigs in order to stay afloat. A Bankrate survey from this past summer found that more side hustlers were dependent on their extra income to pay for everyday expenses than they were in 2019. Freelancers are also more likely to be satisfied with their pay than their non-freelancing counterparts; Upwork found that while 57% of freelancers were happy with their wages, only 42% of non-freelancers felt similarly. Perhaps due to their financial situation, the youngest generations are most likely to pursue freelancing; 43% of Gen Zers and 46% of millennials said they were freelancing this year. It makes sense, given that these generations are more likely to be in entry-level jobs that simply dont pay enough for the current cost of living. While older millennials may be in the mid-career and earning more money, theyre also in a life stage of big ticket expenses, from weddings to homeownership. Financial anxiety is high among these groups, as many dont think theyll ever be able to afford their dream lifestyle.And Gen Z has proven to be especially nervous about a looming recession, likely because a majority of them are experiencing true downfall on their own for the first time. The youngest generation is preparing for a potential recession the most, cutting down on spending, delaying purchases, working another job, and working more at a rate higher than any other generation. Sure, freelancing is about control and a changing mindset but its also about being able to pay the bills.https://fortune.com/2022/12/13/freelancing-record-high-side-gigs-millennials-gen-z/....The following could explain how many americans are supporting themselves despite not being officially employed.QuoteThis past year, 39% of American professionals participated in freelance work, either part-time or full-time, according to Upworks new survey of 3,000 adults. Thats equivalent to 60 million Americans, up 3 percentage points since 2021 and a record high since Upwork has performed said survey starting in 2014. While it is not mentioned, I am wondering how many \"freelancers\" earn income in crypto related ventures? Crypto being one of the bigger employment and revenue creating opportunities of recent times, is it possible that a significant segment of side hustles are crypto based ventures? Or is the trend more evenly distributed throughout ride sharing apps, amazon delivery freelancing and purely internet based activities?Generation Z appears to be the largest freelancing demographic. Which makes sense given they're probably the most internet and technology literate. I think generation Z is also the largest crypto using and supporting demographic.With concerns lingering over future job automation and lack of wage growth. Could side hustles and freelancing work represent the natural progression for the future of job markets? If this is true, then could crypto also be prominently positioned to best leverage and fulfill needed areas of freelance finance, given its flexibility, adaptability and rapid deployment capabilities.",

Moreover, jobs are currently quite difficult to find, the wages they get don't match the work, so that Generation Z starts to leave the job model as before. Currently the Crypto space is getting bigger, the use of investment is quite widespread in various countries, considering that flexibility and adaptability tend to match their thinking.",

There are quite a few of us who receive an income, which depending on where in the world you live is a decent side hustle or even a good salary. I'm not only talking about participating in signature campaigns, but also managing them, giving loans, translating, etc. The great thing about the internet is that it has made it possible for everyone to earn an income from home, instead of the traditional side hustles that require physical presence, such as working as a waiter or delivering pizzas.",

If this is true, then could crypto also be prominently positioned to best leverage and fulfill needed areas of freelance finance, given its flexibility, adaptability and rapid deployment capabilities.There have been an increase in the rate of people that engage in freelancing in my country recently. Most people are even resigning from their permanent jobs to focus on these online jobs. One of the biggest attraction of these freelancing or online jobs is that its recruitment is based on competence and skills and not because of favoritism or other sentiments. Most of these jobs doesn't also need paper qualification but relevant skills or expertise. I live in a country where employment is based on tribal sentiment and tribalism. Most persons are employed based on connection or who they know in government.Most of these freelancing jobs also pay higher than most fulltime jobs. Exchanging currencies like the Euro or Dollars to our local currency makes the payment more attractive and satisfying compared to the national minimum wage. And in recent times most western companies are greatly using the African labor market because they offer cheap and quality services. Although some these freelancing job are very tasking but they can also give workers the opportunity to plan their work life better than when they are doing fulltime jobs. A freelancer might decide to go on holiday without anyone's approval, but this might not be the case in full time jobs.Due to the unfriendly nature of the government of my country towards cryptocurrencies, job opportunities in that sector is limited. But it is common to see some youths engaging in crypto trading or exchange services.",

Indeed, people often have jobs but do other things on the side or mix different freelance jobs t earn a living. While it can mean that there isn't enough money people are getting now from one job, which is something that must be fixed, it also gives more flexibility and less dependence on a particular employer, and thus more power. There are, of course, other sides to it, such as the precarious state of not having a long-term contract, not being sure you'll get as much income next month as this month, and potential issues if you need to get a loan or want a mortgage.Crypto freelance can be a part of it and something to become more relevant with the shifting market, but I don't think it takes a significant share of all freelance jobs for now.

I'd say rather than diminishing the salary or full time jobs, the technological improvements are a massive benefit in the earning power of people who embrace it properly. It gives people the opportunity to improve their lives if they are willing to put a bit more of their private time into it.
