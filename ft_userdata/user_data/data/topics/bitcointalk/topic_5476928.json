  "content": "This is much needed: Quote from: Royse777 on December 07, 2023, 08:30:01 PMI will avoid replying to JollyGood, airfinex, Poker Player, decodx and GazetaBitcoin . Let's work on solving the problems Icopress have against me.So instead of the other thread (where this post will be off topic), I have this topic to answer you.Quote from: icopress on December 07, 2023, 02:22:33 PMI'll leave this here as a reminder for myself.Three of my clients (I have not yet received a response from the rest) informed me that they received a letter from Royce in which he intrusively offers his services under the pretext of banning mixers on Bitcointak. Making it sound like I'm nothing, Lol.. maybe he thinks I can't take care of marketing to my clients outside of the forum.What’s especially funny is that not long ago I was chatting about sponsorship deals with MegaPari, but when it came to launching a campaign, I refused and wrote to Royce to contact these guys.For me this is extremely unethical behavior.Edited: Four of my clients.Come down man, it sounds like only your clients received those offers. I was sending the same PMs to some projects (active and none active both, so which ones were managed by which manager or even if any of them already had a marketing on the forum, was not in the mind). If you have doubt then ask julerz12, one of his client also received the same message and we both had a chat earlier about some other topic. Don't consider yourself the center of the business. You and GazetaBitcoin really needs a break. Don't force me to go bad and expose what you two do behind the scene (the template, scripts - guess what I mean). Have in mind that I am also a campaign manager and I have connections with a lot of projects which I managed and not managed (I also have very very close connections with many forum members too). Time to time they tell me things too which I never thought to post like you did in public because it will not look good on you two.QuoteWhat’s especially funny is that not long ago I was chatting about sponsorship deals with MegaPari, but when it came to launching a campaign, I refused and wrote to Royce to contact these guys.I do not think it was unethical, as a manager you can reach out to anyone. I never did mind, in fact when clients or other members informed me I was just giving them a LOL (that's the best I could do). But since you think what I did was unethical (by targeting you campaigns, which was not) what I did is unethical then forget about past ones but just the recent one since you are proudly mentioning it - when you reached one of my client, shouldn't you reach me first because you know I am actively working with them? Anyway, not asking the questions to get answers but you really have a lot of room to improve yourself. I am your competition but not enemy. Don't come after reputation, I will not take it easily.Quote from: icopress on December 04, 2023, 09:46:47 PMA bold statement is when someone brags about how much they earn and how much clients' money they keep.A bold claim is when someone pays several participants a very high rate, and claims that it is the “highest paying campaign.”This was your last message and it clearly means you have problems with me. If you indeed have problems then let's talk and solve it here or let's stay away from each others. Don't write something that could trigger me to response you. I never did any so far unless other day I saw the following conversation between you and another user.Quote from: Royse777 on December 04, 2023, 09:31:54 PMQuote from: icopress on December 04, 2023, 03:50:22 PMQuote from: fillippone on December 04, 2023, 03:38:42 PM[banned mixer] raised their payrate to 10 USD until end of campaign. Finally beating the payrate of CM.Any news from MixTum? Asking for a friend.Did you mean Tumbler?This is just a trick... and it is unlikely that they could compete with MixTum if there had not been a ban since January 1 (in every sense of the word).As for the campaign... the campaign is still ongoing, as I have not yet received a response from MixTum. This week I even took on two new members to the campaign.Isn't it a very bold statement to tell something like this for one over another one?I was asked to make the pay rate $14 per post which I could do very easily since the money is not going out of my pocket but imagine would that benefit the project? No.As a campaign manager I think our job is to balance the marketing budget and the ROI. Sinbad was a prime example of a successful brand until ...",

None of them were campaign managers. Nothing related to icopress or any other manager. Manager to manager things should not come open like this, Icopress could just PM me and ask for reasoning since he thought it was about him only. It was not necessary to post it in several places like one here, another here. Who knows he was considering to make more posts about it in all of the places where he was considering would be look him good and me bad. He knows the best.Quote from: digaran on December 07, 2023, 04:48:05 PMDid you use your forum account or an alt account to do it?I see no point to use an alternative account when I am offering my service to anyone.edit:Just a thought came just now, airfinex is an alt. Who it could be? He leaves no chance unused to defame me whenever he gets a chance. The last one is Royse777 will not pay anyone for the last week /Sinbad campaign/.",

The management team on our forum is doing very well and you both have played very important role as part of the management team. It's useless to attack each-other in public because that will allow those people to attack as well who just want to add oil into the fire. I respect both of you as managers of the forum and I believe that peaceful solution is the best path you both should choose. I hope that others would also like you guys to have a peaceful settlement instead of taking such matters to huge heights.",

He knows the best.When you complained about Poker Player, if you had said something like \"this would have been ok if you were a campaign manager looking to poach my clients\"... actually it would have made even less sense to me but at least you would sound somewhat more consistent above. Now it just sounds like you're making up excuses.I understand that this that way to you, i.e. others messaging your clients - bad, you messaging other manager's clients - good. However: 1) For the person sending the messages, it looks reasonable to warn someone that they're doing business with an untrustworthy (in their opinion) user.2) For the person receiving the messages, a warning about someone's untrustworthiness they can just ignore if they don't care, or perhaps they didn't know and it might be good to know. A message from a competing manager... they can ignore as well. No huge difference although I personally would be more annoyed by promotional messages, if at all.3) For an outside observer, no big difference either way. Someone messaged someone about the business they're doing on the forum. As long as it doesn't break forum rules (which promo messages might be more likely to do but I'm not sure).Edit: When I say \"no big difference\", I don't mean that this is acceptable or unacceptable in my opinion, I mean that if you consider one scenario unethical/unacceptable/etc, then the other one likely is unethical/unacceptable/etc too. Consistency.I know icopress to be a very reasonable person, and I know you're a great manager but perhaps a tad too sensitive when someone says something about you... I mean look at the threads you tend to create on this board. If you did nothing wrong, you did nothing wrong. Threads like these won't help you prove that - likely the opposite, having to defend yourself on something like this makes it look more sketchy than it probably is.",
