The level of risk can be summed up in two points:- Investing in new cryptocurrencies means investing in new projects that we are often unaware of the various details of, and even the research process is difficult due to the absence of the necessary information to ensure its credibility. Even if information is available about the vision of the project and the work team, this does not guarantee its success to any extent.The best that can be done in this case is to verify the work team and preliminary evaluations from experts in the field of project activity. Personally, I recommend using Bitcointalk forum to verify projects, whether by searching for discussions or asking questions.- The instability of the price movement and its volatility are what increase the risk of investment, and for this reason, beginners are always advised to invest in major cryptocurrencies that have a good position in the market. This ensures investment in reliable projects whose prices are relatively stable.Personally, I always recommend investing in bitcoin as one of the safest investments in the crypto market.",

Maybe you'll find out that altcoin market is too volatile for you or that you don't have time to watch all these projects. Rule 1: Before you buy any shitcoins, buy bitcoin. At least after losing money on shitcoins you'll still have something worth keeping that's going to eventually bring you some profit.Rule 2:Investing is exposing yourself to risk. You buy bitcoin you expose yourself to the risk of bitcoin failing. You buy altcoins you take double risk because if bitcoin fails they fail and they can also fail on their own. Double risk should equal double reward, but does it?",

Actually, it was really hard to spot a project if it was a scam or legit because some developers are too clever and really doing their best to hide their real intention. But for a newbie like you, it was the best option to invest in old projects while you are still learning crypto. Don't make your life too hard but rather make it easy by choosing reputable coins which most investors had chosen.  OP is right, scam mostly happens to new projects. So, why we should try them in the first place if we know that most of them are scams?",

I would not generalize that all new crypto projects are fake because bitcoin started one day like some of them. But I am sure that only few new projects in the cryptocurrency space are genuine, the majority Of them have a short lifespan. Any project that promises outrageous profit in a short time should be avoided because they are scams. The best advice is to invest in a coin you have confidence in based on track records and lifespan. I don't have the stomach to handle the uncertainties of shitcoins, that is why I only keep bitcoin.",

The government are getting late for proper regulation, the government like to focus most on exchanges but there are still those so called altcoins decentralized exchanges that scammers are using successfully. Even most now projects are fake, many are failed, there are some that their developers are greedy and they dump the project, many are for scam from its beginning. There are thousands of coins that are existing now, but I prefer not to buy a coin that do not have a good marketcap. Out of all bitcoin is the best.",

Investing in altcoins is extremely risky, even if you are an experienced investor, you can still lose money investing in altcoins. There is no specific formula or trick to determine which projects will not scam or which will. Only invest in altcoins when you are willing to take the risk, and there is no such thing as a low risk high return investment.",

This advice is strictly for investors and it is very good for those who like to invest in new projects, but I don't think all investors are stupid. Because there are also not a few investors who don't like new projects, so not all investors are stupid even though there are some investors who forget to research new projects and immediately get into it.QuoteAlmost 99% of new projects are same copies of the old projects with different name, do not be a fool investors, spend time to do your own research.Developers mostly don't have your interest at heart, we all know it's all about the money but they aren't doing something new that worth our money, make sure you do your diligent research. This is very possible because I have also seen a new project with the same concept when it was built and the project team only polished the outside of the project to make it look new in everyone's eyes. Especially in the eyes of investors, even though it's a part that shouldn't be immediately believed before they thoroughly research it or all of it. And I agree on the point of researching more diligently when I see a team promoting a new project.",

In addition, you wrote superficially about the need to conduct your own investigation and did not explain exactly what you meant by that. By calling all developers scammers, you accuse them of being unfounded, but it would be better if there was some definite evidence.Any project, even well-coordinated, in our time has a very precarious position. In times of crisis, building your own business is always fraught with failure. But on one point, I completely agree with you that it is very difficult to create something new at a time when even old projects are crumbling like sand houses.Bitcoin remains the only safe haven, but for lovers of risk, of course, a huge selection of altcoins is provided.",
