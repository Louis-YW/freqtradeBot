  "content": "Sabotaging a new age technology is not new for the Indian government. If you look back such harsh measures were never put into regulation. I am talking about tax without any regulations on cryptocurrency. To explain my point of view, let's look into the past with these three points.  Computers are Devil!Computers were allowed for public use by the government in 1990s, whereas the history of computing in India started in 1955. In 90s the present ruling government was against computers, why? They feared it will enable job cuts. Look at the present situation! Do you think job cut due to computers is an issue? Internet will destroy India!The world was enjoying the benefits of Internet from 1985, we Indians first got a glimpse of it in 1995. Using dialup modem a big chick of our uncle generation got frustrated. At that time this same ruling part and the government were against Internet. The reason it will have a negative impact on our future generations. What happened to the privacy law?I agree as in 2023 we don't have a privacy policy law. As of now we should hear about it in the coming monsoon session. I am sure it will again be stalled. What to do?As of 2022 we are in a dilema with the current tax. This is the first non regulated income getting taxed. Kind of what is happening in the West. The ruling part is the same which objected on all previous disruptive technology. The present opposition is so weak that they can't question it. In the end we as a community have to rise up and question out government. If you think you have that ability then reply to this topic and post your idea!Image Source",

As new blood comes to power this will change provided there is no new technology that they too don't understand, India is far better than some countries even some European countries when it comes to adoption of new disruptive technology",

Technology is such a thing that if you don't adapt to technology, you automatically miss out on most things. But I can say that it was the opposite in India, I can say that now the society has the most qualified people in the world, in the blockchain sector, by far.",

Since google ceo was also coming from india and im sure about this countryis having capability to adopt with the tech development. You shall put the main concern in the government but can you tell me what relation to the altcoin discussion? Your thread was not even discussing about altcoin.",

The crypto tax seems like another example of showing up late and still trying to rule the dance floor.But let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. At least we're on the party guest list now. Yeah, we might have the unwanted tag of 'latecomer,' but we're here. And isn't that a step in the right direction?What can we do? Use the weapons of our generation - memes, tweets, and epic rants on Reddit. Let's start the conversation, shake up the status quo. Maybe it's time the government learns some new dance moves from us!",

If you have any concerns or ideas about regulatory disruptive technology, I think you should/can join in and participate in constructive discussions, engage with relevant stakeholders, and contribute to the policy-making process.",

The best a community can do is to push the idea forward to make them notice about it. The info they'd get? They're the ones who's going to collect that. So the decision of whether your government would adopt new technologies would still rely on them.",

That is because none of them would like to move out of their comfort zone and work for the future. A few decades back who knew that Bitcoin and a few altcoins will change the world so much. Now after realising the fact they are either cashing it out or trying to stop its adoption.",

The main reasons is of course the Government already has a stable and settled system, old media like television and radio are easier to be regulated compared to newer things like the Internet, the same case as Cryptocurrency is much harder to be regulated than the Government own money.",

The reason it will have a negative impact on our future generations.-cut-Mainly they oppose disruptive tech because it could disrupted the government itself. And frankly it could. No one knows the future of new tech when it comes. I would be more afraid of GTP AI then cryptos though. As we can roughly predict what cryptos could bring for us, but no one can see full picture of AI generated content. We could lose real, trusted, verifiable information for exampleMany accountants sticked to pen and paper for a long time, and many people opposed the internet when it came, it wasn't just governments, but people themselves. Computers were clumsy, and no one really could have predicted where they were going at the time. When you say that \"The world was enjoying the benefits of Internet from 1985\", it wasn't even near the internet we know of. And public wasn't using it. I started to use internet in university in 1995 in Finland. And even then it was mostly ftp and irc for me. http wasn't really useful for anything else then homepages for a long time and homepages were a wild west. Just finding anything remotely true was a shot in the dark. So i don't think you were too much behind on that.Same thing goes with cryptos. Even now people aren't really \"using\" cryptos for anything as tech isn't ready. They just send it back and worth and swap it. There are no big scale innovations build on top of blockchains. And when people are interested from things like nfts, it's only the speculative value that matters to them. So you are early on cryptos too. This is the altavista phase or earlier if we compare cryptos to internet history.",
