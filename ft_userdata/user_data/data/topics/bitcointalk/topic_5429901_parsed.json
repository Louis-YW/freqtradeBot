Just because a service accepts cryptocurrency that does not mean that it is cost effective. Something that costs 100-200 EUR at Hetzner can cost upwards of 500 EUR somewhere else.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 18, 2022, 09:50:40 AMQuote from: BenCodie on December 18, 2022, 09:22:38 AMThe hetzner blanket ban on crypto is taking further effect, in accordance to their terms of service.

This is not officially sourced anywhere, however I have spoken to a few other full node operators who took the risk to use hetzner, all of which have also been locked out. There are hints of complaints on hetzner review pages, though there is no official talk about it yet. It happened very recently (within the last 72 hours). People are probably not going to speak up either due to it being almost expected (since it's against ToS) and also due to the Solana situation, which served as a warning. Anyone who speaks up will be called ignorant of reading Hetzners rules, rightfully, so not many/no operators will post most likely.What you have sent from mempool space ([2] https://mempool.space/graphs/lightning/nodes-per-isp) does not include nodes that do not have open channels. Most of the data has not been updated in 1-3 days either when you look at data specific to HetznerI will do further work on analysis later.",

And if it has issues, if you have no open channels it is not such a big deal to recover, you are not worrying about lost / locked funds.-Dave",

Though, since these cloud hosting companies are centralized, expect changes in future. It's well clear that choices differ and people may prefer to run nodes on cloud computers, but electronic devices like laptops, raspberry Pi etc, works better, and maintains decentralization; removes fear of getting banned. I've used Hetzner (not for running nodes) and indeed they're quick to ban accounts especially when the IP has been blacklisted for some reasons. In addition, taking a KYC to run a bitcoin node is an unbearable hassle.",

Usually providers will at least make some sort of comment somewhere when they have an issue like that.Otherwise rumors start to build. Does not even have to be their fault, a blown route in one of their peering partners can be a pain to trace out. Dave on cable can get to them but Dave on FiOS can't. Do you blame FiOS or the people that FiOS themselves are connected to. And so on.For all it does BGP routing is simple when it works, tracking down odd issues can take a while.-Dave",

According to contabo docs, they are definitely crypto friendly. It's a shame they do not accept cryptocurrency, but yet again not many decent providers do. Not sure what is crypto, nor do I give too many fucks.  I would think that a service provider should try to accept bitcoin and/or lightning network payments... ....and yeah maybe they can accept some shitcoins and convert them to bitcoin or to dollars right away.. and sure some shitcoiners would maybe want to find some ways to off-load their shitcoins, but I am not sure how that would be bringing much meaning towards the various kinds of concerns that bitcoin users may well be attempting to address in terms of decentralization and various attempts at self-autonomy.... except surely there could be some deflection values in terms of the various shitcoins that are out there and are being promoted, talked about in ambiguous ways as if there was meaning therein and/or used.Regarding any business needing to accept bitcoin in order to be bitcoin-friendly, sure it is understandable that some businesses may well have some constrains towards being able to receive depending on their jurisdiction (tax, accounting, reporting and maybe others, perhaps?), but I would imagine that any companies doing business in and around bitcoin should attempt to address the issue in regards to explaining their payment methods and maybe mentioning if they intend to accept bitcoin in the future or if they feel that they are restrained from being able to accept bitcoin (and provide a reason for why they are not accepting bitcoin, if that is their current status)... of course, if they choose to accept some shitcoin then maybe they should specify, and hopefully they are not using dumb-ass vague language that hardly means anything, unless there is some specification regarding what it means.. .. \"crypto-friendly?\" what the fuck is that?By the way, the Contabo statement (See below) about how they are not currently accepting bitcoin payments is a bit lame.. but at least they have an explanation to help to inform their clients regarding the extent to which they seem to have a decently good explanation or some lame one, like Contabo (from my perspective) has a fairly lame one (at this time).>>>>>>What About Paying with Bitcoin or Other Crypto?We don’t have plans to start accepting Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment in Contabo. The main reason is volatility of most coins, which means that we would have to adjust the prices multiples times a day. Second, more important reason is the fact that many coins have a negative impact on the climate. Even Tesla eventually decided to stop accepting Bitcoin. <<<<<",
