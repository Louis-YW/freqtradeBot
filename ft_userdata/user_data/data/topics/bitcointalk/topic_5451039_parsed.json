While government actions may impact the market, it is also possible that the market will recover and continue to grow over time. It may be a good idea to consider diversifying your investments and staying up to date on any developments in the industry.",

Conflict arise mainly from regulatory uncertainties which is brought by unclear policies. Companies are confused and it seems Coinbase got tired of this so they sued the US SEC. I don't know if that will go far but I like what they did. I think it will be significant in creating future crypto-related rules and regulations.",

Why should a company choose to shut down when they had built it for many years? move to a different country isn't simple as you saying.Government's only take action against of privacy oriented crypto, so for ETH, BNB, USDT which is centralized coin, they can cooperate with government and choose to follow the government's regulation.",

Therefore, the remaining ones are keeping their hostility until they no longer have this problem but they won't gonna succeed because their days are now finally over.",

They might have to shut down or move to a different country.It is pretty obvious why the governments and authorities of the world are so negative against cryptocurrencies as a whole in most cases. Cryptocurrencies were invented to give people a payment method, that has no middlemen or banks involved in a normal payment and that can not be controlled or seized by any government. Obviously the the authorities does not want something like that they want control over their people. That is why they are trying to hinder the growth of cryptos as much as possible.So far though i think that the more the governments have tried to hold crypto back the more crypto as a whole has grown. So i am not worried about sanctions and stuff like that.",

The government are fully aware of how profitable cryptocurrency is and looking for loopholes to attack it has always been their strategy to make money out of crypto companies. Taxation has also been their main goal to regulate over cryptocurrency users. These things have always been the things that users have to bear with because we can't always expect support from the government.",

There are people in crypto world saying that law makers doesn't understand crypto and that's why they hate it. But i see it as an opposite, anyone with a brain sees that it's a direct threat against government money and they have to move to move towards more auditable system. I am not saying it's a threat because it would replace fiat money, it's a threat because when wealth isn't in control of countries, it can't be seized and they are afraid that it would become a way to launder huge sums of money.Luckily there are options that could suit governments as well but for some reason they haven't been expoited yet. And there are more then one voice in regulators so we don't yet know what road they will ultimately take.Ban of fiat/crypto pairs in west would be disasterous however.",

And with those that I've been reading, they're going to tax it a lot. India is like 28% or more than that. To think of those percentages, it will literally make you think if you want to take those profits while them are just waiting for it for every individual who's gonna take profits.",

A lot of cases have been seen in the last few years. Due to this case, some good projects are facing various negative effects. I think the main problem here is that people don't like to keep their money in banks anymore. And when money is being withdrawal from the bank, the bank collapses in uncertainty, which they see as a major threat of their country. They are trying to regulate crypto by filing various lawsuits which will never succeed.",

They also said that they are going to imposed 30% of bitcoin mining, and I think that is huge already for miners.So don't be surprised if exchanges are going to move away from US, just like in the thread that I open here, Robert Kennedy Jr on the subjecdt of bitcoin, mining etc..",

Yes, although each different venue has a different perspective and approach to crypto, and this can create a fragmented regulatory landscape. I personally see The success of the crypto industry will depend on finding the right balance between innovation and regulation, I mean the government is not undermining the potential benefits of crypto through overly strict policies to bring about positive change and continuing to push for more inclusive regulation and framework going forward.",
