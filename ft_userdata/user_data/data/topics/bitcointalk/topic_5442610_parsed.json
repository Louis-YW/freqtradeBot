      "body": "I still can't decide how well these might do (even for the trials) and if they'll ever be released normally. I guess there's similarities between so many countries having their own fiat system and it should be a safer method of exchange than fiat (but less safe compared with banking) just looking at the potential for counterfeits to cause a problem. It also seems weird that 6-12 months ago there were lots of complaints about cryptocurrency being bad for the environment and now a bunch of countries are trying to launch their own unnecessary version of what already exists - also it feels like it'll be EVM compatible because that's either what the devs like or because they can (although maybe there's an NFT plan there, or a tornado cash one for the banks ).",

I wrote about this in September 2019https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5198245There are a lot of programmers for this ecosystem, so they did the right thing by choosing this platform. In Russia, Sberbank also promises to launch its products on the Ethereum blockchain, I will see how it will work. Even if Japanese banks have separate ecosystems, due to interoperability, they can be connected to the Ethereum Ecosystem through bridges.https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russias-sberbank-launch-defi-platform-coming-months-interfax-2023-02-03/",

Usually countries do prefer to use their own private blockchain 5o issue digital currencies. But this will be the first time a public blockchain will be used to hold a national digital currency. That is certainly going to give a huge trust boost to ETH ecosystem. It will be interesting to see how the pilot works!",

But since the algorithms are the same, these blockchains can be easily connected. More information will come after citizens can test the stablecoins. But this year there will be a lot of similar information from many countries.",

I mean, the assumed use case of the pilot project and probably future implementation of this digital Yen are including but are not limited to:- Payment networks for individuals and businesses like SWIFT network- Any online payment that charges fiat from your credit card- Digital stable coins issuance- etc.At the very least, this pilot might serve as a basis for the central CBDC. I can't imagine how troublesome it would be if they have many chains with different kinds of digital coins being issued by different parties. Unless they can converse one token to another in an instant or build a proper bridge that has good security, the risk of hacking and so on is too high IMO. Building a private chain is understandable to avoid unnecessary exposure, let's see how they handle international transfer though. I doubt other governments would agree to store their yen reserve on a chain owned by a single entity.[1] https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000019.000083257.html",

Until I see the open testing of the platform, I have no understanding of how this ecosystem works.So far, I have dozens of questions, but there are no answers to them either on the official website of Sberbank or on the Internet. From May 1 to May 9, holidays in Russia and most companies do not work. I'm sure we won't see anything before May 10th.",
