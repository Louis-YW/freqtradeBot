Bonk has gained alot and if you are wanting to invest to any of them, you are surveying on which is a good one. It is likely that you will get some advises exactly from the ones who has invested on them already.Anyway, for me the most gain that I have seen is with bonk these past few days. I haven't check the others though.",

If it's VeChain then I don't think there's much need to compare because of course I'm not a person who likes to exaggerate fomo with memes so a Crypto that operates at its core will always receive support, that is my personal opinion.But going back to BONK and AIDOGE, both of them are getting a lot of attention, especially BONK about the things surrounding SOL. But if we look at AIDOGE, I also think that its supporters will have a way to fomo the upcoming process with Arbitrum.",

I don't think anyone will gives big profit like Shiba Inu or doge because tokens already get suitable marketcap. As for AIdoge I think it is not more interested while I don't know about VET.",

      "body": "I wouldn't be going with BONK as investing into these coins is like investing into it just by assuming one day if these gets listed on Binance exchange then we may get huge profit and I have decided to stay away from meme coins and AIDOGE is not on my list now as I feel it has been overbought and may go down anytime. I would prefer VET (Vechain) if I have to choose between these as there are higher possibilities of this coin being revived as it was one of the top altcoins during the previous bull run. But unfortunately couldn't capitalize the market. I feel it has possibilities though not my preferred coin but out of three coins you have mentioned I would choose VET.",

You trying to find out whether your judgement was correct or not. If it was me then I would not invest any of the three. The reason being that adding AI before Dodge doesn't make it similar to to the famous memecoin. VET has been in existence for a long time now and I don't think it has the potential to pump just like NEO. Bonk, I am unaware about it and won't look into a new project before halving. I would wait till halving is completed and then check the market for new coins and trends.",

Meme coins are not much interested but the token like Shiba inu and doge performed well thats why people alter their mind according to situations.BONK and AIdoge are a good candidates and in coming Bull season they will pump but I think BONK will be more profitable than AIdoge. the main reason behind the better activity and increase desire of holders for BONK token is that it is formed on the basis of Solana therefore in my opinion BONK is more better meme coins among all these coins.",

VET is what I would consider as an investment.I did check both of them and VET's overall performance in the market using coinmarketcap.com. Investing in VET is a big blunder as the last time it reached a high was in 2021 of a few cents. I do not understand why anyone would be interested in buying this coin. The developers have done nothing with it and so the investors are doing, as they are waiting to get out.Bonks made a comeback as Solana did it for itself, without the Solana blockchain it would not have made a comeback. It is still very down from its original position in USD and this is just a short comeback as coins like it have a big market supply. Coming back to what OP asked, I feel it is not a good project to invest for now. Wait and watch the trend. I do not like AIDoge as the name suggests it is a pump and dump coin without any practical reasoning to support it. I won't be investing in any of the three coins that you have listed.",

The speculation is to push it to 10b mcap and I don't want to miss out on that even though I entered a bit late, I have made some profit already. I know someone who invested $5 on bonk and so far has turned to $100+ My point is, meme can be a good way of making profits if you find the right one to invest a small amount on.",

Are you expecting the developers to create hype so this coin could pump? That is dumb since price is beyond their control. I would sell immediately if I see the dev team speculating on price. Their focus should be working on the products that investors would take interest in and I can see them doing that.",

You have many options you can select one of them. These coins are not listed on Binance too. I know this is not compulsory for a good coin to be listed on Binance. But if you still want to invest in these coins so I will recommend to make your own research. Means you should check their developments their team. Their purpose. After this research you think you should invest so you can. Because if you will trust on yourself so you will be succeeded.",

So if they want to play with shitcoin market maybe they should try to invest on newly launch token since this would provably give them more higher chances to earn rather those tokens which already accumulate a huge price rise since provably the next thing will happen to it will be abandoning of the said project since this is common thing happened to those scam projects and their devs will create another token so that they can earn a lot of money again from the hype brought up by meme shitcoin craze happening especially when bull run season is about to happen.",
