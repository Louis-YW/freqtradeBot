If they become deposited then that will be good.",

I doubt they have made any transaction, but in the case they have made the transactions, it's easy to find to their IDs. You can enter your binance deposit address into a block explorer and see all the transactions made to that.

Always, do your own research before using any service. Edit: I just visited the website in question and noticed something really funny. Look at the following image.

I would bet that the person who cheated on you had a very nice profile photo, and what's even worse, in most cases it's not about women at all, but about men playing women.For consolation (if that means anything to you), some people get cheated on for years, and I always remember this case - a man was in a long-distance relationship with an alleged super model from Brazil for 15 years",

I am not going to pound on you when you are down and you got scammed, but I just have to ask really? A dating platform should be about finding a new partner not investment opportunities. In many similar cases, it's usually a sexy Asian girl who finds you cute, interesting, and simply irresistible. So she can't help herself and wants to make you a millionaire so you will love her even more. Sounds like a story for cheap and badly-produced movie.     I hope this lesson teaches you not to trust unknown internet communication and confuse it with someone who wants only the best for you. Did you lose a lot of money?",

Do you mean you saw her and she actually looks like the actress or she i using her picture. If it's the latter, then you will find hundreds if not thousands of profiles on social media platforms using that picture as their main profile picture. Doesn't mean all of them are scammers, some of them are just fans.",
