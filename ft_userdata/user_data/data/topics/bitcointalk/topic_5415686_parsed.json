Could all these be like, a coincidence? Yeah?😄Note: This is not made to BEG-for-MERIT; that was why I refuse to celebrate myself when I became a member cus I wouldn't want anyone to feel I'm begging for merit and that's the LAST THING I'D DO.I didn't wanna call out names in appreciation but, that'll look really 'mean' to them.

I'm making this in form of a rhyme at EVERY SENTENCE END.  something I wrote down ever since I was a jrn member  here is it* some hours in the late 21, I got an  account* was sick all day so I left it some days to  count*  finally I'm back, I've got a price to pay, what's the  amount🤷* it ain't fungible, just sacrificing some time to  mount* took up forums rules , well yeah, I was probably late*  plagiarism and spamming became, but to newbies as a  bait 🎣*  though these rules and getting perma-ban from the forum had something to  relate*  yeah? Each time anyone from any rank got perm-banned, the rest were left to their fate☹️* DT members, driven with static potentials are hunting phishers et spammers, I'd say they deserve kudos and even some more  accolades  👏*  Theymos, the undisputable has overworked himself, day and night, swaying these assholes in a dungeon, sip some  chocolates☕* maybe you'll think I copied this from somewhere? Make your research and you'll realize, she  formulates*  I've done what I know how to do best so if you think I'm merit-begging, check my history or consider it some fucking postulates*  finally, I ranked up, been dreaming of these all day and it means alot to me 🥺*  feel sorry for those that left, the likes of vod, lauda, SATOSHI himself and also my mon-ami😣*  even more sorry for the ones who were lowered six-feet dip, BECKY,HAL, I'm sorry mate,life got two columns,after A you've got a column B😓*  I'm sad and happy at the same time.

Could all these be like, a coincidence? Yeah?😄Three things sayeth thou, congratulations! However, you left out health and life. Without those two, nothing can be achieved.On your rank up, there's no need to panic that anyone would think you want to beg for merit. Feel free doing that at Announce your rank up, merit or any achievements that makes you feel great!. Even if anyone thinks so, you deserve the merit. Don't allow anyone kill your joy.Truly, Nigeria had her independence yesterday. It was a 62nd anniversary that was marked in a low-key. I didn't even feel any impact of it. Did you see that disgraceful parachute landing by our military to mark the event? They couldn't control where they were landing and it was laughable.On your selection into a signature campaign: I hope you know that campaigns come and go. You could be in one today and out of it by next week.By the way, I don't think this post should be in Meta. You can ask the mods to move it to the right section.",

There are many threads here already who are giving merits to those users who are contributing to the community.those rhymes are very lovely.you getting accepted in a campaign isn't called \"being lucky\".try to help for the communityand one day, you will reach Legendary-SheJust tried what you did out of nowhere (impromptu) but congratulations on your new rank .",

Even the voice communication can not be used to detect a feminine or a masculine voice. Cell phone can be tune to any of the voices and communication can go smoothly without interruption.
