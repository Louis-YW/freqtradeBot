      "body": "One option for anonymously exchanging BTC to ETH is to use a decentralized exchange (DEX). These types of exchanges operate on a blockchain and do not require users to create an account or provide personal information. However, the trade-off is that DEXs often have limited liquidity and may not be as user-friendly as centralized exchanges. Another option is to use a centralized exchange that allows users to trade BTC for ETH without requiring identity verification. But before using any exchange platform, it is always a good idea to do your own research and due diligence.",

In this exchange you can use Tor browser, unlike the other decentralized exchange where you can't use Tor browser and they will record your IP address.Bisq is a desktop-based decentralized exchange, it's not a web-based application. Hence, it does not use Tor Browser, it just uses Tor to connect to the networks. Tor Browser is just an overhauled browser with Tor network connectivity by default, the Tor itself are kind-of proxy that can be used in any application.Though, recommending Bisq is a good way for those seeking the utmost privacy. As for looking at the ETH/BTC liquidity pair, refer to: https://bisq.markets/market/eth_btc, there is a plenty of offers that are going on. @OP, you can learn more at https://bisq.network/getting-started/.",

So, the KYC policy might change and get complicated even if you don't use Changenow directly. There have been many negative discussions about Changenow in the past iirc, so anyone interested in using them is recommended to research more about them.Changenow aside, so many of these instant exchanges don't offer their own exchange but connect to other services like Changelly, Changenow, etc. I've seen so many KYC complaints in the past even if the transaction amount is allegedly low.

I agree on you this one. There could be paid videos made to destroy a reputation but at the same time, the opposite is also possible with it that there can be videos and reviews paid to make an exchange or service become better in the eyes of those potential customers.It's never enough to rely to one reviews website and YT isn't really a good place when it's about questioning the reputation of an exchange that you'll use.

I think, another option some exchanges do offer more privacy-focused options, such as using a pseudonym or requiring less personal information to create an account.I would recommend looking into some of the more established exchanges that have a proven track record of reliability and security, such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. It's also worth considering using a peer-to-peer exchange like LocalCryptos, which allows you to trade directly with other individuals without the need for an intermediary process, which may not be as anonymous as you'd like.
