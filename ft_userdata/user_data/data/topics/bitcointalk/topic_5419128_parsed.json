  "content": "Most of the cryptocurrencies listed on the market have experienced large gains in price over the past years. Even during the bear market, some coins have managed to \"pump\" a little in price because of the hype. But that doesn't seem to be the case with LTC, as market prices are relatively the same these days. In the worse cases, LTC's price goes down only to take quite a long time to go back to its previous highs (if it ever does). I don't get why Litecoin is often under the radar of investors and traders alike, when it's one of the oldest cryptocurrencies on the market. The supply is finite (84m coins), and it's still a PoW coin unlike most of the popular \"shitcoins\" (ETH, ADA, BNB) which are PoS. Not only that, but LTC recently adopted a privacy mechanism dubbed \"Mimblewimble\" to help bring anonymity to the Blockchain. Have people forgotten about this coin? It's sad because Litecoin was often proclaimed as \"Silver to Bitcoin's Gold\". With Ethereum becoming less-decentralized after \"The Merge\", it might be possible for a truly-decentralized cryptocurrency like LTC to gain the spotlight once more.What do you think about LTC? Will it die soon? Or will it last? Do you think it'll go sky-high sometime in the future? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

      "body": "Yeah it's forgotten since most people only look for Bitcoin, not Litecoin. Litecoin's development also slow and the Mimblewimble privacy mechanism is seems not really important. It's good to see about privacy improvement, but it's not quite enough since I don't find any trusted Litecoin mixer and DEX that has a good trading volume. Bitcoin already have both of it, so it's easier to use the privacy feature. Some people can directly use Monero to achieve 100% privacy rather than need to use Litecoin to get privacy.",

But that doesn't seem to be the case with LTC, as market prices are relatively the same these days.It really seems like that Litecoin is kind of on the sideline now in the last two years or so. As you already said, at lot has happened in the crypto space in the last two years but Litecoin was not really a part of those crazy movements and developments. The main reason for that in my opinion is the fact, that the biggest trends in the last 2 years were Defi, NFTs, play2earn and the metaverse and all of that stuff is just not possible to create on Litecoin as it does not offer smart contract functionality. It's the same with bitcoin but of course BTC has the big advantage that it basically invented crypto and therefore still is the leading indicator for the whole market.I don't think that Litecoin will die, but i also don't think that it will come back to the top 10 to be honest.",

Depending how you look at it, by transaction volume, active addresses, payments and community activity, #Litecoin is always in the top 2-4. And, Litecoin activity is GROWING!!\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/litecoin",

Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. No, I doubt that it will simply die, it's one of the oldest crypto for all we know and a good little brother for bitcoin. So litecoin is always on the shadow, but nevertheless still enjoy some success and support from the community.Even majority of the gamblers are still using it as far as I know, very fast and who knows, in the next bull run, we might see it as one major coin that will give us a good profit.",

Its not really been forgotten because this is included on top selections among traders. But it just many people pick shitcoins in terms of investment because they see that the money is fast due to high volatility compare to the top one.But for sure once bitcoin pump LTC will pump to since it still got decent volume on exchangers where it listed.",

Some day ago hashrate seems to have updated its record and amounted to 558 TH/s. So there are no problems with new miners in LTC. What is the point of changing something in a working mechanism? GPUs are all unprofitable now and until the market finds a profitable coin, like ETH before, it will continue and LTC can't help with that only bull market can.",

I wouldn't say people forgot the Litecoin and its a lot of better than shitcoins which grown drastically in the recent years but the actual reason could be the Litecoin overshadowed by the hyped coins so new people entering into the market doesn't know it so the potential to grow further from its previous high lacks because there is a lack for investors to know it cause its same like bitcoin so no one is going to boost it like Elon for Doge.",
