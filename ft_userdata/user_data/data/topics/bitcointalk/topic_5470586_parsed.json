      "body": "I’ll recommend you use any cex exchange since you’re still very new to it. There are several that you can buy little amount of bitcoin from and still withdraw without having to undergo KYC verification.Or if you could get someone that you know that wants to sell some of their coin, you can buy from them and that would be more safer. You can still go through this link[1] to learn more and follow the ones that’s more suitable to you.

But then if you are planning to store and keep the coins for a long time, then I would advise that  you would probably move it out and save it in a more secure wallet, maybe a non-custodial wallet like electrum wallet.",
