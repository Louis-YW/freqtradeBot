      "body": "Can you tell us what pool you mine? The pool you are trying to connect to may be unstable or maybe your ISP/router blocking your miner to connect to that pool.I have a few steps that you can try.1. Try to mine on other pools like Viabtc/ckpool solo then test.2. If the first step does not work try to change your miner's DNS to Google/Cloudflare DNS then test.3. Replug or replace the Ethernet cable4. The last step share your kernel logs as suggested above and let us troubleshoot the issue.",
