      "body": "welcome to the forum, I looked at your casino and the first thing I looked for to read was the casino's TOS and I can't find where your casino's TOS is, maybe it's a mistake on my part because I don't see where it is it is. I also saw that your casino has a Curacao license, as I haven't seen your casino's TOS, so I will ask in this thread how KYC will be done in case you have to ask for KYC. When I ask how KYC will be done, I'm referring to whether people are required to do KYC as soon as they create an account at your casino or will people be able to create accounts, deposit and only after they deposit and want to make withdrawals will they be asked for KYC or your Will the casino only ask for KYC in case of any suspicious activity?Something that really caught my attention was this:Can you prove this? So I went to the FIBA website and didn't see your casino in the list of partners.https://www.fiba.basketball/es/equipment-and-venue/official-partnersI was shocked when I saw this in your casino:It's strange to think that casinos with licenses from the Curaçao couldn't hold cockfights, maybe I'm wrong, but in many countries this cockfight is prohibited",
