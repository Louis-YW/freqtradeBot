  "content": "The Bitcoin Puzzle Transactions are due for solvingHello guys! I am currently working on an ambitious solo project. Most of you here should already know about the Bitcoin Puzzle Transactions. More can be read about it here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306983, here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5166284 and here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5218972.I myself first noticed them a few years back, but it wasn't until recently when I got really set on solving them. One thing became awfully clear right away; It's not possible to do alone.That's why I am coming to this forum, to find interested individuals (with strong GPU's  ) to group together and start taking down the puzzles once and for all.So, what's the project I talked about? It's an automated tool to hand out key ranges to people running the program, checking them, and reporting back to the pool. The process will be entirely automated, all the user needs is a strong GPU, Windows, slight knowledge of the command line and NodeJS. The tool builds on BitCrack (huge thank you to all of the lovely people that have created it. More information about BitCrack here https://github.com/brichard19/BitCrack.The project is still in development, but I need early testers to ensure the functionality of the server under load, so that everyone can participate eventually. I have created various resources across the web to follow the project and contribute thoughts, so no matter your preference, you can be involved and follow the progression.The current estimate for a working, testable version is 4-6 weeksWebsite: https://bitcoin-puzzle.comReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPuzzleCom/GitHub: https://github.com/0xIcey/BTC-Puzzle-Pool-Solver-ClientDiscord: https://discord.gg/PDaXWXgSA3Telegram https://t.me/bitcoinpuzzleAll of the backend for validation and storing checked keys is financed out of pocket. Even the smallest of tips greatly helps in keeping everything running!bc1qk9llkc5kc2zzcs03fq8nqtk4hgt6rdjgmafg6e~ Icey",

On VanBitCrakchenS Random there is only a windows executable. Are there any linux capable versions available on Github? What was so special about VanBitCrakcen, what are the main differences to BitCrack and why did you remove those tools from your github ? As far as I know, it was a Windows-only program.But I don't particularly like running these things on Windows, because it keeps asking for auto-updates. Today my work PC running Windows 10 wanted to update to Windows 11, for example.But then again, you're not supposed to open your internet connection when you're solo-solving. Pool solvers are different though - nobody has made a proper (performing & secure) key cracking server... yet.",

Also, I do not put any additional effort into it because KeyHunt-Cuda was/is a better product. VanBitC was different as you could use newer cards, it randomized as quick as the GPU/CPU could change keys...",
