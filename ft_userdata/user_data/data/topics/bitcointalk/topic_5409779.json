      "body": "Trying to put all your points together, I just understand you are trying to talk about BTC Bitcoin as not being money.   First let's understand what money is, \"A currency maintained by a state or other entity which can guarantee its value\". Everyone who is using money understands that it is a hard cash or could be call bank notes. Talking about Bitcoin not being money, am on the opinion that everyone who owns Bitcoin or decides to invest in Bitcoin is already awear that Bitcoin is not bank notes called money. Someone said that Bitcoin was designed as a means of  transferring digital cash in a decentralized manner. Having $50 in your wallet is already a fiat crypto, is either you are converting to hard currency (bank notes) or converting to a Decentralised asset like Bitcoin.",

Btc is not money.It should take a long time for everybody to understand the combination in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a currency with all the characteristics of a currency and a way of payment at the same time. But it's not money in the way as we know it.",

While paper money is real, offline, with a country's signature as a distinguishing feature, BTC however, is more or less like imaginary money that happens to exist in an online space with an address. It is not limited or claimed by specific countries. Anyone with access to digital technology can outright make transactions with monies or BTC, so long it is valid in consent. Our old parents used other means of exchange like the cowries for trading, an upgrade was paper money. The future is already happening because the latest upgrade for exchange universally considered is BTC.",

(if they are just looking for a hassle-free transfer)I am wondering why we call Bitcoin cryptocurrency.  And yet not consider it as money anyway this is to show the difference between money and currencyQuoteCurrency is the promissory note or coin presented in the form of money.

It is an investment, a store of assets and a method of payment, it can be said that Bitcoin is the collection of things that we humans need for today. What Bitcoin is will depend on the purpose of each person's use, you use it to pay for an item, it is also considered a currency, a digital currency, if you use bitcoin to store assets, it is considered a digital store...Bitcoin is very convenient and has many different uses.",

At last, someone who refutes the topic in the OP (everyone else is just rambling about the differences between BTC and paper money).It is foolhardy to think that BTC is not money at this point, because everyone is using it that way. End of story.It doesn't matter how similar/dissimilar it is to existing currencies, the fact that people are using it that way makes it a medium of payment.",

Certainly not. so btc is definitely not money even though btc can be used as a medium of exchange, btc is more appropriate as a digital asset that can be exchanged for money so don't confuse btc with money.Actually, gold was once used as \"money\" especially with 'trading' of 'goods' between different countries or places, but I'm not quite sure if it is still being used at the present. Money is indeed different because it is centralized or simply, it is under a government or 'system' which is primarily for transactions. Bitcoin technically is not money if we would base on the characteristics of a fiat or typical currency. I do consider it more of an asset which I can trade to buy things.  The only reason I guess why cryptos are related to currencies or money is because of its value which is still based with fiat.",

Look at gold, it has been much longer than Bitcoin and it is still calculated in € and $ today. As long as there is fiat, all other values will be based on it. But I also believe that Fiat will not last 20 years like it does today. Inflation is a big problem and it can no longer be solved by raising interest rates or printing new money.",

You can't see radiation, but it can still kills you if there's too much of it, and Google Pay is just digital nothingness on a screen, but it can pay for your groceries.People can use Bitcoin to buy things directly, just not as much as some would want. Also, try coming to Ukraine with dollars and paying with them for anything. You won't be able to because dollars aren't accepted, you'd need to exchange them for local fiat to actually use as money. Same thing will happen in the majority of the world. So what, dollar isn't real now either?",
