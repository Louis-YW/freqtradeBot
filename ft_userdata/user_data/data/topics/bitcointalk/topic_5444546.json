  "content": "The image shows the exchange price between Weimar Republic marks in the hyperinflationary period and gold. As can be seen, the marks ended up losing almost 100% of their value and in comparison the price of gold went into the stratosphere. But the process was not a straight line, rather there were sharp drawdown and a lot of volatility: Quotethat occurred during the hyper-inflationary period. Speculating using leverage got wiped out multiple times.Without stating that we are about to enter a hyperinflationary period, as it means an increase in inflation of at least 50% per month, similarities can be seen in the leverage that ends up being liquidated, and that the loss of value experienced by fiat with respect to bitcoin is far from being a straight line.But if we follow a similar process, as we seem to be doing, the clear winners will be those who hold bitcoin until the end of the process.",

My advice to Bitcoin holders is that they should always be watchful and not let some fantasy cloud their judgment into believing they will be so rich overnight.The coin is now following the due market process, though the holders are safe and will surely earn, not that a historical correlation or belief/theory 'must' make it happen.The market might disappoint big time!",

As can be seen, the marks ended up losing almost 100% of their value and in comparison the price of gold went into the stratosphere. But the process was not a straight line, rather there were sharp drawdown and a lot of volatility: Those charts date back to a previous era of history, when people mined gold from the earth with pickaxes and shovels.The advent of mechanization has dramatically increased mining and production aspects of gold. Substantially increasing the global supply. I believe these upticks in mining technology will lead to a less dramatic and less pronounced price spike. Another major contributing factor is the global economy of today lacking a gold standard. Most people wouldn't know what to do with gold, leading to large decreases in demand. Gold was a more widely supported token of exchange during that time. There was considerably more infrastructure and economic support for gold, than there is now.What we should naturally expect is for the supply of gold to increase, with support and demand for precious metals over the same period of time, declining. These two elements should converge to produce a far less dramatic price spike of gold, if one does actually occur.Another key observation to keep in mind with that chart is that period of time preceding the great depression in 1929. It is possible that the sharp spike in gold supply observed during the 1920s was partially motivated by sharp and savvy investors buying up stockpiles of gold to prepare for the economic downturn of 1929.",

It cannot be brought about to this scale by regular economic downturn, or even by recessions / depressions.Nowadays we have bonds, so a country no longer has to print its own money to meet its debts, they can just sell more bonds to investors.

Remember that anything can happen overnight if you aren't that careful, you'll be swallowed by the currents. As for now also it is still within our imaginations but still we do need to be careful because who knows what will happen? This is crypto we're talking and it's not just another asset or a store of value that most of us traditionally knew.There is also a huge chance that the bubble would pop if those big fishes decides to play around the market, but it's just a possibility coz who would ever want to lose their money right? In regards of the inflation, I know for sure that in the next few months our country would feel the changes. I'm getting this weird feeling that there will be another change somehow.",

Troubled countries, in most serious cases after a devastating war, were forced to pay preparations in a currency they couldn't get ahold of it and were forced to print more and more money to pay that up. Nothing of that scale is happening right now, the only similar example is that of Iran which is doing the same, printing money to buy needed $ but on fall smaller scale, still losing 95% in 6 years but not on those figures.But I love how things change, after 1 year of painful bear markets one huge jump and everyone is again talking about the death of paper money and banks, the bears have left for their dens, it's party time!",

This is where government had been trying to do when BItcoin or crypto market does give out that significant attention and popularity but they do ends up on getting failed due to the fact that it isnt something that could be controlled over or there's no way for it to be confiscated due to anonymous feature or being simply decentralized.About its price, anything could happen and since we dont know on what the future brings then for those who could really hold of their holdings no matter what then we arent sureon what are the numbers ahead.",

After that, the price will slowly decline in preparation for a bear market. There will also be negative news that can come along the way which can affect the recovery of Bitcoin but that won't be completed without a positive news on the side. All of these scenarios will just cycle or repeat and only those who can endure the negativities are the ones who can succeed in this Bitcoin investing game.You're right, inflation can negatively or positively affect Bitcoin. Last time it was high, that is why the price of BTC fell down but I heard they lowered it because some banks are badly affected, and as a result we are now back at $24k something, going to $25k.",

However, let me put a new perspective on it, you are saying it happened in the past, but we have seen a huge inflation during 2020-2022 period as well, maybe not this high, but it was still pretty high and destroyed many peoples economy and finances right? Which means bitcoin was still better option during that period.Secondly you are saying localized, but that means it may happen in your nation too, so why not take some defensive measures and buy bitcoin in case your nation becomes like Venezuela?",
