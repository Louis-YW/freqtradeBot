What he says would make a lot of sense if people valued their privacy highly, if they didn't increasingly pay for digital media from centralised entities around the world, if they didn't post half their lives on social media and so on. But we see that the trend in the world is the opposite and most people don't care about the loss of privacy of CBDCs, they already pay for everything with their smartwatch.",

Unfortunately, they will fail at achieving a digital currency that will challenge Bitcoin. My country launched E-Naira but it failed because people never paid them any attention as there was practically no need for it.

Kiyosaki just made a statement without backing it up with any explanation or probable fact and i wouldn't take anything he said here seriously.[1] https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-bitcoin-will-become-priceless-when-cbdc-enters-market",

We've seen a lot people predict worse on bitcoin yet bitcoin has been waxing stronger.ordinarily CBDC is government controlled and doesn't have that decentralized uniqueness of Bitcoin hence if people drift over to CBDC their financial activities will no be private as it  with bitcoin.Here in Nigeria, government has launched, CBDC coin yet nobody has asked how that coin works or even used it, even among cryptocurrency enthusiast like us. So Robert kiyosaki should take a chill pill.",

In the specific case of the Petro, it was a project which did not have a true decentralized system, it was not actually backed by any oil and the liquidity was very low. For example, here some years ago the government announced and Airdrop of 0,5 PTR for all public workers.A family member of mine wanted to sell it for local currency, back them the value of the Petro was officially 65$ or so. But when I logged on the official government webpage to buy and sell Petros, I could not find anyone interested in buying for the official price, in the end I could only sell it for half of it's value in local currency.In short, it was a failed project from the start, unlike Bitcoin which only gets stronger, the Petro is likely to be put down before we even notice (because how irrelevant it has become)",

Bitcoin is a digital asset, the reason it is called an asset is that it has a limited number of amount. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed on paper at will, and their amount or number can be increases day by day. And Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is the digital governing body of those fiat currencies or the digital format of those fiat currencies.

Like how CBDC affects the price of bitcoin. There is no comparison between CBDC and Bitcoin. CBDCs are governmental and are centralized and hold the people by limiting their freedom while bitcoin gives them the freedom of their finance, The CBDC will be supported by the govt and take ownership of people's finance while bitcoin give them the ownership of their own assets. So how people will choose CBD instead of Bitcoin? Ita just a pridiction boys and pridiction sometimes happens and most of the time not. He made a lot of predictions but no one of them happened.
