Your first site listed is stake.bet, but the original one is https://stake.com. Can you explain why it is so?",

If I remember correctly, the last service that offered this kind of affiliate bonus also stated that they do have some kind of deal with Stake, and that their rakeback and commission is also higher than most people, but they weren't able to provide exactly how were they able to get that kind of numbers. Maybe you could explain to us how and why you get that dealfrom Stake.",

The Rakeback of the casinos is different than the Rakeback i offer. They still can get the offers or vip offers of the casinos or Rakeback but different than what i offer. Again If you search Rakeback rebate Cashback in Google you will understand It's not that I'm not trying to answer but the questions so basicAns so far all people who asked those basic questions are spammers maybe they get paid per post. I won't explain basic information again sorry if you interested customer I might but seems another signature spam .My service for serious people not for spammers. I feel I got attacked by spammers I light report them directly to whoever pay them to spam. I have a question do you get paid to spread your signature or not ? I answered your questions right ?Can you answer this simple question? Maybe you cannot answer but Anyway I won't answer spammers or signature scam Welcome serious people.",

But if it is one time payment, I do not think OP is right. I do not have to think twice, I will avoid this, but if the site links are legit, people trying it also will not lose, but I will prefer to use the official site, or people should be very sure they are not directed to a scam site.",
