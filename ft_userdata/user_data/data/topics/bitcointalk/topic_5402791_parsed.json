Because according to this article, One of the well-known and popular beer makers Budweiser has partnered with ZED Run to deploy a Clydesdale draft horse in the world of virtual NFT-based horse racing and wagering games.- Will it help attract even more gamblers like the Budeweisers & Zed Run will do?How much capital did Budweisers spend on NFT (Non-Fungible Token)?Answer:- QuoteThe latest move from Budweiser adds to the $120,000 it spent on nonfungible token fan art and the beer.eth domain name it purchased via the Ethereum Name Service in August 2021.Reference: https://cointelegraph.com/news/budweiser-uses-120k-to-purchase-fan-art-nft-and-beer-eth-domainWhat is Budweiser Clydesdales?Answer: QuoteThe Budweiser Clydesdales are a well-known group of horses used for company promos and commercials, with the beer makers being a major sponsor of horse racing events across the globe.- Since that the budweisers will gonna have a total of 2500 PASS NFT, where each price was 225$ plus the gas fees, and they're also going to have a Racing challenge at July-Sptember with a price pool of 45k$ and for the tournament is 95k$ this coming December and Airdropped as well to their holders.

I read the news, it was as old as 25th of August 2021, 2022 is almost gone half way and this type of news should be what is trendy. Even if Budweiser NFT is even trendy, that is still an old news which may not contain better accurate information again. Although, if I wshoikd have to contribute, NFTs are just digital tokens that are non fungible just as Bill Gates recently said they are not worth what people are thinking they are worth of, though companies see it as a means to advertise more about their product and to design new NFTs to make profit and nothing more.",

Everybody's going for NFTs since the big entertainments businesses are already in this direction. UFC has NFTs, NBA has its NFTs too, just a lay up view of someone popular can be an expensive NFT.

If you guess the one that will be worth a lot it will be like winning the lottery but chances are you will lose your money. In this type of NFTs may have more future because if buying a NFT of an NBA team for example, gives you discounts for games, preferential tickets, etc. will have a certain demand because it has a clear utility.",

There hypes are rare these days, so their arrival is going to be more noticeable than if they launch during the bull.It's only a win-win situation for both (budweiser and nft) but not really in the crypto market as a whole but idk maybe investors will also find out cryptocurrencies later on?
