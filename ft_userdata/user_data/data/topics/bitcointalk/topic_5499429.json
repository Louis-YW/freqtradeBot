  "content": "Hello,Seing the difficulty for solving Puzzle 66, I'm thinking about joining a pool.I came across this one https://btcpuzzle.info/ that seems serious. They clame they've checked already >10% of the range for Puzzle 66.Here are some statistics : - They devided the search range into 33,554,400 parts- 1 range a time is assigned to someone- Each range has 1,1 trillion keys- The price is 5$ to check 350 ranges in three days. - with this, the average speed of the pool is 24756 ranges in 24 hours- This means there are 2 years left to solve Puzzle 66It could be very reasonnable to do it if and only if they are :1) trustworthy --> I have no idea2) fast enough 3) much better than other pools --> does someone have any names ?My thinking is that if the pool has chances to win, it's not a lottery but an investment because the gains will be distributed proportionally to one's contribution. So even 1$ would be worth it !Thanks in advance for providing any feedback.",
