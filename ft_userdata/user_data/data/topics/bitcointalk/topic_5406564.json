I looked at a few browsers and was able to see it when using Microsoft Edge.  It is pretty annoying on that browser, I will admit.  I've never seen anything like this before on the forum, but I'm typically using Safari or Firefox.  I don't think the OP has a problem (other than using Microsoft Edge for a browser) and it seems like this is normal.  Can anyone else confirm they see this using Microsoft Edge?  I'd hate to think that I also have a problem.",

If we simply view it as it is, nothing is bad and annoying. It is only random thing. Combine of random things can not make annoying things.{($()&~ is random combination and not annoying but why {()} or 0U0 is annoying. I don't be creative with this combination. I saw it on forum and I did not feel bad. Icon or word, it is not annoying if we don't use it with bad intention.",

So it's actually really annoying because it's overlapping, but it's good that it's been removed now. So, the OP can now lock this thread as the question was already resolved by the mod by deleting the topic. Next time just report a thread like that instead of making a thread like this because I'm sure the mod will take action if it's annoying. Besides, you should also change the title of this thread because the code or symbols you use are just as annoying.",
