The only problem is if they only have a few units to mine it won't be enough to find and mine a block faster.It needs a huge mining power to be able to solve a block faster and confirm transactions. @OP the chances of finding someone here who mines solo are very slim. Most of the small miners nowadays are mining directly to a mining pool which is why you can only request to prioritize your transaction to a mining pool operator like the one mentioned above (Viabtc).",

Well, Actually, they can even if they were not solo mining but using Stratum V2, which has a protocol called \"Job selection\", The pool only sends the prevhash to the miners while the miners prepare the transactions they want to include beforehand, of course, this has to go into a negotiation process before the template is approved by the pool (to check if the transaction included are valid), but it's there, and I think it's only a matter of time before some large pools start using it.",

But that can be done only by the sender. If OP has control over the receiving address, he/she can do CPFP. Otherwise, the only way to accelerate the transaction is to pay a mining pool, so that they prioritize the transaction.",

If I send to you with a low fee and then for whatever reason stop responding you have to wait.You can do a CPFP if you have control of the receiving wallet and it allows for spending unconfirmed TX, otherwise you have to import the private key.All well and good for people that know and care. But if you are not a person that regularly uses BTC and just wound up having some sent to you, then it's a different story.It was the OPs 1st and only post. RPF / CPFP and so on can take a bit to understand. Pay someone (pool) to do something (mine transaction) is simple.-Dave",

As he said \"It doesn't have RBF enabled\"So I pointed out the obvious that now all transactions 'can' be RBF'd.So while it may or may not be possible for him to have the transaction RBF'd by the sender,he has stated the term RBF in the opening post ...If he has no control over it and was intelligent enough to say \"RBF\" in the opening post, then doing a Child Pays for Parent is the other option.Assuming he's ignorant of what RBF/etc are seems a silly thing to do when he's used the term in his opening post.",
