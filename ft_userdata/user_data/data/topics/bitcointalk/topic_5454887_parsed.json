He won't be doing it to destroy the West. He will be doing it to warn them so they can turn from their wicked ways and be saved.Note that there are many people in the West that are God's people and don't want anything to do with stuff like LGBT. God will protect them when the West falls.State Duma proposes legislation to officially ban gender alteration procedures in Russiahttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-06-01-russia-proposes-legislation-to-ban-gender-alteration.htmlRussian lawmakers are proposing a new bill that would officially ban doctors from performing surgeries that would alter people’s primary or even secondary gender characteristics.According to the state-run news agency TASS, medical workers would be prevented under the legislation from performing medical interventions designed to change the sex of a person except if the procedure would be to treat congenital anomalies in children.“Medical interventions are only possible to treat birth abnormalities in children upon a decision from a medical commission of a federal state-run public health institution. The list of such institutions and the procedure for issuing such decisions will be approved by the government,” the bill stated. It was initiated by Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, also known as the Lower House of Parliament.It would also be made illegal to alter identifying legal documents such as passports on the basis of “gender-affirmation certificates” issued by doctors or any medical organizations. As per the current law, public records offices can change personal documents on the basis of a medical certificate of gender reassignment.Justice Minister Konstantin Chuichenko earlier said that a ban on changing gender in passports and other documents would be one of the first steps to enshrine family values into national law.This most recent measure matches with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s repeated speech emphasizing how he would fight against what he’s described as “Western attempts to push non-traditional lifestyles including LGBT ideology on the Russian public.”Russia has already strong laws that are intended particularly to protect children against the massive and prevalent LGBTQ propaganda. In fact, last December, Putin signed into law a bill that made it illegal to publicly promote same-sex relationships, or to present non-heterosexual orientations as “normal.”...",
