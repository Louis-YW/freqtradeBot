Trust systems are quite subjective, but in general we can recognize patterns of potential fraud especially those that don't meet the forum's standard requirements on collateral. Therefore a negative score is given early as a warning to other users. After all, the final decision rests with the prospective client.Stay careful.",

I live there, and a judicial investigation will be opened against you if your account receives a transfer of a large amount related to cryptocurrencies, and some of them fall into money laundering crimes, so unless you have a license, dealing with such people may expose you to legal problems.There are approved exchanges and you can conduct peer-to-peer trading on binance",

This simply shows that you can't be trusted while dealing with you. So anyone negotiating a business deal is at his own risk and forum are not liable for any lost at cost of this business.",
