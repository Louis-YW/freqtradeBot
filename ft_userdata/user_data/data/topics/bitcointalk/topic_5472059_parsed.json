  "content": "When I was looking for my first asic besides the S9 which was not only profitable but it was relatively cheap and you could use braiins os to modify they fan speed for noise reduction the antminer B series was cheap and the profit was sky high but I got the S9. Now looking at the coin bytom which is mined using tensority there is nothing I couldn't find what happened to it anywhere when just a few years ago the profits could set a family for life with a few miners.",

      "body": "I haven’t seen such cases for a long time when several ASICs could give a big profit.If you mined Bitcoin or Ethereum on the first ASICs and did not sell coins for a very long time, then this is possible, but now the opposite situation may happen.Why make a new coin for mining on existing ASICs?It’s better to make a coin using a new algorithm, and then start selling ASICs for its mining, as in the story with Kaspa.",

      "body": "I don't remember the profit ever being sky high with the B3.  If I recall correctly, shortly after they released the asic miner someone wrote a GPU miner and a single nvidia gpu had a higher hashrate than the asic.  It was an immediate doorstop.",
