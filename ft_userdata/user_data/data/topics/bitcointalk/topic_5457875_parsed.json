I didn't know what to do. I tried to contact with them. I called by their phone numbers and introduced my issue, then I got an advice to wend the screenshot of my transaction and mention the order number. I did this via email and also contacted them by chat. After a minute i Got an answer they tryin to solve my issue. so they identify my transaction by that details like order number and transaction details which was dipsplayed on my crypto wallet  transaction history. Then they asked me if its better to get my extra payment by Ethereum or USdt. I preffered to get with USDt and after sending my USDT TRC20 address to them I got an email notification. The email meesage informed me that My identificaiton  was managed and I got my 0,04 Eth to my wallet. The customer support was so helpful.",

I don't know if there's currently a running bounty for this exchange but that's not a good incentive if you've got any of those. And I think that you need to go through again with your label. Because these days, whoever is saying that they're legit and safe, it's the opposite thought that's coming to everyone. Well, I am not saying anything against your exchange because I want to see a lot of it compete so that we as users got a lot of choices.",
