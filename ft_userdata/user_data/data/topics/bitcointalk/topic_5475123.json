What could be the problem??AFAIK, 14 days of unconfirmed transactions will eventually drop the transaction to the mempool.If this does not push through might you wait because it will back to the sender which puts a risk for both sides parties including your reputation as a seller.There's nothing you can do as of now because you've used an auto service which I think they are partnered with a custodial exchange so you can't increase the fee.  Next time always check the network status before making any transaction towards Bitcoin.Here is the link on how to know the Bitcoin transaction status, https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,fee.",

But it still somewhat that fee rate (in sat/vbyte) is proportional to a dollar based fee value, the higher the number in fee rate (in sat/vbyte) is higher cost im dollar. But of course, higher the fees are much more prioritize.",

It sucks as a service, they would provide a better service.But their answer about Bitcoin network congestion is true.

In CPFP method, you can spend the fund received in the unconfirmed transaction in a new transaction with high fee, so that miners include both transactions in the same block. I don't know how much you received in the unconfirmed transaction. So, maybe it's not worth to use CPFP. As mentioned above by BitMaxz, you may be able to use ViaBTC free accelerator too. If you can't/don't want to use CPFP and you can't use ViaBTC free accelerator, I recommend you to export the raw transaction, so that you are able to rebroadcast the transaction by yourself, if it's purged.

What could be the problem??There is no choice bro, you need to wait, there is congestion in the network and depending on the fee size used, you might be waiting a month or months. Such happened to me the last time a thing like this happened around June/July if am correct, I had to wait more than a month before I received my money. In layman's language, the transaction fee rose to almost $20 at that time, something that was about $0.03 a month before then. A similar event is happening again.You might try to read more about the Bitcoin network fee to get yourself acquainted with it. And good use of \"mempool.space\" is another one to educate yourself about this.Also, you might want to ask for the transaction ID if it was sent individually, and if the fee is about 18 sat/vb (around $0.9+) or more, you can use a free service of ViaBTC (https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator) to accelerate it.",

Make sure your wallet support this feature.-Request to resend the same amount using another network.- Wait for the network to come back to normal.",
