  "content": "Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone had some advice on what to use to re-seal a small section of my dashboard. I believe this is a commonplace it has worn when \"attempting\" to remove power sockets. I have accidentally exposed copper that lays between the pads of the PCIE connectors. This is sure to shorten upon plugging it in as the pads are now touching.Could anyone please point me in the right direct for the green material that's put on PCBs? I'm hoping someone carried out some form of repair similar to what am trying to do. I'm very insure if just any resin or PCB paint with prevent the shorting/bridging.Thanks, guys",

I use it in jobs to protect copper, secure tiny wires, etc, but you need UV light to cure it (make it hard) and not only any UV light. I needs to be UV light under 395nm wave length. If you go longer wave length, chance is that it won't cure properly! I'm saying this because I tried to make my own UV flash light out of UV leds from china, but it went wrong because I chose 405nm (iirc) and I tried to cure solder masks and they didn't got hard!If you show some pics, maybe we can suggest other ways to secure your connections. I'm not sure I understood correctly, but there are small pads to fix damaged pads in PCBs. Let me see if I can find them and then you (I mean the OP) can see if those fit/fix the problem!Check if these can help fixing your pads:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005349724542.htmlhttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003684322155.html",

      "body": "Thanks for that, ill be sure to avoid using that UV stuff because I'm trying to keep costs to a minimum. I don't have a smartphone or access to a camera, but I made a brief diagram as to what's going on with my board. I understand the photo in question isn't an S9 but it was the best image I could find to demonstrate my problems with - https://yourimageshare.com/ib/reQSt7Dd4kJust for more clarity, the red squares are exposed copper with solder on, I can't remove the solder even with a soldering wick or pump. In the purple square the circular copper hole you insert the power plugs too, one ring is missing. I think I can see from the products you share, that the pads consist of 3 of these holes and must be laid underneath the green stuff. I thought they were singular pin holes! so your already helping",
