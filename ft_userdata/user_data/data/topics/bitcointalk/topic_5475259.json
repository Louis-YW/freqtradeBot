I vividly recall the November 2022 FTX crisis when Bitcoin's price plummeted, critics predicted its demise, and the media celebrated prematurely. Those who celebrated during the crash are those who are anti-bitcoin, on the other hand, smart investors took advantage of that collapse to fatten their wallet. And as I have said previously, we are now 100% in profit in just 12 months. So other assets can give us that huge profit for just holding and buying at that lowest low.Quote from: Kensure on November 23, 2023, 10:00:30 PMYet, none of this affected Bitcoin holders.They held firm and even increased their holdings over the next year.

I mean why would this many people, would hold this much bitcoin, if they didn't think that it would go up a lot. I think it's quite crucial information because it also proves that we are going to have what we think we will. I mean I think it will go up a lot in the next year, maybe even for two years, and I do not have any data to back that up, it may not go up too, we do not know.However, at least I can show this data and say that there are plenty of people like me who expect the same thing as well, that's a good benefit because if I am wrong then a lot of people are wrong too, and if I am right then we all did the right thing.

Besides, I remember what CZ said after the FTX crash more or less: \"Your keys your coins\".

So many bitcoiners don't want to fall victim to another FTX scandal type. Another reason for this occurrence is that nobody wants to be the pizza guy by selling their bitcoins too early.  The result of which the OP has already said, an increase in the number of Bitcoins not moving. We expect a bull run and also expect that the price may be between 80k - 100k therefore nobody wants to sell at 37k now when they could sell at 80k -100k then.",
