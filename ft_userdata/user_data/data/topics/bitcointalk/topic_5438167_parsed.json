      "body": "I wouldn't call that a good way to choose any project, least of all the ones you have in mind. A partnership with someone respectable can give a certain importance to a project, but if you look at who the big scammer projects like Kwon&Bankman were in partnership with, then some things can be much clearer.In addition, each project can claim to be in partnership with someone, but this can only be a simple deception that lasts long enough for the scammers to achieve their goal. Don't blindly believe anything, research and verify every piece of information because that's the only way you can prevent yourself from falling into a trap.",

One scam report should be enough to make you leave though (unless you really have to it's not worth the risk).",

Partnerships with reputable establishments is a plus, but not a determinant of a good project.Quote from: Peasant Wright on February 05, 2023, 11:44:12 AMDo partnerships means the project can easily become successful? No. The only determinant of the success of a project is it's utility in day to day life. You can surmise that if a reputable company is willing to associate with a particular project, then they have seen prospects in it, but that doesn't mean it's going to be successful.",

Do partnerships means the project can easily become successful? Basically the success or failure of a new project really depends on the efforts of the creator of the project itself. Because partnerships that are willing to work with the project, of course, there are reciprocal rewards that they can get, so even a large number of partnerships cannot guarantee that a project can succeed so easily.Because the project team itself needs to carry out its own roadmap according to the time target they set in order to be successful, because without any effort from their own side, of course, success will be difficult for them to get even though they can have a little help from their partners. Many good partners are certainly better for new projects because projects can be recognized by many people more quickly, but the project still has to find more investors who want to get involved in it for the smooth running of them in terms of launching the product they want.",

      "body": "I assume by \"journey\" you mean trying to find low market cap tokens/coins and buy them so you can profit when they do a 10x or 100x at the next bull run.A partnership is definitely a nice thing to have, but that should not be the only factor that you consider. I'd argue that focusing only on one part is not going to help you find which projects you should follow. For example, one of the projects that I like (the idea is good, but they don't have any marketing) suffers a lot in recent months. They do have some partnerships with established projects, but that didn't help them at all. On the other hand, you can argue that Doge doesn't have any \"partnership\" but because their presence in the market is well-known, it allows you to get decent profits (at least in the last bull run).There are many things you can consider. Other than what has been said above, I believe you can also use these factors to decide which projects you want to follow:- The team (whether they have a track record of doing business before, are their words reliable, are they transparent enough etc)- The community that follows them (is there a pump & dump channel that promotes them heavily, which can be a sign of short-lived hype etc, is their social media/marketing very active, etc)- The tech/product that they sell (do you see them as useful or not, is there any competitor on the market, do you think they can compete with established competitors or not, etc)- Their financial leeway (do they always ask for funding, does their main funding comes from selling tokens that can be quite a problem for their community/token holders, etc)- etc.At the end of the day, don't forget about luck. Sometimes just being at the right time at the right place, you can make a decent profit. Or just stick with Bitcoin and stack sats every month if you don't like gambling with your money.",

Do partnerships means the project can easily become successful? Partnership is fine for determining project success, but I don't think it's very reliable. How long a project has been in the market and occupying space among others is a better example to look at when you want to invest. A project with a competitive advantage amongst others is a good one to bargain for in the market.",

Research really has to be carried out thoroughly to find out how the quality of the project is and whether the partnership listed is genuine and whether the partnership process is actually established.

Projects that have been successful are based on upgrading existing successful projects.  I don't think whitepaper is going to prove whether a project will be successful or not although you can use it to get some red flag for the project like if the whitepaper is plagarised or not. But analysing a project to try to determine how well it will do doesn't always produce result. If you check most projects that are doing fairly well now you'll see that they don't even have a well structured whitepaper and if eventually they do, you'll see that they sometimes tend not to follow what's written there like for example their roadmap.",

Do partnerships means the project can easily become successful? Partnership is only one of many contributors to success of a project. It is a kind of external contributor and not as same important as internal contributors. A project can see chance to succeed if its internal components are good enough. Then external contributors like partnership can help to boost it.You can think of partnership like relations between Bitcoin and Bitcoin accepted companies. Bitcoin has achieved great success since 2009 but not all companies that accepted Bitcoin had success.Success of a project can not only come from its venture capital partners which are kind of partnerships too.",
