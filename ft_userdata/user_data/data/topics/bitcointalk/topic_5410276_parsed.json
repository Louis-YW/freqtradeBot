The token has been dropped from an all time high of $0.40 to $0.003, but it seems to be a solid project - experienced team, external funding, doxxed team, defi platform, roadmap that's being worked on.I don't understand why the token is so low - is the defi platform never going to make any money?Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.",

Being low as an unknown coin in this market is quite normal, and seems like they launched right when bear started so it's understandable. And could take a while until this gets confidence to rise.

If the OP wants to keep up with the project and assess its potential, he needs to follow the social media channels of this project.In that manner, he will understand more why the price is down and if there is hope that it will go up again.One can't understand the project if he is not familiar with the project itself. So for the OP to understand better this project, he needs to study and do more research. He can also get good insights from the discussion in their social media channels.",

I've been looking through their telegram and it's quite active but no clues as to why the token has dumped so much. I'm going through the discord now (also very active) to see if I can find any hints.",

Promotion is important, but if the product is good the token should go up in price, right?",

I'm researching now, will come back to this thread if I find something. I'm really Â    because the market is saying that this token is basically worthless, but when I dig into the project it looks like it has promise. Maybe not the $0.40 ATH but it's got to be worth more than its current price - sure at least $0.01 or something??? On that basis I threw a couple of bucks at it last night. Unless it's a complete scam??? If anyone has any insights please post here!",

Even this time the price is still going down. You can take your own conclusion. Don't be so mad because this is obvious scam token. I said in the first post that price had gone down hard. I said it could be a scam, which is why I was asking for people's thoughts. But there could be other reasons why the price had gone down - the bear market is a factor, and in the discord someone said that single sided staking at 70% APR caused selling but that's been ended. Is that the reason? I don't know, I'm hoping smarter people will weigh in.I'm thinking about it like this - there's a 90% chance that this could go to zero (scam, no product fit, product doesn't work). If that happens I've lost $100. There's a 10% chance that this could go to $0.01 - if that happens I've made $3100. I think it's a good investment.",

Oh well, it might be cause of the recent bear because even the solid projects like eth and btc do also experience the same thing. Something about the team and the roadmap can be faked easily. So, it's not enough to convince a wise investor if that's the only thing that they are going to show.Also you forgot to describe if what was the project all about? You only mentioned that it is defi but my guess is it's some kind of a lending platform? Dunno why but that was the first thing that pop in my head. Maybe because of that word finance in its name.

You can spot scams usually from lack of transparency and blaming anyone but people themselves. Some times obviously community reacts by selling it to the ground but if you can't see any good reason for it to be scam, it could be either the fact people are slowly accumulating, no one wants to shill a project that they don't have pockets full. Or the fact is that thay project isn't needed, which is the major reason. Normal people just don't see that because they can't read the code or compare it to competition.",
