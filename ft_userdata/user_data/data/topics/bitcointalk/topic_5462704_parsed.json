If you want to increase the position size in copy trading you should also make that your balance is enough to cover up the fees and the positions, so it's good to have more balance in your account to make sure that your trade will be running smoothly.When you copy trade, it's recommended to follow the leverage of the master trader because they calculated it very well. Don't rush things because most of the time it will just lose your money. Better to stay calm and be disciplined, use only a small leverage.",

      "body": "I think the problem is simple and you've got insufficient funds to do that. Even if you only need $10 for a $100 leverage then there's probably a bit of additional funds needed.I don't trade there but that's most likely the problem that you're encountering right now as when someone trades, there's always a fee on the move for each trade we make whether it's leverage or not.But if not and for your peace of mind, do as what logfile said of contacting their support.",

You need to understand that there is cap on the amount of leverage you can open. While there is low leverage of 3x(i.e. you can borrow up to 3 times the amount of your balance) and there is 10x(i.e be able to borrow up to 10 times of your balance) in margin trading, these options depend on the exchange. The coins that are available for margin trading are always indicated in the list of coins that are available for trading.With your balance of $10 dollars, if the coin you want to trade has a leverage up to 10x, you should be able to borrow up to $100 to trade and if the exchange doesn't have up to that, you can't borrow up to that amount, you have to lower it to the max they offered in the exchange to be able to leverage that coin/token.",

Hmm, I use to say that copy trading and trading on leverage suck for a newbie especially. I want you to know buddy as you don't even know the basics of an exchange for the copy trade and leverage.

This means that your margin per trade (which is the amount you're putting in) is too big compared to your account balance ($10). So, they're basically saying, \"Hold up! You need to have more money in your account to copy this trade.\" So as a solution i think is to just deposit or transfer more money into your account. In that way, you'll have enough funds to cover the trade, and you won't get the red flag or risk warnings from the platform.",
