      "body": "To be honest it's pretty hard to give an objective and valid opinion with only one twitter link as reference to the project.Could you tell us more? What will give value to the project? Which added value concretely?How much NFTs will you mint in total?/After that, I might be concerned about your middle fingers Â . I have nothing against cryptos, on the contrary, and I have nothing against NFTs. I don't like Ordinals and what they do, and from a personal point of view, I keep hoping that it's just a collective fad, and that once the users involved get tired of it, we'll be able to get back to normal fee transactions on a regular basis. I'm not opposed to it, because everyone does what they want with blockchain : we all agree that as long as it's possible, it's doable. I just don't think that everything that is doable should necessarily be done.",

Agree with you.I like the OP's idea, but for it to be Bitcoin's middle finger in the air pointing to NFTs. The purpose of the project would be to keep NFT away from the Bitcoin blockchain. They were doing just fine on the Ethereum or Polygon networks, there is no reason to make the Bitcoin blockchain more difficult.",

The added value is mainly the big joke of the middle finger inscribed in the blockchain and \"art\" creation like most of the NFTs.We have 204 ordinals ready to be minted!Not 10 000 like some projects, which I can understand isn't really appreciable for the transaction fee...",

Twitter has only 100 follower and no partnership and big name so that attract the btc nft lovers to mint NFT. Project team should do some extra hard work to attract minters because still there no nft minted yet. You can see pepe NFT project which has big demand and best idea and many new NFTS has been airdropped to Pepe nft holder.NFt is not free and its minting fee is 142 approximately which is big and no one will rake risk to mint it. I will suggest to start some artwork or other contest and give some NFT totally free to winners. This will bring community as well as loyal users who will promote it",
