Quote from: SFR10 on October 29, 2022, 05:38:28 PMe.g. I just got the following results when I looked for similar websites!I noticed that whenever someone report a scam website you quickly find all the websites which use the same template (I also noticed this on the gambling section when a new casino with some other members). Sorry for asking but am curious to know how do you do that? Do you search for some specific keywords you take from the website or is there a search engine that searches for websites which are using the same template? (sorry if this sounds stupid.)",

For more details about this site, please provide information to users. When I try to reach the foxcoinby.com domain, I can see that it has just been opened.I'm sure you're not the first victim they're after, maybe there were some others who were disappointed using the Foxcoinby.com exchange site, like the quote above....I'm sure if crypto users are a little careful and want to try checking reviews on the exchange site they want, of course there's a high chance that they will avoid cases of fraud and so on.",

(sorry if this sounds stupid.)It's a combination of a few things... Sometimes you get lucky with just a few keywords but for the most part, I look for similar images + plagiarized content.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on October 30, 2022, 07:32:07 PMIt's a large scam operation if the same scammer's using the sites you've caught. If they're using the same code they're connected.Some of them probably belong to a single scammer [e.g. both \"clowbitc\" and \"bitcexmo\" were registered on the same date while using the same registrar], but there are also some marketplaces that sell such themes/templates and that leads to multiple scammers using the same code [unfortunately].",
