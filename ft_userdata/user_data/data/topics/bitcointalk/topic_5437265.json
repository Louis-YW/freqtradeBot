The downside is that these services are paid you need to pay a certain fee or %. Second option is a free service for example from blockchain.com.

You can use a service like Lightning Charge (if you like the node.js solution) or set up your own node. After setting up the service, you have available client libraries for JavaScript and PHP. For other languages, you can use the REST API directly using a standard HTTP library.Lightning Charge - https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-chargelightning-charge-client-php - https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-charge-client-php",

Thanks this link is useful.I want to add Blockchain.com website is good for accepting bitcoin payments as their Api allows you to control your keys. However they don't accept lighting.Coinbase is a centralized solution and almost all of their payment solutions land in to their accounts where you need kyc and you doesn't give full control as well as no lighting.",
