Is it because the world economy is in decline or not?While this has been mentioned in some post earlier , that the Bear is still on and there are some who says price will drop to 10k this year.I also asking about what triggered this but know what? best to take this as an advantage to buy and buy , because there are some coming years that the market will boom and surely , this buying will make you richer in that time .lets not look at this moment as negativity , instead the positive is what we must see here and that is the chance to buy more.",

Is it because the world economy is in decline or not?Have you seen the recent news about SBF and FTT? I think that's what caused this drop. Currently, the FTX exchange has blocked withdrawals and it is possible that thousands of investors will fall into a similar situation as the 2014 Mt.Gox floor crash caused. This could be the next market crash this year like 3AC and Luna caused. At the moment, it is not clear whether investors will lose money forever. After all, hopefully everyone needs to remember: not your keys, not your money.",

So everyone panics again and sell whether it is bitcoin or altcoins.But CZ comes to the rescue before it liquidates everything and buy it and now we have this new term introduces by CZ, \"Proof-of-Reserves\".

Someone pumped the price from 19 to almost 21k and then dumped everything to 17k. It all happened in less than 2 hours and that wasn't a normal natural market move.What you're seeing is pure panic with people running around the forums asking what's going on, trying to do research and youtubers capitalizing on it saying that the bears won and shit like that. The bitcoin people were buying yesterday for 20k is the same bitcoin they're now selling for 17k. If you have some free cash set some buys at this area. You'll thank me later",

Considering how big FTX is, and their platform being advertised in local tv commercials, it will be a big hit to the market if something really went wrong. CZ had it all planned and it's working. He may be the starter of the dump that we are experiencing now but we cannot blame him, no one should be. Many investors are in panic.",

When Binance CEO tweeted they are selling their FTT, it created alot of panic.At first it was fine but eventually there was too much selling and Almada pulled the bids and then everything tanked. Their largest holding was SOL and hence why it crashed below $20. And other assets started to crash like BTC and ETH.Now there is panic and hate everything and people are just bailing out of crypto. First Celcius, Voyager, bunch of Defi hacks, 3AC, Luna, people are hurt and they are leaving crypto forever most likely. And will stay out of investing for the time being.Not looking good.",

As Bitcoin’s are limited in number, so when the demand increases, the price also rises in order to fulfil the demands. Similarly happen when the demand decreases and hence price falls down. If you want to understand more easily, then just consider, today there were more people selling their coins, instead of buying in many exchanges.",

If people realized long time ago that this is incredibly normal and the price should be like this and volatility is common then we would have gone up already.But, people are overreacting and selling and getting out, which causes the price to of course collapse and not go up since people are spreading FUD everywhere.
