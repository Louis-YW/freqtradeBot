I don't do SEO, but I am fully aware that a website should get traffic if it just contain the right keywords. You should be able to learn SEO for free and without spending anything although it would cost you your time, but that is all up to you.",

That's like organic marketing that you only need to spend your time and effort since you lack a budget. Since you're also in the forum, create a service announcement for that app and then actively share what's inside your app to give us a view of what it looks like and if those sentiments are near accurate.",
