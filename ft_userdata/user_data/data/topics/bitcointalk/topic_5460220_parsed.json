  "content": "On July 17, 2023, Russia withdrew from the “grain agreement” and officially notified Turkey and Ukraine, as well as the UN secretariat, of its objection to the extension of the “grain deal” for the export of grain and other agricultural products from Ukrainian ports to the world market. In addition, Russia withdrew security guarantees for the grain corridor. In other words, Russia says it can sink civilian ships flying any flag as long as they take grain out of Ukraine. The sinking of civilian ships with non-military cargo in neutral waters can be considered piracy.In connection with these actions of Russia, a very tense situation is developing in a number of countries, and above all in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Due to the sabotage by the Russian Federation of the work of the \"grain corridor\" in recent months, the world has not received an additional 25 million tons of agricultural products from Ukraine anyway. In total, during the year of this agreement, 1,002 vessels left Ukrainian ports. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine, since the start of the \"grain agreement\" more than 33 million tons of products of Ukrainian farmers have been exported to 45 countries of the world.  In many countries, even taking into account the work of the \"grain agreement\", grain and other agricultural products have risen in price greatly. If Russia now interferes with the export of grain under this agreement, the population of many developing countries will face starvation.The situation is interesting because Turkey and China, which are regarded in Russia as some kind of economic allies, are interested in extending the \"grain agreement\". One way out of this food crisis is to escort ships from Ukrainian ports by warships from Turkey or China. Is Putin ready to continue to increase the stakes and fight virtually with the whole world?",

Is Putin ready to continue to increase the stakes and fight virtually with the whole world?I think there will be no hunger, no third world war, and there will not even be sunk ships. It’s just that Russia will destroy the infrastructure in Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea with missile strikes (it has already begun to do this) and Ukraine will lose at least $ 500 million a month in budget revenues from the sale of grain, which will have to be compensated from its own pocket by Western sponsors.And there is no need for this hypocrisy about the famine, according to the UN, less than 3% of all grain exported from Ukraine during the year of the grain deal ended up in the poorest countries, and Russia is ready to compensate this volume for free.",

Yes, six Kalibr missiles were launched from the Black Sea towards Odessa tonight, all of them were destroyed by the Ukrainian air defense forces. In addition, the south of Ukraine was also attacked by several waves of Iranian Shahed-136 drones. On approach from the sea in the Odessa region, 21 Iranian drones were destroyed and four more in the sky over the Nikolaev region.Unfortunately, fragments of downed rockets and the blast wave damaged port infrastructure facilities and several private households. It is also reported that in Nikolaev a hit on an industrial facility was recorded, which caused a fire. However, the fire was quickly put out and there were no casualties.Source: https://focus.ua/voennye-novosti/579544-nochnaya-ataka-shahed-i-kalibrami-vzryvy-progremeli-na-yuge-ukrainy-fotoRussia is a terrorist country, and so almost daily attacks the territory of Ukraine with missiles and drones. Therefore, in fact, nothing changes in this regard.And why did Russia withdraw from the \"grain agreement\", which somehow worked for exactly a year? Putin, in exchange for its extension, demanded to reconnect Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT, resume supplies of agricultural machinery, spare parts and services, lift restrictions on insurance and reinsurance, lift the ban on access to European ports, resume the operation of the Togliatti-Odessa ammonia pipeline, unblock foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies associated with the production and transportation of food and fertilizers. But what about the sanctions that are useful for Russia, or do they bite a lot?",

In fact, the European Union sabotaged the grain deal for a whole year, so it is not surprising that Russia suspended it, but that Russia previously extended it several times, despite this sabotage. This is a deal, not a charity. When the conditions of Russia are met, then the grain deal can be resumed, but not before.",

You may keep how the war will play out to yourself, the OP asked for the impact on feeding and how it could lead to more military actions that can again lead to World War III and famine. The last disagreement largely added to the global inflation we are gradually overcoming, people you will never know committed suicide in the last one due to hunger and depression and you are here down-talking it.You don't preach that Russia is a destroyer to the world again, it is all seen. You think a destroyer is better than a builder?This is a very deep philosophical question, and although I am not a philosopher, I can answer it for you. Destruction is no better than creation, and vice versa. Destruction and creation are two sides of the same coin, two integral poles of life. It is impossible to imagine a good balanced football team that consists only of forwards, or only of defenders, there are both - each with its own mission and function. And although modern concepts of \"total football\" make defenders-destroyers and attackers-creators interchangeable in many ways, this does not make attackers better than defenders, or vice versa. Both sides of the coin are important.",

This is a deal, not a charity. When the conditions of Russia are met, then the grain deal can be resumed, but not before.Let's then consider the question of what this \"grain deal\" is and what it was for. Having attacked the sovereign state of Ukraine, Russia, using its Black Sea Fleet, began to block and destroy not only any Ukrainian ships, but also civilian ships that arrived at Ukrainian seaports or left them. That is, Russia arbitrarily organized an economic and naval blockade of Ukraine, simultaneously causing huge economic damage to other states. Hence the question: are such actions of Russia lawful at all and does this not resemble ordinary piracy that comes from the Russian state itself? And the second question: should the state of Ukraine obtain permission from another state - Russia to supply its argo products to other countries?Now, what kind of \"grain agreement\" is this and between whom was it concluded? Ukraine has concluded an agreement with Turkey and the UN on the conditions for the safe supply of its argo products by sea to the world market for sale. Russia has also concluded a similar agreement with Turkey and the UN. No direct agreements between Russia and Ukraine on the \"grain agreement\" was not concluded. The question is: is Ukraine to blame for the failure to comply with any conditions of the \"grain agreement\" with Russia, if it did not conclude any agreement with Russia? Since the answer is obvious, then the next question is: why then Russia began inflicting more severe missile attacks on the seaports of Ukraine after Russia withdrew from this agreement?Russia calls the damage yesterday to the Kerch bridge, which was illegally built by Russia to the occupied Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, a terrorist attack. shelling with all types of weapons throughout the territory of Ukraine, in which the actual objects were civilian infrastructure?After answering these questions, we will move on to more specific questions about the essence of the \"grain agreement\".",

Do I blame Ukraine for disrupting it? No, Russia has not directly concluded any agreements with Ukraine on this issue. Ukraine can continue to sell its grain to whomever it wants and how it wants, this is its internal affair. It's just that Russia withdrew its security guarantees for the passage of ships with grain through a dedicated corridor in the Black Sea, because the terms of its deal with Turkey and the UN were not fulfilled.And as for yesterday's attacks on the port infrastructure of Odessa and Nikolaev, did you really think that Ukraine's attack on the Crimean bridge would go unpunished? After the previous attack on the Crimean bridge, Russia systematically carried out missile and drone strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure for six months. If Ukraine has not learned this lesson, then the punishment for a second attack on the Crimean bridge will be much harsher. It's okay, get used to it.",

It will be interesting to see what happens when Turkish ships have to guard these grain exports because yet again, Russia is incapable of being a decent country. Turkey would literally end up destroying any fleet that tries to engage it in the black sea and would have the might of NATO to back it up if attacked. Putin is always playing a losing game and is so desperate for any semblance of control, but he has very little. Bit by bit, Ukraine is going to take back it's stolen land and many more Russian's will die for one man's war and vanity project.",
