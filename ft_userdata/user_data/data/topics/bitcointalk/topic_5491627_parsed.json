This news is undoubtedly welcomed by crypto enthusiasts, with hopes for more nations to follow suit. For further insights, refer to this article by Cointelegraph: https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptos-role-daily-payments-beyond-luganoThere was a topic titled Swiss City of Lugano to Make Bitcoin Legal Tender which discussed Bitcoin adoption in this city extensively. It's a piece of good news that the government of the city is promoting the use of Bitcoin in the city. But I am also skeptical because unlike El Salvador which legalized only Bitcoin the city is also promoting some altcoins and a stablecoin. Although I am in support of this move I think this is just a strategy of the City government to attract more tourists and crypto investors to the city since Bitcoin is already legal in Switzerland. However, the City government of Lugano should be praised for accepting Bitcoin for the tax payments.",

I hope this news would also make other government decided to make Bitcoin legal tender like el salvador and now in lugano. I think this is also good for the people who are in crypto that lives there.

This gives us hope that may be someday we would also be able to have our governments allow bitcoin to become a payment method or a legal tender. This proves how bitcoin will not be going anywhere else anytime soon since many governments seem to be interested in it. Let’s wish for our own country to do the same!",

I believe that with the integration of crypto payment systems, we'll have a more sophisticated financial infrastructure, as Grace Chen posited. The news about Lugano is just the tip of the iceberg, and we'll soon see crypto play a bigger role in daily payments. People like her are spearheading the adoption of Web3 and crypto through various initiatives, and this news from Lugano is sure to fuel the passion for continued adoption.\"",

So it is no surprise that one of its cities will officially accept btc in their payment/financial transactions. Only a matter of time that other cities will follow thru. If btc will just be like any regular fiat to be included in the payment sector, this will further boost its popularity and so its demand. Given that it has fixed supply, we already know where the price is heading to. People will also discard the idea that it is only being used for illegal transactions over the net, which sadly, many still have that kind of notion towards this digital currency.",

More countries have been involved in cryptocurrency and trying to see for a way to make it legally used in the country as it becomes the trend around the world today. These countries that are already legalizing the use stand at a bigger advantage than those that will do later because of the information they must have possessed about bitcoin making it easier and simpler for them to use it before it becomes a legal tender globally and a means of exchange in the international market for cross border payments. I have hope in bitcoin and the way it is advancing, it will become legalized one day by every country in the world.",

Congrats! I wonder if there are people in this forum came from that city. Feel free to share your experience there Lugano is most likely an experiment to observe the effects of bitcoin adoption/legalization because that much freedom means they're going to have to be getting something out of it right? I really like it if there's people from there that would share their experience but I don't think that it's happening real early.I don't know if it's going to get bitcoin more valuable though because the way I see it, it going to be used like a currency which isn't bad but the people that's going to be using them and seeing the value that they're giving away because they use it as a currency will probably get a second thoughts about using it that way, I just hope that it won't be the case but given the value, highly unlikely that they're going to use it as a currency for a long time.",

That’s how it starts, once a country takes the step, other countries would gradually want to go in. Imagine the other countries who were skeptic if they should do the same. Seeing 2 countries making Bitcoin an actual legal currency will motivate them even more. Can’t wait to see the next country to get into the dance floor.",

However, when the government (i.e. Switzerland), is allowing citizens to make tax payments, as much as I hate tax, it is a huge success and indicator of the future we could have with our own governments. The government accepting tax payments in cryptocurrency indicates they are establishing a mechanism to hold cryptocurrency themselves, so I am curious if they plan to hold it or not.

The only legitimate case I can see of that is El Salvador and it had top down support from the President. Simply accepting cryptocurrency as a payment for government services, shouldn't be constituted as supporting a new \"official currency\", unless the highest leadership in that region makes a public endorsement announcement.",
