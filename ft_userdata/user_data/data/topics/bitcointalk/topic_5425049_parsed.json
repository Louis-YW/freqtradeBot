In order to sustain these high 16K prices, high when you consider bitcoins were so much cheaper just a short time ago in the past, you will need a lot of people buying it and becoming interested in it.I own close to 2 bitcoin now, purchased in the last few months so I'm under water on my investment, and am worried that bitcoin has run its course and now its just all downhill from here. I slowed up my bitcoin buying at this point because I see all the negativity out there. I may purchase more at 10K though as that is what most people think we are heading to, even on this forum.To sum up my point here, everyone hates bitcoin and crypto right now and I don't see it changing.

Most people that know nothing about bitcoin and how it works, but keep talking about the FTX scam and the fake monopoly money, the Ponzi scheme, I'm sure you heard it all. I even find it hard to jump to conclusions when people who know nothing about bitcoin and how it works keep talking about scams. How can they know about scams, fake monopoly money and Ponzi schemes if they have never been involved in any investment themselves? But if they know all about it, then it can be said that they also know about Bitcoin and some of the big exchanges that are frequented by many people so they also know about the FTX drama that has happened at this timeQuoteIn order to sustain these high 16K prices, high when you consider bitcoins were so much cheaper just a short time ago in the past, you will need a lot of people buying it and becoming interested in it.Because the decline is already in a very large category, yes it is clear that more people need to buy Bitcoin from now on because doing so can make the price increase continue to happen to Bitcoin. But don't worry about that, because Bitcoin has been around for a long time and obviously it will always be very attractive in the eyes of many people when they start to see a price increase in the market.QuoteI own close to 2 bitcoin now, purchased in the last few months so I'm under water on my investment, and am worried that bitcoin has run its course and now its just all downhill from here. I slowed up my bitcoin buying at this point because I see all the negativity out there. If you are slowing down your purchases just because you see negative comments and news that are still circulating at this time, then try reading some positive news from some media that say there are already several countries that legalize crypto and Bitcoin at this time so that it can also have an impact on increasing the price of Bitcoin itself. So there is no need to worry just because you have read the news because you shouldn't be affected by negative news about crypto and Bitcoin which may not be all true.QuoteI may purchase more at 10K though as that is what most people think we are heading to, even on this forum.To sum up my point here, everyone hates bitcoin and crypto right now and I don't see it changing. I've never seen more negativity and FTX made everything a lot worse.FTX has certainly taken the crypto space by storm at this point, but rest assured that not everyone hates Bitcoin and crypto just because of the problems FTX has. Because I can still see more people who love crypto and Bitcoin here by not letting themselves be influenced by untrue news and also not making themselves worry.",

In fact, it's lesser hate now compared to the early years of Bitcoin when it was publicly branded as a currency of criminals. Not only did Bitcoin survive from all that, it thrived and even reached mainstream adoption. There's nothing to worry really. Bitcoin doesn't have to convince all 8 billion people in the world in order to succeed.

What I mean is, bad stories can also make something popular, the negative stories are twistedly contributing to the popularity of bitcoins. The stories and bad news around cryptocurrency are making people know about it, and when the bad news and reviews turn to good reviews and news about bitcoins and cryptocurrency, most of them will also be aware.",

Issues were faced before which made impressions for this industry as ponzi and fraud; volatile market value, prohibitions by some governments, scam projects and more. Losing interest? possible especially during down times in this market it is not surprising. Most people looks at this technology more of an asset than currency. But things would surely change once there's something, most of the time are news related to cryptocurrencies or in favor for this industry, which would hype the interest of potential investors once a bullish pattern is established. We might not know when will such thing occur, but the only thing we should do is to be patient for now.",

But for sure once they realize that what they think about it is not true they come and try to use bitcoin as currency and investment on real tradings.Its just you bought at a wrong time but if you don't dump what you currently own you will not lose anything so maybe try to hold since maybe next year we can see more great picture of Btc and price would pump hard again.",

FTX is just a another bad new in Bitcoin/Crypto that will soon be forgotten due to the long list of same issue like this in the past. I can’t anymore many times crypto is subject on this negative publicity. Not to mention all the ponzi/hyip occured on crypto space before.  It’s not losing popularity.

I slowed up my bitcoin buying at this point because I see all the negativity out there. Did you think that BTC price will experience a new bull run just because you bought 2 BTC? It doesn't work that way and you should have learned that before you decided on that investment, so now you might be less worried about the fact that you have an unrealized loss.

For me personally it's okay for bitcoin to be closer to $16K or even $10K, because that's when we start to take a bigger share of bitcoin investing.Stay calm and don't panic, continue to make purchases according to your abilities, because when bitcoin begins to find a four-year cycle, then that's where you know the advantages of bitcoin that other coins don't have.",

Because it means that no one doesn't see the potential of it, just think about this way, when we had the pandemic, everyone is also calling bitcoin dead when it went as low as $3k and many doom and gloom prediction that we have seen right now.And yet in the aftermath of everything, the price goes to $69k and those who stay and bought it through DCA up to 2021 could have made al to money.So I will say that don't bother but those negativity, they will individuals who have those narrative to attack bitcoin whether we are in a bull or more specially in the bear market.
