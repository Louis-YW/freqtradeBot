  "content": "From yesterday you can join to launchpad (https://arbimm.finance/launchpad) for $MMF token. White List was for people who have their tokens on Cronos, but Public is also open. What's your opinion about this? 1st their DEX start on Cronos was incredible and for few months we was farm easy on their farm pool, collect nice NFTs, after this good time also they open on Polygon their DEX, which was good for a few days if we mean good price of main token. I'm participle in this launchpad and as we can see, overflow on both sales will be good, because WL right now have 1.6mln$ and Public 1mln$.",
