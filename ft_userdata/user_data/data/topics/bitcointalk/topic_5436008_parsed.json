Therefore, your might be just one of the scammers looking for a victim here in the forum. By the look of this thread probably he is an affiliate of a casino or person in charge on marketing. Probably you will need to contact the telegram user account for the details of the casino and to get the 10$ bonus during the sign up. The title is implying that he is promoting a casino. I knew many like this guy on telegram that sending random offer if you are subscribed on telegram casino channel. Probably he is either protecting the casino from criticism here or he knew that sending affiliate link here is not allowed.Either way he really needs to provide the casino info here to save time in case it is a bullshit. But I won’t call it as scam early if deposit is not required to get that 10$ bonus and if we can withdraw it once the requirements meet. I knew some new casino that offers this kind of bonus for sign up and end up successfully before.",

If OP is not an affiliate, why would he invite people to play on their platform? more likely because of the referral bonus, unless the $10 reward is in token form of that particular site which could only be used inside but is not withdrawable. If you are not an affiliate and you are doing this for the sake of bonuses through referral, we would have no problem with that just say so. Referral bonus in the first place would be given to both invitee and inviter. 'coz if you will hide hidden motives you are just putting other players at risk if that particular site would turn out to be a scam. Please don't be like that.",

Now you say \"for play from our side\" and I ask which game are you talking about? Is it a casino, poker or what? Which side are you talking about? You want to give sign up details over telegram, what then happened here? If you feel here is not reliable then why making a thread here? You should have done that on telegram platform where you feel is ok for you so you could be free to give out your registration details.And you are saying no kyc no scam, I would not be surprised if it turns out to be a scam.",

But then ops should tryas much as possible to furnish the thread with the necessary information to avoid all the misconceptions going on in this thread. And again we can say for sure if this casino allows the use of VPN from none US playerplayersf that is possible then ops can mention that to us but it is not advisable to use vpn to access restricted casinocasinosys but since ops said the casino is a none kyc compliance you may not have a problem using VPN.",
