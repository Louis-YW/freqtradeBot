But the reason why Bitcoin price is declining not because of that, but many newbies are trust in so called professional investor and follow fake trading signal. Also they're sold now and trying to bought at the bottom on the next year.",

Bitcoin works the same way today just like when the price was $60k or $100. It is still by far the most secure/most decentralized chain and only a few alts can come close. (ETH is not one of them)Also the price don't really have anything to do with the miners anymore because the block reward isn't big enough to have a significant impact on the price.There is only one reason for the current low prices. There are more sellers than  buyers. It is that simple. When the bears get tired, then bulls will take over. It happened before, it will happen again.",

There are still millions of transactions happening everyday between various parties. Institutional investors are the biggest parties hodling the coins and buying more and more as we speak. Various countries whether developed / under developed are trying to adopt bitcoin as alternate mode of payment; with some cold war but it is happening. Definitely P2P system isn't getting accepted as it should have been but bitcoin not loosing its principle purpose. As mentioned above, there are still big players in the market using bitcoin. If it wasn't under adoption then we would have seen the crypto fail by now, going all the way to zero.",

But in the process bitcoin will still achieve its fundamental purpose which is peer-to-peer payment systems that allow individual freedom to send and receive money electronically because quite a good number of Bitcoin transaction is on the p2p level. Miners may not be the ones selling off Bitcoin and if you have been following,  bitcoin is relatively stable at the moment and bitcoin is constantly making recovery attempts.",

But once they got it, I believe they will realize its benefits as payment method.For now, you can't really say btc can free the financial world because we are not yet in that level.

As for the means of payment, everything is much worse here, because exchange rate stability is important for making payments, and the price of Bitcoin is very volatile, so there is no that important adoption that many were waiting for.

It's not all about speculative profits, but also fundamentals, and fighting inflation and money's devaluation is one of them.Right now the situation isn't that good, it's true, but there are external factors which are causing it. Furthermore, we can't live in bullish market forever. There are cycles following each other. We have to be patient and wait for this cycle to finish. The important is that bitcoin isn't losing importance, because we are still at 16,000$ price range, despite so many negative news and thefts this year which made investors lose billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.",
