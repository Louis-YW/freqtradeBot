So yes, the cycle will continue and even though there are some who think that it can break the pattern since we have a whole country, El Salvador making it their legal tender. Super cycle or two bull runs in 4 years? Nah, I'm sorry but I don't think it's possible. So bull run starts at the halving year of 2024 and then eventually reaches it's peak in 2025.",

Right now all we can do is trust the process and carefully educate ourselves not to jump to any conclusions when investing with money because this is not enough reason to put all of your money to invest in this bearish market and wait for the next bull run. Things are changing their course every time, we just need to stick to the simple rule \"spend what you can afford to lose\".",

I call 2018 the \"year of hell\".2021 is also the year where Bitcoin reached its new ATH of around $69,000. Now year 2022, we are again in a bear market. See the cycle? It's the 4-year cycle and I believe that it is happening again, and it will happen in the years 2025 and 2026. Now to answer your question, yes, I believe that Bitcoin will repeat history but let's not remove the fact that it might not happen as well but just looking at the history, we can see that history repeat's itself.",

Looking at this Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, it seems like there is one major ATH in that 4-year circle and maybe some other peaks too, and from this same chart, It does seem like Bitcoin is at the bottom or close because looking at the next image of trade view chart, We are kind of trading along the long-time support of the last ATH and possibly if that happens to be broken like some other people believed Bitcoin will, then we are possibly looking at the Red bottom line which is around $12k-$11k which is marked with the brown line Bitcoin Rainbow Chart but do we think we could have that much deflection from within the chart down that level?So, the big question is, can Bitcoin break the normal 4-year circle, or are we seeing another ATH before the next Halving, I think this might not happen until after the Halving",

Every four years we see a new high and then a bear market. But my question is that What is the grantee that this model will be repeated every four years. There is no hard and fast rule that bitcoin should follow this 4 year cycle. Is there a possibility that bitcoin cycle increases or decreases the time span ?  Right now we don't have any other data so as long as bitcoin follow this cycle, we can hope for another cycle.",

If it goes wrong, what you will do? or can we say you're stupid?",

But that is only a possibility considering that now so many people have joined bitcoin and don't want to miss the opportunity to profit from bitcoin. But if that cycle persists, that means we will see the price of bitcoin increase and get a rally, which will trigger the price to get a pump. So before we enter the new year or next year, we better use this moment to buy bitcoins. And if next year the price of bitcoin is still at its lowest level like now, we are still given the opportunity to buy more.",

Anyway, what happened in the past may or may not happen again. It is not in any way a guarantee that it will happen again. If it happened once, twice, thrice, that still doesn't assure you that it will happen again. So I wouldn't go all-in on that. Perhaps the only thing that I'd like to believe as a guarantee is that better days will come. Whether it will follow the 4-year cycle pattern or not, it doesn't matter.

I still believe bitcoin's 4 year cycle is still going on, bitcoin will only rise and hit new ATH after halving, there will be no chance bitcoin hit ATH before halving. In addition, looking at the current economic situation, it can be seen that the possibility of a bull season in 2023 is unlikely, war, crisis and interest rates have not shown any signs of slowing down. I can't find a good reason why 2023 is the year of the bull.",
