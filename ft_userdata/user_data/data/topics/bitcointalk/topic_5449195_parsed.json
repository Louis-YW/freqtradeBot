  "content": "Hello again everyone!¬† ¬†So here we are, week 4, with a rollover, as nobody won the prize pool of $50 worth of BTC last weekSo now the rollover of $100 equivalent of BTC is up for grabs this week. A quick recap on how to play:- I will post 5 games below. All you have to do is decide the result of each game and post it here. So for each Game you need to choose either a Home Win (1), a Draw (X), or an Away Win (2). If you make it to the end of Game 5, you win. You will win either the full prizepool, or shared with however many winners there are. If nobody wins, the prize pool rolls over to the next week.For speed, an example selection for the 5 games could be: 1X221 good luck !¬† IMPORTANT- Entries close 1 hour before Game 1 starts.(All fixture times for GMT +1)Game 1 - Wednesday, 19th April @ 20:00, Bayern Munich v Manchester City (Champions League)Game 2 - Thursday 20th April @ 20:00, Sevilla v Manchester United (Europa League)Game 3 - Friday 21st April @ Arsenal v Southampton (Premier League)Game 4 - Saturday 22nd April @ 15:00, Brentford v Aston Villa (Premier League)Game 5 - Sunday 23rd April @ 14:00, Bournemouth v West Ham (Premier League)Game rules & eligibility- Must have 20 minimum Bitcointalk forum posts for your entry to be eligible- Pick either Home (1), Draw (X), or Away (2) for each game- Must be remaining after Game 5 to win.- If multiple winners, prize split between all winners- If no winners, prize pool rolls over to the next week- In the event that a game is cancelled/void, all players still in the tournament will progress to the next Game.-- All management decisions are final, collusion / cheating will not be tolerated",
