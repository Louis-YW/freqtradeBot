  "content": "My Rollbit account was locked with almost $17,000 and with a $4,000 rake back after doing KYC with my account becoming suspended not even a day later from the website on July 29th. After speaking in live-chat for almost four days straight I got the same response from every team member which included \"Our team will reply in the original ticket as soon as we can my friend.\" - Pacho \"A random interval has been assigned to every eligible players. Hopefully there will be an update with your case soon.\" - Moonlight, and \"Pending a colleague we will update you accordingly in your original ticket!\" from Styx. With these responses I started contacting the live chat at-least once a week, eventually becoming a once per month occurrence. Yet again, I was met with replies from the chat such as \"we are still waiting to hear from our higher-ups\" 4 months later I have yet to receive any more information, my account is completely banned with my only access to the live-support chat being my email associated with the account, and nothing in withdrawals. At this point my rake-back is completely voided but I have over 16k+ sitting of winnings in my balance. I have nobody to reach out to regardless of how many emails I send out, and I assume I will never be updated on my case. This forum is genuinely my last hope to at least get a little bit of my money back. Thank you for reading.",

You are still newbie so your post can’t show image but other user can quote it to make it visible.Probably you might have a transaction from wallet that has a previous transaction too on other account that is already ban or committed violation of ToS. Casino is pretty strict in any hint of money laundering especially if the source of your Bitcoin has some record to them.",

Is there any way to help finish my own \"investigation\" ?   To be fair, Razer didn't accuse of hacking wallets and SIM swapping, rather your account being a recipient of funds from suspected source, thus the money mule. As for what you can do, perhaps... wait? Sounds like there's nothing anyone can do other than the 3rd party to finish their investigation.Quote from: Sunderland on November 05, 2023, 06:12:52 PM[...]Im sorry for saying this but the chance for ilovefunds to get the money back maybe almost zero if the money really a dirty money and Rollbit will not have the money either.Remember, all transactions on the blockchain create a permanent trail of unalterable records, undeniable.Not trying to give OP a false hope or anything, but if his explanation is true and he's a clueless victim who simply receiving payments from several sources, with one or two of them is a malicious entity[es] without knowing the nature of the funds, maybe the third party can singled out these transaction and deduct it from the rest of OP's fund, and return the rest into his originating address.",

Why not just go directly towards your wallet? What's scaring you? And with @Rollbit Razer's reply regarding this issue, you are in hot water right now which is going to be bad for your case. Either you're going to cooperate fully in all of this investigation or you and @Rollbit Razer will have a long talk about settling this case because you are suspected of a crime and I get that they don't want to be conplicit in case you're guilty. How the hell people are still putting a lot of money in gambling sites knowing there's a risk of being locked out of their account? I hope that your issue will be resolved and let this be a lesson for you to not do this kind of blunder again.",
