All the other top cryptocurrencies like ETH and stablecoins are too risk for me to invest this huge amount on",

I mean right now if someone suddenly gave me $35k USD I'd put like $10k in savings, take a luxurious $5k vacation to somewhere warm for a couple weeks next month, and put the other $20k into Bitcoin haha",

Did I just find a loophole?  Or send it to a mixer, the link is in my signature. Frankly, this scenario will not happen, as there is no one who gives you money for free, but it is an indirect way to ask a traditional question: If I have 34k and do not want to invest in Bitcoin, what is the best altcoin that I can invest in?The list of the best altcoins varies according to your investment. If it is long-term, I suggest Ethereum, Monero, Polygon as the best optionsFor short-term investment, I will rely on the news and technical analysis, but it is always better to invest in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "I would sell the BTC to fiat and ETH and then use some of it (Fiat) to start a small business and buy a car to have my own vehicle. I would also buy food to eat even though it won't take much to the money I will get if I sell 1 BTC to fiat (in my local currency). There's no rule about not spending the money when it is in Fiat right?, then that's what I will do if It is while I also have ETH even though we cannot use ETH to buy BTC or just sell BTC to Fiat and then fiat to BTC since there's no rule about not selling to fiat and buy BTC back. Just having fine answering this one although no one will give you such amount of BTC just to make you spend it within 24 hours.",

Let's say that if someone gives me 1 Bitcoin in theory and I'm allowed to spend it on other altcoins or buying something offline then I'll go with the route of offline purchase rather than buying any altcoins. The altcoins aren't as good as Bitcoin and investing that money into any altcoins could be a huge risk and I won't take such risks anymore so I will better go with an offline purchase. I have many options in offline purchases and there's literally no limits on things that could give me some profits here and there in offline world.I would never spend 0.05 Bitcoin on books as that would be the worst investment ever because I can get so many e-books on my Kindle with much cheaper rates and there are so many free e-books that I can read without investing a penny. In my country the cost of purchasing a good 2nd hand kindle e-reader is around $15 and it would be stupidity to spend 0.05 Bitcoin on books which you can't even read in many years.",
