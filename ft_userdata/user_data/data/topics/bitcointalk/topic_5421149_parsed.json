This was made clear via the ticket you opened.Please check the following modal which has to be acknowledged to trade on Rollbit:There was no loss incurred here, we simply removed profit generated by activity that we do not permit.Thanks,RazerRollbit.com",

I am 1 who does not agree with all the terms in most casinos ToS, but you clearly knew what you were doing was wrong, yet you continued to do it anyways and only complained once caught. There should be a penalty for you knowingly breaking the rules, so your losses are your penalty IMO.",

By retaining the $100K, it deters you from ever creating new multiple accounts in their platform, since you now know that you will be doing it all in vain once you are caught.I think its a good counter measure to cheating by them.",

OP, collect money at another job. and never enter into any casino platform. looks like you are not fit for this business.The amount which got terminated by site is $100k, he got it from his multiple accounts. Based on OP story, it's likely he use $10k from his own pocket money, but that's still lot of moneyQuote from: yahoo62278 on November 15, 2022, 09:52:13 PMThere should be a penalty for you knowingly breaking the rules, so your losses are your penalty IMO.I think the penalty its not it.

I am speechless....It's sad to read your story, because most of the time I see accusations of scam against a casino and there's that doubt that maybe the accuser has a reason and the casino is guilty, but in your case you got greedy early, cheated and broke the TOS of the casino, when you didn't need to do that, you could have just one account, you would earn fairly and you would have your profit and little by little and with time your bankroll would be much bigger but you preferred to follow the path of greed and often the path of greed makes people cheat, what you can do is create an account at another casino and play without cheating, over time you can have a large bankroll. but you have to forget about cheating, see in this case, even with an account if you had respected the TOS and you hadn't cheated you would have something to withdraw, it's better to have little than nothing",

Follow always what is written in TOS and don't try to abuse anything on casino so that you can play smoothly.You are the one who's to be blame for what you experience because if you didn't do abusive action for sure you can withdraw your potential winnings.",
