I hope you find the time to stay here and give some inputs or outputs here in the forum and, of course, use the search bar before anything else; maybe there are topics similar to your inquiries. Anyway, I don't think age and your race would be a factor in having the long-term investment. You should have in mind why you are doing it in the first place and what plans you would have when you are older. I admire young people trying to think about their future immediately and people like you, who have this in their mind to be successful. As for the Bitcoin halving, it's still best to get all the BTC that you can and make it your investment in the long run. As someone who believes in BTC, I'm biased towards it, but I think it is for good reasons.",

After halving, all-time-high is possible.You can go for some altcoins, but they are more volatile, have low marketcap, more risky and can be like gambling especially during bear market time which can lead to significant loss. What makes me dislike altcoin is because most of them will fall and never reach all-time-high. But there is nothing not good to invest like 70% of your coins on bitcoin while 30% on altcoins. Avoid shit coins, go for high marketcap altcoins if you want to go for altcoins. Most altcoins are shit coins.",

Read as much as possible and discover first, then you have really good, really specific questions to ask.The simplest way meanwhile also I agree with crwth. Buy every time, regularly, with as much money as you can. This is called DCA (you can look it up) and it the best way to get Bitcoin without spending time and resources.",

Two years from now, you know what's about to happen and while it's still not yet there, you can buy and choose the dollar cost average strategy until you accumulate that much.",

I'm kinda biased here ofc, but Bitcoin halvings have historically been times when the Bitcoin market has been rather positive, so yea go with Bitcoin. Though that is if you're going to invest now ofc, instead of on the date of the halving itself. Outside of BTC though, then that's a bit more difficult. The span of time between now and the halving is still 2 years, there's going to be a LOT of coins coming in and out. You can probably profit off of some of them in the short term if you play it right, but that's like a lottery imo. I'd probably just DCA in Bitcoin tbh, rather than finding some coins to short.",

But congratulations, because you have your chance to have the best investment besides gold which is bitcoin.Bitcoin still the best investment, not just because next halving or not because in crypto, bitcoin is the leader among the other. So if you can buy bitcoin periodically, no matter how much the money and you can keep it for one or two or even five year, you will see your investment value will grow. I hope you can dig deeper about bitcoin from this forum so you can find other material that can help you to understand what crypto is and how to invest in bitcoin.",

It is about 2 years before the next halving occurs. The best long-term investment is always bitcoin. It is inevitably everlasting, it has gained a lot of reputation years by years and many investors have considered bitcoin as a safe haven for their capital. Many expect that bitcoin will surpass $100000 in the next 4 year cycle and I believe it is capable. If you feel that investing in only one asset is not interesting enough, expanding your knowledge of the cryptocurrency will give your more power to spot valuable altcoins and blockchain-based projects. During the uptrend, many coins did x10 to x100 in a short period of time. However, making a wrong decision can vanish your investment. Therefore, always make a careful research on any investment that is not bitcoin. Cheers",

It's all about the stability of the investment that you're about to buy and bitcoin is the choice that a newbie can make. Not just because of it being the king of the market.But fundamentally and economically, bitcoin stands as the best of them all. No debates but only proof of the market's existence ever since.",

Read as much as u can in this forum, get on twitter and follow as much influencers and group on it. Learn the idea of trading on both decentralized and centralized exchange. Learn how to open wallet and keep it safe. As u start getting fund buy reliable stable coin not the algorithm stable coin in your wallet. You can decide when to start buying the market in less than 2 years. Before then you might to know about investment in crowdsale etc",
