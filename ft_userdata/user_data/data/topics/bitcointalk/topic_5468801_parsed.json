  "content": "Greetings, esteemed community. I have a question, what to do and where to place such information? It's just the first time I see such a thing. The fact is that I came across a user who, in my humble opinion, can be considered a full-fledged news spammer. Almost all of his posts consist of a news headline and a link to it. Almost all of his posts (out of 931 posts) look like thishttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1157721;sa=showPostsReporting all of his posts to the moderators is just unrealistic. It is necessary to devote a whole day to this activity. And plus there is a limit on old posts.",

      "body": "For my opinion reporting should be when those post are not real and there time of posting them, that is, if he constantly post without even a space of 5 minutes we can say such person is a spammer but from his post history he is dedicated to sharing of news and I can see that is the area he finds interest of posting than involving in deep conversation with other members, although my judgement might not be final but let us see what other could say about it as well.",

Honestly I'd just leave him be because he only posts in inconsequential threads in an inconsequential part of the forum. Wouldn't bother reporting the posts. For some reason Politics & Society has always attracted the most mentally ill members of the forum... I won't name any names but its where they can let their freak flag fly and nobody will bother them (if anyone was capable of getting to them in the first place).",

Thank you all for your comments.",
