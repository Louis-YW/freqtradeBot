When you say \"value [of fiat] dropping\", that's inflation and that leads to more bitcoin adoption and its price going up.But when we have recession, people tend to sell everything they have to get some money to spend and cover their cost of living. Hence bitcoin price dropping due to increased sell pressure.QuoteSo,…, what do you think BTC, and cryptos in general, will do in the event of a U.S. government default?  We have to see how that affects the economy on a large scale. AFAIK this has never happened before so we have nothing to speculate this based on.I believe the default would lead to increased interest rates and a massive recession which could cause a bitcoin drop but at the same time that would be US economy falling apart and people would also look for an exit of the failing economy and this could translate into more investment into bitcoin instead which could lead to the biggest price rise in bitcoin history.P.S. Another thing to keep an eye on is \"when\". The world order is changing and the world is decoupling itself from US economy to some extent. In a couple of years it won't matter as much as it does today or it mattered a couple of years ago if US economy falls apart. That means the effects on bitcoin (which is global) would be a lot smaller.P.P.S. In any case The effects will be short term, in long term bitcoin will become more valuable as it is the only \"money\" that exists in a world filled with uncapped \"currencies\".",

If I owe you a million dollars and I see that I can't pay you back, I print a lot more notes (or create them as bits in the system) and then I can pay you back, even though you have easily lost money on net because the dollars I pay you back with now have less purchasing power than the dollars you lent me.Even if there is a rate hike and a tightening, the debt keeps growing, let's see:https://www.usdebtclock.org/There are always arguments about the debt ceiling but politicians always come to an agreement in the end. So, for me the question is not so much what would happen if the US defaulted on its debt, but what will happen in the face of this inevitable increase in debt that tends to infinity. And the answer for me is that bitcoin will become more and more valuable. It is not so noticeable now because of the tightening, but wait until they are forced to change their interest rate policy, because they are going to be forced to do so and watch how much of the money that is printed ends up in bitcoin.",

Some argue that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could become a more stable store of value compared to traditional currencies, as they are not tied to decisions made by central financial institutions. However, there are also doubts about the ability of cryptocurrencies to function as a medium of exchange and unit of account, as their volatility and lack of widespread acceptance in everyday use may make it difficult for businesses and consumers to use them as a primary currency.In the event of a US dollar financial default, there is likely to be a significant economic and financial uncertainty and the reaction of cryptocurrencies will depend on the decisions of investors and actions of regulatory institutions. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not a panacea for all financial problems and also carry risks",
