But not too late for newcomers to realize this platform has been scamming money from many.I have sent a message to their official account in bitcointalk, slightly hoping that they will attend it to clear out their reputation, although I know it's most probably a goner.But I deeply hope no one else fall for this, I will do this in every sportsbook review websites whenever I have the free time to.",

Well, you learned from your mistake, and this is enough. once again do not forget to do your research or even seek advice from those interested in betting and gambling.",

You stated that you brought this thread to the public's attention. But you had no idea there were more public attention threads that you had missed and been deceived by.

You have deposited on a website that is constantly being accused of blocking their customers' accounts with funds.
