Damn, it's been like 15 years since the last time I saw it. Gotta agree with others, I don't think that theymos should bother with features like that as they are not such a big problem anyway. I've been on many forums for abouit 20 years now and I don't remember seeing \"undo\": option on any of them, and never even thought about needing one. But who knows, maybe that option will be included in the new forum",

I think this is not a website issue and has nothing to do with Bitcointalk, But there is away to save text while you type just incase this kind of mistake happens, and that is by always using the \"Preview\" button even when there is nothing to preview .Seriously, I've made it a habit to always press the Preview button after typing two or three lines, this has saved me a lot of times when I was trying to post something and after typing and clicking the post button, I encounter a network issue, which sometimes, clears my text after refreshing the page, instead of starting all over again, i just click the \"Draft\" button to recover my previous text which i saved by using the Preview button.",

I tried to find solution but I couldn't at the mean time, the only solution I found was to be careful and ensure that before I highlight or edit text, I will deliberately preview it to make sure it has entered into the draft bin. By this, any other edits I want to make on the post, I will be sure a copy of it is saved in the draft. That's the hack I work with...lolx.I also understand on a serious note that theymos is very much unwilling to add anything to this old software of the forum.

Bam, you got that right there right! I've literally experienced lots and lots if fjs and it's usually so frustrating. After coming up with a idea for which your first attempt was already getting by perfectly, your long pressing the delete bottin in an attempt to delete fee lines just ends you wiping of the whole stuff! When it's done, am like oh shit, wtf! Unfortunately, you can never come up with the same perfect presentation but again, you could try.It hits me now that you came up with the undo botton. This means the forum has got to have a Bot or some program that works a kind of a draft system that auto saves right before you post. Would that be a great idea for the forum? I really can't tell if we would need a LoyceV to get this set up but, its unnecessary to me as either typing off forum only to paste when done in the comment box or being a lot more careful while you tap the delete button would go along way to avoiding this error.",
