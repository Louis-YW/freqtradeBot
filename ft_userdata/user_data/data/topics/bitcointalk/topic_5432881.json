These are just some of the reasons that Michael Saylor probably saw worthy enough to go deep into Bitcoin. You should also try to find the real reason why you are into Bitcoin rather than go into it just because Michael Saylor risked so much for it. There are definitely more meaningful and interesting reasons to go into Bitcoin rather than just imitating somebody.",

I’m actually scared because this institutional investors like Saylor and Grayscale that holds huge chunk of Bitcoin that bought in high price. I preferred the small quantity distributed to all holders rather than whales holding it. I know that Saylor intention on Bitcoin is good but he is investing money using his company funds which we all know that will not gonna hold loss for so long or else there investment is not profitable at all.I trust Bitcoin 100% due to its technology not because someone prominent like Saylor that investing huge money on it.",

You don't need a middleman to send, receive or hold bitcoin which means no one's hand is in your pocket when you use bitcoin but your own! It has a limited supply so we can say that bitcoin is the only existing money in the world too (everything else we have like dollar is currency not money).",

He's a very smart, well-spoken guy, but those types of people get it wrong too. Better to study what Bitcoin is and based on that decide whether to invest, as pooya87 says.",

But if you keep on jumping on anything that has been promoted by a big name like Michael Saylor, or even Elon musk and the rest of the other influential personalities around the world, you may get misled because those guys a bullish on those projects simply because they have their investment in them and will want the price to go bullish so that they make more profits. But taking personal time to discover the potential of such an investments and their utility demand before diving into them will help you a lot instead of trusting on the public statement from men of influence. Quote from: raybucks on January 04, 2023, 05:51:11 AMmy English is bad so ignoreOh ok so now let's discuss based on the fact that you already admitted that you made a grammatical error in your arrangement of the sentences,  but from the whole message you posted in ops it seems you know exactly what you are saying and you put in 200% of your investment into Bitcoin after being motivated by Saylor statement and bitcoin holding, even though we don't know exactly the amount of Bitcoin held by Micheal in his personal wallet as a personal asset aside from the one his company hold which belongs to micro strategy.",

They are securities because they had a premine or ICO involving venture capital, they are controlled by a person or small group of persons, they pass the Howie test, etc. In other words altcoins are garbage. Everything Saylor says about bitcoin is true and can be verified. Even the head of the SEC and CFTC regulatory agencies in the United States officially stated that bitcoin is the only digital commodity, everything else including ethereum are unregulated securities.",

He is known to have purchased approximately 2,395 bitcoins worth $42.8 million between November 1 to December 21. So far MicroStrategy has collected 132,500. It is worth about $2.25 billion at current prices. There is no doubt that Michael Saylor is a big holder of Bitcoin. He owns 0.62% of all bitcoins. His faith and trust in Bitcoin has encouraged all the investors. Undoubtedly, he will reach his goal ‍accoridng to his mentioned time. In a bearish market, BTC's low price wont be stable. It will again be able to break the previous record by it's bullishness.",
