The worst thing about buying from exchanges like this is the high transaction fee it cost to move your coin around wallets because they still operate using P2PKH. This exchanges aside their poor network issues, not just with Remitano alone but most CEXs, still fail to upgrade so that when we buy from them, it will be cheaper and faster to move them to our cold wallets. DEXs remain the most preferred when it comes to buying and selling of coin, but the only limitations with DEX is it only deal directly with USD and a few popular fiats which will require still moving them to CEX for easy transactions",

But if you ask me today why I am avoiding Centralize, then I will say Centralize exchangers do not have their own control and it can take full access to my wallet, so I do not deposit my large funds in these online platforms.",

Yes, I'm familiar with Remitano although I haven't used it before. So I'm not familiar that it will take at least 24 hours before someone can login? If that is the case then it's poorly design and I would have stay away from that kind of exchanges.So I don't know what keeps you using their services though if you got that bad experience from them. Maybe it's about time to look for alternatives like Binance to used as your exchange. Of course, crypto exchanges are not design to store your bitcoin, we just used their services to do our trades and then we withdraw our bitcoin and send it to the wallet that we have total control of.",

You can use Naira to buy bitcoin on Binance exchange and move to your hardware wallet, stay away from Remitano, they also cheat when it comes to fees and Naira to Dollar value, worst P2P service ever. Please learn the difference between a centralized exchange and a decentralised exchange, it seems that you don't know the difference and it is very important for a newbie to understand this.
