The processing time differs per payment gateway. Instant processing for our e-wallets, 3 confirmations with BTC, and 10 minutes for USDT.

Currently, there are two other ANN threads that are related to Asianconnect. The first thread is similar to this thread and then there's also the second one that was made by another account and i'm guessing they don't have access to that account anymore.For the OP I suggest locking one of the two threads (guide for locking a thread) that you started since the gambling section only has one thread per site rule.",
