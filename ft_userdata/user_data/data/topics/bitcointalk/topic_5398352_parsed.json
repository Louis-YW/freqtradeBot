      "body": "Many, especially the newer, investors are traders rather than ideologically driven long-term hodlers. They sell much faster, but are also ready to get back in at some point, so they see it more as a temporary exit until the panic is over. If you then hold fiat for only two to three months before moving back into bitcoin, then inflation is irrelevant, especially if bitcoin continues to fall. Currently, Bitcoin is losing a lot of value against fiat and is therefore affected by a lot of inflation, more than fiat. I say this as a long-term hodler.",

Anyone who wants to sell it is their choice to make.I doubt that those that are selling right now are doing so because they plan to enter the market once the price drops even more, if that was the case they had many opportunities to get out of the market before the price went so low, so the ones that are selling now are probably doing so out of panic, and if that is the case then most likely they will choose a bad moment to get back into the market too, and that is the best case scenario as I think many of those which are selling now may never come back.",

But this is mostly applicable to newbies and emotional Bitcoin owners who don't really appreciate the technology of Bitcoin and its potentials. Most of them are carried away by the price. But they will eventually learn, most often by experience, that price drops of Bitcoin are nothing but hiccups in its overall price growth.",

I have seen people get out 85k dollars out personally, of course there are many that take out millions of dollars as well but I have seen someone take out 85k from bitcoin and he made a ton of loss, he got in at around 44k dollars so that was a big fall for them.This doesn't mean that newbies don't, they do get out as well but this is just beyond that now, this is reaching to a level where we are seeing people who have been in crypto for many years get out as well because they have never seen one coin screwing the market this much.",

Actually people have learned not to panic but people's instincts and emotions will getting bigger when they see the price drop drastically. It causes them to sell their bitcoins and hope that they can save their money's worth or want to buy in a lower price range. Many of those who use money are not yet completely free of all needs because they use the money to trade and to make a profit. So it's natural to see them panicking at this point because they don't want to lose the smaller value of their money.",
