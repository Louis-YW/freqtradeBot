Most times I feel emptied should a day pass by without inclining myself to a news broadcast. Am sure there are some persons here that are like that too.Apart from news I also interest myself with documentaries. Just the other day I was watching a particular documentary on Aljazeera about nature and  one correspondent made a statement claiming that \"the most important place on earth is the  Amazon\", and this got me marveling how so. What could be her reasons for this claim.In such wise, for the sake of knowledge and discussion as I earlier expressed above. In your own opinion where on earth do you think is the most important place on earth and why such a place?",

There is no gain in saying that different countries have some incredible and out-of-human-capacity locations and reserves, and this will dash off every form of argument. Amazon may rank among the best location around the world but certainly not the first on the list if there is any.",

I think as long as there is a human presence, it is an important place, and we need to protect all of those places. In addition, we should pay more attention to the climate issue because I see our earth is on the verge of danger when the world is getting warmer, and we still don't have an effective solution to this problem.",

The most important places on earth depends on every individual because it is based on certain reasons. For me the most important place on earth to me is my home.I think the selection of the Amazon as the most important place on the world was made in the context of that forest having much of an impact on the climate and the availability of oxygen in the atmosphere. It has been called \"the lung of the planet\" for that reason before.And while we can have different opinions on the where the most important place is, I kind of agree on how important the Amazon forest is, and I would personally loved if it was preserved for future generations.",

Being a rainforest in South America and occupying around 6.7 million square kilometers shared by nine countries, its favorable contribution to climate change has made it a crucial location to be protected well for future uses. Being a rainforest with such resources does not automatically make it the best place on the planet. No matter how beautiful and appealing a forest appears to the sight, it is never a decent location for me to find comfort and live.",

Just the other day I was watching a particular documentary on Aljazeera about nature and  one correspondent made a statement claiming that \"the most important place on earth is the  Amazon\", and this got me marveling how so. What could be her reasons for this claim.Most of the world's rainforests have been destroyed due to industrialization and urbanization. This has harmed the environment. It is generally believed that the destruction of the ecosystem by industrial activities is the cause of global warming and other natural disasters. Currently, the Amazon rainforest is the largest natural habitat in the world. And it is one of the biggest contributors to the balancing of the ecosystem. This is why developed nations heavily pay nations like Brazil to ensure that the Amazon is allowed to exist and to avoid deforestation. Brazil usually uses the Amazon as an economic and political instrument to seek the attention of the industrialized nations.Quote In such wise, for the sake of knowledge and discussion as I earlier expressed above. In your own opinion where on earth do you think is the most important place on earth and why such a place?There might be other important places that affect our lives positively but the most important place to me is my country. Yes, the world is a global village where every nation is interconnected and interdependent. The political or economic problems in any country will affect me indirectly, but if it is within my nation, I will be affected directly. I have always prayed for world peace but I am more concerned about peace in my country.",

On the order hand, if the Pyramids or the Great Wall disappeared, it would be a negative impact on the history and culture of humanity but we could continue to exist in the long term without them.Realistically, It would be more likely others to consider the Mecca or Jerusalem the most important places on the planet, rather some historical monuments.",
