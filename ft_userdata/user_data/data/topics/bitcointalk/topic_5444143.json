It requires the victim to pay $300 and get software that checks the price of his currencies and the NFTS..etc. These are all accessible features, and anyone can do this manually through one of the sites; the other thing is that for the victim to do these checks and monitor prices, he should put his wallet recovery phrasesÂ  Â  .",

It requires the victim to pay $300It's an interesting \"business model\".I think the price is because it claims to be open source, but there is a paywall, so clearly it's not \"open\" source code. But there is a good reason for this... If it were truly open source, with source code published on github for example, then it would be easily to pick apart and find the exploit if there is one. For example there is already a \"SeedChecker\" on github it seems: https://github.com/L1ghtM4n/SeedChecker - not recommended(May or may not be legit, even though couldn't see an obvious exploit myself)So while it's \"possible\" SeedChecker has forked this and included more blockchain compatibility, it's the claim of being open source while having a paywall that's the obvious scammy part (the contradition). A seed checker in itself wouldn't necessarily be a scam, it could be like Exodus wallet (that supports lots of blockchains) without the functionality of sending transactions. At least theoretically speaking.My point is if SeedChecker wanted to restore their reputation, they could provide the source code for review to some trusted members here... but for obvious reasons, I doubt this would happen.",
