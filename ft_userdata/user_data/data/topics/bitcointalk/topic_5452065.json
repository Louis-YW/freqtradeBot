  "content": "Bitcoin Lightning Network is getting more attractive attention amidst the recent ongoing challenges with making transactions as a result of the introduced ordinals inscriptions into the bitcoin block space, many people, industries, organizations and institutions have been adopting the use of the lightning network as an alternative to this congestion on mempool, which is one of the reasons why the layer 2 protocols was implemented abd developed in situations like this.We can see some of this adoptions into the use of lightning network from the few examples I will be sitting from here:1. Payment made using bitcoin lightning network amidst mempool congestion and higher transaction fee in an hotel resort https://twitter.com/snaxion/status/1655755502117171200?t=KiE0wPiuVY9-eiCc9LAb3g&s=192. Bitcoin exchange bisq starts the integration of bitcoin lightning network into it service henceforth. https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1654552334343520256?t=kmTclZj8o0SX5pIdVRY7eA&s=19 3. An exchange named Binance is also planning on integrating Lightning Network to their system considering her recent controversies and withdrawal challenges as a result of the bitcoin network congestion due to ordinals. https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1655587572876279817?t=ZnmNwnEeAlSuqRliHRtvxQ&s=19Is this recently challenge an avenue calling for more adoption to the use of bitcoin lightning network as being acceptable by many or not?",

      "body": "I guess that is one good thing in reaction to the recent spam attack.Just as the skyrocketing fees in late 2017 caused exchanges to start batching transactions, thus making Bitcoin tx usage much more efficient, now we get exchanges implementing LN in response to the latest attack and presumably the assumption that ordinals will in general make txs cost more in the future.At least for smaller amounts of money, if all major exchanges implement LN then people can easily move their funds between their wallets and different exchanges. And of course all actual payments, though of course this isn't a major use case of Bitcoin yet and won't be for some years to come, should be done over LN, there isn't really any reason to pay someone on-chain unless its a large purchase.On-chain is for moving large amounts of money around or large payments and for usage that isn't balanced (ie only receiving like cold storage or only paying like gradually moving out of your cold storage). Small or daily-type transactions or balanced wallets where you both pay and take in money are when LN should be used.",

How come people using Bitcoin for bitcoin, are suddenly treated second class? \"You plebs go L2... we corporate spammers are owners of L1 now.\"I understand every of your point here, there are many things to be unveiled later than we are seeing currently with this present challenge with ordinals and transaction fee, but come to think of it this way when such experience occur in 2017 when the bitcoin fee rises as well, also we must put into the consideration that Lightning Network was introduced as a solution to the then current challenges with the bitcoin network as well, just that in this case, it's all about ordinals, but just in conclusion i see to your point that we the legitimate user of bitcoin shouldn't be the ones to shift ground for NFT by moving to layer two at our own expense while they take over the blockchain layer 1 in doing what can be regrettable for the entire bitcoin network later in life.",
