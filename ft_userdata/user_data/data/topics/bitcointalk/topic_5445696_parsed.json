Wars between black man and whites was brutal contents and controls, uniform forces were mainly shuffled by whites in authorities to control the blacks.Now over years, Africans have gain freedom from wars, fears and slavery but Africans has not be free from and within themselves. Hatred, killing, indirect slavery, wars and rivalries still exist within us, no good government, no incredible elections, no honest leadership, no sincere development, questionable and unhealthy education.Are we true free Africans? Whites do you think you're still the cause of our slavery mentality? Let's argue this deep guys",

Let's argue this deeply guysYour question OP is very annoying because as an African I know what is happening in the continent. I am sorry for sounding rude, this is because of the political drama that is unfolding in my country. You are not out of place to assume that developed nations have a level of political and economic control or influence on Africans. But this influence is still potent because Africans have refused to develop. We are not the only continent that was colonized. India, Indonesia, and other countries suffered under colonialism and today they are far better than Africans both politically and economically.Africans like playing the blame game. Is it the Europeans that rig elections in Africa? You feel it was the whites that told your president to change and amend the Constitution so that he can become a life president. When your political and economic leaders are looting and exploiting the country, was it a European that is the minister of finance or minister of mineral resources?Africans need to stop this blame game and take responsibility for their development. Most African nations have been independent for over fifty years. And if a fifty years old man keeps blaming his parents for his failure then he is highly irresponsible.",

There are good number of African countries that are doing good in terms of development, good governance, honest leadership etc.Next time be specific and name the countries, this will make them improve.Regarding slavery, much of Africa has some form of slavery. None of Africa that we see in general news has any official slavery. It's hard to erase hundreds of years of tradition. In places like Western Sahara, there almost doesn't seem to be any government enforcing anti-slavery, even though 'no slavery' is on the books of what little government there is. It's the wealthy slave owners that seem to rule the land, and they are as quiet as possible about slavery when talking to people from the outside.Further, the slaves often don't know any other life. They have been born in slavery, raised in slavery, and for them slavery is all there is. They have a difficult time even understanding what freedom means.However, and here is the big part. In places like the West (the US, Canada, and all of Western Europe), even though the people are reasonably free, they are all slaves to the banks and governments after a fashion. And their enslavement is bringing wars to them, and bringing them to wars, as we see with their Ukraine involvement.",

The worthy war we stand to fight never ends. In Nigeria, we say the war is against slavery . we are enslaved by our leaders, no empathy,  no conscience. People now go extra mile just to achieve selfish desire and leave the majority in distress. War and slavery never ends, we experience it in different category of life.",

Let's argue this deep guysYou are Right, the 1850s and 1870s were marked by significant injustice and oppression of Africans by Western powers. At this time, many African people were forced labor, and violence. Many were taken from their homes and transprted to foreign lands to work under harsh conditions with no freedom or rights.But It is important to acknowledge and remember these historical injustices and work towards promoting equality and justice for all peoples, regardles of race. We should strive to learn from the past and take steps towards creating a more equitable and just society for all.",

There are good number of African countries that are doing good in terms of development, good governance, honest leadership, etc.Next time be specific and name the countries, this will make them improve.Some African countries mostly the Northern part are better developmentally than other parts. Before the invasion and destruction of Libya by the US and NATO, the Libyan economy was better than some European countries. Many Africans preferred to migrate to Europe when Muammar Gaddafi was in power. It's a shame what the West has turned Libya into today. The war in Libya is destabilizing the entire African continent. South Africa and Rwanda are not also doing badly. South Africa, although its economy is going through some problems, can boast to be one of the emerging economies. Rwanda is experiencing massive economic growth and development. After the civil war that killed thousands and destabilized the East African nation is putting aside tribalism and focusing on multidimensional development.",

Some Africa countries dictate for their citizens on how to live their lives and if you don't obey,you will get killed,or if you come out to say what  the government is doing is bad,your tongue will be cut for speaking.In my country the leaders in power does what ever they like and they are also above the law because they have bought the judiciary  over which is the hope of the common man. Government can come up and give some laws that will make the people suffer at yet,the citizens can't come out to say no. This is the highest form of slavery in disguise.Imagine before the past presidential election, there was no circulation of cash and the reason is that they don't want vote  buying. During the election INEC didn't coordinate it as they promised,instead the election results was released after three days. This shows that there was no transparency like INEC claimed and that they election has been rigged. When citizens are not given the right to choose the leader that they want,instead the electoral body chooses a leader for the people,it is the biggest slavery because the new leader will only come to add more suffering to the citizens by looting the country funds and selling the countries property for themselves.",
