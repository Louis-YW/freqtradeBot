  "content": "The economy is in danger its not fall yet but its decision time.One of the most interesting economy is in uk lets talk Over the few years uk pound been quite strong for tge decades..right but lets look the reasons why.One reason uk exports crude oil but this was not driving up uk pound but main reason was that uk was world most destined country of the investors with big money so at some point there was huge demand of other currencies to get uk pounds so it was pumping up the price of pound.but now properties been just abonded and british pound demand dropped. Do we let out the air out and we go to the little inflation then defltaion then depresion...but its unlikely to happening becouse average joe is too poor thats not good for the bankers and ws players likely they let all this to some limit when are in the middle of inflation and deflation.... then they call the fed \" c mon powell shoot the money now \" and fed will turn on the big money bazookaBut....we need reason and we all know what is the reason the reason must be so good that will eat the inflation away and also will eat all this printed money faster then they can print so in other words the next money supply must go somewhere as we know war can eat fast money so thet can divide money by funding war and holding up markets bull run becouse all this money must go somewhere into the riskassets such us gold and btc.As we know the ammount of artificial price pumpings was if they really dont start money printing fast then the assetprices specially real estate have at least 60% of air those who got mortgage recently congrats you payed 60% for air.The question will the bankers will bail out the system or we will fall down fast ....but odds are 90% on the new printing ....possibility becouse its easy for them to find reason why to print and good big destination where most of this money goes but remember each time finish printing and do little rate hikes the next printing money party must be way bigger then it was before so now its obvious there got be bigger thing then it was covid.Anyone who knows how all this works can not have different opinion.Most likely until the new digital crypto system is ready the world will look like the great gatsby exacly like it was on the movie great gatsby.If you got resources and u can speculate and invest you can live large if speculation not for u then....well u know we will have no middle class you choose ...Here is tge game plan ....you either very super rich or u got nothing both options are easy to get but many of you will try to choose middle class well its not option in the game those who choose the middle class they automatically will go poor class thats the new way of life now until 2025 when the new money system will be ready so the old fiat will be gone but the next 3 years we will live like in the GREAT GATSBY Â specially in usa.Good bless fugazzi...",
