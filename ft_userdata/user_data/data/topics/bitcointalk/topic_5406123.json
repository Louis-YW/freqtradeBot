  "content": "Hi everybody.I took a half year break from the forum, got a lot done, and now I'm back to spread the word about the Historical NFT movement. Of course everybody knows about NFTs by now, but what you might not know is that a lot of aged tokens now possess collector value. Its true that a lot new NFT projects (2020-present) are gonna go the way of ICOs and DeFi, and will never recover their previous price highs. However, just like the good cryptos that were down a lot in 2014-15 and 2018-19, the \"good NFTs\" will come roaring back when the market picks back up again.Words of wisdom from White Rabbit, my favorite \"NFT Historian\"So what's a \"good NFT\"? Most NFTs (art-based NFTs) are only valuable for their collectability. They possess characteristics that are sought out by collectors (these among others): - novelty of creation - aesthetic of artwork - strength of brand / community - accessibilityEven though we have been hit by a bear market this year, sentiment is down and interest has been slowed, this could make for a great opportunity to purchase NFTs that will be coveted for years in the future at bargain prices.The thesis for Historical NFT investing goes like this:There will be an infinite amount of new NFTs manufactured in the future. We already saw a damn near infinite amount minted in the last couple years. So, the ones that are older and scarce - before NFTs really exploded in ~2020 - are going to be the most valuable as they were among the most unique at their time of creation.Another good explainer image by White Rabbit\"Historical NFTs\" go all the way back to 2011 (now that Namecoin IDs are considered \"NFTs) and all the way up to 2018; arguably 2019. The most popular blockchains they are found on include: - Ethereum (Cryptopunks, Realms of Ether, CryptoKitties) - Bitcoin (Rare Pepes, Spells of Genesis, Sarutobi, NILICoins) - Namecoin (Punycodes, Twitter Eggs, early .bit domains) - Dogecoin (JollyRoger, Bitbeg, Dogecar, Goldenshibe)Other blockchains with collectible assets (though more esoteric) include Emercoin, NXT, NEM, and WAX. I currently hold NFTs and other assets on 7 of these (all except Emercoin). There are also \"colored coins\" on the Bitcoin blockchain but those remain elusive for now as their supporting systems have long been dismantled.Another of my favorite \"NFT Historians\" is w3b.eth, who recently put together an amazingly informative Historical NFT Price Catalog that is a great resource for anybody who is looking to get started collecting historicals. So, what Historical NFTs do you own? Which ones am I missing that you think have a lot of future potential?Thread is self-moderated. Useless spam & off-topic posts will be deleted.",

You will definitely want to own at least a few of these going into the next bull market. When I came into the scene, a lot of these had huge price tags which are now significantly reduced due to bear market conditions. DYOR, feel free to ask questions here, but you'll definitely want to get at least a couple of these:Here is the tweet containing the full image for those who want to see it in its full glory, and have a bit of context from the graphic's creator.These are the true blockchain collectibles out of the trillion+ NFTs that have ever been minted. A lot of them aren't actually \"NFTs\" per their strict definition, but rather simply tokens or assets. The fact that they have an early mint date is what makes them valuable. Of course having good art is nice, but creation date far supersedes aesthetic value for HNFTs.",

Only way to make them \"liquid\" is to put in a sell offer significantly below the price floor.

(genuinely curious)What about staks or others... even this one ?Good question. I like Counterparty more because it is simply a protocol that reads extra data in Bitcoin transactions, as opposed to Stacks which is its own blockchain that interfaces with Bitcoin. All Counterparty txs occur as BTC txs, so it seems to be \"purer\" from my point of view, which also includes Bitcoin being the gold standard network for NFTs. Meaning, if you want your NFT to have a good shot at lasting \"forever,\" Bitcoin is the best chain to mint it on. And might as well do it with Counterparty as it is 100% on-chain.What inevitable360 \"made\" isn't actually an NFT -- its simply an image hash embedded in the OP_RETURN field of a Dogecoin transaction, which is actually the field Counterparty (and Dogeparty) uses for its transaction data. The main difference is Counterparty/Dogeparty data is encrypted and interpreted by a protocol run by a node.A while back I actually recreated his transaction and sent it to myself and to him as well, so now there are 3 copies of his \"NFT\" out there.  You can verify it by checking the content of the OP_RETURN field as shown in the block explorer in each transaction.(which is funny because you're not supposed to be able to \"copy\" an NFT -- that's one of the things that makes it an NFT -- nevermind the fact he never actually built a protocol that transfers it)So yeah, the tech behind Counterparty has been quietly brilliant for over 8 years now. Its what has allowed Rare Pepes to have such huge success, as well as Spells of Genesis and several later projects. Its pretty much tamper-proof as there is no way to trick the protocol into copying tokens or giving you other peoples' tokens.There's a pretty strong scene of artists in Counterparty at the moment. Dogeparty lags in this department, but also has its own scene, albeit much smaller.",

But its not even a token to begin with, because there is no smart contract or protocol guided by an enforceable set of rules to define its properties or move it with.For example, if I mint myself a Bored Ape using my own contract, just copying the original contract, it won't magically be added to OpenSea's collection of Bored Apes with all the others. This is because Bored Apes have individually defined properties assigned to them through their particular contract.People had been embedding image-related data in Dogecoin OP_RETURN transactions years prior but nobody ever claimed them to be NFTs. By Feb 2014, there had already been quite a few images put on the Bitcoin blockchain this way:http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.htmlHowever, since they lack a means of transfer, they are not tokens.",

      "body": "Today let's mention a few of my NFT bags.I bought these b/c I believe they fit the Historical NFT Thesis (as stated above) and will increase in value as more collectors enter the crypto economy. I also try to buy stuff that is aesthetically pleasing to me. This combination rules out just about everything on Ethereum. These are all somewhat affordable compared to the ridiculous price tags of some leading NFT brands.Up first, we have DOGECOINCARD on Counterparty (BTC). This is from Spells of Genesis, a project that is considered to be the first crypto collectible series. It was a trading card game that still works to this day (kinda). Cards for the game could be purchased or won in-game by completing certain requirements. DOGECOINCARD didn't actually serve a function in the game but it looks cool.Next up we have Adam Bomb on WAX. Adam Bomb is the most recognizable and iconic of the Garbage Pail Kids series, which started out as trading cards in 1985. Adam Bomb is card #8 of series 1. The first two years of GPK got released as NFTs on WAX before Topps pulled the plug on them. Nevertheless, Adam Bomb NFTs are somewhat scarce and a cool digital artifact to own.For #3 we have JOLLYROGER, which is a Dogeparty token (DOGE) from Aug. 19, 2014 (coming up on its 8th birthday next week). JOLLYROGER is HUGE because it is one of the first instances of somebody ever using a blockchain protocol to associate an image with a token. It predates anything like it on Bitcoin or Ethereum. With a supply of 550, it is somewhat limited and considered to be the \"Dogeparty Grail Token.\"The final item for today, we have LORDKEK, which is one of the most famous Rare Pepes. With a supply of only 10 and a market cap of $163 million, its pretty near-impossible to buy a whole LORDKEK and whole ones seldom change hands. Since it is a divisible token, however, you can buy mere satoshis-worth of one at a time (which is how I buy it, and I own but a tiny fraction of one, lol). It is said that LORDKEK brings good luck to all who hold it, and my few satoshis worth of one still look cool sitting in my Counterwallet.",
