I really don't think it matters. We see newbies manage bounties all the time because many of those projects don't want to pay a quality campaign manager. And still those campaigns get plenty of attention. Why would you want to involve yourself with bounties anyways? Is it worth being a bounty hunter right now? Have you been paid properly for your services in the last year or two to make you want more?",

I would suggest you to first improve your post quality and grow your account's rank to a reasonable \"Member\" or higher. Without this basic workup, nobody is going to give you any importance.Beyond that you should start working as a trainee manager under some reputed manager who might also be looking for an \"Apprentice/Intern\" to reduce their own workload. They can help you get a job under their name and allow you to manage it while supervising it themselves.But this second stage is far from anything close for your account, so you need to work on your rank first. Having been a bounty spammer, very few people will take interest in you, but I am of the opinion that any person can outgrow their habits and become someone worthy, so good luck!",

Thanks in advance.If you sincerely wish to be bounty manager you can achieve that, I am not a signature manager or a bounty manager but I have known how things work here to an extent. You need two things to get started. 1.Forum Requirements 2. Skills Requirements. In the forum requirements, you need to be able to make good posts, you need to be able to build your reputation. You can build your reputation by how longer you stay here, atleast rank up and be trusted by some forum members and then understand how other managers manages to succeed. In the skills requirements, you should be able to know how to work with spreadsheets, update enticing ANN threads and be able to know how to detect cheaters. Then you will be good to go.",

But sorry if i'm hard on you, but your profile record is not actually impressive at all, but its never late to start anew, because everybody here was once a Newbie till we grew to the rank we are today. it wasn't easy, but we never let the difficulty stop us from making constant effort each blessed day, and today we could be proud of not giving up, and you too can do it if you mean it. And this moment, i will be giving you the chance to become that bounty, and not just bounty but a future campaign manager on this forum by giving you 1 merit to rank you up as a ''Jr. Member''. so this is my chance to you, and i expect you to have a U-turn to from this day start adding value to the forum.
