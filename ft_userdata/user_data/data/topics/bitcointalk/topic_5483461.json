Because I was also thinking in same direction because if the site he mentioned was as unsecured as he said, I believe by now everybody's wallet would have been compromised by now.

I'd like to extend this warning to: \"AND do not look up your private key on a webpage showing (tabbed) lists of all keys\".I've seen those sites listing \"all\" keys in tabbed pages with a couple hundred keys per page, using an easy way to drill down to the page with a list also containing your key. A malicious person could look into their webserver's log, look at which pages were visited by non-bot looking users, then try the 100 keys on each visited page... It would be a really easy way of bruteforcing since it would reduce the attack vector by a huuuuuuuuge factor.",
