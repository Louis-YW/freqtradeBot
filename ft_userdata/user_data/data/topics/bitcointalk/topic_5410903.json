And everybody who tells you otherwise is either lying or overconfident. Sure, you can look at a lot of factors and make a prediction, but even the best predictions are still predictions.",

Even if bitcoin price fall further, likely it is not going to fall below $17500, if it continues to fall further, it would only slightly fall further. If you are able to hold till 2024/2025, people will fomo after 2024 halving and all-time-time is possible.",

I suggest to you that you familiarize yourself with it if you don't want to keep worrying about the constant price changes of bitcoin.",

Because it decides how you will react in the market and make your decisions.QuoteI want to know from you, is the price of Bitcoin likely to fall further?Please read two topicsIs Bitcoin bottom there yet? Fear & Greed, Pi Cycle Top / BottomBitcoin Hash Ribbons Buy Signal 19/08Likely Bitcoin is finding its bottom but it seems the bottom has not there yet. It can be a deeper range but is it important if you have chance to buy Bitcoin around $20k and 4 years or 8 years later, you will be able to sell it above $100k - not mention higher price.",

I want to know from you, is the price of Bitcoin likely to fall further?I understand your frustration as you might be one of the people that hold BTC or are in a bullish position on the spots/futures trading. Any which one it is, it's good to be a speculator to avoid this feeling. However, I don't think it's proper to emphatically say Bitcoin will rise or fall at this moment, but it has a long-term bearish trend. This does not still mean it won't buy but I will regard it's buying as a correction of a broader bearish trend until it breaches above 25214.61 (August high) and 26337.38 (A weekly chart trendline resistance).You might want to regularly visit https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410763.msg60799289#msg60799289 for updates on what Bitcoin might do.",

I want to know from you, is the price of Bitcoin likely to fall further?you should do some research before buying bitcoin, there's a lot in this forum where you can get information about price analysis and speculation, although sometimes it's not useful at alli don't think bitcoin will go to $10k and the price of $20k is already cheap, my advice is to make it a long term investment and come back again in the next few years you will see a fantastic bitcoin price increase, hold on and don't panic",

However, you should understand that the market is volatile and unstable because there are factors that affect the price movement. And obviously the news like this; https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2022/08/crypto-minings-energy-consumption-draws-additional-concern-lawmakers/376028/.As far as you second question, no one has the crystal ball and we don't know what the future holds. So I will just suggest that you should invest what you can afford to lose so that you won't get nervous and panic every time the price goes down because for sure you will see them a lot if you chooses to stay in bitcoin market.",

That's what you call price movement, bitcoin is not going on a parabolic rise, and I don't see even in traditional market, an asset that will go on a continue rise. That's the first thing that you should learn in bitcoin price movement.Quote from: Rockstar3 on August 23, 2022, 08:36:18 AMI want to know from you, is the price of Bitcoin likely to fall further?As per TA, we are still in the bearish state, meaning chances are, the price will likely to suffer a downtrend. I suggest you go around this board though, there are a lot of members you share their views on the price movement with their analysis. It is not 100% accurate, but their wisdom and the knowledge their share is priceless and you will learn a lot from them.",

You bought Bitcoins and want to sell them but canâ€™t do it now as the price is low?Then my friend let me tell you that this is just a bear market, once the bear market gets over, BTC price will skyrocket and no one can touch it.I am so confident of Bitcoins as Bitcoins are limited in supply and the market cap is really big. So definitely the price will go up. Just wait and have patience.",

And only you yourself will find the answer and try to do your research and find the best information to calm you down a bit.before you get involved do you understand and study well especially that the price of bitcoin is very volatile which means the price can change significantly from time to time, and bitcoin will be fine for the long term and take advantage of the downturn to buy it, and hold it.",

I want to know from you, is the price of Bitcoin likely to fall further?In fact, the price even exceeded $25 000, but it seems that I and some others were right when we assumed that we will not stay that high for long - because Bitcoin is still only a means of profit for some, preferably a short-term one. People who bought under $20 000 are quite happy that they sold at a price above $25 000, so there's really no reason to be confused, because that's how the market works.Quote from: Yaunfitda on August 23, 2022, 12:09:48 PMWho wouldn't disappointed when you see your portfolio going down? The OP is more focused on some other cryptocurrencies that obviously take up too much of his time, and that's why some things about Bitcoin seem strange to him - although it is clear to most that in a bear market one should not expect any spectacular things when it comes to the price.",

Bitcoin doesn't know you or has a human attribute that you will use the word disappointed. It is a cryptocurrency that is either used as investment and store of value depending on the aspect you intend for it to be used.Quote from: Rockstar3 on August 23, 2022, 08:36:18 AMBecause last week its price was 24000 dollars but now it shows 21 thousand dollars.

It is traded from different exchanges and p2p so the interaction of supply and demand or buy and sell results to volatility affecting the price.",

The difference of $3k ($24k-21k) is not so significant against this background. If you don't learn to keep your emotions under control, then I assure you, even greater disappointments await in front of you. It is likely that the bitcoin price may fall even lower over the next 2-3 years, because this happens during a bearish trend. There is nothing unusual about this and it has been repeatedly repeated in previous cycles. You will get used to it if you can keep btc in your hands until this cycle is completed.",

And I will say that if you have experience a full cycle (bearish and bullish cycle), you will slowly start to understand why the market needs to go down like what we are experiencing. For the reasons, maybe you can search around this community or go to some crypto related websites.
