Sending email will not be a problem because I do not think the email will not go through, but their may be no response from the developers or customer care. Their admins are not known to the public, why should people trust them. I can not trust that kind on service. I did not login because I do not have an account with them. Also I do not know about the withdrawal, but withdrawal is the most important thing. If no one can withdraw their money for some days now with their admin not saying anything yet, this can be a possibly scam.",

      "body": "Actions like service disruptions wihout a single word from the team greatly lowers down my confidence on a service. Looking at the messages on their TG group, it appears disruptions started more or less two weeks ago and up until now, no word from the team.Seeing how their Twitter handle last tweeted almost a year ago doesn't help either. Emails bouncing back due to recipient's full mailbox could be a sign of neglect as well - not saying it can't be intentional. I tried sending an email as well and got the same error so it's not fixed yet.Worth noting that tippin.me changed hands at the end of 2021. It's safe to assume it's not the same old anymore.Quote from: https://nitter.it/eiprol/status/1472880428612739074Today I can finally announce that I won't be managing Tippin anymore.It's been a really insightful journey, but it's time to move on.

In this post, I seek to warn and inform users of the possible risks associated with using Tippin.me, as well as offer guidance on best practices when dealing with third-party services.Tippin.me's lightning node has been down for an extended period, and their support channelsâ€”including Telegram, Twitter, and emailâ€”have gone silent. Many users, myself included, have found themselves unable to access their funds.Although the front end of the Tippin.me website remains functional, users are unable to log in and withdraw their funds. Attempting to log in via the site or the Chrome extension results in an \"Internal exception\" error message. Users who logged into the Chrome extension long ago, when Tippin.me was still active, can see their balances but are unable to withdraw, encountering the same \"Internal exception\" error.A glance at the support channels mentioned on their site reveals numerous disheartened comments from users desperately seeking answers.This situation serves as a cautionary tale for those using third-party services like WalletOfSatoshi. It is essential to minimize the amount of funds held on these platforms, ensuring that only an amount you can afford to lose is at risk. Stay vigilant, and always prioritize the security of your assets.I hope this warning helps prevent others from falling victim to this potential scam and encourages users to exercise caution when using similar services.With the information in the quote above, maybe crypto users in general are aware and can avoid the Tippin.me scam now and in the future.",

It seems due to their hot wallet being dried, which quite concerning as it could means they uses their users' fund elsewhere, so yeah, definitely a ticking bomb waiting to explode.",

They shouldn't be inactive though when the hot wallet is empty.",

I will be telling my friends who use services like WalletOfSatoshi to avoid it.",

It's unfortunate they had such experience but they should receive the blame for entrusting their assets and funds to a third party when they can easily own a wallet where they could privately store their assets and have control over it. This would serve them a lesson so in their next investment they would learn to create a wallet and keep their funds Under their own custody and this would make them be very much careful with their investment and conducting proper research before taking any steps as regards funds and investment.",
