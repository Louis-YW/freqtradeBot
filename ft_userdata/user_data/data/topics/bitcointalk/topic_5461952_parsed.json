I doubt someone here take a screenshot of balance regularly after playing in the casino. And what kind of compensation you will give to the victim and what kind of circumstances for the classification of bonus. I think making your offer in public is much better and just provide a tier system to measure how you categorize bonus on each victim instead of having this discreet offer. Btw this is a nice initiative to help victim but please wagering requirements should be very fair for the victim or else this is just a regular promotion to lure victim to your casino.",

      "body": "Great one from TrustDice, But forgive me if i sound a bit non enthusiastic with the bonus offer, with the wager requirement that accompany this bonus, i bet this is just you guys disguising a bonus to gain new customers to your casino and as well make some money off the betnomi victims, I understand you guys run a business and not a charity organization, and its up to you guys to do your stuff in a way you think is best for your business, but please don't mock the victims of the betnomy exit scam, you could have still launched this bonus without using the betnomy victims as the primary focus/target, but if you really wanna help them, then do so without the wager requirement, since i believe you guys must already have a system in place through which you can verify that anybody applying for the bonus truly lost money on betnomy, with such system , there is no way the bonus can be abused, there is no need for the wager requirement, except like i said before, you guys just want to make money off the victims .Anyways, this is just my opinion, fortunately, I am not a victim, but i am just stating what i think.",

I will suggest they communicate with the betnomi team to get proper statistics of the affected members so as to facilitate the process without any challenge. If the need be, both parties should be able to give out codes to each member affected while trust dice holds such codes in their custody that any one who provides a code will be checked in and possibly all the details would be seen  with the amount of funds held.

We have designed a sophisticated set of metrics to handle this no access situation of Betnomi. This took us a while to contemplate. What I can tell you all is that a legit victim of Betnomi will 100% have at least some of the required proofs. I would advise scammers to think twice before wasting time forging fake proofs for our bonus! We are prepared. Quote from: Coin_trader on August 03, 2023, 01:26:12 PMBtw this is a nice initiative to help victim but please wagering requirements should be very fair for the victim or else this is just a regular promotion to lure victim to your casino.Based on the proofs we receive, we will do our best to provide higher and less restrictive bonus to those with legit proofs, as far as being allowed by our Risk Management team. But for those non-victim scammers who attempt to abuse our good faith, we will deny offering bonus. For those with proofs sitting in between, we will still try to offer bonuses  for the benefit of doubt, but it will has more restrictions. Quote from: Wapfika on August 03, 2023, 02:45:49 PMI doubt that they can benefit on it since this bonus might be abused by those users that will claim that they are Betnomi players. I’m not sure on how they will validate all the claim but I’m sure they have some method which they need to be discreet to avoid abuse.Well, unfortunately, this is what crypto industry always looks like and there are always abusers/scammers. What we can do is try to spot them out based on our knowledge and knowhow. Quote from: notblox1 on August 03, 2023, 02:21:56 PMCan you explain what this trustdice validation means how exactly?

It is just some proofs that an actual Betnomi victim will very likely have. They will help us to validate if an applicant is truly a victim of Betnomi exit scam, or some pathetic abuser who's trying to take advantage of someone's loss. Thank you all again.TrustDice Team",

If they are prepared since its been mentionedabove then it wont really be that an issue or something that we would be worried upon.",

I've been seeing comments in here talking about how \"this tactic is taking advantage of people that have lost on the Betnomi exit scam\" like dude this is more than what most of you guys would do to people that lost their money in there. Nobody even offered some form of assistance when Betnomi's in the talks the past few weeks because of their shady behavior prior to them dipping and now you're discrediting the condolence bonus just because it came from an enterprise? That's just low guys. Best we could do is offer more help to people who helped and are in need of help especially since Betnomi's got a good standing and trust network in this forum for a while until they did this, so for sure there are a lot of victims. Pass this info along, start your own campaign to help the victims, be part of the change not someone who's against it.",
