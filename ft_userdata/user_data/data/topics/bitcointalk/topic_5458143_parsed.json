I imagine that Binance and Coinbase will seize the opportunity to carve out this market full of users and will therefore offer greater guarantees accordingly to avoid actions similar to what the SEC is currently doing.",

It will come sooner or later we just do not know exactly when it will start or if it has already started and what the next steps are going to look like.Although with the latest news from the UK is definitely one of the bigger signs that something is happening or will happen soon. Look at all the financial institutions, getting ready and filling their bags with Bitcoin. It is no secret that once the SEC admits there is nothing in the way of using Bitcoin as legal tender, the world will basically change the fiat system for the Bitcoin one.I am however concerned how the UK tends to make bad regulation decisions. Especially regarding crypto.",

It is way more than cryptocurrencies or exchanges. It is the bid to control. Like a child willing to go his own way, but the parents can't allow it, even if such child stops bearing its name.The fear of the unknown is greater than the fear of what is known. Perhaps, if crypto is allowed but regulated, and taxed, the battle on terroristic inclinations and criminality would be reduced seeing no ghosts exist, and a crypto address is no longer an anonymous entity.",

I am imagining what if China removes its ban on the crypto industry and accepts it fully but I also know the chances here are too less because they have already using the crypto via their second system of Hong Kong and you must hear many news related to HK.Just like recently, I heard the news of HBSC bank in HK applying for BTC ETF is being hyped among users by CTs and different Social media outlets. Just to increase the adoption and dominance of BTC.And coming to the point of why they are in favor of crypto now like the overnight swing of mood. That is what i think is wrong, this was already prepared by them because to successfully make people depend on their products they have to eliminate the existence of their rivals from the market. I hope you understand what I am trying to say (Binance and Coinbase). They might also come up with many statements against BTC too but never utter a word against BTC only talking about six currencies as security. This was already planned by them or maybe i am being too skeptical here. Let's see where this trail will end.",
