      "body": "Those are saved in your wallet.dat file so if there are transactions listed there, those txns were previously sent/received with that wallet.If you want you can export the wallet's \"hdseed\" from dumpwallet and then use sethdseed command to import it to a new 'blank' 'non-descriptor' wallet.The new wallet will have the same keys but wont contain any transactions until it synced.Alternatively, you can import the dump file with importwallet command.If it's a descriptor wallet, export the private descriptors via listdescriptors true command.Then import those to a new 'blank' 'descriptor' wallet via importdescriptors command on each descriptor.Anyways, those transactions should reappear once the wallet is synced so I can't see the reason on doing this.",
