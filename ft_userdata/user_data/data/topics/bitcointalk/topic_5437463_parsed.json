  "content": "As a things of currency indeed our great leaders are trying but must are still expected from them.     In case of this new Naira the government has made individual to oppose the rejection of old Naira without the disbursement of the new Naira to banks which has made things unbearable to citizen's   Some citizens find it difficult to travel those in others area find it difficult to return and most importantly in aspects of commercial activity citizens can no longer buy food items and store including market are been locked as a result of no disbursement of new Naira which is resulting to starvation in some areas.    Student are been stranded in institution due to pending releasement of new Naira due to the fact that most trader don't deal with E-commerce they rather take in cash than accept transfer. Worse of it is that is only the masses this policy is been affected and not those in political power. So our leaders should be reasonable in some cases",

There is no enough money in circulation and the worst part of the issue is that in some areas shops do not accept mobile transfer so how do they expect us to feed you even have money but you can’t spend it. People are really going through alot this period.I don’t even see the need of changing the notes in the first place",

Both the old and the Young the small and the great the rich and the poor are all affected. The thing right now is that I cannot lay the blame on small and medium-scale businesses such as the food vendor, the hairstylist, those who show groceries for daily needs for not accepting transfer. They have to pay extra charges when the need to withdraw the money to restock their store. They might end up running at a loss. That's how difficult it is.",

Worse of it is that is only the masses this policy is been affected and not those in political power. So our leaders should be reasonable in some casesMost traders not dealing with e-commerce is the more reason for the forced implementation of this new money policy. Government wants the citizens to learn about the new e-commerce policies so that we can begin to grasp the concept and apply it. You will notice that more payments and transactions is now done using transfers and CBDC. Also I think the oncoming elections has affected Naira in so many ways. It will get better after this period.",

There is a certain amount you can collect for on POS,down here 3000 is the highest and the last time,which was on Friday my friend went to the bank hopefully to withdraw bit couldn't because of no cash issues. Imagine say bank run out of cash,then wetin make dem be bank. I hope things will go back to the way it is after election. All these are strategy which one party wants to use to oppress their rival. Can these traders adapt to cashless policy ? In the sense that now the shops and stores,most of them don't accept transfer.",
