In my opinion, it would be more likely that they aren't really supporting much open-source development/projects and are instead funding their own technology/agendas...especially in the current state of the market and after recent events that they were likely exposed to.",

Here are some ways in which these companies might contribute:Internal contributions: They might use and extend open source software for internal purposes, but these changes are not always made public.Bug fixes and enhancements: They might provide bug fixes and enhancements to open source software they use and make these changes available to the community. These changes might be submitted as pull requests, or they might be shared through other means such as mailing lists or forums.Sponsorship: These companies might sponsor the development and maintenance of open source software by providing funding or other resources to the development community.Hiring open source contributors: They might hire individuals who are active contributors to open source projects, which can help drive development of the projects they use.Open sourcing their own software: They might choose to open source some of their own software to benefit the wider development community and encourage collaboration.It's worth noting that the extent to which companies participate in open source can vary. Some companies might be more active in terms of contributing code and resources, while others might focus more on using open source software as part of their overall technology stack.",

To continue doing that, he needs to get sponsorship from some company, work another job, or get donations from Patreon etc. So far, the most notable response comes from individual donations. So, this practice is definitely not new.From what I've read so far, open-source organizations contribute more to open-source development. Individual donations from other developers or enthusiasts are also more common compared to business backing unless they are the ones who create it or they want to make it exclusive for their needs. Other than lack of profits/exposure, or the lack of means to do so (small business, etc) I don't see other reasons why they don't do it, which is probably why more projects are doing their DAO thing right now.

CMIIW.Generally, companies tend to donate to projects similar to the industry they are in. Hence why Red Hat mostly donates to FOSS software for example.Some larger projects that are used by pretty much everything and can stand on their own have a list of sponsors - you can find these all around Github but I can't pull any concrete examples off the top of my head.",

They know about it because it's using IBM a supercomputer hardware and obviously they want it to succeed.And it does work out and it does succeed. BUT, since it was developed on IBM hardware (before IBM got involved in giving money) it will run better on IBM hardware then any other supercomputer because that is what it was developed on. Do you think people are going to not care, or do you think they are going to scream that IBM is trying to take over BTC or some such nonsense. So they either help out under the table so people don't know. Or they just skip the headache and don't help.Once again, just my opinion. -Dave",

Or does individual developer who don't belong to any organization usually receive less funding even though their projects are popular?

If someone at Google told a programmer to go do X and it then gets released by the programmer as open source unless they attribute it back to their boss telling them to do it we may just know it as the DaveF tool. Most of the time there will be some recognition, other times it's just put out there.Years ago (20+) was, an open source video codec that was written by someone working for a DVR manufacturer. HE open sourced it, with their permission, but without noting that it was done while working for them at at their request. Because,  at that time it did not do what they wanted with what they had to work with. A few years later when they started using it on some hardware, people were screaming that they stole this guys work. Who worked for them and was paid to develop it for them..... But there were a few weeks when shit was blowing up about it.....Had that not happened, that codec would have just sat there as open source never knowing that megacorp paid to develop it.-Dave",
