  "content": "I've just learned that a security issue was discovered by Binarly. They shared their researches in the Black Hat Europe 2023.Quote from: https://www.blackhat.com/eu-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#logofail-security-implications-of-image-parsing-during-system-boot-35042Everyone loves to customize and personalize their own devices: from text editors to background pictures, from operating systems to keyboard shortcuts, each device is almost unique. One of the most exotic customizations, done either for personal tastes or for company branding, is personalizing the logo displayed by the BIOS during boot. But what are the security implications of parsing user-supplied (a.k.a. \"attacker-controlled\") logo images during boot? Aren't we jumping back straight to 2009, when Rafal Wojtczuk and Alexander Tereshkin exploited a BMP parser bug in UEFI reference code… right?!Enter LogoFAIL, our latest research revealing significant security vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries used by nearly all BIOS vendors to display logo images during boot. Our research highlights the risks associated with parsing complex file formats at such a delicate stage of the platform startup. During this talk, we will show how some UEFI BIOSes allow attackers to store custom logo images, which are parsed during boot, on the EFI system partition (ESP) or inside unsigned sections of a firmware update. We also shed light on the implications of these vulnerabilities, which extend beyond mere graphical rendering. In fact, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to hijack the execution flow and achieve arbitrary code execution. LogoFAIL vulnerabilities can compromise the security of the entire system rendering \"below-the-OS\" security measures completely ineffective (e.g., Secure Boot). Finally, our talk will include a detailed explanation of how we successfully escalate privileges from OS to firmware level by exploiting a real device vulnerable to LogoFAIL.We disclosed our findings to different device vendors (Intel, Acer, Lenovo) and to the major UEFI IBVs (AMI, Insyde, Phoenix). While we are still in the process of understanding the actual extent of LogoFAIL, we already found that hundreds of consumer- and enterprise-grade devices are possibly vulnerable to this novel attack.If you want more details about it, there is a link to the said presentation: https://i.blackhat.com/EU-23/Presentations/EU-23-Pagani-LogoFAIL-Security-Implications-of-Image_REV2.pdfDirect link of Binarly article:  https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/Other articles : 1 , 2In this case, Windows and Linux users are both concerned ; as this exploit is related to the BIOSI am not a tech security expert, but guys, we should all be carefull and update our BIOS firmware as soon as possible. The main computer manufacturers are (probably) already working on an update.",

      "body": "Quote from: https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/Normally, the logo is read directly from a firmware volume. Since the volumes are often signed and protected by a hardware-based Verified Boot technology (e.g., Intel Boot Guard), an attacker cannot store a custom logo there — that’s it, as long as the OEM private keys used to sign these sections are not leaked affecting the entire industry. But in this case, an attacker wouldn't care about the logo at all, because it allows them to inject any custom modules instead.In other cases, OEM-specific customizations allow users to supply their own logo, so attackers can do that too. Most of these OEMs-specific customization read the logo from the EFI System Partition (ESP), a disk partition that is used by system firmware to load additional software such as boot loaders.If i understood correctly, it seems admin/root permission needed to change image of the BIOS in first place. So people who take security of their device seriously is less likely to be affected.Quote from: paid2 on December 08, 2023, 11:29:36 AMI am not a tech security expert, but guys, we should all be carefull and update our BIOS firmware as soon as possible. The main computer manufacturers are (probably) already working on an update.On other hand, updating BIOS/UEFI is one way to break your device if you're not being careful or you're being unlucky where your device lose power. Although some device these days have dual BIOS to prevent that from happening.",

      "body": "Although interesting, it's really not that big a deal. If somebody has enough access to your machine to update or edit your BIOS or if your BIOS updates and you don't know why. You probably are already compromised in some other way. Yes another vulnerability is bad, but stressing out over this one should not be done. Also, BIOS files usually have to be signed by the manufacturer before they will install. If you're installing an unsigned BIOS you can already kiss some of your security goodbye.-Dave",
