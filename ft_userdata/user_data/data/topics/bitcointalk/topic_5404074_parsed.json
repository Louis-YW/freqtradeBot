  "content": "I’ve created a list of interesting Bitcoin statistics, where useful data is accessible for everyone. In addition to simple statistics such as price, I’ve included statistics for a wide range of topics, such as mining, popularity in individual countries, share of addresses on which a certain amount of Bitcoin is stored, when and how much Bitcoin was moved last time, various Bitcoin network statistics and much more. Since we have statistics for almost everything, only the most important things should really be listed here to get a high quality list. Table1. CoinMarketCap / CoinGecko / etc.1.1.

I have been seeing the graph that represented bitcoin from far back 2010, it is great. And to be very frank, there is no rocket science in bitcoin, an there is absolutely nothing new that is happening in bitcoin. Everything is represented in the graph. A careful study of the graphs should give everyone (especially newbies) the reassurance that bitcoin is safe amidst this bearish market. Charts never lies! No wonder good traders who know about chart keep winning and the majority that try their luck keep loosing.Thanks 1miau, strong hands hardly create threads, but when they do, it carries alot of value.
