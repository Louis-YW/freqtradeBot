Ideally you should get the size right before linking to them but, failing that, you can use the \"width\" attribute on the \"img\" tag like this:Code:[img width=100]https://i.postimg.cc/nVFVN93Q/Unconvinced.jpg[/img]Result:",

No, if you change your e-mail and your password you shouldn't edit your bitcoin address because it could show that the account has been sold or hacked by someone and is not trustable anymore. Your account could be red tagged for that. If you need to change your Bitcoin address staked, you shouldn't edit the former one but just add a new one while explaining why you need to change your staked address in a signed message from a former address posted on the forum or giving explanations why you can't access to your former addresses anymore. But I wouldn't make trades with someone who just changed his email, password and BTC staked address together, without a regular signed message from a former address.",

On most cases, and as far as I know, when you change an email, it should send a verification code to the email which is currently being used. I never changed my email here so I can't tell it they have this security here, but I do think that that bitcointalk developers has added this security measure. And for the staked address, I do not think that you should edit it. Maybe sign a signature message there and add your new bitcoin address if you want. Afterwards, it is necessary to sign a message using that new address.",

      "body": "Changing one’s email and or password, whilst relatively trivial from the perspective of what one needs to do on the forum’s software, might be viewed from a wider angle in terms of account security. As such, at the time, and after a quick re-read now, I found the following thread to be worth a whip through: [Guide] Bitcointalk account security. It does lack images though, what can I say …Now here’s an unbecoming anecdote on the matter: I currently don’t memorize my password, since I rely on a password manager to keep track of that. I’m also logged-in for the most on the device I use to access the forum, so I don’t often resort to using the password. Now to test if my password was in order, I tried to log in on a different browser, and lo and behold, the password I had in my password manager was being rejected as invalid. After trying a couple of times getting the same result (insanity cropping-up), I resorted to changing the password. The change of password in the said scenario cannot be done within the forum (on my logged-in session) since I/my password manager had \"forgotten\" my current password (which is required to complete the procedure). I therefore resorted to changing it by clicking the \"forgot your password\" on the login page (of my other browser). From there on, easy peasy: I received an email with a link to follow in order to change my password, and went through with it.I can only guess that I didn’t actually save my last password change on my password manager, and had actually my previously one stored there. Seems weird, and also somewhat distant in time, but it would be a plausible explanation.",

When I booted it up again, it wouldn't accept the password I had configured. I kept trying different variations and was getting pretty confused. I even had to suffer the indignity of being told to \"be more careful next time\" and could only grimace and nod my head.Then, somehow, trying the password I had already tried 10 times before actually worked! Once it booted, I started typing the password into a text editor on a hunch and discovered that the keyboard was (intermittently) dropping keys which allowed me to redeem myself in the eyes of Mr. BeMoreCareful and improved my mood greatly.",
