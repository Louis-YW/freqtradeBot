STO industry in crypto is now long dead due to the SEC interference. All the list above except this one is really unexpected to happened.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on April 01, 2023, 01:07:25 PM•What ways have you exercised hope after setbacks or failure?Stay away on crypto for some time, Don’t chase loss and invest slowly until you fully recover through consistent small profit. Consistency on what you are doing is the best method to do to overcome failure.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on April 01, 2023, 01:07:25 PM•What lessons can we learn from your experience?Never invest without doing research.

The collapse of FTX made me feel concerned how unfair it was to those that lost their asset then, mostly the crypto newbies who just started crypto investment but had their coin in FXT, which failed with the coins of these newbies, which will definitely make them feel bad and or raise a bad perception in them.But not to mention all, those that also lost almost all their assets in the Terra Luna collapse had a terrible experience, but giving up is the worst thing to do because life itself is not a bed of roses or a bed of stones. Some people choose go through what they cannot handle such as going into crypto investment with the hope of making millions in a couple of weeks or months. As such, they make a lot of mistakes, like taking the wrong advice or letting their emotions guide their decisions.There are always those unofficial rules in crypto space:Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.Don't store your coins on the centralized exchange.Don't give your wallet phrase to anyone.If you don't hold, you won't be rich.Buy the dip and etc.",

Diversify into more than two altcoins, this will automatically reduce your risk. I would simply say do not call alticoins accumulation an investment rather if you feel the hype around the coin and your are looking at gaining from it then you could simply gamble on it. But having lots of Alticoins and calling it diversification of portfolio and looking to save them for long is just like setting one up for a whole lot of risk",

The sector is so unpredictable that anything can happen within a few minutes which can lead to the rise or fall of any crypto-related firm or product. FTX was one of the leading exchanges that was seen as a stable and reliable investment. They have invested heavily in advertising sponsoring many key sports competitions and signing expensive endorsements with some key sports personalities. The firm was also a major donor of political parties. With all these credentials, I never thought FTX will collapse.I always knew that SEC was a major anti-bitcoin force because of their constant criticism of the sector. Their attacks didn't come as a surprise because the government will always want to control the global financial sector.I was expecting Bitcoin to rise next year and its consistent gains recently is a surprise to me. Many crypto analysts never predicted that the price will keep recovering because I always heard them forecast that recovery will be next year.I have learned to always expect any surprises from the bitcoin sector. Also, we should invest only what we can afford to lose since we cannot predict the industry accurately. Lastly, we should follow and execute our investment plans regardless of the market situation. Hold your coin if that's what is in your plan and don't mind any distraction.",

Shitcoins collapse regularly, they only grow because they get hyped and pumped, when there's no more new buyers, they enter a freefall. Centralized exchanges and other crypto services also tend to collapse because they often engage in unsustainable practices instead of running a honest business - because they are not fully regulated and audited.

Either we are frustrated and give up, or we gain valuable life experience that will certainly help us overcome the next trouble in the future. You should not consider failure as a problem, but you should see it as an opportunity to show your abilities and become stronger.Always keep faith in yourself and hope.
