Can you please point me in the right direction?Quote from: Leviathan.007 on January 22, 2023, 09:49:40 AMIn order to take down this project please report the website to their registrar (In this case NameCheap).Just checked and saw their registrar is actually \"Gabia\".- You were probably checking multiple Whois results at the time.",

I checked their site and did not see anything related to what you mentioned about the 3% profit. What I found is that their project is proceeding legally. Their platform provides services such as a decentralized exchange, wallet, NFT market, and more, in addition to staking the project currency, which is WEMIX. So do you call the project Ponzi from the staking profits? Please clarify, as it seems that you have problems with the south Korean project team.",

However, after the comments I saw, I will do more investigation about the project and will update the topic on time. Thanks for the Note ~I'll lock until update",
