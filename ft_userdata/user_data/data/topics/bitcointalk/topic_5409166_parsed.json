  "content": "Hello,I have a somewhat unusual request. Namely, it is about an erroneous transaction. I accidentally sent an unlisted token to my KuCoin address. The amount has been credited to my address, but does not show up in my KuCoin account, it only shows up in the block explorer.I have been in contact with support for some time now, however I am constantly being turned away and not directed to the technical department. Since KuCoin have the private keys to this address, there is also a technical way to recover the tokens from my KuCoin address.Support has already admitted that the tokens can be saved once they implement the token. Only no one can tell me if this will ever happen.So now my call to the community: I offer 1000 USD of the saved amount to the person who provides the crucial help to save the tokens.Maybe someone who knows a member of the technical team at KuCoin and persuades them to take up my case. As I said, the support refuses to take up the matter, although I have already assured that I will pay for their effort.I can send a screenshot of my KuCoin account and the link to the address in Block Explorer if needed. So everyone can make sure that this is a real request and not a scam.Anyone who can help me, please drop me a personal message.Thanks",

Since you already contacted them and they said that they will recover your token once the token is already listed on their platform. Why not contact the developer of that token and try to request to add this token to Kucoin?What exactly is the token are you talking about?",

Even you offer 1k here, someone might just pretend to help you with the process and scam you.If the token credited on the exchange isnt supported by them, the chance is slight, especially it will take time for them to get that but I think its not impossible. But if the expenses for recovering that ia huge Im sure could negotiate and bargain with them. But honestly a mistake like that is a sin on crypto. You should always be careful on dealing with sending funds. They always have a warning to not send tokens not supported by their exchange and might got loss.",

      "body": "Of course it is my fault. I converted a test amount of the token to the native coin and successfully sent it to my receiving address on KuCoin.Then the next day I did the same with the main amount again, only I forgot to convert the token to the coin first and then send it. Instead, I mistakenly sent the token directly.Since both addresses are identical and the address was suggested to me directly by my sending wallet, I unfortunately only noticed the error afterwards.The support is just brushing me off. I think they just have the policy of not retreiving tokens manually. Binance instead is offering this service for a fee.This is the problem, the technical solution exists, I just cannot get to a technician directly because support is shielding them off.This is why I call for your help desperately, I just would need the right contacts to get the retreiving process going. So if anyone of you could connect me to the right persons inside KuCoin and they retreive the token, I would pay you the bounty.",

This incident is consider as loss but if you give a try to contact them from time to time and tell them if it possible to be claim then state that you are willing to pay a convenience fee for recovery maybe they will take action to your issue.",

Their policy in such cases is very clear, but your problem is specific considering that they do not support that token - which further complicates the whole situation.From everything I have had the opportunity to read over the years, most CEX avoid such procedures because they represent a security risk, and this is also something that cannot be done by any employee, but specially trained persons. Maybe your best chance is to listen to the advice and take a detour in the sense of trying to convince the owner to try adding that token to the exchange.Edit :I didn't know there was an official BTT account of that exchange, so there is someone you can complain to even on the forum.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2592830",

Not only that but you might become a good target for a scammer who will try to retrieve and steal some of your personal information, phish you, or try to scam you in some other way.I only see two legit ways you can go about this:1. Keep insisting to speak with someone responsible for coin recovery.2. Wait for the asset to be listed on KuCoin. And when/if it is, contact the support department again and ask them to recover your coins.Unless the total value of the lost coins is a significant one, most exchanges don't want to bother with things like this. Since you are offering a bounty of $1000, I can only assume that you have lost a few grands at least. That might still not be an amount the exchange would be bothered to recover. It might sound harsh, but unfortunately that's how they look at things.When you spoke with the support and asked them to recover your coins, did you tell them/did they ask the value of the deposit? Did you have to submit a transaction ID?",
