  "content": "Hi,how I can safe overclock my S19 90TH in BraiinOS? Overclock I mean \"increase power = more hash rate\"Just increase value in \"Power Target (for all hashboards)\"?What is safe value? Now I have 3150W, temps are 65.00 °C @ Hashrate 24H   91.82TH/s, fans are running at 82%.",

      "body": "Since you're currently at 3150W, you should increase the power target incrementally. A conservative approach would be increasing by 50W to 100W increments. Monitor the system's response to each increase.Keep a close eye on the temperature and hash rate. Your current temperature of 65.00 °C is within a safe range, but be wary of pushing it too much higher. The goal is to find a balance where you get a higher hash rate without significantly increasing the temperature or risking hardware damage.If the temperature should rise with the increasements you should also increase the fan speeds since they are running at 82%. Keep in mind that this will push the power consumption and ofc the noise level aswell.",

      "body": "The safe way to overclock the s19 miner with BraiinsOS is to properly configure the dynamic performance scaling including the dangerous temp because it automatically stops the mining process once the dangerous temp is reached, it can save your unit from overheating and instead of manually set the target power as suggested above DPS feature should able to help you to slowly decrease the power when the unit is under hot temperature.So you need to set the temp properly based on the Bitmain documentation the PCB max temp for s19 is 80c you can set the dangerous temp to 75c and hot temp is 70c or below.Check this guide below on how to properly set up DPS.- https://academy.braiins.com/en/braiins-os/configuration/",

Anything temperature related in Braiins OS = \"Chip\" temp, that means PCB+15, so if you think 80 is the max, this in Braiins OS means 95. As you know, the actual Dangerous for Brains OS is set lower than stock, to 90, and HOT is set to 80. This is because the time response of the sensors is slow, so you don't want to risk it and be on the safe side. Also, there are only 2 to 6 sensors per hashboard, so it can develop hot spots unnoticed until its too late, even more reason to play it safe and not mess with those values.Lowering the values is OK, but never increase those. Target 60, Hot 70, Dangerous 80 is OK if you want, or you can leave it at defaults. Due to the aforementioned, leaving the 10° margin between each value is highly recommended.In short, the best setting is already set as defaults. Enabling DPS is ok if you expect not being able to control the heat in summer/day, but a good cooling can keep the miners at constant temperature at any season any hour. Logically fans would run to nearly 100% during the hottest moments and slower otherwise.Since DPS triggers at HOT, lowering the value to 70 is a good idea, so efficiency doesn't suffer as much (side effect of the S19 chips: hot = worse efficiency).",
