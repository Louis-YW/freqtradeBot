But then I also expect an apology from you for you blind hate against me.Why I was looking you up anyway, maybe you should do your job as a escrow holder to finally reply in the bet situation between fatman and nub, I mean you are online all the time but it seems its more important for you do make up stories then doing something you are actually getting paid for.",

CoinSmart and the OTC team as a whole is trying to provide a service to potential clients globally. If you don't like what you post, then simply leave it and go on with your day. Why do you have to deliberately have to comment rude and false statements towards another man's business?",
