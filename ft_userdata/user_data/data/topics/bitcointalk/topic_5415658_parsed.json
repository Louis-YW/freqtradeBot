  "content": "I did a cursory search of other Chips.gg posts and this becomes more and more understandable. I have 11,000 CHIPs staked on their site from prior play, my daily returns began up at $9-10 per day to $1.60 a day. My wager is $1 mil+ and have posted their dice game nearly every day for the past 9 months. Straight up all of their branded games show non random patterns and when asked they point to a random SHA 256 hash with no way to verify pre event. They also link to a probably fair casino auditor THAT DOESNT EVEN LIST THEIR OWN CASINO. I had a recent conversation with one of their chat agents, I've screen grabbed it, https://i.imgur.com/xF6gFIz.jpegNow today, i log in to play away my miniscuel daily stake winnings and find out i have not been paid and open my staking vault to find this: https://i.imgur.com/wHtGXzV.jpegWhat yesterday was a $1.60 payment has now been completely strangled to roughly 65 cents a day and only payable the 1st of 2023Not surprised that support has said nothing.Players, do not play on this site, my rewards have been all but neutered, theyve manually fabricated my user data (https://i.imgur.com/v3UUsGa.jpeg and https://i.imgur.com/toW7DSL.jpeg, just some simple math but in order to earn a CHIP token, one must water at least $100 dollars, Â somehow I've earned 11 400+ by watering only 14 grand. Whats my secret? Lol) Gamblers beware, they are unfair and you will not win long term.",
