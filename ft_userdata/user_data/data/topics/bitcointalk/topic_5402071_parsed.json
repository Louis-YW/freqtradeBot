  "content": "Jamaica’s central bank has officially recognized the “Jam-Dex” central bank digital currency (CBDC) as legal tender, becoming the first country to do so. The Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) has legalized its CBDC in a move to provide an alternative to its cash-based economy.According to reports, the Jamaican senate has authorized the central bank to issue its CBDC, known as the Jamaica Digital Exchange, or Jam-Dex. According to Bank of Jamaica Governor Richard Byles, the Jam-Dex will officially launch for domestic use later this month. The digital Jamaican dollar offers a more secure, convenient alternative to physical notes and coins, and can be used without a bank account.The Jam-Dex has been in a pilot testing phase since Aug last year and this year that it would be rolled out in Q1, but delays have pushed it into the second quarter. The CEO of CBDC technology provider eCurrency, Jonathan Dharmapalan, confirmed the move: “Legislators in Jamaica have all now unanimously moved a digital dollar forward in Jamaica. You can use this to settle any debt in Jamaica. It is the medium of exchange. It is the medium of account.”https://www.warrenscoins.com/jamaica-becomes-the-first-nation-to-make-cbdc-a-legal-tender/Global CBDC driveAccording to Atlantic Council’s CBDC tracker, there are currently 105 countries, representing over 95% of global GDP researching or developing a CBDC. It also reports that 10 countries have actually launched a CBDC including Nigeria, the Bahamas with its “Sand Dollar’ and several Caribbean island nations, however, Jamaica is the first to legalize one as tender.China’s digital yuan, e-CNY, or DCEP (digital currency/electronic payment) pilots are set to continue into 2023. Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and six cities in Zhejiang province were added to the pilot program in April. The United States is the laggard in this race with policymakers and central bankers dragging their feet on any development of a crypto greenback. Some believe a central bank digital dollar will give the Federal Reserve a more authoritarian level of control and surveillance over people’s finances.https://beincrypto.com/jamaica-becomes-first-country-to-make-a-cbdc-legal-tender/",

We can't compare bitcoin and CBCD though, and it's obvious that government can make it legal tender faster than any crypto including bitcoin.I guess it's control, it they allow bitcoin then chances are, it's going to be very difficult for them to track it. As compare to CBCD, just a regular fiat and every transactions by their population should be in their ledger. We can't say that it's a wrong move as other bigger nations is also trying to 'adopt' CBCD's.",

Probably because it is, thats why it is named as digital currency instead of cryptocurrency meaning that its just some sort of digital cash that the goverment control. I honestly dont see any reason on why would they use an existing network because they wont have full control over it so it just makes alot more sense to create everything from scratch including the network assuming that it got one",

They focus in central banks and commercial banks solution.But do you really think there's a country will make their own CBDC that 100% decentralized? I really doubt with it. When you're really create a completely 100% decentralized coin, you don't have any control about it including controlling the price. If the price always stick with their own fiat value or $1, this mean they have a control to burn or mint their coin. When the price is higher than $1, they will mint more their coin, when the price is less than $1 they will burn their coin.Also CBDC is designed about the \"banks future\", anything that involved with banks will always centralized.",

Is it still a pilot program while Jam-Dex is getting more official, nationwide?I'm also wondering how crypto policies are in Jamaica. From what I read they're not legal tender (that's not surprising) and are unregulated (so, they can be used at least for trading?). Will the CBDC launch affect the policies on cryptos?",

I'm surprised we don't have more of these CBDC type systems already if that's all they're doing (although maybe that's just treasury/fed bonds)... They're probably a good thing for rivalling mastercard and visa but that's only if they're well marketed and companies support them well enough (I'm not even sure companies large enough pay fees for receiving debit/credit card payments).",

It is clear that CBDC is just a conventional form of finance that has switched to a modern system in order to have full control over the finances of every citizen who interacts with crypto. Definitely not a positive step for crypto adoption as it is still a centralized system.",
