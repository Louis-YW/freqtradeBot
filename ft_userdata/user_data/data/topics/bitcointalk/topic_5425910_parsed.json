Also, we will require certified identification documents from donor )Winning the Lottery ( You will need to send us a receipt of winnings and documentation e.g. bank statement showing the origin of the funds initially deposited )Divorce settlement ( You will need to send us a divorce settlement agreement and bank statement clearly showing receipt of funds )Loan ( You will need to send us an executed copy of the loan agreement and a bank statement showing the received funds along with your current balance )Mining ( You will need to send us a ledger of the amount of cryptocurrency mined, as well as a wallet address and transaction hash to which the mined cryptocurrency was delivered )Your source of funds document must meet the following requirements:Please upload an original photo or a PDF file of the documents, screenshots will not be acceptedAll documents must be issued within the last 6 months and need to be in Latin international formatShows your full name and addressShows the name of issuing entity and date of issueThe whole sheet of paper is visible in the photoQuotewinning funds from another casino is not acceptable I can't find anywhere on the written requirements that funds from another casino is not accepted. I think this fall under the variation of lottery winnings where you need to send a copy of the source of fund you used in betting or wagering before you win the amount.I believe there are variations that fall under those categories.  I believe the casino is flexible in verifying your source of fund as long as you can establish where your fund is coming from. Like for example, if you are a part of a signature campaign, it is under the salary category wherein you need to present documents that shows that your fund comes from advertising a certain casino or company.",

Those who earn from other campaigns or some who are just trading may just have some problems with this. But like usual, they may just ask for the source of funds for those high rollers. They're not asking just the KYC this time. Stake asking all these means other casinos will also do. Only the DEXes don't require documents.Quote from: IndependentGambler on December 06, 2022, 01:58:33 AMwinning funds from another casino is not acceptable That means the casino where you won those funds will ask for the source of funds from you. Maybe Stake will consider it if you show it to them.",

This is where they really are checking possible laundering activity. There is no escape now. If they require users who have withdrawn big amounts who had passed KYC long before the implementation of income verification, its possible they will not submit this time.",

I get that these casinos try their hardest to ensure that hackers are kept at an arm's length, however I don't see the benefits of imposing such rules over your regulars, especially if it's a cryptocurrency casino. Some of us here claim funds directly from crypto in numerous ways, some of them barred by the parameters you have given, at best, it's just gonna stop a couple of unemployed hackers from ever-getting their hands on your funds, in its worst, it's bound to cause a casino to lose a considerable amount of their customers.",
