Have any of you guys faced it before?So whenever there is a network issue, slow internet connection or slow loading speed, I see something like shown in the photo below. Technically nothing as that user (1700337231) existed on my thread before. And after the thread loads property, the user vanishes. You only see a glimpse of it, when the page is still loading. It will only show, if you have a very slow connection. I have noticed this many times, I don't know if I'm the only one.Username, post count, post content everything is shown as 1700337231. And the rank is hero member. Â I don't know if it's the right board to post this. Since it's related to the forum I'm posting it here.",

The app was released 4-5 years ago and has since not been updated. On the official thread where the user introduced the app to the community in 2018, you can see the below picture where it's evident that there are problems with displaying the avatars properly.Another member says he fixed the code, but I doubt that fix ever found its way into the official release. If there are issues with avatars, there could very well be other layout glitches as well.@DYING_S0UL the next time you see it, run Bitcointalk in Chrome normally and see if it appears there.

I guess it solves the problem then, you should avoid using that addon of the BTT app. BTW I wasn't aware of this app but as of now I am aware of the issue in that app then I might not consider giving it a try.

It does not seem like it is even supported anymore anyway, so I probably will not end up using it. But you cannot judge all extensions equally.

Well, i didn't use any bitcointalk related extension so i can't give any experience to that, but why you use a mobile app look in q desktop browser, or are you using a mobile device?I only use it because I don't have a laptop or desktop device. I have been active on bitcointalk using mobile device only (entire life). If you ever logged in to bitcointalk on a mobile, you'll know how hard it is to navigate to boards to boards, threads to threads. To post, comment, reply or to see the content, you'll have to zoom in and zoom out again and again. It can become a headache for those who uses it on mobile. That's the reason I have been using it on mobile.There are two bugs though. One that I mentioned in this thread and the other one is related to PM. As this extension modifies the CSS code to change layouts some PM won't show up normally. As example, you might see PM1, PM2 but PM3 would be blank. It's there but it won't show, due to the bug. I have been using it for months, apart from these two problem everything else is fine.",

I have tested several time. It only appears when the extensions are on. And only for one or two seconds.For the sake of testing and investigation, I had to add this extension and test it myself, and I was able to reproduce it First of all, yes, there's a post with a hero rank with this weird big number text, but it's hidden. You can still inspect the element and check the second post on the page with the class name \"dummyPost.\"This class with the display property: none means it will disappear as soon as the page is loaded.This has nothing to do with slow speed or connection issues; it will always appear and disappear as soon as the page is loaded (if this extension is enabled, otherwise will be hidden by default).Now, the question is, where is it coming from?No, it's not the extension that is adding this weird post; actually, this extension is doing a favor by showing and then hiding it after the page is loaded.It's theymos... I mean, maybe, but yes, this dummy post exists on almost every page (check for yourself, inspect the tags around the ad)... not only one but three times... irrespective of if you are using the extension of not.Only theymos can answer this, but I think it has something to do with the \"ad\", this bitcointalk ad that appears on every page after the first posts. Because I see there's a pattern, although the number will change as the ad changes, but the ID of this ad has something to do with these posts and this number.Also, sometimes this post appears once, sometimes twice, or maybe three or four times in a row. It can be above the ad, or sometimes it's around the ad.This is the code for the one of the posts if you can't inspect:Code:<tr class=\"wehsezHVggYpYaTFrqbRDA\"><td class=\"XKzrzjxepfzsxynfwvuJZg\"><b><i></i></b> <a name=\"msg1700424016\"></a>Â <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\">Â Â <tbody><tr><td class=\"windowbg2\">Â Â  <table style=\"table-layout: fixed;\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">Â Â  Â <tbody><tr>Â Â  Â  Â  <td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"overflow: hidden;\" class=\"poster_info\" valign=\"top\" width=\"16%\">Â Â  Â  Â <b><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1700424016\" title=\"View the profile of 1700424016\">1700424016</a></b>Â Â  Â  Â <div class=\"smalltext\">Â Â  Â  Â  Hero Member<br>Â Â  Â  Â  <img src=\"/Themes/custom1/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" border=\"0\"><br>Â Â  Â  Â  <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm;sa=send;u=1700424016\" title=\"Personal Message (Offline)\"><img src=\"/Themes/custom1/images/useroff.gif\" alt=\"Offline\" style=\"margin-top: 2px;\" border=\"0\"></a><span class=\"smalltext\"> Offline</span><br><br>Â Â  Â  Â  Posts: 1700424016<br>Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  <br>Â Â  Â  Â  <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1700424016\"><img src=\"/Themes/custom1/images/icons/profile_sm.gif\" alt=\"View Profile\" title=\"View Profile\" border=\"0\"></a>Â Â  Â  Â  <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm;sa=send;u=1700424016\" title=\"Personal Message (Offline)\"><img src=\"/Themes/custom1/images/im_off.gif\" alt=\"Personal Message (Offline)\" border=\"0\"></a><br>Â Â  Â  Â  <br><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=ignore;u=1700424016;topic=1700424016;msg=1700424016\">Ignore</a>Â Â  Â  Â </div>Â Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â  Â  <td style=\"padding: 2px;\" class=\"td_headerandpost\" valign=\"top\" width=\"85%\" height=\"100%\">Â Â  Â  Â <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr>Â Â  Â  Â  <td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1700424016.msg1700424016#msg1700424016\"><img src=\"/Themes/custom1/images/post/xx.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a></td>Â Â  Â  Â  <td valign=\"middle\">Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <div style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"subject\">Â Â  Â  Â  Â  <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1700424016.msg1700424016#msg1700424016\">1700424016</a>Â Â  Â  Â  Â </div>Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <div class=\"smalltext\">1700424016</div></td>Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <td style=\"font-size: smaller; padding-top: 4px;\" class=\"td_buttons\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"right\" height=\"20\"><div style=\"visibility: visible;\">Â Â  Â <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=post;quote=1700424016;topic=1700424016.100;num_replies=2;sesc=1700424016\"><img src=\"/Themes/custom1/images/frostee/frostee_quote.png\" alt=\"Reply with quote\" class=\"reply_button\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"></a>Â Â  Â  Â  &nbsp;<a class=\"message_number\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1700424016.msg1700424016#msg1700424016\">#2</a>Â Â </div>Â Â  Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â  Â </tr></tbody></table>Â Â  Â  Â  Â  <hr class=\"hrcolor\" style=\"margin-top: 4px;\" size=\"1\" width=\"100%\">Â Â  Â  Â <div class=\"post\" style=\"height: 20px;\">1700424016</div>Â Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â </tr>Â Â  Â <tr>Â Â  Â  <td class=\"smalltext\" valign=\"bottom\" width=\"85%\">Â Â  Â  Â <table style=\"table-layout: fixed;\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr>Â Â  Â  Â  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"smalltext\" width=\"100%\">Â Â  Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â  Â </tr><tr>Â Â  Â  Â  <td class=\"smalltext\" valign=\"bottom\">Â Â  Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â  Â  <td class=\"smalltext\" valign=\"bottom\" align=\"right\">Â Â  Â  Â  Â <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=reporttm;topic=1700424016.101;msg=1700424016\">Report to moderator</a>Â Â  Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â  Â </tr></tbody></table>Â Â  Â  </td>Â Â  Â </tr>Â Â  </tbody></table>Â Â </td></tr>Â </tbody></table></td></tr>I have tested it in Chrome, FireFox and Edge same behavior, also it doesn't matter if you are logged in or not.P.S. fahbil's mobile extension named it 'dummyPost', so shoutout to fahbil.Quote from: Pmalek on November 19, 2023, 08:01:15 AMIt could definitely be the result of that Bitcointalk app and addon that he is using that is causing it.
