  "content": "Today I received a private message from the user @Amph in which he informs me that he wants to sell his BTT account, and he refers to the fact that we communicated via Telegram, which never happened. The PM also contains a name (I assume the one he uses on Telegram), but I'm not sure if that might be his real name, so I don't want to reveal it here.Given that the sale of BTT accounts is not something we approve of (although it is not prohibited), it would be logical to leave a negative trust for such an account - even though the reference is a private message, so it's my word against his.I can't say why @Amph chose me, but it seems to me that I am not the only one who received or will receive such a private message. I also don't see that there has been any change of e-mail/password, so the assumption is that the account has not been hacked.",

      "body": "It's quite possible that someone is using Telegram looking for account sellers, and then pointing them to a random user on DefaultTrust or DefaultTrust2, trying to get them to admit that they want to sell the account knowing that the DefaultTrust/DefaultTrust2 would say something publicly about it. There could be several motivations to this; honeypotting which this would be considered, isn't exactly encouraged around here, and actively frowned upon itself. So, the Telegram user doing it could be trying to do it anonymously, and using some other user to deal with it on Bitcointalk. However, that's not exactly great either; since they're effectively putting the user they're saying to contact on Bitcointalk under risk, as it appears they want to buy the account. I suspect in an attempt to keep themselves anonymous due to the frowned upon honey potting. However, I don't see why they just wouldn't send the user to a newly created account, and then report that publicly. Going through the verification that's required if necessary. I don't know, that's my best guess since Lucius seems to be rather dumbfounded by why they received the personal message in the first place.",

If you go, and look at a personal message you've received, and click report to moderator you'll be able to see who can review them, since you can pick who you want. However, admins can probably see any personal message if they wanted too, but this certainly isn't routinely done. Although, this falls out of the scope for them to verify since it's not breaking the rules of the forum. So, please no one report personal messages like this, only one's that break the forum guidelines. There are other ways to verify it, obviously. In the past, some users have given temporary access to trustworthy users, but I wouldn't recommend that either.",
