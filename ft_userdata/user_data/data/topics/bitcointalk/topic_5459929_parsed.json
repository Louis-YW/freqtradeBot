Ripple case committed violations of the Securities Act of 1933.Torres also ruled that Ripple’s co-founders, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, should stand trial in front of a jury for their violations.How on earth is standing trial good news?",

The project should receive compensation from the damages they suffered as a result of the loss of the case. There was a reduction in advertisements, an exchange listing, and a massive loss in trades. There is no doubt they had a share in the wealth of Tron's CEO to allow the dubious loss",

It's a great coin for transferring assets due to its fast network and low fees, but apart from that, what else? A lot of people only speculated on that $2 - $10 a coin without factoring in the market. Who will buy at those prices? Why will they buy at that price? There's really a lot of holes and gaps that the SEC ruling cannot fill, hence why people didn't buy much XRP and drive the price up.",

It's a high cap, give it some time for pete's sake, those take time to move. I personally couln't care less about that centralized corporate coin and it has already superior alternatives. But you do you, obviously there's money to be made with that too.I admit i would have been happy if xrp would have just lost. To me it represents everything i hate about corporate cryptocurrencies.",

True, I believe there are still surprises that we will see in the near future, if it will be an absolute win on the side of Ripple (XRP) when the Halving will occur, this will add to the hype of Ripple to be much higher on the price side. There are lots of people out there predicting that the price of Ripple (XRP) will be at $5+, but for me the highest expectation is $2. WDYT?",

Some people already took profit on the first pump and I am not saying it's already late because, in most of these kinds of pumps, there is always a follow-up pump as long as the market is still not yet dumped. I believe on the following days, there will still be sideways and pump again, just like what happened on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) before it was listed on new wall street's cryptocurrency exchange.",

Also, it certainly did not last one day, XRP's price was less than $0.50 before the announcement that they won the lawsuit. It's now trending at $0.75, with a 60% increase in the last 7 days. On top of that, XRP surpassed BNB in market cap, and this is only the beginning; that's not insignificant at all. I'm not sure how it'll progress in the future, but so far, it has made decent advancements so far, which is positive, both for its future but also for other altcoins that were labeled as securities.",
