I am asking because no crypto miner seem to use these graphic cards for mining a mining rig, not even a video of a complete rig been built using intel graphic card. That is because they have postponed the actual date.Even when they come out for sale the miners need some time to test them,only when successful tests will be shown on official channels like Telegram,Youtube and others from people who keep making content about mining only then you can see a user to build a complete mining rig with Intel cards,you cannot see it before such happenings or if a user is bold enough to go and build this without seeing quite some reviews first he most likely will be in troubleshooting mode rather than in mining mode.So most likely these cards will come out in Fall 2022 which is the next three upcoming months.",

      "body": "Reports of its death are premature. Intel is in it for the long run targetting gamers not miners, and starting small.Sure they've had problems but they also had problems with CPUs for the last 5 years. AVX512 and 10nm node are 5 yearslate on the desktop.I expect mining interest to be slow to pick up for many reasons. First Intel doesn't care so miner devs don't get advanced samplesto play with. Second they aren't building big GPUs yet, which are preferred for mining. And third it will take time for the miner devs tomake the necessary SW modifications for functionality, then tuning and optimization. When decent mining GPUs become available there couldbe competition among miners devs to be first and fastest, and of course snag the highest dev fees. Hopefully there will be an open source miner.",
