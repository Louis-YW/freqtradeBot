For instance, imagine you are integrating a new payment gateway into an existing commercial platform, you need to create a brand new payment gateway, update the particular commercial platform to include the new gateway, and perform multiple rounds of testing such as usability testing, load testing, etc. Additionally, the existing payment gateways usually do not charge anything from the customer's side for using their gateway, the merchant pays a fee for every transaction made. All of these costs including the considerably higher gas fees will have a heavy impact on the forthcoming crypto payment gateways.Inevitably when it comes to the business world, any business will consider the return on investment of such a process. Personally, I think it will take a while for crypto payment gateways to get widely used and normalized.",

Actually that is the purpose for bitcoin and why it was created at the first place if there could be a better way for bitcoin lightning network then it could solved the problems and replaced TRX and LTC, since most people preferred using them. I think ethereum 2.0 also solve this issues i can't still find more changes after turning from Proof-Of-Work to Proof-Of-Stake and should have showed a big turnaround for eth gas reduction and yet people still don't finds friendly to use for transactions instead using preferred using bnb.",

We look forward to when we will have a network that could provide less fees and faster transactions, this may take time to be achieved but then I am very certain that it will come out well in the long run.",

But this has to be fixed and it cannot be this way forever.",

Well we have the likes of bitcoin and eth but there are out there that could be used as well. Im not sure L1 projects that are competing with eth could somehow manage now but maybe in the future if they could improved all the development and secure more recognition among all countries maybe. I am thinking matic, could be a game changer with the likes of trx, litecoin and dogecoin. Obviously binance coin which has an outstanding performance and known by a lot due to the Binance exchange.",

Permissionless transactions create all sorts of legal issues if we bring public using any of this. Old people get scammed so easily even without owning crypto. Luring those people in using something like this when they barely understand how mobile phone works is just too dangerous and irresponsible. I would be happy to be proven wrong and see majority understanding what they are doing with crypto, but i face intelligent people all the time who have weird clichee ideas about altcoins and whole cryptocurrency. And i am bored to explain anything to them. People still see whole crypto as a scam and arguments about eth taking so much energy are still being used, even though it turned to PoS.And even in this forum, people talk same way about nfts filled with hate. I just don't understand the hate towards some protocol.",

Your inquiry on which cryptocurrency payment processors should use is timely and significant. I've championed Ethereum adoption. Why? Its a decentralized application platform that anticipates blockchain technology as well as a means of exchange.But be careful. Cryptocurrencies may undermine traditional financial institutions by breaking through their opaque barriers and freeing them from their monopoly. Adopting cryptocurrency, especially Ethereum, will speed up, open up, and decentralize financial transactions. Beware of opposition from established banks protecting their turf.

However, if we are talking about payment gateway then I am sorry but Tron is by far better than any other coin that exists today.I think it is better than even bitcoin or ethereum, because not only it's cheap (nearly free most of the time) but it is also nearly instant (less than 30 seconds each time) so it means that there must be something right they are doing and could be considered the best one for payments.",
