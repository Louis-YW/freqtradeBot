  "content": "People are thinking what's the best way to get rid of this blockchain network congestion. Network congestion is a problem for us because it affects the fee. The normal fee is just around $1 but this month we are experiencing a very high fee which is unaffordable to most people.We found out that the reason of this issue is because of brc-20 tokens, they use Bitcoin blockchain. And since Bitcoin's blockchain is only process 7-10 transactions per second which is not enough to manage all the transaction if we included the brc-20 tokens.Now, is the problem will be fixed if brc-20 tokens will be removed? Yes, very possible, but how? Brc20 tokens keeps improving and lot of brc20 token is being launch everyday. The total confirmed market cap of brc20 tokens that is listed in Coinmarketcap is $3b with a $1b trading volume which is very difficult to stop.The other solution to fix network congestion is to increase the block size. Is increasing the block size fix network congestion?Definitely yes, and there is no need to eradicate brc20 tokens. But in what way? Is it really possible to increase the block size of Bitcoin? For sure there's a reason why Nakamoto put only a very limited block size.I have found another solution to remove this obstacle in Bitcoin but I don't know if this idea is acceptable to the majority. If you remember what happen to Ethereum way back 2017, it encountered this such problem.They made Ethereum to POS from POW as a solution to this problem, and it's called ETH 2.0If there will be a Bitcoin 2.0 or a change of network from POW to POS then not only the network congestion is being fixed but many more, and also it can reduced the energy consumption.",

Starting from 2018 when lightning network and SEGWIT became widely used as layer 2 solution and a backwards compatible upgrade respectively, Bitcoin still tended towards this situation of high mempool conjestions.With the problem of ordinals, I suggest they should me removed from the network like devs. Because they seem to be producing more conjestions than the LN feature can solve. With the issues on ground, let us not be surprised to see fees become double of it is now, though we hope the go down.With the popularity and adoption of Bitcoin growing vastly, fixing conjestion problems may not be easy.",

Bitcoiners use it cause of the value it has and much of that value comes from the security the network has and how decentralized it is, changing that up will make it just another altcoin out there.Off chain channels now seem to be the best option to transact with less fees at the moment. In the future a better solution ma be implemented.",

That was simply an erroneous assumption that even Vitalik Buterin has many times pointed out is false.So switching to PoS does not make fees cheaper.

This means that miners also need profits. If you switch to PoS, then you are no longer a miner but a validator and Bitcoin is no longer different from altcoins.Even though someone has already said it, I will repeat it again because I think it is true that switching from PoW to PoS is not a solution.Switching from PoW to PoS based on the whitepapers I read, it will never happen.Whitepaper is the beginning of the launch of Bitcoin with a unique concept. 21 million Bitcoins is a great innovation from Satoshi that will never change.Actually, this is beyond my capabilities, especially regarding the offer to remove BRC-20 which was proposed as a solution to high transaction fees.p.s. correct me if I'm wrong",

It's not possible to removeBRC-20 tokens as a \"hey, lets remove this kinds of transactions here and that's it\".It requires a consensus, most nodes running software that limits extra data size and that will limit the amount of shit that can be added to a transaction non-related with financial transfer from inputs to outputs.Now this is not possible with Bitcoin Core because there is a bug that is been exploited, where Inscription can send more data and it will still be accepted by the nodes even if the node owner configured to accept only a limited amount of bytes as extra-data. Once this is fixed, if people update to the new version AND USE this option to limit extra-data size limit, then we can see a reduction in BRC-shit.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on December 27, 2023, 04:40:41 PMThe other solution to fix network congestion is to increase the block size. Is increasing the block size fix network congestion?Definitely yes, and there is no need to eradicate brc20 tokens. But in what way? Is it really possible to increase the block size of Bitcoin? For sure there's a reason why Nakamoto put only a very limited block size.This is old, very old. It doesn't work, because increasing block size will increase Storage requirements on the nodes, and Bitcoin only is Bitcoin today because anyone can run a full node from their home pc. If the Blockchain start going t 1 TB or 2 TB in size, it will start excluding people. If the block comes to somthing like 100 Mb, only big companies will be able to afford paying storage disks to run a node, and then decentralization os gone, congratulations.So, NO, thank you. Increasing block size was defeated back in 2017 or something and should be kept defeated.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on December 27, 2023, 04:40:41 PMI have found another solution to remove this obstacle in Bitcoin but I don't know if this idea is acceptable to the majority.
