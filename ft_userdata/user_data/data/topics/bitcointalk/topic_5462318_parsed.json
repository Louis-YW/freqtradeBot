  "content": "BEFORE YOU START READING, KEEP IN MIND THAT I DO NOT RECOMMEND NON-DRINKERS TO START DRINKING. BECAUSE DRINKING IS VERY HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH.Alcohol consumption and addiction are not new in our social life today, but it is also appropriate to state that alcohol is both a tonic and a poison, with the difference being primarily in the dose.Alcohol is employed in different kinds of festivals, social gatherings, and even for medicinal purposes.  This has raised many questions about the effects of alcohol on every organ in the body. When alcohol enters the body, approximately 80% of it is absorbed in the small intestine and then released into the bloodstream. When alcohol enters the bloodstream, it is circulated throughout the body by the circulatory system, the heart. The human liver is in charge of detoxifying methane (alcohol) and eliminating it from the bloodstream. However, the liver can only handle a tiny quantity of alcohol at a time, allowing remainder to circulate throughout the body.The worst aspect is that it also gets into the central nervous system and brain. Because of the addictive nature of alcohols, heavy drinking is largely almost irresistible by drinkers, resulting to a variety of diseases as a result of the causes I described above.This fact has also make the health benefits of drinking at moderate level not well known. However, moderate drinking can be advantageous to human health, as I will demonstrate below:* Beers can lower the risk of of kidney stones: Beer was found to reduce the risk of kidney stones by 41%.* Beers strengthen your bones: Beer's high source of silicon content is what's responsible for an increase in bone density.* Alcohol can protect you from heart attacks.* Red wines can help fight colds: 8 -14 glasses of wine per week, one could see a 60% reduction in the risk developing a cold.* Red wines can boost your memory: A compound found in the skin of red grapes can improve memory and cognitive function.* Beers have vitamins.* Whisky can cure sore throats.* Drinking moderately can improve sexual function in men.* Drinking can also help in Reducing blood clotting.* Beer can help stop cataracts.Addiction in the use of alcohol is a topic that we cannot run away from, I suggest we open discussion about this topic for the purpose of educating each other.",

Alcohol addiction is now the norm, and some people believe that if you don't drink alcohol, you're missing out on a lot of the fun you should be having in this life while you're still alive and healthy. Many individuals forget the downsides of it and the long-term effects it can have on the immune system and cause utter destruction to some of the body's essential organs when used excessively. I believe that for everything in the world today, there are always pros and downsides, so it is best if we embrace the benefits and stay away from the risks involved in using such substances when they’re too much in the body.",

The ones who are addicted to alcohol are often found to be less conscious when they are drunk, and I believe that anything that can cause consciousness issue in humans isn't a good thing to consume. Although, we can't ignore that alcohol can have some good pros as well, but its cons are way higher than its pros and that's why someone with proper understanding about health & nutrition would avoid substance like alcohol at any cost. The long term consumption of alcohol is know to cause many types of cancers and other health issues and anyone who is addicted to drinking can have such kind of diseases in future. The wrong research about some topics has often caused more problems for us humans and because of such wrong information we can lose our health and many other precious things in our lives.",

Most things considered bad for you can be good and cure many health conditions if used in moderation.Some examples? Common salt. You need to consume a bit of sodium to stay healthy, otherwise you can even go into a coma. Eat too much salt and you'll have heart problems, high blood pressure, finally, just like with too little sodium, you can fall into a coma. Pure alcohol is bad for us in general, but it can help endure pain, disinfect wounds, and allow us survive longer in extreme conditions, especially in a situation where you're wounded and need to walk somewhere to get help. Taking a sip of strong alcohol can help you focus. You can read about the famous Dutch courage",

Therefore, if you don't drink, don't start for the sake of your heart. Eating healthy and exercising can do the trick. And if you already drink too much, don't use the healthy benefits as an excuse because they negative effects outweighs the good.",

I have observed that even if I take little, the effect is not always pleasing. But I will not mind taking a few glasses of wine if the benefits you outlined and discussed are true. I am supposed to do a further study to ascertain if these benefits are true or false but adding the source of research that validates these claims would have been perfect. I hope this information is not based on hearsay and customs but on testable scientific research. I know kidney stones can be controlled by taking plenty of water and I also know that excessive use of alcohol increases the risk of suffering from the illness because of the high rate of purines in beer and grain alcohol. I think it will be better for kidney stone patients to drink just water and avoid alcohol. I have also heard some of my friends claim that drinking beer, especially stouts improved their sexual performance. But I have not experimented with that claim. Nevertheless, I think we should verify this information before using alcohol.",

The issues with them only comes up when they're been abused and alcohol can be very addictive and easily abused which is why they're been banned in some countries.They're banned as they can make people to misbehave and cause destruction of properties. The health benefits of alcohol can be gotten from other beverages, fruits and food that isn't harmful to the body therefore we can stay without alcohol.Alcohol is mainly consumed as a means of having fun, getting drunk or feeling spirited and not because of all the health benefits that you have mentioned. Alcohol has a more negative impact on the society than a positive impact because of it's toxicity nature. We shouldn't be promoting the drinking of alcohol instead we should be discouraging people from drinking it. Drinking more of water should be promoted as the health benefits of water is more than any other beverages.",
