  "content": "If someone bought 1000 usd of bitcoin on January 1, 2011, would it make a huge difference buying on that date vs may 16, 2011 for the same amount? How much would that bitcoin be worth today if bought on January of 2011? 200 million usd or more? How would it make a difference?",

Like you're bored and just feel like asking questions even when they're are not going to be working documents for you.However, you can check further on   coinmarketcap  in case you want to stay updated about bitcoin prices.",
