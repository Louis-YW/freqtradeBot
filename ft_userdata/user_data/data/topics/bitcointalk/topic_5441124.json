  "content": "What happened::  I saw Bounty today, and after I reviewed its project, it turns out that it is a scam project, claiming that they have a certificate that they obtained after the KYC of their project was verified by Interfi.Network, and it is a fake certificate modified by the team of this scam project that is not for the Millennialcoin official project.QuoteAbout InterFi KYC interfi.network verification aims to bring trust and transparency to blockchain projects. In this repo, we'll upload certificates of the KYC-verified projects.Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3487177 {The bounty manager}Reference Link:  1- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5440999.0 {ARCHIVED} BOUNTY TOPIC2- https://github.com/ssolidproof/projects-development/blob/main/Kyc_certificate_Millennia_Token.pdf {ARCHIVED}3- https://twitter.com/TokenMillennia/status/1628666627704201218 {ARCHIVED}After opening the GitHub link that they put in their tweet on Twitter, we will find that their certificate is fake because if we go to Interfi.Network's GitHub link, we will see that the original certificate bears the name of \"Millennialcoin,\" which is the official project whose website link is Millennialcoin.org and not this scam project \"MillenniaToken\" that stole the certificate and modified it and impersonated the official Millennialcoin project.This is the FAKE certificate for this scam project which has no release date and is not mentioned in the official Interfinetwork account on GitHub [ https://github.com/ssolidproof/projects-development/blob/main/Kyc_certificate_Millennia_Token.pdf ]List of projects that have received certificates of passing the KYC verification by Interfinetwork: [ https://github.com/interfinetwork/project-kyc-verification ]This is the original certificate for the Millennialcoin project, issued on August 11, 2022, on Interfinetwork about six months ago.[ https://github.com/interfinetwork/project-kyc-verification/blob/main/Millennialcoin_KYCCertificate_InterFi.pdf ]Additional Notes: The campaign manager should stop promoting it, and the bounty hunters should stop working, as there are five pages on the BOUNTY TOPIC so far.The official @millennialcoin project accounts are https://linktr.ee/millennialcoin",

It's horrible I don't the team either reviewed the bounty thread or not. Everything related to the project is not professional.

Thank you mate for your comment,I will try to contact the bounty manager and send him the topic of this scam accusation, and we will see what he will do. I hope it will be a lesson for him if he wants to gain a good reputation by trying to do research before he promotes a scam project like this which steals another project name, so that bounty hunters and investors do not fall into the hands of scammers.The strange thing is that the project that this bounty was posted about has only a Twitter account without a website or any information related to the project team or the project as a whole, maybe this BM is part of this project or its team.",

The manager in question already has 2 negative tags on them for other infractions on the forum. It's not like they really care if the project they're promoting scams or not, they just wanted to get paid.",

He may not really know that this token is a fraudulent project, so it is better not to accuse him before giving him a chance to defend himself.Although the bounty manager has 2 negative tags on his profile, it is better not to rush to judge him until we know his exact position.Very good investigation, well done.",
