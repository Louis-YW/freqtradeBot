Traders use altcoin or fiat money pairs to do technical analysis, and it obviously will look bad when the trader sets the targets. That would mean that charters would need to use marketcap graph to find a bullish TA and probably no one would even bother to do that as very few do it now.* Rebasing as a solution is worst possible as it eats away the whole idea of having high interest from staking in the first place.So why the hell do they keep coming back on the markets?",

They feed on the money of dumb traders that always taking risk on this kind pump and dump project. They are the ponzi of crypto an using the smart contract and cheap website to create cheap project for there token. These tokens will keep coming back as long as there’s a trader buying it. This is the norm on crypto and we can’t dictate dumb traders to not buying this kind of bullshit tokens because they have there own bullshit reason to lose there money.",

Even though there isnt use case, I doubt traders are checking those things aside from the bullish direction of the chart and some indicator pointing to the path of gains.

      "body": "Lol, I created a similar thread on the local board to address this issue. What I found is that all of the coins with high inflation and even with auto staking/rebasing, all ended up in the dumpster. With too many circulating supply, it would be extremely difficult to pump the price.It's funny how people think LUNC (Luna Classic) can be a $1 token without extreme burning. The formula is easy, market cap = supply * price. Just input any price you think is achievable and look at its market cap, you can then judge whether it's rational or not.While coins must be a serious project, probably for the \"get rich quick\" scheme, tokens can be just for fun, especially if these were built on top of a cheap chain.",

But the problem is, there are a lot of people behind this kind of project who just thinks of many money by scamming a lot of investors. And for the investors, don't patronized this kind of business model because it will not succeed based on the past history of other cryptos, it will surely failed.",

If I'm not mistaken The reason many people continue to buy tokens with big inflation is that first, the market takes time to finally realize this and then react. The problem has been identified for years now in several projects, there are still investors continuing to buy and the second possible reason is speculation. Most investors don't understand the nature and purpose of their investment or they see someone promising 100x profit then they keep buying and hope to find this unicorn token that will give them 100x profit when it goes up to the market cap.",

Plus these over expensive tokens are always in the circulation because they usually have a strong backing and people have invested loads in them thus they don't expect them to be plunged out in the dark that soon.",
