They first give you the private keys with some (fake) tokens in it but they require some gas fee to be transferred into your wallet,  right? The moment you send few bnb or trx into that wallet for gas fee, they auto send it to the scammers' address (via a smart contract arranged). If anyone shows you a btc balance and gives their keys especially on bsc/erc-20/trc-20 chains, its most likely a scam, dont get tricked.PS: If they give you a seed in the form of recovery file, it most likely contains malware/trojan, delete them immediately!",

Sometimes they'll take funds in a scammy way as mentioned above. Sometimes they'll hope you save the wallet somewhere and forget to tell the difference between that and your original one. Sometimes they'll just want to check your account is reading messages and is still active (such as to sell your username on as an account that's active/reads messages).There's probably more reasons but it's worth just checking your notification bar and swiping off messages.",

Before sending crypto to anyone check address three times before send any king of payment .Always confirm contract address of coin/token before you add them in your wallet & never add such fake/scam coins in your wallet, there is possibility that scammers will steal your funds when you try to sell such scam coins. There are thousands of fake currencies circulating in crypto space with similar name to legitimate coins name like Dogecoin and many others. I always check/confirm contract address on https://coinmarketcap.com/ before I decide to buy or add coin in my wallet.",

I think deleting only won't eliminate the risk completely, better he should reimage his system. If he only deletes the file, which he already opened, the malware might be residing on his hard disk. A hard disk format is the best precaution in this case.Quote from: Sayeds56 on January 16, 2023, 03:57:02 PMAlways confirm contract address of coin/token before you add them in your wallet & never add such fake/scam coins in your wallet, there is possibility that scammers will steal your funds when you try to sell such scam coins.

So, in that case, create a new wallet and then claim the airdrop. We should not connect our main wallet to random sites. This is another precaution which should be taken care of, if we want to be safe.",

Seems like its very similar to Macro viruses isn't it? Micro virus embed themselves in word-processing documents (like MS word) that are mostly attached with an email. When the victim clicks the file, the micro virus code is executed. The basic idea behind every modern virus/malware is to trick the victim to do a very simple mistake that results in execution of the virus program (in this case its execution of smart contract when victim send token in wallet). By just reading such replies one can surely save himself from scams. Your reply is worth sharing.",

I guess no one wants to respond to unknown message from telegram or any social networks but these people come up with so lucrative offers which is hard to resist. Everyone wants money and almost every other person is greedy, so these scammers are able to scam people.Even if they hit 100 people, minimum 10 people will fall for their scam because of either greediness or ignorance. Scammers are getting intelligent with every passing day and they come up new ideas to scam the people involved in cryptocurrencies.",

It will never happen that everyone will be aware that you should not look for money online with help from complete strangers, but if only one out of 100 people fell into the trap, maybe the scammers would become discouraged and start giving up their dirty work.",
