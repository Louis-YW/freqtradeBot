Right now, I look at mempool.space and 1 sat/vB is enough to get first confirmation in 10 minutes and if you send transaction with 0 sat/vB, you'll get confirm in 20 minutes.I rarely make transactions but when I send, I always have to pay at least 10 sat/vB and have to wait for an hour or more. I have never seen something like this, how often does it happen? I have heard that years ago you could make it with 0 sat/vB but today, right now?",

Although i visited mempool.space just now and it shows \"~1 sat/vB\".Quote from: Synchronice on April 23, 2023, 08:21:58 AM--snip--Right now, I look at mempool.space and 1 sat/vB is enough to get first confirmation in 10 minutes and if you send transaction with 0 sat/vB, you'll get confirm in 20 minutes.--snip--Aside from display bug, block which shows text \"In ~20 minutes\" roughly means current transaction on mempool with fee range 1 - 1 sat/vB will be confirmed in ~20 minutes (only based on current mempool state). When choosing fee, following fee rate under column \"Transaction fees\" usually is better option since it use more complex calculation[1].[1] https://mempool.space/docs/faq#looking-up-fee-estimates",

      "body": "If you take a look at Jochen Hoenicke's mempool representation for the last two days, you can see how the fees started dropping between 21 and 22 April. In the last 24 hours, there were many windows for 1-2 sat/vByte transactions, and that's something we haven't seen in a long time.I have no idea what caused the sudden drop, as the mempools are slowly filling against with +15k of unconfirmed transactions.I am also confused with your statement that every time you send BTC in the past, you had to pay 10 sat/vByte or more. Before this Ordinals nonsense begun, I have done many transactions paying 1 to 1.3 sat/vByte that got confirmed relatively quickly.  Do you check the state of the mempools manually or do you just rely on whatever the software you use suggests? You should always do your own manual checks.",

The fees have gone up already since OP created this thread. You are now looking at 3 to 4 sat/vByte for a next block confirmation, and I am sure it will get worse. There are over 25k of unconfirmed transactions now.The LN makes sense if you are going to make multiple transactions back and forth with one party. And you still need the opening and closing on-chain transaction.",

And I get kinda confused because when I read posts here, people usually complain about fees and that's the reason why lighting network was created too.Transaction fees on Bitcoin network are more expensive in latest months because of Ordinal effects which make mempools more over-loaded than usual. However, if you know when mempools are often less over-loaded, I am sure that you won't have to pay more than 10 sat/ vbyte for your transaction in latest weeks.Honestly answer me, when you made those transactions, on what day from Monday to Sunday? Only tell you what day of week you made those transactions, I can tell you why you likely overpaid.  Guide to check fees: Taker, maker, deposit, withdrawal, transaction feesSee",
