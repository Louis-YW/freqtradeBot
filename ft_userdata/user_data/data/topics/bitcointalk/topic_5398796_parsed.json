At the moment we think that he is a savior and helps us to gain financial freedom and protect our privacy but let's imagine some bad case scenarios for interesting discussion. At the moment, Satoshi has around 1 million bitcoin.What if it was created by one of the worst person ever? What if he wants to make us dependent on bitcoin as much as possible and one day he comes, sells all his coins and causes financial catastrophe.What if it was created by persons like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, etc. These are the people who don't respect their customers' privacy.What if there is one specific, concrete country behind the scenes? Bitcoin is a mixture of the cyber and financial worlds, this is the greatest power stack to own.The inspiration for me to create this thread was this video. P.S.

Actually situational because the entire community or supporter of Bitcoin itself would really be making out such decision if ever its creator had surfaced out then its neither sell or buy signal but of course it would be depending on what they are seeing if Satoshi whether he do tends to make out some negative vibe or positivity and this is where community would really make out reactionwhether it would be bullish or bearish. We know that Satoshi does hold huge amount of coins but it wont totally be affecting if we do talk about it literally even he intents to sell it allbut what affect most is on the effect on emotional aspect which is really something that strong once the community do share up on the same reaction or doubts.",

So whoever he is they will continue to hide their identity.I tend to agree with the line that I bolded above. If real satoshi is alive, he/they will never think of revealing his identity, there are too many reasons why he must remain anonymous, his life becomes in danger, and might the government chase him for the currency that he created, as we know the government always wants regulations.It's us the users, the ones who created Bitcoin has nothing can do about the Bitcoin price and its adoption.  I think it's a small portion of Bitcoin that satoshi has than the actual holders.  Maybe let's respect the decision of satoshi to remain hidden and let's accept that he/they will never come back.",

The questions are not worth debating because of what has been achieved by bitcoin in this market. If Satoshi has slight inclination of doing what the OP was saying here, Satoshi may have already been showed us a little glimpse of his identity but up until now, it is still a mystery. So do you think, he will sell all his coins and ruin his creation for his own selfish desire? I don't think so. So maybe, we need to leave this topic and better deal on much worthwhile discussions.",

IMO, I don't think there is too much relevance to the personality behind an innovation that is ground breaking. If an innovation from an individual proves important, and all the risk involved has been considered, there is no need why his innovation cannot be carried on regardless of his/her personal lifestyle or consideration.If the founder of bitcoin made himself known, he will constantly be queried and asked questions as regards the fluctuating value of btc, people will hate him when the price slumps and idolise him when it goes up. He may have been invited if not arrested or even assassinated by the government for wanting to create something that eliminates government interference, they will definitely not like him.",
