The global rewards program market size is estimated at around $316 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $472 billion by 2027.This market includes a wide variety of rewards programs, such as points, miles, cashback, discounts, rewards, and more, offered by companies in various sectors like retail, finance, tourism, entertainment, and others.Dissatisfied customers:The Global Customer Loyalty Report 2023 showed us that 44.2% of users who use rewards programs are dissatisfied with their loyalty program.The biggest problems users point out are the:- Expiration of points;- Complexity of point redemption;- Redemption restrictions;- Devaluation of points;- Lack of program transparency.Brands:A study conducted by Harvard University shows that loyalty strategies and programs lack innovation. Acquiring and retaining customers is more expensive than ever.The nature of online distribution has changed dramatically in recent years. With Apple's changes to iOS privacy policies in 2021 and Google set to phase out support for third-party cookies in 2024, it's becoming increasingly difficult for brands to track users and obtain information about their preferences.How can you effectively acquire users if you don't know what they like? The impact is already being felt, with CACs increasing by 222% over the last 8 years (41% just in the last year) and CPMs rising over 60% on programmatic ad platforms like Meta and Google.$375K USD is the average amount companies invest or plan to invest in launching or revamping their loyalty program around the world in the next year.Market:Despite their popularity, loyalty points programs face a major challenge: according to global data, there are 48 trillion unused points, with $140 billion of those points in the United States.This is done intentionally to keep you in a consumption limbo and not benefit from it.On average, a person uses more than 20 loyalty programs, and guess what? Most of them are not connected.What is XPointZ ($XPZ)?XPointZ is the answer to the inefficiency of the points and rewards market, revolutionizing how companies relate to their customers and creating an era of loyalty based on transparency, flexibility, and real value for the consumer.Using blockchain technology and the tokenization process, we will bring this market into the new era of the internet.We connect users with brands through communities, where the user wants to be, generating real engagement through a rewards and loyalty program that:- Does not expire;- Is simple and easy to redeem;- No fine print and no restrictions;- Appreciates in value over time;- Limited supply and has complete transparency using blockchain.- Community whitelabel apps can use our cutting-edge technology easily due our \"interop first\" way of thinkingAs users engage more, they earn more. And as more brands join the ecosystem, users also increase their earnings. We will do this sustainably, with an economic model backed by the rewards economy.Through its Whitelabel SuperApp, XPointZ distributes rewards for user engagement, eliminating issues like expiration dates, redemption complexity, and points devaluation.We are not reinventing the wheel; we are connecting the traditional offline market, web2, and web3.The benefits environment encompasses various stakeholders, including companies ranging from retailers trying to create loyalty to card issuers, secondary market brokers giving tokens as benefits, and creators of points systems, air miles, cashback, and other rewards.With XPZ, this economy of benefits will have a solid foundation to prosper and integrate. At the same time, it will provide the backing for XPZ.Combined with the token repurchase model - which we will explain later - it will contribute to creating a healthy environment for users.Engage-to-earn thesis tested and validated with +100,000 people in Brazil and distributing a total of BRL 1 million in tokenized benefitsThe XPointZ ecosystem is already applied in one of the largest content and news portals in the Brazilian crypto market, Cointimes, which resulted in an absolute success. We tested with over 100,000 organic users, distributing a total of BRL 1 million in tokenized benefits and reaching an NPS of 80 among them.Site: https://xpointz.com/en/home/Litepaper: https://litepaper-en.xpointz.com/",
