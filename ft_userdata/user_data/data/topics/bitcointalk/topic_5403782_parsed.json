The person who stole it couldn't access it, because he didn't have my touch id. But, I had it in addition to the main account, which I left empty so that if someone stole my phone, they would think there was nothing there.However, I only remember the 12 words of the main account. Of my other wallets, I lost, because along with the cell phone, my laptop was stolen. On my account statement, it has the transactions I made for my accounts. I wonder if we can recover my account through the bitcoin remittance keys. I have 17 bitcoins.Anyone help me?",

You have more than one account on trust wallet and but you only backup the recovery words that was empty, what kind of bad security idea did you follow. You have up to 17 bitcoin but you couldn't afford to get a hardware wallet, this is bad news and sad news for you because you cant have access to your bitcoins again except you have the recovery phrase where your bitcoin was received on its address.This is the message from Trust wallet when generating new recovery words, always take caution serious when you see one on your screen.",

As advised above, if you have backed up the 12 words for the primary account, you should import it on a new device and transfer that balance to a new cold storage wallet ASAP. However, the chance of getting back that second account is slim, don't waste your time with online scammers that may want to help you unless you have wallet.dat which in this case you don't and that also require brute force.",

Your best bet would be the police or a good private investigator. There's still a chance of finding your stolen goods if you act quickly. The first 48 hours are VERY crucial in such cases. Good luck!",

I regret what happened to Aécio, but this story is a perfect illustration of how not to do it. I hope this serves as a lesson to current and future readers of this thread.I see the following mistakes made by the author:- didn't save seed-phrase backups.- kept bitcoin on the phone's wallet of the, which he used constantly.- wallets were on devices that are valuable in themselves and attract thieves (phone and laptop).I hope you manage to restore access to your wallets as soon as possible, because thieves can do it too, before you.",

I lost my laptop in the robbery, so I lost the words. Sometimes stuff like this leaves me speechless. If you have several tens of thousand of dollars in an mobile wallet (!) that warns you that everything will be lost if you don't back it up, what did you think would happen. It is normal that phones break over time or get lost, so it was a 100% chance that at one point you will loose all your BTC. Maybe you did write down your seed at one point, because this is the only way to restore the funds if you can't get back the phone.",

He clearly kept everything in his laptop and mobile device which unfortunately not in his possession. When you have a wallet with serious amount of bitcoin then keeping the seed or private key in digital format is really very risky. Even having all words in a piece of paper is also risky. Safe to separate it in many parts. Only you and a very close circle you trust will know the sequence. Place the parts in different vault or places which is really safe and fire proof. Whenever you need it, you collect them together and restore the wallet to move funds.",
