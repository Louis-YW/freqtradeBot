  "content": "Have you guys tried tailing high rollers with their bets on sports and electronic sports? Because today I tried doing it just for an experiment and I took a bet on 5 games even without knowledge about them. I didn't put too much money into it because like I said, it's just for a trial. It didn't end up well and these are the results. 4 losses and 1 win.I copied the bet of users who are mostly playing above $1000 per bet. Some 1 Ethereum and the other with 0.1BTC if I remember it right. So I thought, these gamblers are not joking about their bets, they must have researched hard and knew who has the highest chance to win or the end result of the scores.Question: Has anyone been successful in doing this?I know it's not right to bet on a game without knowing about it, I am just curious if someone does this kind of strategy.",

Maybe you are right, it's just a bad day, I like your optimistic view about it too. I mean, this is what I am really looking for, those who really tried it and had a successful run or even the failed ones because I am trying to compare it.

A known user who has many followers tailing her picks in the chat box. Most of the time it is in a parlay and she will always warn everyone that is neither 100 assured nor a guarantee it will win. I think most gamblers who share their picks should put that note after their picks so no one will expect too much and they are ready to lose if it goes south. The high roller tailing though is like a blind pick but I may be wrong on something.@Eureka_07 may be right, there could be gamblers that are betting large amounts just for fun and it should be considered. Next time I will be trying picks that has low return but a higher chance to win. Like 1.10 - 1.50 odds.",

The reason is, these guys will still have money to bet even after a lose and taking the huge odds, whereas us average bettors would likely consider every aspect of the game and apply logic to it in order to win, even if it does not give that huge return that these high rollers are aiming for. They are just betting mostly on the possibility that their picks would hit - at least that's what the results you got tell me.",

For me, it's good to copy their bet at first with a small amount in order to acquaint yourself with that sport but later on, I would suggest doing it on your own if you already have the knowledge of the game you gain from your experience copy betting.",

What you done it is a research work which is very good because of the practical aspect of the research. But from what you have displayed from the images they odds are just like normal ones. The way other games are placed the same with these ones. The games are lucky winners games and not for skillful games. You were a newcomer in the casino but those guys are real customers in the company so you can't compare yourself to those guys. They know the in and out of the site. So they can play any amount. I thank God that you played what you can loss.",
