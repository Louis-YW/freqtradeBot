Any help would be appreciated. (E.g. is it better to get loan from a bank?)40 BTC is a huge number. Nobody will risk so much money here, nobody will want to show they have such big amounts here. Also 2 years is a very long time.Here I see mostly short-term micro-loans, not such big scale lending.Then you have to provide proper collateral. There's a pinned topic on that, you may want to read. Simply, if you have the proper collateral you may be better off just selling that.Even more, when I see people asking here for a \"business loan\" I pretty much think that somebody, again, just wants somebody act as \"angel investor\" for their business, i.e. give the money, take the risks and \"we'll see\".So yeah, unfortunately I don't think that you have chances here to get such an amount of money.",

People can be trusted only in their field. When we're talking loans and they're huge sums, it's a different field to just transacting $500-1k collectibles and more research should be done.",

      "body": "Hello allSorry. I missed to reply here. The loan was to get new collectible coins (pure silver coins) minted with loaded values.I have launched a series VIBGYOR (VOILET, Indigo, Blue , Yellow, Orange, Red). And thinking of launching two more series (Lost coin series and wonders Of the world series). VIBGYOR series Link here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415734Sincerely, forgot about the post as someone approached me to loan. (But turned out they were trying to scam us.)Someone left a trust feedback (for us) so realised that there were replies to this post.I, genuinely, thought that there wont be traction. So, completely forgot the post.I work as a Full time software developer day to day and the loan will help me start something and quit the job and hire people with getting the coins catalogued, minted etc.I also had an idea of creating numista style site for crypto physically collectibles. But don't have the funds to quit day job and work on this. Hence was asking for the loan. Also, I realised the loan thing may not work because all I have to secure the loan is some Cas collectibles, etc.So, I decided to invest money from my personal money from salary and get coins minted.Thank youETA,¬† lost Bitcoin series : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5426296.0",
