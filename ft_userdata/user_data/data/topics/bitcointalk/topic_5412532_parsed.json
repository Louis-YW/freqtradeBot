      "body": "@OP, as you might have noticed, you need the password to decrypt the Metamask Vault hash. I don't know if directly using Hashcat will be able to solve that, not if you didn't modify the program itself and incorporate it with how the Metamask encrypted its vault data.In any case, if the amount is worth it and you still trying to figure it out, asking and using a reputable wallet recovery service might be one of the good choices, take a look at https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/ / https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=240779.0.",
