His intentions might be different from what he wrote and just as you said it’s unfortunate that he’s not here to answer the question himself - all that will be said will just be based on personal opinion which might be totally wrong from the original intent.",

All the privacy was all because of Bitcoin and its decentralized utility, he must leave no trace behind, for Bitcoin to work as intended.

Besides, I am talking about something that can make people ignore the money aspect while they dedicate themselves to something else. An example is when the previous CoinMarketCap sold it to CZ because he needed to spend more time with his family it is not that he didn't see CMC flourish in the future but his family needed him more.The reason why Satoshi decided to move to another thing despite knowing the good vision of Bitcoin is something we don't know but I believe it's worth it for him and his family.",

He has move to the other side entails allot the state is relative and can be interpreted based on how you view it, until he come to tell us what it means. Pointing with others senairo, like I learnt in my school days Micheal faraday did an incredible things to light that the world enjoy today for humanity despite he did not enjoyed it due to some experiment that leads to his departure as history tells but can't been see as unfortunate because it's sacrifice stand to usher humanity good living. The other side to Satoshi may be more discovery as nothing has state about his been for now.",

As we should not leak information about anyone. I know you don't want also but we should respect each other's privacy.If Satoshi has chosen to remain anonymous then I guess he must have made proper measurement to make that sure, but still many people had tried to call themselves Satoshi but no one succeed to prove that. Well, He should be remain anonymous I mean if he will come again in the view, he become the most famous celebrity I guess and most of the people won't approve that. IFYK",

Satoshi did not disclose to Mike Hean the things he would be moving to, which he mentioned in his message as being in good hands with Gavin Andresen. What he alluded to in his message in April 2011 may indicate that the early important developers of Bitcoin may know these things. But what we assume is just speculation and guesses, of course. As for Bitcoin, he has given it the lifeblood and its whitepaper, and its development was completed by 2010, and he left the reins to the developers thereafter. Therefore, Satoshi’s disappearance to stay away from the spotlight and media and remaining unknown until now to preserve his privacy is one of the best mysteries he has done. The decentralization he established has succeeded in applying it to himself. It really does not matter that we know about the things that he has moved to, as we now have one of these things that is now known, which is BTC.",
