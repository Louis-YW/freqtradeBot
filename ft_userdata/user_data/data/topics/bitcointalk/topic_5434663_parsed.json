Example you want to search about 1xbit scam, scam accusations would be a good section to get it. But if you search on 1xbit official ANN, you will find a lot complaints too that you don't find it on accusations board.",

For example, if you suspect a thread to have been made about abc topic in Bitcoin discussion or economics board, then you can search for the keywords in both boards and also indicate the time period to search through.- Jay -",

Normally I’d use the forum search engine for things that include a verbatim search patter or a set of words, and Google for something that’s more fuzzy.The search engine is not brilliant, but I find it useful enough subject to:-   Using the Advanced Search feature (not the plain search).-   Delimiting message age (i.e. to 2, 7, 30 days, 400 days or such), otherwise the default 9999 will bring up and even display essentially old post entries. This parameter is rather crucial in general.-   Sort by relevance (default) may be useful sometimes, but I tend to favour using \"Most recent topic first\".-   Learning well the practical difference between \"match all words\" and \"match any words\". Complementary to this, searching for patters using quotes.-   Occasionally, delimit the boards you want to seach in (i.e. if I want to write on my local board about something, I’ll often delimit the search to my Local Board & sub-boards).",

A forum search will return more general results, which can be very confusing for newbies. While TryNinja will return more specific results, for this reason I often use TryNinja instead of the search engines available on forums.",

One more additional option you can use is searching with Ninjastic website, that is made by member TryNinja.I found that this method can be much more effective since you can search by specific member/author, custom dates, title, post content, addresses, etc.Free bonus is that Ninjastic website will even show you archived and deleted/modified posts:https://ninjastic.space/",

From my understanding, nothing that we have discussed here so far that haven't be discussed before, i can say that the solution of your questions can come into two ways either you search for whst you are about to discuss with the search button and if it's not there, you can proceed to make your post, so i believe that's how some of the experience people do  via checking the content of what they have not discussed or what is about to discuss.",
