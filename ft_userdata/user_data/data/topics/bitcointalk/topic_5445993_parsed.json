And I know that everybody has their own speculations and also wins and also US presidential election is still 2024, we are still in the first quarter of 2023. Is it worth discussing this now? I do not think so.Quote from: tusandii on March 23, 2023, 06:07:29 AMBut unfortunately in my country when there are elections and betting there are always debates and fights if the final results of the elections do not match expectations so I myself have the thought that betting on elections will actually get someone in trouble and therefore I am not interested in betting at all in the election even though what is at stake is the election in the US state.Only what could put someone in trouble is when you are publicly announcing or showing people to vote for someone, if the person is not liked in such area, it can be a problem for such supporter. The best you can do is to let the person you want to vote for to remain in your mind. The way I think it is, betting site can not disclosed that you are voting for this so person, or that you bet that this presidential candidate would be the winner, it remain on the betting sites, so no problem. Besides, this is US election and you are not from USA, only international betting sites that would have this for their customers to stake who would be the winner, even just on only very few international betting sites. You have nothing to worry about. Even as for the local ones, you are right that people are betting for who to be their president, but not also a problem to use the opportunity to bet who would win the presidential election.",

This is just a normal bet to us and even the odd when you bet on the US election is not even close to what I do see when on bet on my regular football matches. The US election is still far from us and I can't imagine seeing myself going to bet on it when we have more than 12 months for us to wait for the outcome. I can't even imagine the amount of money I would have won betting on my regular sport bets.",

Ron DeSantis will be my best bet. He will get votes from many democrats that are not satisfied with Biden's administration.
