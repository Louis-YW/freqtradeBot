  "content": "Dear Bitcoin Talk community,There is a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange operating under the name of Boomchange or Boom Change, which can be found at \"Boomchange.com\", \"Boomchange.io\" and \"Boomchange.net\". This fraudulent platform, operated by an individual from Armenia (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡²) in Asia, who may be using Ucom as an internet provider, claims to offer cryptocurrency swapping and withdrawal to fiat currencies, with methods such as PayPal. However, this exchange is fraudulent in nature and seeks to scam its users through cryptocurrency theft. Numerous reports have been filed regarding the fraudulent activities of Boomchange around the internet.Their fraudulent websites, boomchange.com and boomchange.io, are promoted through various means, including social media platforms like YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@boomchange_com & https://www.youtube.com/@boomchangeespanol), as well as search engine optimization (SEO) tactics. They employ these strategies to attract unsuspecting victims, and lure them into their fraudulent schemes.The website \"Boomchange.com\" is a static site built on a .php script. This script generates crypto addresses that belong to the domain holders of \"Boomchange.com\", who were previously associated with \"Boomchange.io\". The old domain owned by the fraudsters was suspended by the Namecheap registrar, but they have now brought \"Boomchange.com\" back online. The fraudulent scheme operates in such a way that if users send cryptocurrency to \"Boomchange.com\", their funds will end up in the wallet of the fraudsters, and these funds will be lost forever. The scam is designed to deceive users into thinking that boomchange.com and boomchange.io are legitimate cryptocurrency exchange platforms, but in reality, they are fraudulent websites that should be avoided at all costs. The Armenian company, Smartweb.am, is believed to have developed a fraudulent website for the Armenian Boomchange Operator. The suspicion arises from the fact that the operator of Boomchange specifically ordered their programming service to create their scam platform, \"Boomchange\". This assertion can be further verified by visiting the portfolio page on: https://smartweb.am/#portfolio , providing evidence that Smartweb.am could have been responsible for designing the fraudulent website.Red Flags of Boomchange: Unlicensed, Unregistered, and Verified as a ScamBoomchange lacks an official license from entities like FinCEN or MSB, proving it to be a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange.The absence of a physical office or headquarters, coupled with the lack of a company address, further confirms that Boomchange is a deceptive crypto scam phishing website.Another concerning aspect is the complete absence of official business registration or any similar documentation, underscoring the illegitimate nature of Boomchange.A significant cause for alarm is Boomchange's failure to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, solidifying its reputation as a malicious scam crypto exchange.In addition to these red flags, Boomchange's website features a fabricated Terms of Use page, incorporating AI-generated texts, while crucial sections such as the refund policy and privacy policies are intentionally missing. You can view the page here: (https://web.archive.org/web/20240106020937/https://boomchange.com/terms-of-use).The most damning evidence against Boomchange lies in its verification as a scam by reputable platforms like MetaMask and Scam-Alert, further reinforcing the prevailing concerns regarding its lack of trustworthiness.You can view the pages here: https://metamask.github.io/phishing-warning/v3.0.0/#hostname=boomchange.com&href=https%3A%2F%2Fboomchange.com%2F , https://scam-alert.io/scam/bc1qgwx3z59thekwcmp92arrvf4s2yg4ystsr9k2ttBelow in this text, you can find additional evidence and indicators of the fraudulent and malicious activities associated with the fake crypto exchange scam phishing website known as \"Boomchange\".The SCAM Domains are:boomchange.comboomchange.ioboomchange.netThis page can be accessed through a direct URL and serves as proof that the scam operation is in place:https://boomchange.com/order/5bdda7e1a9 (Backup from 10/30/2023: https://web.archive.org/web/20231030133554/https://boomchange.com/order/5bdda7e1a9)https://boomchange.com/order/c7dda2e520 (Backup from 10/30/2023: https://web.archive.org/web/20231030133703/https://boomchange.com/order/c7dda2e520)https://boomchange.io/order/5bdda7e1a9https://boomchange.io/order/c7dda2e520The scammers behind the fraudulent \"Boomchange\" operation utilize a static end-order page, which persistently presents the same cryptocurrency address to all visitors, irrespective of their affiliation with the fake exchange. Furthermore, the end order pages of the Boomchange scam do not impose any specific information or credential requirements, thereby allowing unauthorized users unhindered access.In addition, the final order pages of the \"Boomchange\" fraudulent scheme consistently exhibit identical fraudulent cryptocurrency addresses to all visitors, each of which is controlled by the operator of the scam.Visitors to the order page do not need to provide any information or login credentials, making it easily accessible to anyone. However, the displayed Ethereum address \"0x4c2acc0580765d04d555a791bcb0b3661af67b8d\" and Bitcoin addresses \"bc1qmxkj49ujzednhnzkr3wqpkeh4kfslr9zqume72\" and \"bc1qgwx3z59thekwcmp92arrvf4s2yg4ystsr9k2tt\" are actually being used to deceive users by pretending to be a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange.Blockchain scan of \"0x4c2acc0580765d04d555a791bcb0b3661af67b8d\", \"bc1qmxkj49ujzednhnzkr3wqpkeh4kfslr9zqume72\" & \"bc1qgwx3z59thekwcmp92arrvf4s2yg4ystsr9k2tt\":https://www.blockchain.com/en/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qmxkj49ujzednhnzkr3wqpkeh4kfslr9zqume72 (Over $50.000 stolen as of 10/30/2023)https://www.blockchain.com/en/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qgwx3z59thekwcmp92arrvf4s2yg4ystsr9k2tt (Over $58.600 stolen as of 10/30/2023)https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/eth/0x4c2acc0580765d04d555a791bcb0b3661af67b8d (Over $14.700 stolen as of 10/30/2023)On these transactions stolen Bitcoin got transferred to Binance:https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/39b3941da4aff56ccf55d307065034a87bb7c7629d3cf7c03db0129f5bf76a0e (Date 12/30/2023) -

They use this tactic in an effort to trick victims and evade detection, thus allowing them to continue their scamming activities. In addition, there have been reports from victims across the globe who have fallen victim to the scam. These reports can be found on various online platforms which are linked below.The operator suspected to be in charge of Boomchange (Boomchange.com & Boomchange.io) resides in Yerevan, Armenia (Asia).Suspended History of the Domain \"Boomchange.com\":The history of the \"Boomchange.com\" domain is marked by suspensions and changes of ownership. Initially registered with NameCheap, the domain was suspended by the registrar. After expiring, it became available again and was repurchased by the Armenian operator of \"Boomchange\" through another domain registrar called NICENIC. It is noteworthy that NICENIC is considered the most abused domain registrar according to Spamhaus.org (https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/registrars/).\"Boomchange.com\" was also suspended on NICENIC. Unfortunately, the domain is currently back online as the operators have employed psychological operations and social engineering techniques to persuade the NICENIC abuse support teams to unblock their abused domain. As of 1/19/2024, the domain is still accessible.As of February 16, 2024, the operator of \"Boomchange.com\" changed the domain registrar from \"Nicenic\" to \"Internet Domain Service BS Corp\" to continue his fraud and abuse of their domain services (https://web.archive.org/web/20240306101848/https://www.whois.com/whois/boomchange.com).Here is the evidence to support these claims:https://web.archive.org/web/20230510133318/https://www.whois.com/whois/boomchange.comhttps://web.archive.org/web/20240119200752/https://www.whois.com/whois/boomchange.comTheir previous domain, \"Boomchange.com\", was already suspended for fraudulent activities and an archived version of the site from 2022 at https://web.archive.org/web/20220701070044/https://boomchange.com/ before suspension. Currently, the domain has expired on the old registrar, Namecheap where it was blocked, and the fraudsters have switched to the NICENIC chinese registrar and later to Internet Domain Service BS Corp registrar. Despite the domain's checkered past, it is back online, and people continue to fall victim to its scams. As of April 10, 2023, the operator of \"Boomchange.com\" is now using a new domain, \"Boomchange.net\" again on NICENIC chinese registrar, as the previous one was flagged as a phishing website by MetaMask and some other crypto cybersecurity companies.These are the email addresses of the \"Boomchange\" operator:boomchange222@gmail.comboomchange6@gmail.comregister2022.2023@gmail.comedgarhakobyan2012@gmail.cominfo@boomchange.comA newer email address that has been identified is: boomchangeplay@gmail.comThese might are the fraudsters IP addresses:37.252.89.7 - Armenia, Yerevan - Internet Provider: Ucom.am (This might be his computer IP)46.130.8.54 - Armenia, Yerevan - Internet Provider: Telecom AM (This might be his mobile phone IP)Another IP address of the Armenian living in Yerevan cyber criminal: 37.252.93.99 - his iPhone IP address (Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 16_0_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1)Update as of 11/2/2023:46.162.253.8 Â - Armenia, City: Yerevan, State/Region: Erevan - Internet Provider: Ucom.am (New IP of \"Boomchange\" operator as of 11/2/2023)Possible VPN or Proxy IP Addresses of the Armenian Operator of \"Boomchange\":41.160.35.133 - South Africa, Gauteng/Johannesburg/Western Cape - Internet Provider: Liquid Telecommunications Operations Limited (New IP of \"Boomchange\" operator, might be a Proxy or VPN as of 11/2/2023)217.182.175.162 - France, Hauts-de-France - Internet Provider: OVH SAS (New IP of \"Boomchange\" operator, might be a Proxy or VPN as of 11/2/2023)The Hosting provider of the scam website \"Boomchange.com\" is: Amarutu Technology - Koddos.netBoomchange can be reported to abuse@koddos.net or through a ticket on their site under \"Abuse\": https://koddos.net/clients/submitticket.phpThe Domain provider of the scam website \"Boomchange.com\" is: NICENIC INTERNATIONAL GROUP CO., LIMITED - Nicenic.netBoomchange can be reported to abuse@nicenic.net through email.\"Boomchange\" has been scamming people for years, utilizing search engine optimization (SEO) and purchasing positive online reviews on platforms like Trustpilot and Sitejabber to promote their fraudulent services.The \"Boomchange\" Operator systematically deletes negative reviews by flagging them as not genuine, abusing the report system of these platforms, and making it difficult for scammed victims to provide the necessary evidence to keep their reviews visible, resulting in only verified negative reviews remaining on Trustpilot and Sitejabber.These are the social media accounts of the criminal operator of \"Boomchange\", which he uses to promote this fraud:https://www.youtube.com/@boomchange_comhttps://www.youtube.com/@boomchangeespanolhttps://www.youtube.com/@boomchange_iohttps://www.facebook.com/people/Boom-Change/100084132785601/https://www.tiktok.com/@boomchangehttps://www.reddit.com/user/boomchangehttps://www.twitter.com/BoomChange1https://www.instagram.com/boomchange_comWhen the domain \"Boomchange.com\" was blocked by the former domain registrar Namecheap, the scammers switched to using \"Boomchange.io\" for their fraudulent activities. During that time, they also changed their YouTube handle to \"@boomchange_io\" to match their new domain name. Now, after buying back the \"Boomchange.com\" domain name following its expiration on another domain registrar, the scammers have resumed using the domain name for their deceptive activities. As a result, they have reverted back to their old YouTube handle, \"@boomchange_com\".The operator of \"Boomchange\" uses the Telegram and WhatsApp number (+18502800803) to engage in social engineering and manipulate victims into sending cryptocurrency to the fraudulent platform.GitHub accounts of the operator of \"Boomchange\":https://github.com/Boomchangehttps://github.com/adminchangerhttps://github.com/Uscompanylawhttps://github.com/Jerayerhttps://github.com/Rodriguez3234https://github.com/CarsWell87https://github.com/Kurtel-liot0808 (banned)https://github.com/User-Jack22 (banned)https://github.com/Gagi77788 (banned)The operator of the \"Boomchange\" scam has created multiple spam accounts on GitHub, including \"adminchanger\" and \"Uscompanylaw\". These accounts use words in their username such as \"lawyer\" and \"admin\" to suggest authenticity, but they are fake and part of a malicious manipulation tactic.As of 1/3/2024, the operator of the malicious scam platform \"Boomchange\" was recently active on GitHub under the account username \"@Jerayer\" (https://github.com/Jerayer).Possibly \"Boomchange\" operator accounts on BitcoinTalk:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3559734 (Username: Craigorders)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3551462 (Username: Jerayer)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3561707 (Username: James77887799)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=828900 (Username: tobi4255) It seems that the account with the username \"tobi4255\" on https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=828900 may have been purchased on the black market, given its suspicious activity promoting the fraudulent website \"Boomchange\" found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457875.0 It is worth noting that during the same time period, many questionable accounts - some of which with a Trust rating of -1 - posted almost identical positive comments about the website, which appears suspicious.The Connection Between \"Boomchange.com\" and \"IPTVleopard.com\": Uncovering the Association with Other Illegal Activities:I researched and discovered that the website \"iptvleopard.com\" may be associated with the \"Boomchange.com\" Operator, who also owns the website. The website \"iptvleopard.com\" is being promoted on the same Medium account as \"Boomchange.com\" through fake articles. You can view these articles at the following archived links: 1. https://web.archive.org/web/20240120180921/https://medium.com/@WBD-Vlad 2. https://web.archive.org/web/20240120181225/https://medium.com/@WBD-Vlad/best-canada-iptv-service-provider-for-tv-channels-iptvleopard-2b4e4a896e74 3. https://web.archive.org/web/20240120181609/https://medium.com/@WBD-Vlad/the-best-reliable-crypto-exchange-boomchange-a9220839b228In one of their YouTube videos, where they advertise the \"Boomchange\" scam platform, I discovered that the operator also researched becoming an \"IPTV Reseller\". You can see this in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4KrPTeNCCA&ab_channel=BoomChange (archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20240120181903/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4KrPTeNCCA). At 0:08 minute mark, it is evident that they searched on Google to become an IPTV reseller, making it the second clear connection I found.Additionally, they promote the \"IPTV\" stuff on a YouTube channel.The videos on this channel are similar to the ones on the \"Boomchange\" YouTube channel, both in terms of creation and voiceovers. This further suggests that the Armenian operator of \"Boomchange\" also operates the \"IPTVleopard.com\" website. You can find their YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@ShortMovies2024 (Channel-ID: UC6IM2FP9we9E5A3IGGl1fgQ)For their other platform, \"iptvleopard.com\", they use the WhatsApp number \"+37433890790\" and attempt to promote this website on Reddit, just like they do with \"Boomchange\". You can see the attempted promotion here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Internet/comments/17vsev8/best_iptv_service_providers_in_2023_trusted/However, the post has already been removed by Reddit fortunately.It seems that \"iptvleopard.com\" belongs to the Armenian operator of the \"boomchange.com\" crypto scam phishing website. The utilization of illegal IPTV services directly violates copyright laws that are in place to protect the intellectual property of content creators and providers.More information about the \"Boomchange\" scam can be found on Chainabuse and other Bitcoin abuse sites, such as:-https://www.chainabuse.com/domain/boomchange.comhttps://www.chainabuse.com/domain/boomchange.iohttps://www.chainabuse.com/report/2281bb1d-cc6a-4023-a57a-a09504d258a8?context=search-domain&d=https://www.chainabuse.com/report/2d277c00-5a1d-4544-941c-66a784c47d39?context=search-address&a=bc1qr0avgajde8y37qadrtjd4vt6sdvl9dgq7j6ckj&chain=https://www.chainabuse.com/report/dc9abf1d-264f-4420-ba2a-b475809e0411?context=search-address&a=1Dgc3h8caaJKEBRyrLgovwQWudxmDXmKiK&chain=-https://scam-alert.io/scam/bc1qgwx3z59thekwcmp92arrvf4s2yg4ystsr9k2tt - Confirmed Scam (boomchange.com) by Scam-Alerthttps://scam-alert.io/scam/bc1q6a5gket0qhzks42k6v94uwshrse5t0njtpy3grhttps://scam-alert.io/scam/18vpuWeMMFEZhm5tgxjuTs7aHtwotchPkrhttps://scam-alert.io/scam/bc1qr0avgajde8y37qadrtjd4vt6sdvl9dgq7j6ckjhttps://scam-alert.io/scam/1Dgc3h8caaJKEBRyrLgovwQWudxmDXmKiK-https://cryptscam.com/en/detail/bc1qgwx3z59thekwcmp92arrvf4s2yg4ystsr9k2tthttps://cryptscam.com/en/detail/bc1q6a5gket0qhzks42k6v94uwshrse5t0njtpy3grhttps://cryptscam.com/en/detail/18vpuWeMMFEZhm5tgxjuTs7aHtwotchPkrhttps://cryptscam.com/en/detail/bc1qr0avgajde8y37qadrtjd4vt6sdvl9dgq7j6ckjhttps://cryptscam.com/en/detail/1Dgc3h8caaJKEBRyrLgovwQWudxmDXmKiK-https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/18vpuWeMMFEZhm5tgxjuTs7aHtwotchPkr-Be cautious of the scam known as \"Boomchange\" which operates under the domains \"Boomchange.com\" and \"Boomchange.io\", and thank you for your attention.

They try to trick people and scam their money in form of cryptocurrency.They promote their Fraud sites (boomchange.com/boomchange.io) through social media such as Youtube and search engine SEO.Kind regards.Thank you, OP, for posting this thread, I have never heard of the Boomchange platform before, and I searched and did not find they have an ANN on the forum; the fake features of their scam exchange platform that attract customers is that they can start using Boomchange service in less than 5 dollars and the other feature is that anyone can make an exchange of cryptocurrencies to receive his cash on Paypal, Pioneer, or Skrill at the lowest prices and the lowest cost as they claim. There are a lot of people that I've seen commenting on Boomchange YouTube videos that they lost their crypto, and that's true because the proofs mentioned by the OP show that their platform was launched to deceive people only, and after where the domain of their platform is suspended, they quickly create another domain to continue their fraudulent movements; in addition to that, the domain that ends with .io has not completed 100 days since its creation, and there are no updates on their social sites other than videos created with robotsâ€™ voices about how the exchange works on their platform.",

Their .com domain meanwhile which has been here for a lot longer is full of negative reviews, see: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/boomchange.com It also helped that Trust Pilot removed fake reviews on thereQuote from: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/boomchange.comWeâ€™ve removed a number of fake reviews for this company.We believe these reviews relate to review seller networks that buy and sell fake reviews. These can lead to bias and compromise the reliability of reviews. Weâ€™re strongly against this.We take the integrity of our platform very seriously.

However, this is far from the truth.The evidence presented in the aforementioned Bitcointalk topic sheds light on various instances of fraudulent behavior.To further support the claims made by forum members, I would like to draw your attention to a review on SiteJabber that highlights Koddos.net's lack of action against this scam accusation. The review can be accessed using the following link: https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/koddos.net#113 .Given the severity of the situation and the growing number of individuals affected by this scam, I kindly request Bitcointalk members attention to report the activities of boomchange.io/boomchange.com to Koddos ( abuse@koddos.net ) which is their server hosting provider. Try to explain the scam of the fake crypto exchange Boomchange to them in a comprehensible and logical way, as they are probably laymen when it comes to crypto.Thank you.",

I have been using this website more than a year and I donâ€™t understand why there were posted misleading reports. You can use boomchange free and its legit well working swapping serviceMy guy, by that logic that would mean that people in this forum would've heard about this and this account wouldn't be created this month or year but last year or probably last month because you probably have encountered some problem using the site even if you're saying that the exchange is good, you catching my drift? Now I'm not inclined to believe when someone accuses someone of doing scams online unless there's damning evidence to prove that they do definitely scam people online. For your defense though, OP's word has more weight compared to yours because he's got the evidences to back it up, now it's your turn or you're one of the many accounts used by boomchange.Nice catch OP, even if you didn't follow the typical reporting format, I'm impressed by how you organize your evidences, I'm not so sure I agree with leaking the IP address though, I'm not the authority here but I believe that's doxxing right?",
