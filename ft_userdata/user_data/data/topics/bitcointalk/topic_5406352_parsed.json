They even appear in Mycellium and Blockchair. But if you just google it, you'll see ads and fake reviews in their favour. The pathetic thing about this is that if all the money and effort they put into ripping people off were put into running an honest business they would make a lot of money. The many gambling houses that operate in an honest way prove it.",

As for me, if I check a site and I saw any bad review, I checked the bad review specifically, on the bad review, they were more about users that are unable to withdraw from the gambling site, that alone will not make me use 1xbit.Definitely, the good ones of the reviews are fake.",

I do this cause I'm specifically looking for scam accusations against them and study those, rather than positive reviews which could be motivated financially.That's standard approach of anyone that is a little bit longer in crypto/generally using online services, but unfortunately that's not how majority of people operate. They tend to trust everyone and only after they get scammed by 1xbit they put into google \"1xbit scam\" which brings them here.

They are definitely paying majority of positive reviews, but some of them are legit as you simply can't scam your users 100% of the time and run for longer period. 1xbit is probably playing the long game and scamming selectively in order to keep getting constant influx of new people.",

It is easy to assume that they are paying for positive reviews. Participants in their signature campaign in this forum are blindly defending 1xbit, and from this it can be understood that spending money in their campaign is not a loss for them. 1xbit marketing is spending a lot of money, and the result is that these kinds of fake positive reviews are available online. These reviews are very dangerous for new and inexperienced players who would be interested in joining a website full of scam reports.",

People used to look on review sites for ICOs, and then lose all their money on scams and rug pulls. So what did we learn? These review websites have a business model, which is to positively review ANYTHING as long as they are paid enough money.This is not how you should be doing your research on whether or not a website is legit and upstanding. I think anyone should realise by now what it means to ignore red flags and trust in the greedy.",

And if you open first result then it will show you that they have received 5.8* out of 10* That doesn't a good site. I think it means a bad site. From that page if you click on recommended page then it will redirect to the good sites and there has no space for 1xbit. So, I don't think there is anything which can make you shocking.",
