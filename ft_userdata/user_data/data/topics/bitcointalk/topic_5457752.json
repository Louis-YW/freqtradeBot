  "content": "Someone that is not a member of this forum saw my service and hired me to write some articles since April. I charged him $4000 and asked for $3000 advance. He paid the advance of $2,500, but has since vanished. I'm putting up this post in case he forgot he gave someone $2,500. If you know someone that paid someone for a job and forgot the person, please let them know I'm the one. As in, can't imagine someone throwing away their money just like that. I also hope he sees this post and remembers.Edit: Some people don't believe my story. That's not atypical of Bitcointalk. Anyways, I do not care if you believe it or not. For those of you that have given me some advice, you're all appreciated. Hopefully, my client will be back. I really pray he comes back because men like him come by very rarely. As in, men who have trust in a weird harsh, near-trustless world. For those hoping for a TXID, keep hoping, but that's not gonna happen.I've written to the company. Hopefully, if he's working with them they'll respond. Thanks all.Last year, someone sent me some unexpected funds and I posted it here. Some folks say I'm sort of hunting for merits and reputation (whatever that means) for these posts. In other words, that I claim people sent funds when no one did. Anyway, those seem to be mainly people who live in Bitcointalk. In the interest of objective people, I'll explain what happened last year. An exchange contacted me to publish an article for them on my site. It seems that the contact didn't know when the finance chap sent me the funds and for days, I didn't know the source of the crypto. Later, perhaps weeks later, the initial contact sent me an email and notified me that they had paid for my service. Here is a link to a snapshot of the email: https://imgur.com/a/okUotWiI'll keep updating this thread until my $2.5k client shows up. Update:No response from the company yet. I'll give them a couple of weeks before sending another email. Meanwhile, I want this before a lot of people. Who knows...",

Though it's not a duty for you but it would be better if you try to search out your client in April. Anyway It's been too late and there is a less chance that you might search your client. Have you got the client from Services section? Then there maybe a possibility to find out that guy. And obviously sign a message if someone contact you and claim it.",

Anyway, our life activities are not predictable. Maybe something happens to the client because nobody will want to waste such amount of money. Maybe health challenges or other uncertainties might be the reason for his disappearance. Maybe he can just show up at any time so ensure that you are through with the job.
