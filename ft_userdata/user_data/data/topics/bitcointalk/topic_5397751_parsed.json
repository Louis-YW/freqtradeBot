      "body": "Not sure if that's what you're asking but: It's true. In fact it's easier to find collision of a multi-sig address rather than a single-sig's, because of the birthday paradox. For a 256-bit P2WSH, there's one in 2^128 chances to find a colliding script while in a 160-bit single-sig P2SH, it's 1 in 2^160. For instance, you and the attacker might decide to do business together and share your keys to form a P2SH multi-sig (160 bits). You give him a public key and wait until he gives you his public key. The attacker now constantly tries out two different scripts; a P2SH where he can spend money all by himself and a P2SH which will form your multi-sig. At some point, after about 2^80 tries, he'll find a collision. Quote from: nosferatu8701 on May 08, 2022, 08:52:00 AMIs the above true? If an attacker were to randomly come across my private key, he can move the funds without requiring the origin keys that resulted in the multi sig?But, that's true for everything. If the attacker randomly comes across your private key, he's also the owner of that public key. Multi-sig or not.",

It's in the form of \"OP_HASH160 <script hash> OP_EQUAL\". If you want to avoid the scenario wherein you've been attacked alike, use P2MS where you include the public keys beforehand instead of a script hash. Note that P2MS comes with disadvantages:Quote from: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/p2msWhy do we now use P2SH instead of P2MS?Because by using P2SH you can avoid the disadvantages that come with a “raw” P2MS script:1. P2MS has no address format. So if you want someone to put a P2MS lock on your bitcoins, you will need to construct and send them the raw locking script yourself. Worse still, they may not be able to create this transaction for you, as most wallets only allow you to use addresses (and not raw scripts) when making a transaction.2. P2MS is limited to 3 public keys. The locking script of a P2MS can get pretty sizeable with all the public keys, so it’s limited to 3 (to prevent too much data being stored in in the UTXO set). However, with P2SH you can use multisig locks with up to 15 public keys.So you can still use P2MS if you want, but it’s more convenient to use P2SH to achieve the same thing instead.",

Meaning for example if people could find HASH160 collisions, find public key (hash) collisions, script (hash) collisions and generally speaking anything that would let them spend someone else's coins and successfully pull off  the attack, Bitcoin that we know will no longer exist so it won't matter if you are holding your coins in a multi-sig address.The reason why Bitcoin works and keeps on growing is because such attacks are not possible and if there were the smallest possibilities of these attacks becoming possible in near future we would have changed the algorithm already.",

I know and have tried using rotorcuda and fialka  to run random private key attacks and trying to find private keys. In fact, I have already found a few private keys (unfortunately they were already emptied before by someone else). However, this is very much a possibility. The fact that me, an individual can run such brute force attacks for random keys with little knowledge concerns me. I'm sure that North Korea and other big malicious actors would be running far bigger operations to brute force random keys. I may go so far as to even say that these whale alerts that we see on twitter (that some bitcoin was moved after 10-11 years) may be such crackers stumbling on these private keys.I want to protect myself from such attacks by using multi sig. My assumption was that the Bitcoin chain requires the 2 signatures and this enforcement is done on chain. However those reddit comments and the ones in this thread too suggest otherwise.",

Dictionary attacks and bruteforce attacks of that sorts are meant to target non-random and weak keys. They are neither effective, in terms of time and space as well as the cost to yield anything. Anyone can run brute force attacks to generate millions and millions of keys but with the key space so big, it would be impossible for them to find anything at all. There is nothing to protect at all because no one in the world can feasibly bruteforce any keys generated correctly. If they could, then we would've done something about it by now.",
