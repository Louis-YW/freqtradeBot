      "body": "My dear there's nothing bad about cryptocurrency at large, the only thing I noticed wrong is when you try to apply greed in the industry because let say for instance, you invested in an altcoin and it happens to pump 10x or maybe 50x instead of you to sell and take profit you will be expecting the market to give you 100x of which to me is a greed why because the opportunity was there for you to utilize but you didn't make any efforts rather you seat and watch the opportunity passed you bye. Again if you want to invest for long time do not consider invest in altcoin because they may not have this long term increase since we often encountered bear market. At this point either it may dump on your head or you are being left with nothing from your investment so I suggest you should look and consider bitcoin as the ultimate over here and can withstand long term investment. If you can understand all this correctly then cryptocurrency is very sweet especially when you don't involve yourself with a borrowed money or a family money other than your spare money.",

The most beautiful part of being a part of a bitcoin community is that you get current information on bitcoin trends and everything happening in the bitcoin ecosystem, the disadvantage however is that when you’re in a bitcoin forum such as this, most people are biased and only discuss bitcoin, you can miss out on other profitable projects in the crypto space because you’re fixated on bitcoin.",
