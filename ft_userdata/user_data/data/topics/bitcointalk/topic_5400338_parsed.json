So am putting this question to you what is your set price to buy more bitcoin during this dip?For me, just buy when the price goes down, you don't have to wait for a certain price before buying. Of course there is an advantage when buying $20k as compare to $29k, but the thing is will the price go that low? what if it's not? and the price suddenly bounce back to $35k? So you missed that opportunity already. So better prepare yourself to buy at every dip and just take advantage of it, and no need to wait and don't regret when you have bought already even if the price goes down further.",

So am putting this question to you what is your set price to buy more bitcoin during this dip?Below $30k, and lucky if I can still get BTC from below $25k.I can wait that much since I have a limited capital so when I see opportunity to buy, I will do it. I was able to short some BTC and have a good result, BTC has been playing for this price range, a good opportunity for a short trader. I wish to buy more at a more cheaper BTC, we will see it Bitcoin goes dipper below $20k again, I’ll go all in for that.",

So am putting this question to you what is your set price to buy more bitcoin during this dip?If it hits $25k, I'll buy more but that's not a condition to me. As long as I've got money to buy at any price that I'm good with, I'll buy. That's the matter with most of us, we're targeting and setting a price and if it's not hit, what do we do next?DCA, it's the best strategy. It's okay to set a price but if it's not hitting, you just do your thing and buy as soon as you've got spare money and if you're long, there's no need to worry about it because you have an all set price in the future.",

So am putting this question to you what is your set price to buy more bitcoin during this dip?Don't have any set price to buy but I always look up for how the market goes and what will be the emotion spread on the market since if we just look at the price without having a look on something needed to consider on trading then maybe we are doing a more risky trades. I am waiting or monitoring the price right now to see what is the ideal price to join the market and this days are best to join if we want to short because the market is falling and mostly the volatility is great for us to earn especially we want to do short trades.",

There's no exact time or price to be honest if you want to buy or invest though but as long as you think it's gonna give you a profit then go for it. This is not applicable for newbies, they should learn the basics first.If you have enough money or right amount of money that you think you are ready to lose then buy Bitcoin. And don't think that you only need to buy if this is the bottom, no, you are not since no one knows what will be the bottom so you should take the risk to buy what you think is the bottom then proceed to carry out your next plan.",

If you look at a weekly chart since bitcoins existence you will see it as strong support.Last I checked it was something like $22K. Which is ideal since I don’t think the old ATH will be reached. And I think we will chop for the summer and the $25K will eventually be retested and broken. Way too much negative news lately for Bitcoin to not retest the $25K area at least.
