      "body": "Are you looking for something like they will do KYC verification for you? Does it mean you want to buy KYC verification? I am just confused about your demand. If you are thinking of passing KYC through someone else, then it seems you are going to do something wrong. Otherwise, why are youn't able to do KYC? Selling and buying KYC verification are both risky. I don't think you will find any, at least from the forum. I would advise you to avoid such illegal business on the forum. Otherwise, you might fall into trouble.",

It will be the person who solder their documents who will end up getting traced and not the actual criminal.I'm really not comfortable with people coming to get others kyc for them. We understand there are restrictions now in the space across loads of platforms operating in various countries that have compliance issues but their kyc data, in most cases, end up in the dark Web and this is not an ideal situation. People should be careful how they share their details online even if they are to be paid for it, ensure its truly worth it",

Then you would be surprised how many people are ready to sell their personal data for $15-20. There is plenty of services who are paying or used to pay for registration and KYC verification. Mostly it's online banks or payment services like Verse, Bitavo, W1tty and etc. People don't value their privacy at all.Quote from: Blackbacked on May 16, 2024, 01:03:19 AMMany people live in ultra-authoritarian countries where any words against the state is a crime and if your name added to the \"list of terrorists and extremists\" you can't even use bank account in any bank.In some countries like China do exist millions of so called \"unregistered children\" who of course cannot pass KYC even without being added to \"state adversaries\" lists.All of these people cannot pass any KYC without using fake, stolen or bought IDs of another people.From my point of view, it is absolutely ethical to use stolen IDs from state officials, because they participate in state violence and deserve no mercy! I understand why people are doing it and being in their place I probably would do same thing. But all these reasons behid this doesn't makes their action legal and ethical.",
