His forum account was open on the browser, and logged in; the hacker could, when he finds the computer idle, control the mouse and keyboard and publish what he wants through the account because he cannot change the password or email if he does not get them through the keylogger or text documents.@Harizen, I wish you all the best in returning to your account after the administrators review what you provided and unlock the account. I believe it was locked as a security precaution after the scam ANN topic was published from it. Now, all that must be done is to find out the real reason that the hacker was able to access your account; you should think and review what you did before this happened. I also advise you to use another device and change the complete account security information if your account has been unlocked until you make sure of this hacker; he cannot reaccess the account again.",

Good Luck, and that will be temporary OP.  I guess change your email to an email that hasn't been used in anything. Worked for me. Of course, be careful as well. P.S. @tranthidung, yes unfortunately. It says \"Pwned in 3 data breaches and found 3 pastes (subscribe to search sensitive breaches)\"Yes currently, I'm not using that email anymore, and the worst thing is that, I'm always receiving random emails from potential scammers. Not annoying for me though. I guess that hacking incident that happened to me with my account is what I considered as \"blessing in disguise\" since I learned something from that mistake.

I tried to recap what I did these past days and weeks. As an internet guy for a long, basically, I know the basic and advanced safety measures for protecting my personal account. Although there's no 100% guaranteed protection, I'm really sure I didn't do some crappy moves that lead to this. My Bitcointalk account was only accessed here in my IP's home and on my mobile data (single network) when away.No downloading attachments, no downloading apps, not entering any inputs on a field, etc.I don't welcome any random apps, browser plugins, extensions, etc. from random sources on my PC. It's been well protected by me for years and this is actually the first time I got to this kind of situation. Aside from that, all my keys, passwords, and any personal stuff can't be found on my PC, email, notepad, files, etc. as I stored those on my external flash drive and a backup USB drive.In the first place though, I'm glad that my account got locked right away after posting that thread as it might do some sh*tty moves. I was around 2-3 days offline until I realized that my account was compromised. Hopefully, I can get back my beloved account.
