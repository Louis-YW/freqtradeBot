I don't have any idea what is coinomy, but based on the ZCL market, only 3 exchanges are currently support this coin [1]I can't find any news about delisting, only the other centralized exchanges are delisted this coin. Well it's not surprising since ZCL is one of privacy coins, government right now tighter their rules about cryptocurrency and of course they're against privacy coins since they can't have full control over those coins.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zclassic/markets/",
