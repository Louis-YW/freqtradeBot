So if you use electrum, keep the seed in different location like your planning, and don't forget to write in paper or steel.and don't remember the passphrase, write it because the human memory has limited to remembering all things such as passwords, seeds, billing, girl friend phone number, and the passphrase.",

Is that the same process you've outlined?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5392824.0",

Is that the same process you've outlined?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5392824.0You don't need Bitcoin Core and those instructions go beyond what you need. Any wallet that gives you a recovery phrase and extended public key will do.Tails is a good way to do a clean boot, but I don't know what wallets can be used with it. Electrum is probably your best choice of wallets. Just remember that Electrum does not use a recovery phrase BIP-39 by default.",
