  "content": "I know that many bettors, if a sporting event develops in favor of their bet, make a counter bet - for example, they bet on odds of 1.3 and on the opposite event, the odds were 3.3. Then the odds changed 1.3 -> 1.1 and 3.3 -> 5.7. At this moment, they \"fix\" their winnings by betting on the opposite outcome with odds of 5.7. Or they use the option of selling their bet (cashout - some bookmakers have such an option), that is, they receive their winnings immediately, but less than if they wait until the end of the sporting event.In my opinion, this is not a profitable strategy, since in this way you minimize your profit, but potentially maximize your losses - if a sporting event develops against your bet, then you lose it entirely without any compensation.",

For in-play, if the team you selected to win is losing, the amount of money left to be cashed out will be very low in a way you will be discouraged to cash it out. Even if the team is winning, the amount to be cashed out will be low compared to the total amount that you supposed to win. I do not use cashout anymore.",

I used the features on some matches in the last premiere league and champion league and to a good extent cash out helped me a lot like the final game between Liverpool vs Real Madrid, I gave Liverpool winning but during the match and in the first half I notice the chance of Liverpool winning was dimming and I was offered a cash-out amount that is like 20% loses on my bet amount so I just cash out to avoid a total loss.",

That would make me to not focus on the events, so I can't enjoy it since I'm more looking about my profit. I think a professional gambler who make money by betting a sports will use this kind features, but for me as a gambler who only gamble for fun didn't use this.",

Even if the team is winning, the amount to be cashed out will be low compared to the total amount that you supposed to win. I do not use cashout anymore. I use it when I have won for example 6 games out of 7 and I am waiting only one game that plays several hours later.The amount of cashout despite being lower than if I would wait to see the last game if they win I would not like to risk it after finding 6 games correctly and lose it all just for one games.This is the special power of the cashout option and not that it has any other magic power except that,even when you find 2 out of three games in bet,it is better to cashout the winnings rather than risking it all.I still use it in tickets with many games.",

This cashout feature is best to take advantage of long-term bets. An example would be from my experience. Took the bet for Dallas Mavericks to win the championships as I was a fan of Luka and the odds given were tempting. They went to the playoffs which enhances my chance and the cashout was x1.7 already. Then they went to the Western Conference Finals which made it x5, IIRC. I could've cashed it out but I want more. I was in a win-or-lose situation back then and I chose to win it all. Sadly, as they are losing the profits are going lower.",

Let us assume that the opponent is winning 1 - 0 in 60 minutes, did you know that the amount of money you can cashout may not be up to $30. The more the chance of losing, the lesser the money to cashout will be. Our opinion maybe different, but I have seen cashout to have more disadvantage than having advantage towards someone to make profit.",

The cashout amount should be lowered than your bet if you are losing that bet or am I missing something here? That said amount is even lowered to the point that you won't have any interest to cash it out but rather go straight to the final result. There's no such thing as betting sites that will give you a profit once you cash out while your team is close to losing that game.It's just minimizing your possible losses and they are giving you a chance to do it.",

They either benefit by making you wager more money with a smaller payout or by making your regret withdrawing early (and perhaps making you bet higher on your next bet because of it.",

As soon as your team (on which you bet) starts losing, this amount drops sharply to 30-40%. Given the fact that the situation can unfold and your bet can win, it seems to me that by agreeing to lose 60-70% of the bet at the first unsuccessful turn of events, you will very quickly find yourself in a big loss.

E.g. long shot bets that actually take the lead (Villa two goals up against City last season for example. Perfect hedge would have been a City handicap... Which would protect the odds but give you insurance if game goes away from you.Obviously watching live can give you better knowledge as well of whether to cash out or not, and it is easier than love betting.

I'm not sure about other sites or other sports matches as well, but I think that when your bet is about to lose, it's impossible to make a cashout. I mean, why gambling sites should do that as they almost claimed your bet amount. The cashout feature will just be opened or available when the match is somehow close or your bet is quite advancing. Don't also expect a profit when you do that in most cases.For me, it's better to just go straight until the end and wait for the final results. What if you won, that's more regretful.",

For example, if you were to win 200 units by betting 100 units, then your cashout will be around 190 even when the game is almost won because the house edge or the juice is higher on sports betting. When betting on NBA the game can turn within a minute and the last quarter is always risky so if my team is doing well after 3rd quarter I sometimes cash the bet for some loss because you never know when a comeback may happen.I stopped betting on bitsler because they don't have bet-cashout on sports betting and it sucks to see your bet lose and you are just helplessly watching it. I am not saying bitsler is a bad casino/sportsbook but just sharing my own experience.",
