A gent we'll call \"Brad\" was so smitten, he plunked down 66,000 smackers. But plot twist: Brad insisted on using a particular exchange to pay in Bitcoin.Once I got the Bitcoin, the \"fun\" began. Apparently, I can't transfer my now 75k BTC to another wallet unless I verify it by depositing 3k first. https://images2.imgbox.com/41/1f/zOBamJHp_o.pngSo, my BTC is stuck tighter than a bull in a milking stool at the exchange https://treadsly.com. It turns out, this site has a bunch of ugly step-siblings:https://bitvizz.comhttps://coinvel.comhttps://bitmintex.comhttps://coinsetter.proAll these exchanges seem to have been crafted from the same slapdash template, and I'm betting my last nickel there's an exploit to be found. I’ve got 75k in BTC stuck in the wallet that’s swappable within this murky exchange.It looks like there's a rudimentary API for these sites, but its functionality is questionable at best. There's a section in the profile to generate an API key, and I’m guessing that the underlying API may hold the key to getting the BTC out. I tried swapping to an alternate address but locating the right parameters for the wallet address is like finding a needle in a haystack. If only I had the source code for this website template, it would be like shooting fish in a barrel.So folks, anyone up for helping me unstick this situation? I'd sure appreciate it!",

Apparently, I can't transfer my now 75k BTC to another wallet unless I verify it by depositing 3k first. <cut>This is a common scam involving fake crypto exchanges. Scammers create websites and platforms that appear legitimate and mimic real exchanges to deceive unsuspecting users. These fake exchanges often offer attractive deals, such as exclusive promotions or deposit bonuses, to lure people in. Once users sign up and deposit their funds into these fake exchanges, they may experience difficulties withdrawing or accessing their money. The scammers might manipulate account balances, making it seem like users have more funds than they actually do. They may also delay or deny withdrawal requests, giving various excuses or claiming technical issues. In some cases, the scammers might even use phishing techniques, tricking users into depositing more money, under the guise of fake verifications, transfer fees, taxes, and similar charges. They will communicate with you and fabricate new reasons to justify further payments as long as you continue to comply with their demands. Don't do that!The key point to understand here is that there are no actual Bitcoins in your account (they are merely fictional entries in their database), and there is no way to \"trick\" the website into paying you. Basically, you've been scammed. The best thing you can do is try to find the scammer who did it and report him to the authorities. And, whatever you do, never give scammers more money!",

Apparently, I can't transfer my now 75k BTC to another wallet unless I verify it by depositing 3k first. These scams have been around for a long time, and are a common scamming tactic for scammers these days. They may even offer you millions of dollars and you will see millions of dollars in your account, but you do not own those dollars, they are just numbers. They give you tempting offers to trap you, because you will be greedy and willing to pay 3k in the name of verification as they say. But in reality you will not get a single penny, they will keep taking money in the name of making you follow different steps. Stay away from them, crypto users should verify any offer using their own commonsense.",

Apparently, I can't transfer my now 75k BTC to another wallet unless I verify it by depositing 3k first. I was consistently publishing topics about these new scam exchanges in the scam accusations board, and that they lure their victims by contacting them, then sending them a promo code, and after activating it on their exchange platform, it appears to the victim that he owns thousands of dollars in bitcoins or any other currencies, but the trap falls in that the victim cannot withdraw these fictitious amounts from his account until after he passes the KYC and deposits his funds, and in the end, he cannot withdraw the amount he got from the promo code, and he cannot withdraw his deposits, and they close his account after they injected poison into his vein, I thought that these methods have become familiar and outdated and that people have known and increased their awareness when they see these deceptive methods, but there are still beginners who do not know them. I hope that you did not deposit because thousands of new exchanges are now being promoted on Twitter and Discord, and all the social media that may appear in its interfaces and templates are legitimate, but all these exchanges, in fact, are outright fraud.",

Yeah really old they are doing new variations or methods I first encounter this, years ago when they are using a casino as their means to scam, they will tell you that they found a bug in the casino and they will make you win, you sign up give you a bonus then you play then you won and then they ask you to deposit so they can verify the address where they will send the winning.Then there is this mining, web miner you just hit the button to mine using your browser they tell you mined 0.1 Bitcoin but you have to deposit first before they send you your coin to verify your address, the trick or method has always been deposit first to verify the address, if you are not aware of this trick you'll get scammed, they will keep doing new variations because there will always new people who are not aware of this trick.",

Once you've proven to be a sucker, they'll ask for more and more until they bleed you dry. Don't do that.I always wonder if these people really receive anything at all. To create the site, it cost them at-least a $100 to $150 and then they invest their time to find their victims. All together a small amount of money and a good amount of time invested. Obviously, they are creative, but the creativity has been used in deceiving people instead of benefiting someone. If they could use their skill in something good, then everyone could be benefited from them. What a waste of time.Quote from: BITCOIIN on June 23, 2023, 12:36:33 AMSo folks, anyone up for helping me unstick this situation? You may get the domain back by contacting the provider but if any Bitcoin sent then it's gone.",
