I do randomly change the sequence of my game on casino and keeps giving me same good result on my personal lucky casino.

But the more I learn, the better I know, presently I trade on both exchanges and I win than lose which makes me think it is just my believe and not reality. In gambling, I have not experienced this, the luck I have in one gambling site is what I have on another too, I remember when I use to lose more while gambling, I lost money similarly on each gambling sites. When I decided to reduce my betting, take it for what it is, I still have more win, but if low amount, but which is similar on all the gambling sites that I am using.",

You're playing because of the trustworthiness from the provider, it's not because of the casino. Casino only include the games and they're not doing anything to control the game.",

But according to my experience, every game I played I have never experienced getting the bonus in a game.But I also have a friend here in crypto gambling who seems to have the same experience as you dude, maybe the only difference between you is that when he plays a game and gets the bonus or jackpot he does it after 2 weeks again before he plays the games again that, and he will choose a different game to play the next day. Although he also tells me that he often loses playing games and that it's just luck.",

I have 70% to 80% win chance rate on my lucky casino based on my deposit and withdraw history compared to my other casino account that has negative profit. I always deposit fixed amount in each casino that I play so that I can track my profit. Of course, this is just my personal belief since there is no way to measure luck or to prove it except for the positive result. I’m also a casino player that playing with bonus consideration that is why I play on multiple casino. This just lucky casino of mine is just my personal assumption based on my experience.",

Although if you believe in such, there's also no harm. Maybe some of us really have that kind of \"lucky\" places and such. Perhaps we attract some form of charm if we believe in it. However, I think it's more of your mental state and your determination to win the game. If you are not in the right mental headspace and if the odds are not just on your favor, then expect losses. Winning is a combination of luck and calculated probability after all. Just be mindful of your gambling habits. Still always play responsibly despite winning or losing after several attempts.",
