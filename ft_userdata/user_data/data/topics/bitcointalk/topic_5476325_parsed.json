As far as I understand the bitcoin and how it works, once you send your BTC to someone you lost it. Is  n't is risky? They do not forward your BTC to another address, the bitcoins you sent is mixed up and you receive the same amount from an unrelated transaction which ideally should not be possibly linked back to you.It is risky and you need to be sure of the reputation of the service before using it.Quote from: a298b112 on December 02, 2023, 07:13:42 PM2.

How mixer works in terms of blockchain and transactions? Is it like you sending your own BTC to address of the mixer and the same is done by other people, and they just forward your BTC to another address of your choice?The simple answer is here-Quote from: https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-a-bitcoin-mixer#:~:text=Bitcoin%20mixers%2C%20also%20known%20as,to%20obfuscate%20the%20transaction%20trail.Bitcoin mixers, also known as tumblers, are services that receive cryptocurrencies from users, pool them together, and then send the amounts to their corresponding recipient addresses. This is an effort to obfuscate the transaction trail.QuoteAs far as I understand the bitcoin and how it works, once you send your BTC to someone you lost it. Isn't is risky? Of course it's risky. But in this case it also depends on your choice, if you use scammer mixers then no one can stop you from losing your funds here. And to avoid it, first you have to explore and select a reputable mixer. By the way, did you know that the new law is going to start on January 1st on bitcointalk about mixing service-  Mixers to be banned .Quote2. The article also mentions that some exchanges might refuse to receive 'dirty' BTC. How they define and later find out if particular BTC is 'dirty'? I mean what makes BTC 'dirty' or 'clean'?Centralized exchanges can accomplish this by blacklisting wallets connected to mixers declared illegal. And dirty bitcoin refers to those bitcoins that have been acquired by doing criminal activities like- hacking, drug selling etc.Quote3. If you bought your BTC from well know CEX, should you be concerned? Is there a way to check for 'dirtiness'?If you buy or sell Suspicious Amount Bitcoins they may send you a notice to show official documents from where the money or Bitcoins came from. This is one way to issue illegal checks and another option if funds come from blacklisted wallets.example-This is a screenshot of a recently seized mixer signatures campaign participants-",

As far as I understand the bitcoin and how it works, once you send your BTC to someone you lost it. Is  n't is risky?Using a mixer is risky just like using a centralized exchange, you have to trust the mixer company before you send your BTC there for mixing. Mixers don’t send BTC back to an address different from the one you deposited your BTC from, they simply mix your BTC and send it back to your address from an unrelated link that will make it impossible to trace back to your wallet address.  Quote2. The article also mentions that some exchanges might refuse to receive 'dirty' BTC. How they define and later find out if particular BTC is 'dirty'? I mean what makes BTC 'dirty' or 'clean'?Yes, most exchanges don’t accept BTC from mixers because they believe that’s were fraudsters deposit stolen BTC so that it cannot be traced back to their account. Quote3. If you bought your BTC from well know CEX, should you be concerned? Is there a way to check for 'dirtiness'?There is no way you can check for that, and in the first place, if the exchange you use don’t accept BTC from mixers then, your BTC should be clean and not dirty unless the exchange is involved in another secret stuff that is unknown to its users and public.",

As far as I understand the bitcoin and how it works, once you send your BTC to someone you lost it. Is  n't is risky?Of course it's risky. What did you thought? You are sending your funds to a address which is owner by other people. As far as I understand, when you send funds to a mixer all the funds are pooled in a single place. Now imagine thousands of people are using the service. All the funds are mixed together and sent back the same amount you sent previously. But this time there is no way trace back it's origin.Quote2. The article also mentions that some exchanges might refuse to receive 'dirty' BTC. How they define and later find out if particular BTC is 'dirty'? I mean what makes BTC 'dirty' or 'clean'?There is no dirty BTC or clean BTC. Its just BTC. Again yes, if your BTC came from a fraudulent source or address it can be called dirty BTC. The more cleaner term is \"tainted money/crypto\".There are lists of blacklisted addresses. And if your funds are somehow linked to those address, the exchange might block or freeze your account. So yes, it is possible and it happens. Quote3. If you bought your BTC from well know CEX, should you be concerned? Is there a way to check for 'dirtiness'?Nope, you cannot know if it's tainted or not",

At first it was difficult to believe this but articles and blogs proving that point is all over the net. Soon people will avoid mixing their Bitcoin.Do you believe the government and what their state-controlled media writes and publishes, you think that mixers and Bitcoin are so widely used for money laundering to warrant this sort of crackdown, there are much more \"comfortable\" tools people use to launder money, but the government chooses to fully focus on mixers as an indirect attact on Bitcoin. That being said, i don't think people who want privacy would avoid mixing their coins because of this, though it is better if they use non-custodial options like coinjoin.",

As far as I understand the bitcoin and how it works, once you send your BTC to someone you lost it. Is  n't is risky? Yeah it is risky because if you have sent your funds to the pool (address) of the mixer then according to the time delay or congestion on the network, you have to wait for your funds to reflect in your wallet, till then the mixer can also flew away with your BTC but with small amounts they might not. And its not exactly how things works in mixers, it like a pool of funds where many other people are sending there funds and then those funds are mixed with each other like sending from one place to another then 10 other places then 20 other places then to your specific address. The level of security and anonymity depends on the services of any mixers, well, the point is that's how they work. Quote from: a298b112 on December 02, 2023, 07:13:42 PM2. The article also mentions that some exchanges might refuse to receive 'dirty' BTC. How they define and later find out if particular BTC is 'dirty'? I mean what makes BTC 'dirty' or 'clean'?If the BTC is coming from an address that is already tagged as of scammers then exchanges can easily check that, by blacklisting them, and when a transaction came from that address, the funds are not processed into that exchange and are stopped at the start. We can also do that to avoid any deposit from such address. Quote from: a298b112 on December 02, 2023, 07:13:42 PM3. If you bought your BTC from well know CEX, should you be concerned? Is there a way to check for 'dirtiness'?I don't think we should worry about it, but if we have to then I don't have any exact answer for this question other than trailing back the transaction history (origin) like from where the funds are coming from. It will took huge time manually but with tools we can do that and most of the tools are paid.",

KYC doesn't help an exchange detect funds from money laundering per se, KYC in centralized exchanges is in compliance with the laws of the country they operate in, and they collect KYC so they can hand over a customer's personal data to law enforcement agencies if they ever need it in their investigation of an address belonging to one of the exchange's customer. KYC also prevents criminals from using exchanges to launder money because they know the funds will be seized and their real identities will be linked with the coins.",
