Anyone else invested or can advise if this is a good opportunity? Have watched a few videos online many say it can 100x next bull run but even a 25x would be great and with its low market cap and most of the supply in circulation it could be possible / likely.",

No problem, if that's your choice, I would only advise you to invest a very small amount in NXRA.What's the appealing part in this? It looks like a project that was dead on arrival and has $80 daily trading.Sure, it could move fast if people pick it up, but i can't see any reason for them to do that. And even 200K marketcap is way too high for this kind of volume.",

Actually quite low marketcap for a decent project and if you gonna invest with that and that hits like a major projrct with the same concept. It could go pretty wild like more than 50x or more. I heard of that project and thats a great one but since its bear its quite hard to pull off funds to inject more for each altcoins. If you are a patience guy then its one of the good one to pour money in. But of course dyor, check updates and current status of their progress and development.",

This is a case of a small capitalization project that can grow well in the next bull run. The only thing that confuses me when investing is that the project doesn't have any big investors, but it is listed on exchanges with good liquidity. In general, you can take a risk. DYOR.",

It all depends on who makes such predictions. And if it comes from team members, then it is natural, because they are interested in having their coin bought. But forecasts don't always come true, and what will you do if it turns out to be wrong this time?",
