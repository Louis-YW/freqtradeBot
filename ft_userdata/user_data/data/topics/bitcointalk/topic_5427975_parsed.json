  "content": "The Central Bank of Spain is planning to launch an experimental central bank digital currency (CBDC) project next month, after inviting financial institutions and technology firms to submit proposals.According to a bank release, the program aims to simulate the use of CBDC in wholesale transactions.Unlike retail CBDC, which is typically distributed to the general public and can be used to replace fiat currency in retail transactions, wholesale CBDC is only used by financial institutions. Wholesale transactions involve the movement of money (cash) between banks and financial institutions.Source: https://mycryptoparadise.com/bank-of-spain-to-launch-experimental-wholesale-cbdcs/",

      "body": "Well, experiment is better than gambling with the future of the country as it relates to the use of real CBDC... only fools are gamblers.I hope the experiment is holistic and thorough without intentionally/unitentionally living out or ignoring the important/useful lessons learnt that could help in preventing lots of serious problems in the future. Atleast different countries could develop different CBDCs that are based on different safety standards rather than having a uniform one.",

      "body": "I like everything about Spain! No wonder the banking system is ahead of the world. Also It has many natural and human resources that make it a desirable place to visit. Many visitors enjoy taking photos of the famous Spanish architecture and landscapes. They also enjoy sampling local cuisine, drinking Spanish wine, and exploring the country's history and culture. In this body paragraph, I'd like to explain why I think Spain is so wonderful.As a nation in the northernmost part of Europe, Spain has a Mediterranean climate. In this sense, it shares characteristics with countries such as Greece and Italy. As well as this, most of Spain's cities have beautiful old buildings that were constructed centuries ago using stone and brick. Some of these cities are Madrid, Seville, Cordoba, and Barcelona. Each city has its own unique characteristics, making for a wonderful vacation experience for any traveler. I visit Alicante, Costa Blanca, Spain every summer and rent a house at https://happylife.es. They also provide all the necessary services for tourists such as transfer, car rental, etc!",
