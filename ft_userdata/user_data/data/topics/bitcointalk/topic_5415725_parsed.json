You can go for Electrum cold storage option before sending the coins to the addresses generated on the hardware wallet.",

So this option with importing several single private keys would be safer than the option with sending transaction.Thank you!I am not sure there is a hardware wallet you can import private keys to, but, for example, Coldcard allows users to restore wallets using extended master private keys (xprv). You can find more information on their documentation page: https://coldcard.com/docs/import From my point of view, the main reason most hardware wallets don't implement importing of single keys is that introduces additional problems to the security setup. Typically, your wallet's sensitive keys are generated by the hardware itself, and all information related to the signing of transactions is kept isolated from other parts of the system. When you \"add\" new private keys from external sources, you basically force your isolated keys to interact with this new key information, thereby ruining its isolation and making it vulnerable to attacks. That's not worth it to implement a feature of sweeping private keys on hardware because the main point of a hardware wallet is to protect the keys that are already inside.",

It's an OS you can easily install onto an USB stick, it contains Electrum (and since you'll take care to always use it offline it should be OK, or you can download Electrum AppImage if you want to be extra sure). It's not a HW, it's a cold storage, you may need to give it some time to learn it, but it should be just fine for your needs.",

      "body": "Importing a private key in to a hardware wallet defeats the purpose of the hardware wallet in the first place, since it cannot guarantee that the private key was created securely and has remained permanently offline. For the same reason you should not import seed phrases created elsewhere in to a hardware wallet. The hardware wallet should be used as a standalone device to create its own wallets, and interact only with those wallets.Quote from: Gorilla22 on October 02, 2022, 10:47:47 PMYes, it's a good solution with Electrum offline.Slightly difficult for me though as my offline PC is the one with Windows 7, impossible to install the latest version of Electrum.As I think I said to you in another thread, you should download and verify version 4.1.5 of Electrum from this link (https://download.electrum.org/4.1.5/), which works on Windows 7, to use on your offline computer. Use it to sign a transaction which sends all the coins from your offline wallet to a fresh address on your new hardware wallet.",

And what solutions exist at all.I don't know of any, sorry. But what you can definitely do is boot your PC or laptop using https://tails.boum.org/. You flash that to a USB drive and boot from it.It comes with Electrum preinstalled and lets you import keys & sign a transaction without ever putting them on a 'hot' PC. Export the signed transaction to a second USB drive, reboot and broadcast the transaction.For broadcasting, you would also need Electrum; if it doesn't run on your PC, you could spin up a VM.Or download 4.1.5 as o_e_l_e_o said.",
