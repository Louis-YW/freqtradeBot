      "body": "Are you seriously suggesting that your custodial wallet and mixing service, operating on a clearnet domain and server located in Moldova, can guarantee privacy and security from government agencies? That's quite amusing! But let's consider a scenario: what happens if such an agency issues an order to freeze someone's funds? Can you assure your users that their assets won't be compromised under such circumstances?Furthermore, I've noticed that you have opted for complete anonymity, with no legal information provided about your company on the website. This raises an important question: If, at some point, you choose to disappear with users' funds, what safeguards are in place to protect them from such a potential rug pull?",

We have implemented multiple layers of security protocols and established comprehensive backup plans to ensure the safety of our users' funds. Additionally, our presence on the Tor network serves as an additional safeguard, enabling us to maintain redundancy and accessibility even in the event of unforeseen circumstances.Addressing concerns related to governmental interference or attempts to freeze funds, it is essential to emphasize that our platform operates independently from any government or regulatory body. Our commitment to empowering individuals to have control over their own finances is at the core of our founding principles. We do not comply with requests or directives from any agency, as our objective is to provide a secure and autonomous financial environment for our users.While complete anonymity is a desirable aspect for many users, it is important to acknowledge that achieving absolute anonymity becomes increasingly challenging when interacting with government agencies. Although Bitcoin was initially conceived with the intention of providing anonymity, the emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has introduced new complexities and restrictions on the free utilization of cryptocurrencies.We appreciate your questions and the opportunity to provide clarification on these matters.",

Very important things besides privacy and security are their reputation, anonymity and transparency in business.In the first presentation here, you are trying to deceive us with incorrect information and by exaggerating some figures. Here you say that you have been in business for 3 years, (even if it is interpreted that you have been developing the platform for 3 years, isn't that a bit too long?), on your site you say 4 Years of experience, At the same time, the domain was registered about a year ago.So what is the truth?Code:Important DatesExpires On2023-06-09Registered On2022-06-09Updated On2022-06-14Name Serversdns1.registrar-servers.com156.154.132.200dns2.registrar-servers.com156.154.133.200https://who.is/whois/imperiume.ioDo you think it is good to start by exaggerating your experience? How can we trust you in the future and possibly entrust you with money?You also offer staking but with some \"too good to be true\" interest rates. Earn up to 37.32% APR...

All the user wants is to break the link between deposit and withdrawal currencies and ensure that his data will not be recorded. If he feels distrust or lack of professionalism on your part, he will not use the mixing service.You started introducing your service with vague words that do not indicate professionalism, and lied to say that the years of development are 3 years while the domain was registered up-to-date, there is no explanation of the mixing mechanism, no onion links, and the loading of the site is very slow.",

Considering that you're operating under complete anonymity and lack any established reputation within the community, why should individuals place their hard-earned money to your custody? I simply cannot fathom the rationale behind such a decision. What safeguards are in place to prevent you from executing a good old-fashioned rug pull at any given moment? After all, in this delightful arrangement, you have absolutely nothing to lose, while your hapless users are left to bear the brunt of the risks and potential losses.I hope you understand the gravity of the situation and can shed more light on your background, qualifications, or any measures you have in place to mitigate the concerns surrounding this arrangement. Up until now, it's been rather... well, let's just say lacking in that department.",

I would like to hear what the possibility of such a high yield is based on.Some extra points to note:The page is filled with trackers, including multiple trackers from both Google and Facebook.Parts of the site are plagiarized. One such example example from the FAQs:Quote from: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/is-bitcoin-anonymousWhile Bitcoin addresses are \"pseudonymous\" - meaning, they don't, in themselves, reveal the identity of their owner - they can often still be linked to real-world identities. For example, if you withdraw bitcoin from an exchange where you've identified yourself, the exchange knows that the withdrawal address is yours. There are also more advanced techniques - such as blockchain analysis - to tie Bitcoin addresses to real-world identities.The next time coins move from these addresses, users risk revealing all sorts of personal information. Depending on how they spend the coins, they could reveal how many coins they own (even on other addresses), what they spend their money on, and more.By mixing their coins, users can obscure the ties between their Bitcoin addresses and real-world identities. This allows them to use Bitcoin more privately. Our service provides you with an opportunity to protect your anonymity.There are also other sections plagiarized from known scam mixers, which I am not going to link to.",

This has \"exit scam\" written all over it. I'll leave neutral feedback, and it's only neutral because that's how the feedback system is supposed to be used. I don't trust you at all.",

Bitcoin was conceived with the idea of sending transactions from one party to another without going through a financial institution.One thing is clear, you haven't been working on the development of that mixer for three years. You offer from 14.8% up to 23% stacking APR, looks very impressive but sounds like a thing to attract people and then scam exit.Don't just throw away beautiful words, just prove, back up what you say.",
