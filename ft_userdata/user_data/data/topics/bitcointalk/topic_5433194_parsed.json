It was because the tournament already ended and the second on the leaderboard continue gambling which made his points up when it shouldn't be happening if you ask me. It is more like finding a loophole. The tournament is balance type so make sure if the tournament ended then it is. I can say that is the casino's fault for not checking if there's an issue that could be exploited.",

However, since the game does not support bitcoin, you had to place it in the corresponding board in Service Announcements. I tried to connect the Cloud Wax wallet and as far as I understood, the default rate is 1 Wax, (as far as I remember, the commission is 5Wax) it can be increased to 1000 Wax by clicking on the corresponding chip from 1 to 1000 and then approve the transaction in the wallet.",
