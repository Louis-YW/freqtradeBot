I'm tempted to look at the range of $40k resistance and this because most people fear that inflation may keep raising as the war between Israel and Palestine still going on, people will want to continue hedging with bitcoin and that will keep price action on the bull. Moreover, the year is ending and the halving getting closer while more investors keep DCA.",

Now it's 5 since the price shoot up because of that ticker symbol. Anyway, I will stand to my previous prediction that Bitcoin's price might end up reaching the price of $40,000 or even higher to even $45,000 depending if there's some kind of news that makes the investors change their sentiments towards the market. Overall, I think my prediction is a bit realistic since it's kind of near to it's current price, and one good news can change everything.Overall, I'll be bullish for the remaining months of the year. I believe in the 4-year cycle so... yeah I'm bullish.",

      "body": "Bitcoin seems to be raging bullish at this time but I feel differently about the coin, it's gonna sell from now and towards December/January and might pick the bullish trend from there. One thing I've noticed about markets is that they always follow the law of gravity as there is no perfect slope in a sane market, Bitcoin can't be an exception at this time. And if you take a look at the October bullish movements alone, the coin moved almost $10,000 in just a month, which is insane at this time when the pre and post-halving effects have not even started.Without mincing words, Bitcoin is now heavily overbought, there is no way it will not sell for a retracement to be observed. I don't see the coin breaching $36,000 successfully in November let alone making a sustainable breach above my main barrier of the year at $37,000.",

IMO, we are not yet in the bull market, although the price might increase more than $35k but will still drop.

From all indications we are not going to see bitcoin price hit 100k by the end of this year it's not something we would debate about anymore. It's a MOONvember month which is a critical month for bitcoin price this year critical in the sense whatever news or event that takes  place this month will determine the price of bitcoin by ending of this year December. I can still reminiscence in the month of August speculating out of high optimism that  the price of bitcoin will get to $65k at the end of the year but I think I'll be withdrawing that figure from what am seeing the price action doesn't appear to surge to $65k anymore so therefore the feasible price we should be looking out for if am to be realistic is between 40k-45k at most.",

I would suggest everyone to actively keep a track of price movements and set alerts based on your targets to ensure we don't missed out on this bull run because we entire mistake bull trap for bull run or bull run as bull trap and wither end up losing the investment or the opportunity to make profits. Better to have personalized indicators by doing relevant study and backtest the data and act accordingly.",

I am on the I don’t know camp, the increase on the price of bitcoin that we saw during October was spectacular, but at the same time I am not so sure this trend can be maintained that easily since it seems to me the price is high enough already, so I could see November being a relatively stable month for bitcoin so things can calm down a little bit or maybe we could even witness a slight decrease on its price, however knowing bitcoin it would not surprise me if I was completely wrong about my expectations.",

I believe that we are in a bull period right now but also I believe that it's just the start of it and nothing major, we shouldn't really approach it like it is going to be something special right away, that is not the case most of the time.For example we may not keep on rising for a while longer, the halving is still some time to go and not right now, so we need to take our time. I hope that people do not put all their money right away, or maybe they rather should but do not put any money in expecting a profit daily, because it may go up in the future, looks like it will, but maybe not right away this week.",

It's a MOONvember month which is a critical month for bitcoin price this year critical in the sense whatever news or event that takes  place this month will determine the price of bitcoin by ending of this year December. I agree with you. Some months ago, speculation was high, and most threads  were regarding some market experts who thought that the Bitcoin bull market would begin this year and that the price of Bitcoin would hit an ATH even before the halving would take place. Well, I am yet to see that coming live. I know that this market is not controlled by anyone, and anything can happen, which will not even be a surprise unless Bitcoin just surges to $500k overnight. Or do you think that any event or good news could just come up tonight that will trigger the price of Bitcoin to fly past $499k? In this market, there is lots of speculation, but I doubt that Bitcoin will get to $100k this year, and I also doubt if we are yet in a bull market. This afternoon, I took a look at the price history of Bitcoin for November alone, starting from 2016–2022, and that's why I said the price of Bitcoin is even more likely to drop; it's just my speculation, but I could be wrong too.",
