To me if America will collapse it doesn't need China and Russia, both just need to play the waiting game and the collapse will definitely comes just like Roman Empire. Americans have it all and are full, and they are not producing real men to lead the future, just look at what they are clamouring for, Gay rights, Abortion, Trans etc. things that is devilish. Greed is another thing that is killing Americas, they want to make money from everything just like the War in Ukraine, all this money sent to Ukraine, more than 50% are for American companies",

      "body": "The relationship between the United States, China, and Russia is complex and constantly evolving. The balance of power and influence in the world is constantly changing and it is difficult to predict how it will ultimately play out. However, it is clear that the actions and decisions of these three countries will have important implications for the global system and the rest of the world. Although the United States has historically been the dominant world power, its influence is waning and it faces increasing competition from China and Russia. However, it remains to be seen how much China and Russia can challenge the US individually or in alliance with each other. A key factor in this dynamic is the role of middle powers such as European countries in helping to maintain the current world order. These countries have their own interests and objectives, and their decisions will affect the global balance of power. Ultimately, the future of the United States, China, and Russia and their influence on the world stage is uncertain. Their actions and interactions will continue to shape the global system. This can result in a complex economic situation, and the outcome is difficult to predict.",

What is \"not\" given China and Russia their undue advantage and where were they when the US was building its relation with the world and using their resources fairly for the common good of man?Your preferred countries are always taking the backseat and you are here believing that the US will be sidelined with time? Well, no one knows tomorrow, not even you and I, let's just wait and see what happens even as the two countries try. QuoteBut what they do is together with china and russia they wait and help for Western countries collapse.Then they the russia and china will offering the funds to help out and then Putin and china will laugh at West as usa NATO tought they Will foolisly use war but not instead of using brutal Force to make war the Putin is old judow martail arts he knows the old method \" LET the enemy crash So that's the plan Putin and china waiting when Western countries asking help and Putin and china will help very likely.Politics could be surprising, and who you think is an ally today could be an enemy tomorrow, and who you think is an enemy today could be a friend tomorrow. You can't also underestimate the economic and military power of the US and NATO nations, they are studying carefully the situation even more than you a commoner are and will always act appropriately both internally and externally.I don't see the table turning against the US in the long run, they are too rigid for that.",

It may also be true that each country that has been mentioned actually has its own intentions or motives.Now, maybe they're just doing that for a temporary reason; maybe they're just waiting for good timing; maybe they're your alliance now, but one day they could be your enemy; that could really happen.",

Because so far I have seen from many local news that Russia will not help the US and Europe and other western countries as long as the US continues to support the war in the Middle East and continues to provide assistance for the ongoing war. I am more confident in cooperation between Russia and China in any matter, including economic matters, but for other western countries that still have one voice with the US, I think Russia and China will not support it as long as the US continues to facilitate war in the Middle East and also in Russia itself.",

But for now the western economy still seems to dominate. But even so, currently I personally see that economic growth in eastern countries is actually growing no less quickly. Even in my country, although in the middle west, there is an economic crisis. In fact, here inflation can be overcome more quickly. Some wars are violent and some are subtle, such as through economics and so on. And so also in colonialism. There are countries that colonize by going to war and there are those that colonize by controlling a country's economic sector. You definitely know which countries implement this. But this will continue to happen. So we shouldn't be surprised. My country has good relations with both parties. Be it the US and Russia and even China. And I hope everything will be well forever. Because I don't like conflict and war. I don't care, they had a cold war a long time ago. As long as it doesn't disturb peace in other countries. But a cold war is much better than a direct war.",

But we also need to look at China's pragmatism, as they never give it away for free, and rather their approach is extremely cunning and smart. Fuel and money are the immediate things that many people think about, but that doesn't mean they need help.

They'll want to show support for their allies when the need arises, to show the other opponents that they're leading in dominating and subtly controlling certain affairs in their allied nations. Other nations are at the mercy of choosing sides so they'll be in the good book of their preferred candidate.

Is it a genuine partnership built on shared values and goals, or merely a strategic alliance aimed at challenging US dominance? The answer likely lies somewhere in between. Both countries stand to gain from their collaboration, whether it's economic benefits, political influence, or simply the ability to counterbalance American power.However, the consequences of this geopolitical competition extend far beyond the ambitions of these major players. Innocent civilians often bear the brunt of the conflict, becoming pawns in a larger game of power.

What they want to do is to free the other regions of the world from the enclave the west has on them. A typical example being that the francophone countries paying tax to France. This has been going on for decades. The French impoverish these regions of the world by stealing their resources to enrich their own country and leaving these nations to die of poverty. And on top of that they tax these nations. Let's not even talk about the US. This is more than just about oil or economics. It is more about pulling down the stronghold of the west.
