  "content": "Hello there,I'm not the kind of guy who bothers about its price and any predictions that pop-up, because I haven't let the downtrend affect me. I'm planning to accumulate as much Bitcoin as I can and hold it for a long period. However, an article was trending on my news feed and decided to check it out. According to the article, Bitcoin was supposedly capable of avoiding inflation, although, it seems to have been severely affected by it. The change in risk appetite, the tightening of monetary policies and the withdrawal of liquidity from the markets and, finally, the rapid rise in inflation show that the cryptocurrency market has been severely impacted.George Savakis, with the help of the analyst Dimitris Tsantoy, a member of Elliot Wave trader community, are predicting a correction down to $20.000 - $23.000, while claiming that as long as Bitcoin is below $35.000, it's extremely unlikely to see a market recovery.Source: https://www.euro2day.gr/investments/crypto/article/2136805/h-tehnikh-analysh-deihnei-nea-ptosh-toy-bitcoin-to.htmlTranslated to English: https://www-euro2day-gr.translate.goog/investments/crypto/article/2136805/h-tehnikh-analysh-deihnei-nea-ptosh-toy-bitcoin-to.html?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=el&_x_tr_hl=el&_x_tr_pto=wapp",

And as a investors what will our reactions, for one we should take advantage of the discounted price and fill our bags.",

I really hope that the price can hold at the current price and have the power to bounce up to the high price. But we should be prepared just in case the price is really down. If that price goes down to that level, we will be back to the previous years and I guess we will have more supports that can lift the price to break the next highest price.

      "body": "The scenario you're describing is actually something that's been speculated about since the price went downhill and went below $30k - many speculate that the bottom will be just around $20k. I'm not an expert on TA, but this whole situation with inflation, recession, and war is reflected in everything, and Bitcoin (as many wanted) has become part of the system, and whether someone likes it or not shares much of its fate.However, let us remember that after each halving and ATH, there was a drastic correction, and that the price, without everything I have already mentioned, would probably have undergone a correction. Looking back, the current price is more than phenomenal compared to halving 2016 ($400), or halving 2020 (about $7000) so in the long run, no one can be dissatisfied even if there is an even greater loss of value.",

Even with all the negative news that was happening, the continuation of some institutions to buy bitcoin made the price go up sharply, so things like accepting bitcoin will make the price soar.I do not expect that we will witness a change in the barrier of ~20k,30k.40k at the present time unless something exceptional happens, so the levels of changing from 23k to 20k do not represent a serious change.The serious change will be if it falls below the level of 19k, which is the psychological barrier that was not broken in the previous cycles.and we touch less than 23k  ($22.9k on KuCoin BTC/USDC.)

I also believe that eventually, it will suddenly crash down to $20.000 - $23.000, before slowly recovering and regaining ground. Such scenario will definitely cause panic to investors, similarly to 2017's crash.Hopefully, it'll eventually recover, providing that we're patient enough to wait it out.",

But then again this is Bitcoin.The market is constantly moving and we never really know what will happen next although right now there are some people who think that $20K is coming. The price drop is inevitable due to growing panic among traders over the fud effect, but I don't think $20K will happen this year if people ignore fud and avoid panic.I don't see an obvious scenario to see it go to $20K, but the whales may be able to take a step back to make up for it as a result of the massive sale. Today we have finished 7 months of the previous ATH, the price is down more than 57% and probably won't stop as the correction continues. But when a weak hand starts to lose its grip on bitcoin, then I believe we are headed for another great climb ahead.",

What I'm saying is this could be the perfect buying opportunity again. And then hope that in the next bull run, and as we have been projected, the next run could be in the 6 digits minimum. So think about the future, don't panic when the price falls hard, but instead, accumulate.",
