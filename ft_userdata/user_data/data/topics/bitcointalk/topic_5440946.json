For three of those seven years, Falke’s efforts were funded by crypto exchange Okcoin and Web3 investment firm Paradigm.The storied developer reaffirmed his passion for Bitcoin and said he was “positive about the future,” but that his role was no longer a good fit.“I am happy about my achievements,” Falke wrote. “And recognize that they would not have been possible without my sponsors.”",

But maybe the benefits outweigh the risks depending on the subjective perspective of said developer on how much money he needs to live a good life, even if they throw him out of the boat? He would have to take a large gamble that he will be kept on for at least a good 5-10 years to get enough money together to live how he wants (but not considerably rich) until old age takes him?After earning that much money, anything else becomes unnecessary unless you have dreams of becoming a centi-millionaire by age 70.",

Taking a bit of a US attitude here, since I can't speak for the rest of the world. it's not just the money. Want to get a mortgage self employed people find it more difficult to get one then people with a regular job. Even if they make more working for themselves. Same with trying to get other forms of finance, even credit cards. Sometimes it's just nice knowing you are working in an environment where you can take a couple of weeks of for something and there are other developers / programmers on task to keep things going. When working on something like BTC although I can't be certain I can see it being more of a constant non stop thing that does burn you out.-Dave",

Yes, it is a huge responsibility and an honor to work for the strongest token, but after a while the novelty of that wears off and they start looking for other opportunities to stimulate them. We see a lot of them being targeted by CW and also some governments, so it must take a toll on them. Let's appreciate their commitment to this experiment and wish them the best in their endeavors.",

The mailing list is still busy, so I think it's safe to say that these big projects will both continue and proliferate. but as far as the big job of getting the codebase more sensibly structured, alot of the work is now done, and many parts might now stay the same long into the future. you can see the results of that with the so-called kernel project; it probably wouldn't have been possible to start the kernel library (which is just the consensus logic factored out into a standalone library) if the codebase wasn't slowly tidied up and consolidated over time.Marco's job was to oversee alot of that churning consolidation over the year as an expert on the c++ language. I can see how he might find now a good time to move on from maintaining, as there will be less need for that kind of role which seemed to suit him so well. he's still active on the project though, so this is more what you could call \"shuffling\" roles instead of \"moving on\" outright",
