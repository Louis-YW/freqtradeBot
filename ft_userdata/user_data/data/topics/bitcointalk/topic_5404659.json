Market needed a correction and we are going through it. Some people are expecting it to go below $14k, not sure if this is going to happen. But personally I would not mind bitcoin to be under $14k for few days or weeks or even months. We will have new people on board before the jet engine starts ðŸ˜‚If this is not the bottom then I would like it not to move upward soon.",

I'd actually prefer price to consolidate between $20K and $30K for a 3-6 months for further accumulation and in order to more likely confirm a bottom and return to $40K to $50K levels, as part of a bear market dead cat bounce. If price reverses too soon it's much more likely to get rejected by $30K previous support and fall much lower than $17.5K I fear.I think many people here are otherwise still hoping for $14K, $12K and $10K levels, even if their not necessarily waiting for these potential lows. But personally I'd be very cautious if price came down to $10K, as it could very well stay below $20K for multiple years if this occurs. It would invalidate a lot of strong Bitcoin 12 year long bull market models such as log growth, that could lead to a much longer bear market.",

But you have to realize that basically the price will move in both directions where it can go down or up all the time. So far the bear market is still hitting and the market has not recovered, this is an opportunity that people can use as an opportunity to buy.I'm still expecting a decline, but I don't know how many lows it will hit later \"I'm not sure\", but basically it's possible. Buy now or later depending on our financial ability and willingness to invest. But nevertheless DCA will still be very useful for the current market situation.",

Take it as long as you have cash to spare.It's good advise, though there are some analysts that remain more neutral, or otherwise focus on fundamentals which I find useful. Personally I find it a useful metric seeing many perma-bull YouTubers finally turning bearish at $20K levels, to me these are strong signals that the bottom is in or very near, as many only became bearish when it was effectively too late to take any decent profits.I agree that the market is presenting a great opportunity, and while I am always planning for the worst case scenario, such as a decade long bear market, as well as best case scenario, I still see DCA at current prices (as well as below) to be great buying opportunity for the future. Whether that be in the coming years or decades, I still hold a very long-term perspective of Bitcoin's adoption in the future.",

Why else would you buy? Nobody invests to get poorer, right? But if you want to know the answer about this particular case of buying 1 bitcoin yesterday, then it's better to ask smartaction about it.A strong upward movement will not arise from the simple desire of people, even if there are many of them. This requires several key factors to converge at the same time.",

I'll then likely evaluate the situation again then. Until then though, I don't even check the price. The only times I actually get to know the price is through threads on the forum. Other than that, I don't check unless I'm making a payment, which these days has significantly declined. Quote from: ShowOff on June 30, 2022, 05:05:43 PMEveryone wants the market to go up because only then will the estimated value of their investment increase. I must be the odd one out then. Nah, the logic is sound obviously, but I think that's just scratching the surface. If you're invested in Bitcoin for the long term, I'd deem long term 5+ years at the moment, or at the very least beyond the next halving, I'd say most people would benefit from accumulating as much as they can.",

Unfortunately, we can't outplay the market as it was still in the bear situation where to expect more on the dump rather than pump. I couldn't be hopeless but for now, I don't even think about it. I would say that this current situation will even stay for a little bit longer.We got reached $22k in the past few days but dumps are then to come and prices went down continuously.
