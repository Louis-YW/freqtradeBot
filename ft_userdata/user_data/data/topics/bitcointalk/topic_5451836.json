And, if you're not so bright, it makes perfect sense, the evil greenback is holding the economies of emergent countries down, it's not corruption, it's not stupidity, it's not the lack of planning, the one who is to blame is the $.So, some  leaders have come up with the idea, let's trade in our currency and prosper!

And this is where we arrive to exactly the bilateral India-Russia trade:QuoteRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that Russia has accumulated billions of rupees in Indian banks which it can’t use. This is a problem, Lavrov told reporters in Goa on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting, reported Bloomberg.“We need to use this money. But for this, these rupees must be transferred in another currency, and this is being discussed now,” he said, as per the report.Simple as that, ruble-rupee trade is good until you need to use all those money, and for the use, you have to exchange it into a trustable currency, at which point you realize nobody is taking monopoly money India can print unrestrained for good old $!The chances of more countries using their useless fiat in order to settle trades?Just as much as every single one of you denying a Bitcoin payment and choosing to be paid in PooGrow, which is an actual coin, btw!",

You sense of humor is quite good but no body would every accept payments in PooGrow until its grown to acceptable levels. And, anything can happen in crypto-world because a useless meme coin can be acceptable by Tesla than why not PooGrow? That makes sense if you put it into an equation like that otherwise RIP PooGrow.",

Frankly, any currency is free to replace the USD if they dare to but I must assure you that they will always fail. The USD is the perfect no. 1 currency for the world's jobs as I know, it's jealous countries and haters that are behind this propaganda called a project to reduce the dominance of the USD.For what? I don't really know. This is not child's play, \"the USD makes the world go round.\"Furthermore, is there any serious project aiming to limit the power and influence of the USD? I bet there is none. What China, Russia and any allied countries are doing is not realizable as they do not have the economic status to achieve that. The USD did not align with countries or beg them to take the mantle of leadership, it's the world that chose it due to its stance of stability and dependability.China is the anchor of this, and of course, Russia is desperate, but anything planned under ganging up rather than letting economic demands be natural would not stand.",

Of course, the reason is clear. England and France were the dominant powers in the world at that time.Therefore, personally, I believe that Dedollarisation cannot be removed unless the United States collapses economically or loses its control over the world, as happened with England and France.",

Inflation alone can not kill economy, and it's not even clear that the supposed dedolarization will cause massive inflation.You are correct that the term \"petrodollar\" was referred to dollars earned from the sale of crude oil in international trade. However, this concept evolved overtime, and now it is widely perceived that US dollar value influenced by demand for oil. Therefore, In case of any shift from dollar to any other currency or basket of currencies, could potentially have significant impact on value the of dollar and US economy.Inflation is a complex issue and it is influenced by number of factors including devaluation of currency, and it is not yet clear how dedollarisation  will affect US dollar.",

But look at any country - no one has yet been able to bring this to life. Why? Yes, everything is very simple. At the moment there are no adequate alternatives to the dollar. Let this be a bad option, but they could not think of anything better.I will immediately be objected on this forum that there is an alternative and this is bitcoin. Yes, I agree, this is a great alternative, which I also like, but I have doubts whether bitcoin will be used as a replacement for the dollar in the world. It is easier for countries to create and control something of their own, rather than a decentralized and free digital currency, most of which is already in foreign (whale) hands. Whoever has the most concentrated BTC will have more strength, weight and power. Countries and governments will not want to share this with who knows who.I expect that all these attempts at dedollarization are expected to fail in the near future, and as we see in the example of the ruble and rupee, the countries are not able to implement this in any way.",

For more details you can read this articlePlus, i don't think solely Russia could devalue the Dollar by taking trade money in INR (Indian currency), that's why they are organizing big countries to come together so that an impact could be made on the dollar. I am wondering, why Russia can't trade INR to use them, as there are financial restrictions from many firms on Russia due to war as stated above but why can't they just convert them, it indicated that in BRICS Russia is a weak point and i think until Russia don't settle the war, there will be no implementation of BRICS currency.

Under such conditions, interaction within the framework of a bilateral swap of national currencies has ceased to suit Russia, it simply does not need so many Indian rupees, and it also does not want to strengthen its ruble (for obvious reasons, for every export-oriented country). One possible solution is to increase the import of Indian goods to Russia in order to even out the imbalance in the trade balance. There are other options, such as gold. Judging by Bloomberg's weekly statistics, the supply of Russian oil to India has not stopped, which means that the parties have found a way to negotiate with each other.",

Here it is the main reason - the inability for rogue countries to exist in the civilized world, and play by the accepted rules! That's the whole point of stuffing about the dollar, or rather its \"weakness\", lately But the joke is that a group of \"helping the sufferers of sanctions\" has also formed, which, under the guise of help, actually uses the situation to its advantage - for example, to buy a lot of cheap oil from Russia, selling them, for example, Indian rupees for oil, banning them change to dollars! In the people it is called \"to breed a sucker\"!But here is another nuance - Russia will be \"used\" and thrown into the dustbin of history. But what will happen to those who, on a wave of hysteria, abandoned the dollar and transferred their entire external economy to the yuan? These countries are really pitiful ....",
