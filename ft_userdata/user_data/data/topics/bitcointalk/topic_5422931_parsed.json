Your announcement looks poor since it's full of words and doesn't have proper announcement, I advice to hire a graphic designer to design your ANN thread and you need to bought copper membership [1] in order to attach image since you're still a newbie.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote",

Welcome to the forum and good luck with the brand. yeah I think it's also possible that the OP made a typing mistake which should be 1 in 20000 or more than we don't know outside of this forum, but apart from that their casino is pretty good by design and also mobile friendly, I just signed up and took a look inside see some bonuses that might make me interested in playing there",

It's fine, I mean a new comer wouldn't know how this forum work and how to create proper advertisement in this forum, so that's why many users are suggest and guide you to advertise your casino in proper way. In addition after you have create proper announcement and bought copper membership, you can start to run signature campaign if you have enough funds. Although it's up to you how long the campaign will last, but for better result you need to run it at least a month.There's a campaign since 3 years ago still active until right now.",

However, I got confused in what year the story of ole777 begins, whose branch it apparently is ole7.io so on the website https://ole777.com / it says that the casino was created more than 10 years ago and according to https://www.whois.com/whois/ole777.com the domain launch year 2010 is visible, however, in https://ole7.io/en/#/account/about-us it is said that OLE777 was created in 2014.",

As they have said you do have poor announcement thread and in my opinion, I didn't read about about the site and instead of just sharing the link of the mechanic then there should be the main link of the site like the home page and what it is about. The link is provided before on what to do to be able to post images which you have to pay in order for your restriction to be removed or you can choose not to pay but you must have to gain activity points and 1 merit.

Ok good luck on that, and hoping to see you around bifcointalk is an easy-to-understand community, made up with user of diverse backgrounds interacting towards a common goal which is information sharing about Bitcoin and other altcoins, and the forum is also home to projects which to grow the reputation and community base.I hope to see you improving the thread with more virtual content that will promote your casino more on this forum, as mentioned by others you are not the first casino to accept cryptocurrency on their platform we also have some other casinos around here to accept cryptocurrency deposits,  and another thing I will like to know is your KYC policy do you request for KYC at any point?",
