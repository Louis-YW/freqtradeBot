Are you planning to run it 100% off solar during daytime and then shut down at night? On-grid or off-grid? Some kind of hybrid system using solar as main power source and drawing the remaining power from grid or with automatic transfer switch grid -> solar and back? Please elaborate.P.S. Latest solar panels are 600-650w I guess.",

Latest solar panels are 600-650w I guess.here is a more typical panel 450 wattshttps://sungoldpower.com/products/450-watt-monocrystalline-solar-panel?here is a kit below that will do up to 12000 watts (not really)it comes with 12 x 450 watt panels and only 4 batteries it is not enough to run a 2000 watt miner 24/7/365https://sungoldpower.com/collections/all/products/complete-off-grid-solar-kit-12000w-48v-120v-240v-output-10-24kwh-lithium-battery-5400-watt-solar-panel-sgk-12maxand it is not cheap I did find a 600 watt panel but I do not know anything about themYangtze PERC super power 182 mm MBB monocrystalline 600w half cell solar panel – SolarPlushttps://solarplus.a2hosted.com/?product=yangtze-perc-super-power-182-mm-mbb-monocrystalline-600w-half-cell-solar-panel&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8IuFhMin_QIVjEFyCh0XhgqhEAQYBCABEgLfyfD_BwE600 watt panel is huge 89.5 inches by 44.6 inches450 watt panel from sunpower is 75.2 by 44.6 inches way easier to mount and almost the same efficiency per square inch.these are off grid the kit has 4 200 amp batteries or  9600 watts that means 6000 watts for your usable stored power or about 3 hours run time during low or no sun.I would guess that the kit could run maybe 10-13 hours out of 24.that kit was 8100 add in a 2000 watt miner for 2000 and you are at 10.1k invested.at 8 cents a th and 80th that is $6.40 and since you will stay up 1/2 that you clear 3.20 a day or 1000 a year or 10 year payoff for an off grid setup.",

      "body": "The choice of a solar panel for a mining rig depends on several factors, including location, climate conditions, and availability of sunlight. In general, solar panels with a power of about 2000 W should have a high enough efficiency to provide maximum energy output when using a mining rig.Power: The higher the power of a solar panel, the more energy it can produce. Choose a solar panel with more than 2000 watts.Efficiency: The higher the efficiency, the more energy the solar panel can produce from the sunlight it receives. It is recommended to choose solar panels with an efficiency of at least 20%.Dimensions: Make sure that the dimensions of the solar panel allow it to be installed in a place where there will be the most sunlight. The dimensions must match the installation location.Material: Choose a solar panel with high quality materials that provide durability and environmental protection.Warranty: Make sure the solar panel has a warranty that will allow you to replace it if it breaks.",

Just curious, if somebody have the time and want to explain for a rookieOkay off the gird ie  using batteries for the dark  cost a ton more.Grid tied can save a lot of money if the place you are in allows metered swapping.my big array does 1 megawatt a daywe burn 110kwatts an hour or 2.64 megawatts so 2.64-1 = 1.64 megawatts out of our pockets.but if your array did same 1 megawatt during sunlightand you burn 40kwatts an hour for all 24 hours the grid banks the 1 megawatt for night time.so 40 x 24 = 960 kwatts.   so 1000-960 means you are owed 40kwatts of power for that day.but you need a place that does fair net meter.Some places would not net meter the 1 megawatt you generate.  so 45 x 7 = 315 kwatts is all they would give you.  even though you  created 1000 kwatts or 1 megawatt.Now with batteries it means you need 960 x 2 = 1920 kwatts charged into the batteries since you can only run down a battery about 50%.Now a small system scales different but if you do on grid and do net meter your savings are more than 35% over no meter power grid. You save about 50% over batteries.",
