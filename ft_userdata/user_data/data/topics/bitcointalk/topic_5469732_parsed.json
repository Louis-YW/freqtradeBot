In Russia, mining developed because in some regions the cost of electricity is 1.5-2 cents per kilowatt. But after scandals and breakdowns of household transformers in residential areas, they are fighting against miners. If mining is discovered, the equipment will be confiscated",

Maybe we don't feel it now, but in the future we may \"miss\" the small miners. Fortunately, the network is dynamic and will always adapt to changes that arise.That said, about strategies. The first is to analyze the capital needed for the investment, and be willing to only obtain a return in 2 years (more or less). And a large part of this first return must be for reinvestment. In other words, you must create a plan for 4-5 years, until you actually have constant profitability. Of course, the value of bitcoin will help accelerate or delay this return on investment. Therefore, you must have a medium-term vision and never a short-term one.",

Designing/making an ASIC mining chip itself? Zero. Making a ASIC-based miner - still being done today.ASIC's are not 'programmed'. Their logic is hard coded as a fixed set of logic gates and com circuits etched into the silicon chips. The threads you reference were using chips that were designed and produced by companies with very deep pockets and it's the same today. Bitmain, microBt, Canaan, Inosilicon and Bitfury spend 10's of millions of $ for each new chip they release.There are several threads here that carry on with the same idea of building miners but today using chips from Bitfury and Bitmain.",

Newpac, Compac F, which are all based on Bitmain's ASICs.There are also other promising DIY Asics projects on the forum, but less accomplished for the moment.Of course, the aim is not to compete with an S19 or with the last Whatsminer, but to offer DIY and open source alternatives products to hobby and home miners.",
