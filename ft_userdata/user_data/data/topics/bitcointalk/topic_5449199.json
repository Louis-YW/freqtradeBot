  "content": "Hi. I'm Aprilio.This is my first post.I joined the bitcoin forum initiated by a meeting with one of the people who claimed to work as a miner.He explained to me about bitcoin in general, what is bitcoin, what is the role of bitcoin in the future that made him pursue this activity.For my reference, he said join the bitcoin forum (bitcointalk.org) to find out all things bitcoin.A few days ago I registered here but only to open and read. I continued my search on google and found the bitcoin.org site.On the bitcoin.org site I found some initial steps such as a wallet and what is bitcoin.Wallet security, a good choice of wallet is as important as privacy.Regarding the wallet, I found two, namely software and hardware.Then there are addresses starting with b1. Next there is an address starting with the number 1.Please help me.",

Next there is an address starting with the number 1.Please help me.What kind of help do you need?Ask some specific questions about what interests you and what is not clear to you. this way we can only guess and give extensive advice that you may not even understand.If you are confused by addresses that start differently, don't worry, because they are all compatible with each other. A Bitcoin address can start with 1, 3 or bc and it doesn't matter which one you use, with the fact that users of Segwit (starting with 3 or bc) addresses pay a slightly lower fee compared to users of legacy addresses (starting with 1).The most common classification is software and hardware wallets, although that is also a bit more complex. A hardware wallet is certainly safer to use, but you have to pay for it.",

Next there is an address starting with the number 1.There are also addresses starting with 3 and bc1p, you can use any of the addresses you want and they are all compatible with each other, but i will advise you to use the address that begins with bc1q, it is the one used the most today because the fees are lower when you use this address and the transactions are faster.",

Bitcoin.org provides you with a reliable filter and sorting option to go out and find the best wallet either hardware or software for being your own bank. If I was a newbie, I would have loved this for how useful it is. Let's take an example of an average Bitcoin enjoyer, who uses Windows OS, is new to the field of Crypto just like you, I would simply go with Electrum as that is also suggested by the above website.Some features Electrum provides:- 2FA- BECH32- Legacy Address- Lightning- Segwit- MultisigI am sure it covers all of your needs with Bitcoin and if you are looking for a wallet that not just only cover Bitcoin and other crypto assets as well, go with a Hardware Wallet like Trezor or Ledger.",

Uhm, about this Quote from: AprilioMP on April 17, 2023, 06:13:28 PMWallet security, a good choice of wallet is as important as privacy.  This is true, but it's not only the security of the wallet itself that's important; you also need to know how to secure it. For example, you need to know that the wallet consists of two keys: a private key and a public key. The private key to your wallet is a lengthy string of letters and numbers that, like a password, must be kept hidden. Meanwhile, the public key is your wallet address that was shown publicly. People can send crypto (or, in this case, bitcoin) to you through this address. It is right that wallet addresses consist of random alphanumeric that start with a 1, a 3, or a b. I hope it could help, if not don't be hesitate to ask more specific questions in this forums. Cheers!",

Next there is an address starting with the number 1.All wallets listed on the bitcoin.org website are secure enough to provide reliable protection for your bitcoins: it is definitely a good source of information to choose your first wallet, especially if you have no prior experience in dealing with similar software systems. All those wallets are open-source, which means their codebase is being maintained and peer-reviewed by the bitcoin community consisting of people of different levels of expertise in programming and development. If you don't have knowledge in this field or can't review the code yourself, don't worry: as long as you use a widely-adopted wallet such as Electrum or Sparrow Wallet, you may be sure that it was well-reviewed and shouldn't contain serious bugs or vulnerabilities. As for privacy wallets, you better don't use them until you fully understand how the Bitcoin protocol works, how to manage UTXOs, and control your behavior during transaction sending or receiving. Privacy wallets won't help you if you don't understand the basics, and they may do more harm than good if you choose the wrong wallet to protect your privacy.",
