  "content": "N3TSIS Coin is a cryptocurrency that was created as a result of the inspiration between Bitcoin and Dash.Users can run a node in the N3TSIS Blockchain Network using the NETSIS Core Software. For the Proof-Of-Work Ecosystem, NETSIS employs the X11 algorithm. N3TSIS is based on the Bitcoin Core and Dash Core cryptocurrencies.Miners & MasterNode Owners are awarded 232.5 NET per block.This project aims to create a coin with value, for example, if you compare Bitcoin with Litecoin you would notice that bitcoin is slower than Litecoin however in terms of the total supply of Litecoin you would find that they have a large amount of 84 million coins which is a big number, N3TSIS can provide only 210.000.000 ¬†coins & faster than bitcoin and Litecoin combined. Superblock reward : 7%Masternode reward : 50%Masternode amount : 10000 coinsMasternode confirmations : 15 blocksCoinbase maturity : 61 ( + 1 default confirmation) blocksTarget spacing : 5 minutesTarget timespan : 10 minutesTransaction confirmations : 6 blocksA block is generated a minute and a half (1.5 minutes) with a difficult retarget change every 5 minutes. A transaction is confirmed after 6 confirmations.If you compare n3tsis with Dogecoin you would notice the total supply of Dogecoin is Unlimited which is absurd, this is equal to printing money forever nonstop.I would consider n3tsis comes between Bitcoin and Litecoin.Currently, there are only almost 500 mined blocks, the difficulty is very low and I invite you to start mining.https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1173239789026283562/1173241621714841681/Image_1-1-1024x596.png?ex=656c77e8&is=655a02e8&hm=d2af3d161f8a13b6b733e9174a1bc87f72826bd027fa0a4f076caeb9f43dcbf8&We Offer You the Best Cyber Security SolutionsN3TSIS Technology, operating its sales operations through successful channel structures, provides innovative products in the field of cybersecurity.
