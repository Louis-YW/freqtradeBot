  "content": "most times, I wonder how these food produce are been made to last for a very long period of time. As at early 19th century, perishable food items could not be preserved for a lengthy period of time. now, we can see new ideas and innovation coming up. These food items can now be stored for longer period of time using preservatives or consumable chemicals tested and approved by the government for food preservations.   but how sure are we that these chemicals don't have negative effects on our body. we have heard about deaths in some countries caused by food consumption and this is really awful, leaving fear in the minds of other consumers.      In the United States, only 24%of it's citizens have confidence in the USA food supply. my question now is what happened to the remaining 76%of it's citizens. why are they not consuming these food produce?     In order to resolves these challenges, new innovative company like the UNISOT, has been set to address this problems using Blockchain technology to increase transparency and enable consumers track food products from the point of production, to the point of sale.The question here is, will this new Blockchain technology be able to solve this problem?will it return the trust of the remaining 76% of the USA citizens who lost interest in consuming their own country's produce.would this Blockchain prevent infected food from reaching the mouths of unwitting humans in the future?what do you think about food preservation is it fine by you, knowing fully well that these preservatives can be dangerous to health? here is a source for this topic, you can as well read more on this from this link:How blockchain technology can help solve the $40B food fraud problem",

If you could draw back then there were no much development or technology that could proffer a solution for preserving food, there were other local preservatives that works fine without harming us and at then the life span of man were about 90 to 150 years but in the current century and age, people barely live for about 69 to 90 years due to the development, forms of food consumption, climatic and environmental factors which includes air pollution, land pollution, water pollution have drastically endanger the life of a man. These are the major factors that influences the life and living of a man in the world. Well lemme just stop here I don't want to deviate from this topic otherwise I would have loved to go more deeper.",

Blockchain is nothing but chains of blocks of data, which are difficult to modify after being broadcast, and there is no relationship between them and improving people's confidence because it can happen that there is a consensus between material manufacturers to cheat, and therefore the consensus is the correct one in the blockchain, not the correct data. .It can be said that encouraging organic farming, consuming canned foods in a short period of time, and emphasizing industrial additives provides better confidence.",

      "body": "I don't think that blockchain or any other technology can fix the issue of the preservatives that are being used in every food items these days. In this day and time things are different from 19th centaury. The population of the world has seen huge growth during past decades, and with that the demand and supply of food was needed to combat that problem. The only solution in that situation was to use preservatives to enhance the usability of the food items.But, these days the food producing farms, and the processing companies are using harmful chemicals to enhance the life span of the food items in the worse ways possible for monetary gains. In such cases how could a teach like blockchain help to solve the problem? And, if it even plays its role in fixing the problem then how will low teach people take benefit from it? I believe that without proper infrastructure and strict regulations the problem can not be solved. These problems can only be solved by governments and high authority organizations. But, unfortunately none of them will take any action against such preservatives as they are aware of the consequences that will happen after the restrictions. That's why I believe that only new startups that are well aware of the benefits of organic food can help in such scenarios. Their beliefs regarding high quality organic food that isn't processed by any chemicals is a must thing, and the food should be transported through a medium which would make it to reach the consumers as soon as possible.In that case the problem can be tackled very well and the fear regarding the harmful chemicals won't exist in the minds of the consumers. Now if blockchain is incorporated by such startups than that would really make some positive changes in the food delivery system. But, the need for blockchain in such systems isn't necessary however you can consider it as a good feature.",

I don't think blockchain can help in this case when we are talking about real time products and not just any other products you can easily manage as long as you have internet. Besides that, even as we are now facing global economic crisis, nobody would even want to risk losing what they have in exchange of recognition or patriotism, and I don't think it is also the answer to this problem especially now that even crypto is facing problems in terms of not only adoption but also from the hands of high authorities.",

Because all companies that are engaged in the food sector, including in America too, must have carried out maximum sales promotions. But the problem is the matter of the ingredients in these foods, namely chemicals or food preservatives as you wrote. Now everyone knows and is aware of the preservative content in certain foods, especially in foods that can be stored for a very long time or fast food. Even though these preservatives have been approved by the government in each country, it's no longer a secret, that chemicals that are put in fast food or put in as preservatives, will definitely cause side effects on the human body.Even though the effect is not felt immediately, in a period of several years if consumed continuously you will definitely feel the effects of these chemicals.And about the blockchain system, if it is applied to a food sales system, I think it might be fine. But maybe it just needs adjustments to its consumers.",

If I remember correctly we have different methods I remember the pot thing where they put foods inside then buried them. Even when a long time passes by the foods are still fresh and new. But if you're concern about how blockchain could help people to be aware of their food they intake, I think most of the people are aware of expiration date and still people doesn't care about it. So in short even blockchain couldn't do about it as people already lost their trust.",

Some of the preservatives sure cause more harm even if there's only a little amount of it but there are guidelines for this stuff so it's nothing to worry about.",

      "body": "From the article:QuoteUsing solutions like those powered by UNISOT (using nChain technology), every step in the life cycle of a food product, from farm to plate, can be tracked and traced, creating hitherto unforeseen transparency and true accountability. Everything from the farm something is grown on, to the chain of custody along the supply chain, to the conditions in storage facilities and transport vehicles, can be tracked and traced, leaving an immutable record on the blockchain for all to see.When consumers pick up an item in a supermarket or order something in a restaurant, they’re able to see all of this information just by scanning a Q.R. code. This allows customers to make more informed decisions, providing them with certainty that the food they’re about to consume has been produced in a way that’s compatible with their values and that it is what it claims to be. In short, selling wood chips as parmesan cheese will become impossible in a blockchain-powered worldTracking the product will not erase all possibilities of fraud! No tracking, no timestamp, no code, no blockchain will be able to deal with fraud in the food industry.It might sound tempting when you think the farmer wills can each carrot, assign a code to it and you can check that on an app to be sure you've received that exact carrot, but nothing will stop the farmer from importing illegally 100 tons of carrots and labeling all of them as eco bio green ultra natural gluten free carrots!Same for the meat industry, things get so complicated here because you simply have no way with a simple database to know if the said ingredients are indeed part of the mix that was used for your salami, this can only be done with a 24/7 monitoring of the entire facility with health inspectors at every step and thus, why the need for blockchain at all?Oh and btw, and for everyone cheering for this solution, it uses Bitcoin SV blockchain, so, might have to think once or twice before clapping!Quote from: Husires on April 29, 2023, 01:21:17 AMAll I see now is to put the word blockchain in a sentence and then think things will get better.But it works, right?I just washed myself with a shampoo that uses blockchain technology and I need a lawnmower to shave!",

It is often used in grocery supermarkets such as fruits, vegetables, fish, chicken, and others so that it does not rot immediately so it takes a long time to spoil.Of course, when it is said that it is a preservative, since it contains a chemical, once it is introduced into our body, it will actually cause a chemical reaction in our body, not immediately because we have an immune defense mechanism that is called.The only thing I don't understand is what is the relevance of blockchain here in the matter of preservative foods.
