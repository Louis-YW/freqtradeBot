Even if you really don't know it, Bitget is already quite well known to traders. As for other exchanges that provide options such as DEX and CEX, I recommend checking the advice from Zee27, just do your research first before actually putting money into it.

It often helps to protect against theft while providing anonymity. It's a development that can protect us from scammers, because my wallet has once been wiped before while trying to participate in a fake airdrop, if it was this I'm sure it wouldn't have happened.",

It really just doesn't mix.I am afraid that a classic DEX cannot be used in the near future if you have to provide proof of origin for the sale of your cryptos against FIAT - as is the case for example with European exchanges like Bitpanda, or all exchanges that will be subject to MiCa. It is much more difficult to prove the origin of the coins via a DEX, because it cannot be guaranteed where the seller got his coins from. This is no longer the case with exchanges, since the exchange must ensure that no coins are sold from \"dubious\" sources. So if you want to exchange your coins against FIAT in the near future, I would personally be very cautious about using DEX.",

So you can develop your own Blockchain if you don't want to pay them, whether you prefer using the Bitcoin network, ETh network, or BSC you have to pay network fees.CEX made a huge contribution to developing the systems in the crypto industry in my above post I have already mentioned that mass adoption is the result of their marketing strategy. The ho DAPPs concept is based on the CEX's developed systems & features, most of the innovations are sponsored or fully innovated by the CEX. No need to be a fanboy of DEX's do credit their contribution at least.No noo.. Banks cant do it, and banks really cant bear the pressure of the establishment and state policies, But CEXs can as they offer their services worldwide so they don't accept much pressure from the state if a state is enforcing them with their terms they can simply quit their service there but Banks cant quit they will compromise as their Bussnies domain is the state specifically with some exceptions but Banks really cant, giving benefit of the doubt if they can why they are not doing so.Buddy, it's not that simple.",

Especially if they are not based in that country, to begin with. While it is harder for them to completely move from one country to another, I'm pretty sure regulation is the key reason for that. I would not be surprised if exchanges will also have the same problem sooner or later.At the end of the day, moving to a hybrid platform won't remove the risk that the platform will control your funds. I believe if security and control are your priority, any kind of CEX or hybrid CEX is not an ideal choice.",
