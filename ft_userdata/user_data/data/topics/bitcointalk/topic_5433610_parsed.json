  "content": "I have read on this forum how some users are starting to accept bitcoin as a payment option for their businesses. This makes me happy. I want to believe that there are three kinds of merchants when it comes to accepting bitcoin or cryptocurrency as payment option. They are 1) The decided. 2) The undecided. 3) The Never will.If you belong to the second or third category, I'll make an effort to convince you otherwise using the findings of this study. Forrester Consulting, a reputable research and consultancy organization, did a study in 2020 to assess the economic effects of businesses accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using BitPay.Before I continue, I want you to understand that it is entirely up to you whether you use a payment gateway or manually set up your wallet; it depends entirely on what you want. So, I firmly believe that the result can be generalized. You can check this threadUsing a Crypto Payment Gateway vs Setting Up a Wallet Manually for Business I created some days ago to read the opinions of people.  What matters are the benefits your business stands to gain.So, what do you stand to benefit as a businessperson when you start to accept bitcoin as a payment option1. New customers base: According to the research, 40% of customers that pay with crypto were new to the merchant. 2. Increase in the size of transactions because buyers who pay with cryptocurrency tend to spend more than other customers. 3. Lower transaction costs: Transaction fees are lower than those for other payment types4. Elimination of traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards. Basically, higher revenue and ROI, a new clientele, and improved fraud security. Aren't they what businesses need?I hope that I have been successful in persuading the unsure and the Never will that accepting bitcoin as a payment option will benefit their businesses more.Lemme hear your thoughtshttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929005406/en/Study-Shows-Merchants-That-Accept-Bitcoin-Attract-New-Customers-and-Saleshttps://bitpay.com/resources/forrester-report-says-bitpay-adds-new-sales-and-2x-aov/https://www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoin-payment-services-introduction/#:~:text=Cryptocurrency%20gateways%20enable%20you%20to,to%20offer%20more%20payment%20options.",

Elimination of traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards. You're right, also in addition we can see the benefits of avoiding bulkiness in making payments, it brings about easy and increased security measures against the former means of making payments with fiat, theft in this regard is associated with physical assault which has been well dealt with.",

No such limitation when they purchase using their self-custody wallets.",

People who are in this industry would hesitate to spend their assets on a daily basis because of the tendency to earn profit from holding. With regards to non-crypto users, same thing would happen I guess. What I am trying to point out is; people are still not ready for massive adoption of this technology and would still be as long as volatility is high on the market price of not only Bitcoin but also with other cryptocurrencies. This will only work at the present with crypto-related projects but I just doubt that it would as well be good for businesses;maybe in the future.",

But of course, this is if the shop is known to the crypto community. Every country I think should have a directory of shops that accepts BTC. Or they better be adding a huge logo the one that says BITCOIN ACCEPTED.There are merchants that use other platforms like Binance Pay and then eventually convert their coins to fiat after receiving them, can they be undecided?",

If it requires them to pay for a service with their bitcoin, they can; that doesn't make them a new customer. In the \"Never Will\" category, they probably are either aware of or not aware of Bitcoin; they may also be your regular customers, but not just paying with Bitcoin.I don't accept your facts.

Transactions being irreversible is a good feature for sellers, but not good for customers, since it might be difficult to ask for a refund in case the seller is the scammer, instead of the buyer. That is a guarantee customers have when purchasing at online shopping websites and when using traditional payment methods through their banks, as they are centralized services.Anyway this is a delicate matter. I think the refund policy should be clear, like customers have until 3 days to ask for it. So for 3 days, funds remain in bitcoin at the shop, but after that time period they can be swap into fiat and used by the shop's owner. Or the refund policy should return the customer btc amount proportional to the fiat value of the purchase.",

For instance, businesses like SMM, a reseller that doesn't accept cryptocurrency will lose out lots of buyers, same is applicable to a merchant that doesn't accept paypal. All payments methods are needed for effective customer satisfaction, most customers can't patronize if paypal is not available; they only pay with Paypal. Hence, offline business that accepts bitcoin can be effective if a person is low on fiat, but the other way round, they'd prefer to use fiat. However, why it's crucial to add bitcoin as a payment method in offline businesses is that the competition is less; many businesses don't accept bitcoin yet. So, with bitcoin as an addition, the vendor will be one step ahead of his competitors.",
