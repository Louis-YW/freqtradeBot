  "content": "In continuation of Part 1 of this topic, which can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412147.msg60870969#msg60870969It's important to note that no one has been able to move the price up since it was moved from +19,500 to 25,000 as promised by Bitcoin master here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404659.0Someone or couple of people accused him of not moving the price exactly as promised (in 1-2weeks) time, his reply for such people is this: \"moving of the price is based on rules, without adhering to the rules the price may not be moved. The rule is Faith-based and very simple: Love for GOD/CREATOR and love for neighbors. Certain people wanted to take the Glory that belongs to the CREATOR, but bitcoin master refuse to allow them take the glory by refusing to let them pretend to know how to predict or move the price. I would have accommodated them if they had given Glory to the CREATOR and maybe recognize bitcoin master for his efforts. That's basically how my faith or belief works... It's based on Rule of Love for GOD and people. I don't want to go against the rule by displeasing my CREATOR.Now, Bitcoin master wants to move the price to $30,000 and above, and he wants to achieve this this year as he noticed people are already giving up on the possibility of such massive increase this year. They are hoping for massive increase next year or more. This is the right time to move the price up, the time those who claim to do the same thing are pessimistic. This should serve as proof who really controls the price.Now, if Bitcoin master is able to achieve the upward price movement this year, will you support him? Remember, he proves it, you reward him = Pow(Proof of Work). What do you think?[moderator's note: removed fake signature]",

      "body": "I just noticed the above words in red, like this:  [moderator's note: removed fake signature] They are actually links that are relevant to this topic... am not sure if they qualify as signature even though I once use the links as signatures but didn't continue using them because they were not displaying properly when used as signature.By the way, they are not bad links/topics. One is a Bitcointalk thread that explains how Bitcoin price can be moved without money while the others are threads on Avoiding gambling, My works on Bitcoin project and My faith-based posts.I will continue using the links in other of my forum posts but in different form, maybe without colours so people don't think it's signature.",
