I don't know how many hours you've been active on the forum daily in the last 8 months since you signed up for an account but when you consistently make 4-5 posts daily then 1000's seems like a normal thing. But anyway, it's a journey that should be quite enjoyable for you because the time you spend on forums is worth what you make.But out of respect for you, you deserve my congratulations. Continue and maintain your quality, the journey is still long.Quote from: T3PR00T on May 25, 2023, 08:10:55 PM16 days ?That's the accumulated time or total time logged in that he has since registering his account on the forum in the last 8 months.",

I think one of the above users has mentioned it, it may be true that 16 days is the total time the OP has logged on this forum. I'm just wondering why threads like this end up trending among some people even though they are free to make one for themselves. I mean they can make one, but of course for big achievements like 10k posts or 20k posts in 5 - 10 years of participation in the forum. If this idea were adopted by many newbies, then indeed this reputation board would have many threads of personal achievement.OP, you deserve it, but why don't you consider posting it in this thread: Announce your rank up, merit or any achievements that makes you feel great! - But sorry, I just think like that even though I also congratulate you on your achievement.",

I was about to write the same thing but figured out you already posted this. I know how it feels when we reach some milestone, and they want to share their feelings. In the old days, everyone started creating separate threads for reaching Member rank, Full Member rank, Sr, Hero, and another achievement. BitcoinGirl.club firmly believes that if everyone started making such threads, the reputation board would be full of such topics. So, she came up with the idea of posting all of them in a single thread. That was a good idea, and most forum members followed that. But in recent days, Some Prominent forum members created a separate thread for their achievements (which I consider an extraordinary achievement), and now we are trying to follow them. We should not compare ourselves with some extraordinary guys even though BitcoinGirl.club may argue about that. It's not like OP is not aware of Announce your rank up, merit or any achievements that makes you feel great!. Only nine days ago, he celebrated his Sr. Member rank-up achievement in this thread. He could have posted this achievement there as well. But decided to create a thread because others are doing the same.",

If we see others doing something, we tend to follow them. The reputation board is in the Trading discussion board. It is supposed to use for trading-related reputation. But, it has been used for other reputations as well. I don't see any problem there. Again, I don't blame OP for not following the guidelines because maybe he saw other members creating threads to celebrate their achievements, and that's why he thought, why not create one for me?

Neither I. I did not celebrate my rank or other achievements by creating a thread, and I do not plan to create one unless I achieve something extraordinary. QuoteIn addition, I think that the quantity in this particular case is not too important, because numbers are just numbers, and the quality of the posts is a much more important criterion. Somewhat Agree. But, Do you believe Ratimov's post quality or writing style is terrible? He is one of the guys who wrote most tutorials and Guidelines for newbies. He was excited about his achievements and created threads to celebrate them. Somehow BitcoinGirl finds it annoying and decided to create a separate thread so everyone could celebrate their achievement in a single thread.",
