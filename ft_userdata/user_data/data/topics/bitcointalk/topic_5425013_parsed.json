      "body": "Yobit is an old exchange with several bad reviews from users, a little search here in the forum or through google will give you the exact picture.They are surviving because they know how to play their game perhaps, but that does not take away the fact they are shady and mostly favor artificially pumping coins and wrecking naive investors.If your intention is to use it, I would say look for other exchanges that are far better, however, the choice is yours. There is a reason why most crypto investors don't use it.",

Those tremendous APY that they're giving, look at how much it got with its order book.Most likely, you'll see nothing to its buying order and those that have been selling it like waiting for it to be taken care of. But the thing is, no one wants to take care of it.",

They use to be very popular even in 2015 because of the campaign they are doing here in the forum but are now disliked because of the shitcoins they create.One thing that you might like is that they don't force KYC. I still see many users in their exchange chat and if you wanted to know about them, I guess you can chat the users there.",

Has anyone done any due diligence on them? Are they trustworthy?As others in this thread have already mentioned. YoBit is an exchange that is around for a long time now, which is usually a good thing but at the same time YoBit always had the reputation to be shady or even scammy. They had some weird launchpad sales in the past that did not so well if i remember correctly too. So personally i would not really use YoBit as my primary exchange or use it to keep my funds stored there. Also the token of YoBit really seems to have a pretty high value at the first glance but if you look a little closer then you see that the total supply of it is only 17000, which is extremely low and the trading volume is also very small.",

Probably sanctioned because it's a Russian exchange. It could be this bad when your coins can't go through because of the wallets being tagged.",

They are not scammers who steal your things shamelessly (kind of makes them better than FTX, LoL).But people are right to call them shady. Everything else they're famous of, like their IEOs in the old times, their pump and dump mini (or maybe micro) projects, their farming project, etc, etc has mostly made people lose money. I've heard of occasions in which someone made money there, but people losing money has been a much more frequent outcome.  Be safe.",

I am not sure but sometime it feels like the exchanger was itself invented to list the shitcoins and make business out of it. However, the exchanger is now in shadows, there is not much buzz about it anywhere. The advertisements and signature campaigns everything gone down the sink. There was period when this exchanger hosted very long signature campaign and even with the negative reviews they kept it on to prove that they are working just fine and all. The problem was they used to quickly stop the payments, show reasons as not to verify the users and loot them in the name of kyc and shit. The volume was also manipulated many many times. Without any doubt one should not be using it.",
