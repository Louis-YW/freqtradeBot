      "body": "Why not, because bitcoin still has the potential to go back to bullrun in the following year maybe I would say after the halving we will see how bitcoin rally, even though the exact time cannot be determined but bitcoin always has a good cycle after the halving occurs, so you still question about bitcoin investment now?I'm only referring to bitcoin, not crypto, so it's clear that this consideration still makes sense if you start investing from now on, and there are even some investors who have persisted when they bought above $ 50k and are still holding it, so why are you considering it when the price is already lower than the current price?If it's quite difficult to make a lump sum or buy directly then you can use the DCA strategy, of course it's very effective to accumulate until the end of the year or as long as you want.",

The halving controls the supply and keeps the demand relatively higher, tilting the trader sentiment towards the bullish pointer. The other qualities bitcoin has makes it a valuable investment even during a bear market.- Jay -",

The price may dip for a moment but I'm sure the price is still very early for we are going to see the price surpass the ATH last 2021.One reason also is that you don't wanna put your money in the bank right now. You may want to have your cash at home but moving it to BTC will be safer.",

Bitcoin will climb to 40+ before the year will run out and if you buy it for now and it goes up then you will make you profit. But there are two factors to consider. Long term factor and short term factor. Now if you are buying it for a long-term investment then I will say yes because this is also the period to buy it but If you are buying it for short term then I will say no but you can still buy it if you wish to. But since it is a short investment you would have wanted for some time for it to come down again to either 16k$ or 20k$. So that when it goes up again you can make small profit the short term investment. But long term investment is the bet investment ever. In short term investment you might have loss in the process, because the Market is unpredictable.",

This is nothing but speculation. It could start before halving because of how much people believe in post halving bull runs. What makes 2025 so special that you expect the ath to happen? It could happen before, at, or right after the halving.Quoteone major element that can catalyse the next bull run, is the Bitcoin halving that triggers every 4 years.  And as expected after every Bitcoin halving comes a  Bull run in the crypto market.Bitcoin will reach another all time high, I have no doubt about it, but don't act like you already have the money in your hand. QuoteSo, from the look of things, don't you think that investing in Btc at the moment could be worth considering?I do, but I'm not investing now. The best time to invest was when the price was crashing hard in 2022. When we broke below 20 thousand was the most obvious sign that bitcoin is at or close to its bottom.",

But it's OK now, I'm not a spammer.  Investing now or later is good decision as long as you believe that bitcoin can bring you returns. Even I think someone is still very likely to get bitcoin at a higher price in the past, it is also a good option if they are in long timeframe. Investing at lower price is likely to give you higher return in the future if the price goes up, but that doesn't mean investing at high price will cost you forever. Absolutely yes, I have to agree that this is the time you should consider investing.",

It's known that when Bitcoin halved, the price of the coin always saw a surge in price, and with the current price, it's still a good price for those looking to invest because it's still low. If a person is not sure if they can invest now, then buying on DCA would also help them to buy at a different price level.We cannot predict the Bitcoin price, but for an investor who has intention to hold for a long time, they have the chance to sell their coin when the price pumps after some years of holding.",

And they don't need to buy 1 full BTC right away, they can do it slowly (and we still have more than a year before the halving), like doing DCA or just bought whatever money they can afford to invest right now.",

If you buy now you can still make it but it will not be as the long period of holding it.Last year from April bitcoin price was very much down till the early part of the this year 2023 and those who buy at that time of low which was 15$ are happy now but that can not fetch what they really want so they still have to keep it in the investment platforms to matured before converting it or marketing it to be used.",

It's common to see people discussing Bitcoin during a bull run, but it's important to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although it may be difficult to answer, it's worth asking where you were when Bitcoin was priced around $16K. Comparing the current price to the last all-time high suggests that there's still a good opportunity to invest. It's important to stay calm if there's a sudden drop in price and hold onto your investment until the price recovers. In conclusion, investing in Bitcoin requires patience, but it can be a good opportunity for those willing to take the risk.",

I agree on that mate, i was there at the time when btc rise up to 14k$ on year 2021 in a month of december, i was afraid to buy that time because i thought that was the highest price that bitcoin may reach but i am wrong, when btc rise more than 3x of its price in 2021,so based on my observation the perfect time to buy is now and if you are not convince then look at its previous price from year 2010 till today and you can see that btc is not fulling back it is moving forward and if you have patience to hold you will surely have a return or profit from your holdings.",
