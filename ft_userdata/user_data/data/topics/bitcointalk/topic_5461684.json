  "content": "As we all know most of Nigeria populations are aware of Bitcoin. So I was thinking about how many of Nigeria's top politicians, musicians, and actors or comedians might be involved in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. It was also interesting to wonder if some of these celebs are part of this forum too, but due to anonymity, no one can reveal their true identity.The great thing about Bitcointalk is that everyone is treated equally regardless of their status (as long as you don't break the rules) which helps prevent intimidation. It's a place unlike our daily social medias. The main purpose of Bitcointalk, is to serve as a community for Bitcoiners and so we are not supposed to care if you are anybody out there.Lol, Im just a wiredo   If you happen to spot someone here who writes like a celebrity, feel free to give them a virtual nod or wink For me, @ cryptobrainboss be wan resemble- Burnaboy   The only person I haven't seen yet is OBO, wizkid I guess some others might be here somewhere. but remember, shhh... we'll keep their secret safe in the world of Bitcointalk anonymityI like the picture rep by CryptoHeadlineNews so I decided to add it to my thread (thanks)(Please no offenses, this thread wasn't meant to insult or reveal any ones identity so please don't even if you know them)",

It was also interesting to wonder if some of these celebs are part of this forum too, but due to anonymity, no one can reveal their true identity. Yes, na true say all those people wey you mention go fit dey into crypto in one way or the other, but since that's not their main source of income, and not to make people put eyes on them, they go just want to be on the low key, which is what our founder & this forum taught us. But I doubt if any of those top especially Nigerian celebrities dey for this forum, because if they been dey, no how no how they for no show up for our local board to run one or two stuff to show love (i.e contest), since they already get the rubbers (i.e money). QuoteFor me, @ cryptobrainboss be wan resemble- Burnaboy The only person I haven't seen yet is OBO, I guess some others might be here somewhere. but remember, shhh... we'll keep their secret safe in the world of Bitcointalk anonymityThis is funny shah.. But abeg when you finally see who is likely to be \"OBO\" for here, please also help us find Wizkid and \"Tiwa Savage\" too ohBut I think \"SatoPrincess\" be our \"Tiwa Savage\" for here..🤔 while I leave una alone to find the rest for the fun of it.",

No matter say anonymity is the key to the forum but I doubt say those celebrities them wey you mention say them dey part of this forum because we know ourselves as naija say if such people dey here,them no go fit hide their identity because of the kind people wey them be. Wetin make you reason all this mata self because I feel say you dey go too far. I know say Nigeria celebs go dey into crypto because we no dey  carry last but nobody go come tell you but I don hear when our celebs dey use bitcoin sing.",

      "body": "Sarcastic    we'll since you already stated that this thread is for joke and fun,  I will leave you to it then but when it comes to identity there is no way to joke with that most especially in the Bitcointalk forum where privacy is rated high but all the same. Let me add a little bit of fun to this,  I think we need to have Elon musk here on the local board too because sometimes we dey see some white guys were dey enter here once,  once so we fir make any of them represent Elon Musk,  I think that fit best since Elon musk involvement in crypto is pronounced but we don't have him in the bitcointalk forum. So since you are adding meme faces to users here,  you can also consider creating a face for Elon Musk as the big money bag and you can consider users like JayJuanGee who have displayed a wide range of financial knowledge and investment expertise, and haven't sneaked in here once a while make sense to have him included even in the first page of the thread,  and once he pin this thread for notification believing me he will react to each comment because he is most active. But in doing that we need to make the thread more broaden so that it can trigger up discussions that will keep the thread active for a long time. Back to the subject of wether we have any naija celeb here in the forum or involved in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, the possibility is higher in them owning Bitcoin or any other coins but being a member of the forum is something that can be debated for long and their os 90% chance that most of them don't know about bitcointalk as a forum, and even if they do, they won't be willing to remain above in the forum",

      "body": "Celebrities of Nigeria that are into crypto are much but maybe only a few of them reveal it publicly as the ones you’ve mentioned above. I don’t think those celebrities that are into cryptocurrency will feel the need to join a forum like this. Because of their busy schedules and events, they’ll rather higher a good crypto trader to take care of their funds for them rather than them coming to learn about crypto in general here. If they want to trade they can hire someone to do that for them, if not they can just buy and hold and keep their private keys private. Even with this, they must have learnt about the security and privacy involved in cryptocurrency that’s not supposed to be exposed to the public. They can as well just sign an agreement to convict the person handing the funds for them if anything happens to their money. Celebrity life is very hectic, so I’m very sure that they’re not the ones handling the account no matter how much they have in crypto.",

Let's celebrate ourselves in the forum instead of others and op your topic tok about bitcoin and those who you mentioned are not part of us. Yes as you said, many people in the country know bitcoin and many e no dey interested because dem say na Yahoo boys nai dey use am to dem no want anything wey Yahoo boys dey use.",
