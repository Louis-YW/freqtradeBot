  "content": "A big panic has spread in different banks of the United States. In this situation, the alliance of these banks has requested the country's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide insurance against any deposit for two years in advance and ignore specified limits. So that faith returns to customers and banks return to normal situation. Since the rumors of SVB's closure, customers of Signature Bank have started withdrawing their deposits. In that event, their share prices started falling. Not only that, the shares of Signature Bank's peers also fell. Meanwhile, after Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, another bank of the country is at risk of collapse - First Republic Bank. However, some of the leading banks in the United States have come forward to prevent the collapse . 11 banks led by JP Morgan and Citigroup are depositing 30 billion or 3 trillion dollars to First Republic.Despite all this news, crypto is showing good signs. If this fear prevails in the banks, then a large deposit of the bank customer may be invested in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Investors can also earn huge profits against their deposits. What is your opinion in this regard?",

I do sense most of the investors or customer have made a Uturn by investing and putting their resources into cryptocurrency again since they have less confident with bank, maybe they don't want any collapse anymore whereby channelling their investment to bitcoin, if this is actually true then I smell to see bitcoin at $35k within 15 to 25 days interval imo.",

They are not looking for alternatives to put their wealth 1:1 or even make money thru bitcoin. So it's strong enough reasons for us to see buying pressures in the market for the last 3 days or so.",

Most people who have knowledge of crypto will definitely use this means to run to it, while those who are still not certain about the crypto market will have to pull their funds and hold down on their personal deposit box.But it's really clear that the majority of people are now choosing the crypto market over the banking system; it's really clear how the bearish market turns bullish just as of the time all this Banks issue began. Â It's a good one for all of us in crypto but how long do you guys think this market pump without looking back is going to last?",

So it's strong enough reasons for us to see buying pressures in the market for the last 3 days or so.We all know how untrustworthy banks could be couple with the fear from SVB fiasco are very threatening for investors which might leads them to have an alternatives to secure their asset with digital currency without undermining what happened previously with FTX and Terra, I believe they will learn to hold in a self custodian wallet where they could be in control of their assets rather than any other third party. Likely this could be correct or wrong but I also feel the buying pressure within this few days that is to say there's a good chance of bitcoin creating a new ATH before we could gets to next bitcoin halving.",
