The wealth and income gap has increased. There's really no middle class anymore.  According to this report by the the World Inequality Lab,QuoteContemporary income and wealth inequalities are very largeAn average adult individual earns PPP €16,700 (PPP USD23,380) per year in 2021, and the average adult owns €72,900 (USD102,600)1.1 These averages mask wide disparities both between and within countries. The richest 10% of the global population currently takes 52% of global income, whereas the poorest half of the population earns 8.5% of it. On average, an individual from the top 10% of the global income distribution earns €87,200 (USD122,100) per year, whereas an individual from the poorest half of the global income distribution makes €2,800 (USD3,920) per year (Figure 1).Global wealth inequalities are even more pronounced than income inequalities. The poorest half of the global population barely owns any wealth at all, possessing just 2% of the total. In contrast, the richest 10% of the global population own 76% of all wealth. On average, the poorest half of the population owns PPP €2,900 per adult, i.e. USD4,100 and the top 10% own €550,900 (or USD771,300) on average.In the country where I reside the prices of everything are skyrocketing but the income remains the same year to year. Is it still possible that in 2022 Bitcoin can help reduce this wealth and income inequality? Bearing in mind that most people were not early adopters.",

Is it still possible that in 2022 Bitcoin can help reduce this wealth and income inequality? Bearing in mind that most people were not early adopters.It's a hard knock of life that we live in. Inflation everywhere with price of goods steadily on the rise and we don't see workers salary or wages increased. Except for slightly in rare cases but not significantly.Talking about bitcoin reducing wealth inequality that exists between the classes in our society with respect to social stratification. I would say, NO! Bitcoin might play a role in ensuring that individuals with certain skills becomes engaged and paid with BTC as a base currency but, that's in the event that you work or offer a skill in exchange for payment. Same could apply for working with fiat.What we have to realise is, there is an equal opportunity in the crypto field and is basically based on who keys in. Should one party key in while the other doesn't, the individual investor enjoys the benefit it offers. Having both parties to key in, they enjoy as due too.Hence, your ability to offer something, be it goods or skills could do this and not bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is for people of every status.",

Before this time I felt it will take care of that because of the investment opportunities that bitcoin is having but the investment isn't that going straight especially that the price fall without a definite price that it will get down to. Investors don't know if the bear is over or not and for the fear of losing greater amount of their investment, they sell in fear and taking some loses that affect the inequality state already but the rich can afford holding on because of other sources of income and wait for bitcoin bull and get increased profit at ATH. For profiting in bitcoin, you have to have a longtime plan of which the rich can afford but the poor can't easily and this keep widing the inequality gap.",
