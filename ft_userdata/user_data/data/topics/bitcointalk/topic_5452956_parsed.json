I know most of the casinos proposes this kind of \"Responsible Gaming\" things. I mean, wouldn't that be a good alternative to the instant withdrawal when the mempool is full?",

I checked the gambling site again after two days and I saw that the money is still there, but I thought I have withdrawn it. It does not concern and I only just make another withdraw and it was successful. I was happy that I did not choose Arsenal in the coming match which I initially intended to do but I did not. I am not a frequent gambler,Â  just once in a week or two weeks, so this can not happen to me, but it is a good advice.",

I don't want to be that guy that will leave your friends right? but while waiting for them, just play some slots until I started to lost and wanted to get it back, in the end I lost all my winnings and my bankroll. If I just have the patience to just watch them play and keep the money in my pocket, then I still have that winnings.",

While gambling, greediness should be taken away because this is what that happens to most gamblers that win but want to win more and continue to gamble.In reality when there is continuous winning, the gambler continues to gamble out of greed. One out of ten might have the right understanding and take a break out of satisfaction. Whether one is on the winning streak or losing, it is good to take a break. When you take break, it lets the gambler to analyse the gambling activity and move forward.Even if one isn't able to have patience, he/she should have the control over the funds, because we don't know how far the person gonna be lucky or not. Most of the time even the person who have got good self control, losses patience when the bets continuously fails.",

I understand that this is a rhetorical question, but this behavior seems strange to me. Plus, let's say you were able to successfully withdraw funds, then what would stop you from returning everything back and losing after a new unsuccessful session (especially if the mempool was free and transactions were fast)? I think it's not about input/output speed, but about discipline.",

All the casinos sites that I have used to gamble has different deposit options and some have both cryptocurency and fiats deposit options.If we experience similar congestion in the future then just use other deposit option to avoid experiencing similar problem. We can't blame the gambling sites as it wasn't their fault that your deposit wasn't confirmed on time also keep spare gambling money on the site.When you have your gambling funds on the casino, it eliminate waste of time to wait for the miners to confirm your transaction and gives you enough time to bet. Don't keep all your money on the gambling sites since they can shutdown but always have some spare over there.",

You can't change the world, only yourself. Had you reacted a little differently during that situation, and waited instead of pushing for it knowing that you are already aggravated by the inconvenience that the lack of instant withdrawal is giving you, you might have been able to bag your wins. So for that matter, control your emotions and yourself, and no amount of inconvenience will ever shake your confidence and your mental stability. I'd agree with him over the fact that he put up a warning to all people who were once like him, kind of a cautionary tale, but much of this could've been avoided if he only cleared his mind and made the right choice.

The whole gambling setup is often located in a blackbox that you will never be able to analyse or dispute. If you do happen to get lucky short term, then either the natural variance will be lost to the inbuilt house advantage or they will speed up the process, targeting you with a string of losses to return their money out of your account. You should definitely avoid working with casinos that have large delays built in around withdrawals or put too many steps into place to prevent you getting money out. They should be as fast giving you money as they were to receive it.",
