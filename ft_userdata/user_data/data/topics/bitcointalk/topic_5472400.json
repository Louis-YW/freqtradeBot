      "body": "This would make it more convenient for investors who may not know about the technical aspects of buying and storing Bitcoin. By investing in a Bitcoin ETF investors will be able to indirectly participate in the potential price movements of Bitcoin. This will eliminate the need for investors to set up and manage a digital wallet or deal with exchanges or worry about the security of their Bitcoin holdings and also they don't need to give KYC to exchanges. Like big exchanges ask for KYC.",

Do this make any sense?Almost everyone had talked about this ETF and SEC related issues, bitcoin ETF is making the talking about bitcoin here amidst the government agency while bitcoin itself is not the point of discussion, they are only making use of the unique volatility with the bitcoin market price to also incorporate their own shares and and stocks market value, this alone is causing a shift on the market price because bitcoin is getting more rated as everyone look onto the market volatility to determine their state of income for both bitcoin network and other centralized organizations.",

Oh yea, that's true because Bitcoin would have more exposure than it is now. Currently, everyone is just waiting for when will the ETF be approved.

Do this make any sense?Yes, it makes sense for those who are not used to trusting decentralisation and who want to invest millions but do not want to take care of their money because if they will take full responsibility, then how can they blame others and how can they get insurance on their money? They need some centralized authority, which should be approved by the government, and then they will invest huge amounts of money and get a lot of exposure from the features of BTC, but they will lose the real advantage that they could have if they kept their money with them.People just need some trustworthy entity to make a deal, and that's what ETFs are for. It eliminates the decentralisation and anoynmity factor, but indirectly, it would be a benefit for BTC because these ETFs have to buy large amounts of BTC to provide it to their customers.Which means the demand will increase oversupply and the BTC price will shoot up. And it will be a win for us from all sides because we are the real owners of our assets, we don't have to pay huge taxes on those stocks or shares, and we can withdraw, send, or deposit any amount to our wallet anytime.",

      "body": "The concept of spot ETFs is quite intriguing. In straightforward terms, it could be a game-changer, making it much easier for people to delve into the world of Bitcoin. You won't need to fret about the intricacies of storing and purchasing Bitcoin; it all revolves around those ETF shares, which you can trade much like regular stocks.What's in it for us? Well, the major players, the institutional investors, might feel more at home with Bitcoin in a notably convenient manner. This could potentially inject more liquidity into the Bitcoin market, which is invariably a positive sign. Furthermore, it's akin to a badge of approval – having a dedicated ETF for Bitcoin could lend further credibility to this digital asset.However, there are a few potential downsides to ponder. It might attract some speculators who could introduce a tad of turbulence. And, as with anything in the online realm, there's a hint of risk, including the potential for hacking or manipulation.All things considered, the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could streamline the entire Bitcoin experience, enhance liquidity, and provide more credibility to the digital gold. So, yeah, it makes quite a bit of sense!If you have any questions you can contact me via my Discord: https://discord.gg/WyUZV2uP",

I can understand some of them though. You can be a bitcoin loving CEO but getting the company board to vote for bitcoin allocation might take a lot of persuasion. When a big company known for managing billions of dollars stands behind this bitcoin investment it makes things much easier.",

Do this make any sense?You're right about Bitcoin ETFs as they can be an easy way to invest in Bitcoin for those investors who believe that they won't be able to secure their Bitcoin on their own. Although storing Bitcoin on online exchanges isn't really hard and anyone can do that but investors can't trust the centralized as well as decentralized exchanges as the exchanges can go down or maybe hacked by hackers and in the process they may lose their money which they have invested in Bitcoin and stored in those exchanges.BlackRock the top investment company and investors trust it so much that once its Bitcoin ETF gets fully approved then the price of Bitcoin will pump a lot as many new investors will invest Billions of dollars in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and they really won't have to buy and store Bitcoin themselves but will reap the profits if Bitcoin's price grows in value.",

Do this make any sense?As long as it's a net positive effect, we'd take it. Most institutional investors know very little to nothing about how bitcoin works can still participate in the Bitcoin economy. It's just interesting that this is the category that some of the investors with the deepest fall under which is why it is a big deal, not just for them but for the rest of the community. At the very least, it's proof that something big is coming and global adoption is near completion.",

Because those companies use their customer money to invests in many assets and in future, soon we will see them invest in Bitcoin through Bitcoin Spot ETFs in USA.Not your keys, not your coins. Although it's ok if those big companies with big AUM don't mind about it, their customers must know about that risk and consider to buy bitcoin and store it by themselves.Q&A: Not your keys, not your coins",
