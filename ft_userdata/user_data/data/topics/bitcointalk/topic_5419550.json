If not why would a government that has been ruling for 8 years and have been hostile to bitcoin suddenly have a change of hearts.In fact this isn't the first of this initiative. Here is a link to where it is reported that they are partnering with Binance to educate people on blockchain.Two big initiatives to help spread the adoption of bitcoin in a space of two months? After years of banishing it? It's political.

Now this current administration might actually be playing there last card with all this initiatives to win those youths back from the opposition",

It will have little effect on the peoples political opinion about the present government in the country. One thing it proves is that the government can be indecisive and that their former decision on crypto was borne from a standpoint of either ignorance or hate. The radio and other media outlets can be engineered to deliver any information or promises the government wants whether they have intentions to honor them or not. Believe I will believe these, I will like to see a proper list of people who qualified for it and picture evidence.",

Nigeria has her general elections February next year and the government who has been hard on crypto-currency comes up with this it's just to buy I over people.This is exactly what I can relate this news to, this is just political propaganda in the wrong direction, teaching citizens about blockchain technology and crypto payment gateway processor is a great opportunity for the citizens to dive into the blockchain industry as an early adopter even though Nigerians on their own have adopted blockchain, Bitcoin for personal usage.Where the government got it all wrong is where the focus is on Bitcoin Satoshi version BSV which most of us know is not real Bitcoin and was developed by Craig to claim the identity and control of the Bitcoin ecosystem which has not been a successful attempt for him, even though Bitcoin Satoshi version BSV exist on the exchange, it doesn't change the fact that BSV is just a copy cat and is no different from other altcoins like Bitcoin cash.From this screenshot, you can see where that is mentioned, so to me personally, this is not a development that can get my attention since the process is faulty and dead on arrival with the mention of the Bitcoin Satoshi version (BSV)Below the screenshot is the current price of the bitcoin Satoshi version, which has witnessed a lot of manipulations in the past.This is not the first time the Nigeria government through its agencies will misplace their properties in blockchain/ crypto adoption, we can also see similar government policy mistakes when the CBN developed the e-naira that does not run on the blockchain which has led to many Nigerians not being able to onboard the e-naira wallet through their banks.No doubt, blockchain/bitcoin is the fastest were to bank the unbaked but will the government take the right step in the right direction the answer is no for now due to corruption and lack of competence of the personnel in charge of key agencies in Nigeria.",

Moreover, there's a fine difference between 'blockchain solutions' and becoming Bitcoin-friendly.

After that, the SEC announced that it had suspended the recommendations. Since then, CBN has been the only Nigerian regulator that controls the country's cryptocurrency industry. And finally, in the fall of 2022, the government of Nigeria begins negotiations with Binance on creating now favorable conditions for cryptocurrencies, but so far in a separate zone https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-binance-in-early-stage-talks-for-crypto-friendly-economic-zoneSo in six months I would not be surprised that Nigeria will again start banning and blocking everything related to crypto assets.Crypto and sports have been in collaboration for quite some time anyway, so for example Binance has collections of NFT FC Porto players, many famous athletes have approved cryptocurrency projects. It is known that the Dallas Mavericks have launched a cash-back rewards program to encourage fans to buy tickets and equipment using Dogecoin.",

There are other countries who are like this before where they also ban cryptos and then they unban it later on. It is said that their government already realizes the benefits of cryptos, that it can help improve the economy of their country.Now can we stop thinking negatively shall we? Participants are lucky because they can be able to travel in London only for them to understand bitcoin more and to make use of bitcoin as a currency, as stated in the description. We readers can only wish that the same thing can happen to our country soon. I mean not the banning part of course but the traveling part .",
