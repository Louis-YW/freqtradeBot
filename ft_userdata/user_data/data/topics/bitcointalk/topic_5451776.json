      "body": "Bitcoin is one of the most difficult assets to speculate on because of Bitcoin's high volatility, there is no doubt that we can see a 100k Bitcoin price since Bitcoin price is always unpredictable, but then we have to put some things in place that could aid us in coming close to the future realities of bitcoin.First, we must take into consideration of the Bitcoin cycle calculation and charts to know what exactly influences Bitcoin price at that time, the year 2023 has been filled with a lot of positive Bitcoin price attempts and price recovery after the 2022 cryptocurrency market fall., Bitcoin will likely touch somewhere around 50k to 60k this period before 2023 elapse but I don't think we can go anywhere near 100k in this 2023 market cycle even though Bitcoin price cant be predicted.",

Although it is hard to predict or speculate a volatile asset like bitcoin but considering the past cycles it is possible to reach 100k after the 2024 halving.  Just like the past halvings, we can see the price continues to rise before the halving anc following this sequence it is possible to see a significant rise to 100k a year post halving. But not withstanding there are factors mostly economical or governmental policies that drives bitcoin prices and we don’t know what the future holds in regards to this prices. Also has the block reward for miners reduces to 3.125btc, also the amount needed to get mining tools many miners will leave off mining. This could also have is impact on the price. So base on past halving experience 100k is possible but not assured base on future circumstances.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on May 06, 2023, 10:10:42 PMYour speculation is really so high, which is good, and of course, who will not be happy if Bitcoin is able to hit $100k this year? Only those who have the intention to buy more would feel a bit upset about it.This wouldn’t mean much because almost every investor will be expecting a high price, so people that have intentions of buying more will just accumulate some now and sell when the price is high then go back into buying again once the bearish period surfaces again. So I don’t think anyone who knows the trend will be upset about it",

So I don’t think anyone who knows the trend will be upset about itIt may not really matter, but you know, some new investors may also be hoping that the market can drop way more than it is now so they can buy more, but I really wonder why they expect the price to dip more, maybe because they don't know more about Bitcoin volatility. The bitcoin price is supposed to be becoming bullish gradually by now, but it even seems as if the $32k mark might not be crossed this month. Based on the OP's speculation, I don't believe Bitcoin can reach $100k this year, unless the bull run is going to even happen before the halving takes place by 2024.",

History does not represent the future, but without history, there is no future. So there's nothing wrong with people relying on history to predict the future, and it's all conjecture, no one makes any definitive statements. Admittedly, the world is going through a period of so many events, it can turn everything upside down and create a new history. But nothing has happened yet, so we can still expect old history to repeat itself.",

We have the wait for the block halving next year and then we will see how it goes. For me maybe a good $40k'ish price will be good before entering next year.Of course who wouldn't want the price to see 6 digits? But not this year though and as far as $100k in the next bull run, there are still a lot of factors to look at, regulations, FUD, supply and demand, etc. So let's see, the best thing for us to do is just continue to accumulate though. So in case $100k or higher can be achieve next year or 2025, then we will sure make a lot of profits.",

It has no basis in fact or pattern. The most likely scenario, according to bitcoin's past history, which is the only thing we can rely on to get an idea of future behaviour, is that $100,000 will be passed within a couple of years. To say that the price is going to surpass that figure this year by looking at a bitcoin chart is mere lucubration. It is not impossible, but I see no reason to think so.",

Regarding interest rates, I don't think the Fed will continue to raise rates as they have already hit their target of 5%-5.25%. Increasing interest rates further will not tackle inflation but will push the economy into recession faster. What is more frightening if they are maintaining this interest rate for a long time will also cause many consequences as much as continuing to raise interest rates. I think banks will continue to collapse in the near term, and that will make the economy worse. Many people think that's good for bitcoin, but I don't think so, bitcoin is also part of the world economy. People are having financial difficulties, even daily living expenses are a worry, there is no way they are willing to spend to invest.",
