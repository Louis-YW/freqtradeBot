  "content": "I'm recently getting into cryptocurrency. I started trading maybe two months ago. I was surfing YouTube and came across a tutorial on creating your own cryptocurrency tokens. So I decided to create and mint an SPL token.I was mostly annoyed with everyone on twitter saying Doge to the moon. So I went ahead and came with a slogan and that is \"Forget the moon. We're going straight to Uranus\". This is more a joke than anything else. I was going to get them listed on some exchanges then give away and sell a bunch of them. I noticed exchanges want you to have at least $10,000 in your liquidity pool at any time. I don't have much money. I collect partial disability and do gig work. I'm determined to get this thing off the ground though. Decided that I'm going to do a token sale. I think it will be memeworthy and good joke. I'll have the official website and things like that up pretty soon.In your opinion what is the best way to execute a token or altcoin presale?",

Because using a launchpad at lest you can get a guaranteed investment 50% will be sold, but off course depend on the type launchpad itself.Next, \"Marketing\" strategy. Most of project using \"KOLs\" strategy, they can paid influencer or spot investment for influencer with the return they will promoted your project.",

      "body": "You will need a heavy bag of money to get a proper token presale because you will need to invest on marketing such as Kols and shillers to promote your token sale to vast number of investors or list on a launchpad and pay for there fees. Some launchpad is very strict on requirements especially documents that will make your project legit. Base on your token, it's just a meme coin without fundamental so your best chance to list on a launchpad is to pay fees which is very expensive. In general you need huge sum of money to have successful presale.",

Bunch of scam tokens were using this garbage launchpad but remember you shall complete KYC verification for that.  Just to make sure if you need to get people who wanna gamble with your shitty token.  You didn't have much money to fill the liquidity pool and so another choice to make money from there.",

I'm going to giveaway a bunch of tokens and just see what happens. 251 holders at the time of this post. Probably keep this a social token until I have a better idea of the financing. Also gives me a chance to gain some popularity for the project.",

I've seen a lot of coins do really well at first then just tank when they hit the exchanges. I'm not after a pump and dump scheme but something a little more long term. Going to just give them away until I get a few thousand holder at least https://solscan.io/token/BJkKpQ1tE81msuAxguGSmL47KnxXsNjFG9EJE1e2Sixk",
