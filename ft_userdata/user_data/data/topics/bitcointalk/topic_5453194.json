This is what is called the FOMO attitude but with bitcoin the safest  way of holding and earning profit isn’t a short term thing but rather a long term strategy. There are also shirt term options but two months is just so short. If you’re looking at earning profit on bitcoin or cryptocurrency on short term basis I would suggest you look into trading although it is more risky than the holding that is currently frustrating you",

Your thinking is very similar to those who get into $hitcoins.You need patience and a medium to long term outlook. Also a little more educationwill trach you that on a weekly, monthly or multi-monthly Bitcoin doesnt keep going up!There is a market there with traders, investors and speculators who all affectthat market up and down.",

You know it will get higher. But you don't exactly know when and at what price you should buy and get a position. it's okay to be desperate, that's how you feel. What's not okay is if you do something you aren't sure of. Like your idea of buying at any price. In the market, you have to demand your own price.Just a tip. Don't FOMO. There will always be another trade. There are abundant of opportunities in the market every day, every week, and it won't stop.",

It is better to become clear and transparent about yourselves, rather than keeping it secret otherwise, you are ruining your goal and the reason why you are investing in Bitcoin. Well, we can assume what will happen in the market but we should still keep calm and have faith in crypto despite the corrections and slow recovery, we can be there someday that is why we should have to be patient.

Even if the price goes up, there are still plenty of opportunities to buy cheaper.You don't need to panic just because the purchase target has not been reached. Don't push yourself too hard to keep buying if the target hasn't been reached. Wait and see what the market conditions are. Buying early will make you feel dissatisfied when prices continue to fall. It's good to do DCA and prepare capital reserves for each purchase. Buy lower and hold until you reach the top sales target.",

There’s no asset that can perform a continuous pump for a short period of time. You can only see this kind of price behavior when you are using a long time frame and Bitcoin is the perfect example.

Also, I'm not quite aware of July 1st to be an indicator of the market unlike with the last quarter of the year. However those expectations does not mean certainty. The market price will go sideways without any particular hint. Whether to hold or not, depends on the investor; short term or long term. Basically, short term investors are the ones who swings in every price action. Is it best to just hold? If you can endure seeing how price changes from time to time, then you're good with long term holding. Price is somewhat consistent upward if you'd use yearly timefrme.",
