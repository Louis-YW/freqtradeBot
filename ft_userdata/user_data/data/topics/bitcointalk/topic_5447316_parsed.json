I guess you get what you pay for (access to crypto without KYC). I've used Sideshift.ai sometime ago, until they've started restricting access to US-based customers. I don't get why they're doing this when the exchange doesn't comply with KYC/AML laws. Using VPN would be a workaround, but not all people are tech-savvy you know.There's an exchange called \"AtomicDEX\" which is decentralized and powered by \"atomic swaps\" technology. You can trade from one crypto to another in a breeze without a middleman. If it had options to buy/sell crypto using Fiat without the need for KYC, I'd be sold already.

We need as much non-KYC exchanges as we can, to help expand crypto's potential. After all, crypto is a \"Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash\" system without middleman (especially Bitcoin). I'm personally a fan of Uniswap and PancakeSwap, due to their decentralized and censorship-resistant nature. You can trade tokens in a breeze with low fees and fast processing times (subject to current network conditions) all without KYC. The best part is that Uniswap is hosted on IPFS, so if governments try to shut down its centralized domain, you can easily access it in an \"P2P manner\". Who knows if DEXs are poised to take over CEXs in the future?",

Indeed, any exchange platform that does not require the customer to complete KYC and submit his documents can request that at any time. If they discover suspicious activity in the customer’s account or discover that this customer violates their policy in terms of money laundering, the use of mixers, etc., then the money of this customer will be frozen Immediately and forcing him to pass KYC and verify the source of funds and other procedures. If a person wants to deposit his money on an exchange platform without KYC, he must bear in mind that he may wake up and find that this condition has changed for some reason, and he will be forced to submit his documents at the end, or his deposits will be in their possession.",

This shows us crypto/Blockchain tech is far from dead, despite the fact that governments and mainstream media are spreading so much negativism about it. We need as much non-KYC exchanges as possible to help bring true financial freedom to the unbanked. The new \"Better Call Raul\" exchange reminds me of the popular TV show called \"Better Call Saul\". It only has three trading pairs (ETH, XMR, BTC), but it could've been worse. I hope they add other coins in the long run, to bring a little more convenience to hardcore crypto users like me. Still, there are no ways to buy/sell crypto without KYC in a truly-decentralized manner, so my options are limited. Better Call Raul is also centralized like the rest of the other instant exchanges available right now. This makes it easy for governments to shut them down whenever they want to. Something like Uniswap but that'll give you the ability to swap any cryptocurrency, would definitely do the trick. I think what comes close to that is BlockDX and atomicDEX. At least, it's a good start. Just my opinion",
