      "body": "Firstly let me start by saying this; the Blockchain doesn't make use of your conventional password. To access a Bitcoin wallet you need a seed phrase or private key passwords you come across are just additional modes of security by the app developers especially to encrypt your seed phrase.As for both sites they are actually wallet generators which claim to use custom words to generate a wallet address. Now I don't trust these sites but the fact is if you can't generate them offline it's not safe.",

      "body": "All I can see are compromised wallets, which could be the ones in which the users have made mistakes in one way or another for them to gain access to their private key, and when such wallets have been drained, they can be publicised. Passkey and phrase finders: you need to give them something that could be used to generate and fine your private key and phrase. They can't just get your private key out of nowhere unless the wallet used in generating those phrases or private keys has an inbuilt database where they store the data in the background, which hackers can access and gain access to.",

Sorry, I just checked it and it is about seed phrases which I do not think you can ever recover. The reason is that most Bitcoin wallets allow their users to always create a backup of their passphrase. If you have not then you cannot access your coins as that is the key to accessing your wallet. I do not want to be rude to you but your past post suggests that you are not the owner of the wallet that you have. As per me keep hunting the passphrase as you won't be able to find it for sure.",

If you want to generate wallet, use HD wallet like Electrum or Sparrow.Quote from: temeteron10 on February 23, 2024, 01:31:38 PMNo, it's a word that I chose, a lyric, but how do I withdraw the money from another wallet?You can use https://www.bitaddress.org/bitaddress.org offline. For offline usage: https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org/archive/v3.3.0.zipAfter you access the it, click on brain wallet and paste your password to get your private key and see your address. The private key starts from 5, K or L.After you get the 5 prifix private key and not matching your address, try to check ✔️ compressed and click on 'view' again to get the K or L private key and see if your address is correct with the address it generates you.Download Electrum from https://electrum.org/. After you setup electrum, click on import bitcoin addresses or private keys and paste the private key there. Let the wallet synchronize with the blockchain and check your balance.You can proceed to that thread and check on many more vital information's concerning brainwallet, know this that as long as you have your private keys with you to the wallet, you're safe to an extent, just hear about what other members have to offer from the above thread link as quoted.",

Copy your original private key to your main wallet, change a few words and numbers from the same private key, use it to import into a wallet, and you will see you just got yourself a new private key with an empty wallet.  A private key can be generated from anywhere and will be valid, provided the number-world combination is correct, but it will always lead you to an empty wallet.  What they are doing, in my opinion, is just a wallet gesture.",

For example, you can use the words \"hello\", \"bitcoin\", \"yes\" and so on to generate a private key. There have been people who have used simple and guessable words as their passphrase and due to obvious reason, those wallets are not secure.",

It's shocking knowing that there are millions of brainwalletsI am having a hard time understanding what you are saying, but you cannot access somebody's private keys in this way, why are you even concerned about getting someone's private keys, if you want a wallet yourself, generate your own wallet and keys. Your topic is confusing, but somehow it sounds like you want to buy fake wallet files, take note that if you do so you'll be scammed and lose your money, because you will never be able to open the wallet.",

It's shocking knowing that there are millions of brainwalletsIt's technically slim possible to guess or brute-force a private key or phrase, but the possibility of doing this is very small. Private keys and phrases are generated using very hard algorithms, and the number of possible combinations is large. For example, a private key for a Bitcoin wallet is 256 bits long, if I guess correctly, there should be 2^256 possible combinations that make up one wallet. Even with a powerful computer, it would take many lifetimes to guess the correct combination. In conclusion, the possibility of someone else guessing your wallet is very slim, so going into that scenario will end up wasting your time. If you are afraid someone will guess your private key, you should remove that from your mind and focus mainly on protecting your wallet from outsiders who will gain access to it. Using computer power to search it out is nearly impossible.",
