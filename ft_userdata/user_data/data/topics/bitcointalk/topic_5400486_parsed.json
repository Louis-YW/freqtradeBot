I think OP is too risky to deal with because in this forum or even in telegram still a people you deal with is anonymous and how should we now that they are legit or scammers .",

There is no reason to trust a newbie.I agree. This guy is trying to rip us off. Apart from the concerns expressed in the previous comments, that he has no reputation on the forum or that he just registered today, I think one thing: if this guy is confident in his betting system and makes money, I don't know why he wants to bet with other people's money. The time a person has is limited, and if you bet with other people's money you are going to win less than if you bet with your own. If your answer is that you don't have enough money or something like that, you have managed your bankroll disastrously, because to offer that service you should have been betting for years, and in that time a winner, reinvesting the winnings, can make a lot of money.",

As we know if there is no evidence/proof that proves OP has the potential of making money. This will probably be a scam and no one will waste their time if they did not have a benefit.
