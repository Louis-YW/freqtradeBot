This is a lot, although I browsed some news.I saw some bots making a summary of the most important news on one page with a link to each news. This is how it is easier to read the summary, and if you want to read the entire news, you click on the link.I don't know if you can do that or if it takes a lot of work.",

This is a lot, although I browsed some news.Yes. I agree, the user experience can be better, and I think one solution would be to not send more than one article per subject.Quote from: hugeblack on March 17, 2023, 06:19:38 AMIs there an option to customize the type of news you are looking for, such as Bitcoin or altcoins, and its sources (add new,) or is it just a bot-powered channel?I do not use Telegram groups, so I do not have knowledge of how they work, but if you can customize the channels, I will download/try it.At the moment, it's just a bot-powered channel so there's no way to customize anything, everyone is getting the same news. The first suggestion should be achievable, as most of these sites/articles have tags. Allowing users to add new sources, however, may be difficult to achieve especially if I want to summarize their articles.",

There are a lot of news telegram channels. But the difference is that most of the Telegram channels for news are links chosen by the channel owner who publishes them either by himself or with the help of moderators, while this channel transmits news directly from its source on global news sites and the bot creator is a member known for his integrity as a Bitcointalk moderator.Personally, I would have preferred to visit the news sources myself, but this bot saves me a lot of time, and I have begun to get used to the frequency of notifications, as I receive dozens daily. I've been using the news bot for days, and I encourage everyone to try it.It would be great if Omega continues to work on further developing its features.",

If you're referring to communicating with telegram API, then I'm using telegram-bot-python.As for the language filter, then could you please elaborate? If you want to receive news in certain languages, then that's obviously doable however, the sites I'm currently watching do not support languages other than English (or at least most of them don't). It would help if you could mention a few reputable sites you know, so that I can add them.",

But I am not interested in all crypto news except what's happening regarding Bitcoin. Indeed I don't want to hear what Justin sun is doing with his bunch of altcoins. I am not sure how many websites news your bot is covering right now and how reliable they are since I didn't try your bot yet. Keep the number significantly fewer with some reputed website news; all the news should be trustworthy. If you add too many websites, people will see the same news repeatedly from different websites, which we don't want.",
