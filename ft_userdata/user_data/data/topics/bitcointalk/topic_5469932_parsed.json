There are alternatives to trading view but do not offer a full package of services like TVTechnical analysis is mostly dependent of one's trading style. What could work for me may not work for you, so the best thing is first discovering what kind of trading strategy you want to practice, How much profit are you will to take per trade, what time frames will you use, What's your risk reward ratio etcLooking for trading \"signals\" is useless if you don't know your strategy.",

All that you need in trading can be found here so it's not necessary to find alternative platform other than this. I have tried different platform before but I immediately stopped using it and I continued using tradingview. And yes, anyone can share their analysis from tradingview but I just want to advice you that don't rely your trades from them especially if they can't provide PnL. Depending your trades from others won't make you profitable for a long time since we don't know how long the lead trader will stay for us. I recommend to join mentorship program then back test and enhanced the strategy that you learned from them. You can also try paper trading and if you can profit and a good win rate in a month, then you can also make it in live trading.",

For beginners, things like this will actually make you confused. With functions and uses that are not understood it will only waste time and money. Instead of wasting time doing analysis with complicated tools and looking at other people's analysis which is not necessarily correct, buy the dip-hold is the right choice to make a profit (of course this will be very effective on BTC, if it's about shitcoin I have no comment because I have experienced a scam in shitcoins)",

It will be very different from live trading which directly uses money.As a trading experiment, it is okay to use demo trading, but after that, it is better to immediately practice to get the euphoria of trading directly and this will train the emotions and psychology of trading.Use minimal funds to overcome losses so as not to be too much.",
