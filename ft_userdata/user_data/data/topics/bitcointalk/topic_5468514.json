      "body": "To add to Charles-Tim's reply: it's also a good idear to look at the \"Tx\" column inside electrum and use an address with Tx count 0 (= addresses that were never funded).This way, you increase your privacy level... If you re-use your address, it decreases your privacy... Also, once you spend funds from an address, you expose your public key. This is not a big issue, but there have been arguments in the past about a very tiny decrease in security funding an address that was already spent from and thus has it's public key exposed... The bottom line is that you shouldn't worry about this to much, since those discussions were merely theoretical... But still, don't re-use addresses for privacy reasons",

Do note that the fee you pay is denominated in sat per vbyte of transaction data. A transaction's size depends on the amount of inputs you use and the amount of outputs you create, so the bottom line is that the more unspent outputs you combine in a single transaction, the bigger it will be, the bigger your transaction fee will have to be (but re-using the same address wouldn't have changed this fact, since receiving funds 3 times on the same address will also result in your wallet seeing 3 unspent outputs it's allow to spend).TL;DR; you don't have to create 3 transactions to spend your 3 unspent outputs, as long as the addresses you received funds on were generated by the same wallet (it's usually even possible to combine unspent outputs funding addresses that were not generated by the same wallet, but this requires quite a bit of expertise)",

Usually, you can just import the 3 private keys into one wallet and the wallet should take care of the rest... Offcourse, this is the theory, in reality things sometimes go sideways.Do be carefull when exporting and importing private keys! make sure you do spend some attention to opsec (best only to handle private keys on an offline machine)EDIT: just on a sidenote, when doing this, i usually use electrum... I just create a new wallet with the wizard, chose \"import bitcoin addresses or private keys\", then you get a screen to paste your private key(s). Do click the \"info\" button, since there's a trick to import (for example) (nested) segwit and this is discussed in the \"info\" menu...",

Anyone who reuses a single address is at risk for the identification of all their transactions and potentially compromise their privacy, especially if the address is associated with your identity through other means. If you use different addresses for each transaction it makes it harder for observers to connect all your addresses and transactions to you.Any who is interested in their privacy with Bitcoin should use wallets that support generating new addresses like Electrum, Blue wallet for each transaction because they have robust privacy features to prevent address tainting.",

If you want to aggregate all the utxo's in the different addresses, then create tx's sending them to one wallet or address, and back up the seed phrase to the wallet.To op, i don't know if all these addresses are yours, but if they are and you care about privacy, don't expose all of your addresses in this way next time, it wasn't even necessary as you could have asked the question without the image.",

The difference is it will transfer all bitcoin on the addresses related to those private keys to one of the addresses on that wallet in one transaction and as you know will increase the transaction fee. You can go to wallet option then private and click on sweep. You will have to enter the keys whose addresses needs to be swept into those space one by one with each private key on a single line. Just as macaccino pointed out click on ‘info’ to prepend the keys with different address formats.",
