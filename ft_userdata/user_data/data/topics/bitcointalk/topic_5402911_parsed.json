  "content": "Hello everyone!I don't know if I am the only one who experienced this today, but I just noticed that my user stats were disabled for show stats and show posts (except for show threads which still works fine for me). While I am trying to check the profiles of others and their stats, they're seem to be fine. Is there something wrong in my part on why my user stats were disabled? I can't keep track of posts that I have contributed from the past until now.Can anyone please enlighten me on this issue please? Thanks in advance.",

They were disabled at some point at the end of 2018 (see  User stats are disabled? or unable to understand the stats), due to a DDoS attack, that led to @theymos disabling them.Why not use https://bpip.org/ to check for the stats you need.",

There are lots of websites like ninjastic space and bpip that can show every user statistics, with much better look and more info is shown than the default forum users' statistics.",
