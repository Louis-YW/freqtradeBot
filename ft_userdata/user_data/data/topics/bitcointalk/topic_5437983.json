  "content": "On the previous thread, How to thrive with low income in a humble area, we have talked mainly about saving strategies in order to accumulate funds at the end of the month for investment purposes. However, to save money is only the first step towards prosperity.It was pointed out income must be raised and built, since many are unemployed in such areas, therefore they can't save anything.So, let's think together what people can do to build new sources of income, without the need of high educational backgrounds:Work with food manufacture: food is essential in every human beings' lives. You can buy raw materials, cook it and sell more expensive. Even though people don't have money to spare, they can't stop eating and many aren't willing to cook by themselves, so they do the sacrifice of spending on food.Check what people are willing to buy for daily meals, and then if you can provide it to them.You don't have to sell it expensive, anyway, so you will have more customers in a frequent basis. Sales can be done from door to door on the neighborhood or the entire city. Going to other cities with a large stock is also an idea, but fuel/tickets' costs must be taken into consideration.Personal example: I bought manioc direct from the farmer producer. Washed it, peeled, cut, pre-cooked and freezed in packages of 0,5kg. Since meat is more expensive, people tend to prefer the manioc to replace it, due to low costs. So it's easy to sell.Resell goods (also food): you can buy goods and even food cheaper and resell it from door to door with a profit margin for yourself. It's possible to import goods or buy from your country to resell. In my opinion this method is already saturated, because there are many importers, but with food it works better, if you have a quality, tasty product and can acquire it for cheap price.Personal example: bought pieces of cheese (0,5kg) directly from producer to resell and put a competitive price compared to supermarkets' ones.Develop a good relationship with the neighborhood and offer your handyman services: there might be earnings' opportunities where you least expect. If you have contact with people around and tell them you can execute tasks for extra income, they will call you at some point, especially elders who have more limitations. It can be to make a delivery, paint a room/wall, cleaning or maintenance services and so on...These are just few examples, but there are more ways to build an income in your area. If you don't have an initial investment, which is required for the first two examples above, you can try asking the seller for a payment period.Images created using Midjourney AI, see more at: Bitcoin AI Generated Images",

And this product must be unique or very cheap, which again makes it meaningless to spend on it.Yes, it has to be in high demand and be cheap, so you profit in the quantity sold to different people. I highlighted food, because it's in constant demand, so you can come back to the same person to sell again every few days or once in a week.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on February 04, 2023, 06:49:20 AMThe same with the scheme: buy low, sell high.

That is nothing impossible or from another world. Batches can be bought in small amounts, if there is little money available.",

In the humble area, say Wyoming you can just be a prepper who can plant veggies on a 300 sqm lot and catch fish in the lake. You will survive a lifetime with these skills while you will experience hardships even if you earn $50 a week in the city.",

If you're poor and live in a poor country, if you want to change your life, you should work as a freelancer where your clients are from developed countries or you're move to the developed countries. Freelancing is a very good option when it comes to surviving in developing nations because when one receives payment in dollars it became huge when it is converted to the local currency. Some people in my country are surviving through these freelancing jobs. But sometimes some of them require some level of education or skills which many people lack. For those that are not literate learning a vocational or technical skill might be handy. Also going into subsistent farming with low capital might assist financially. But the challenge in my locality is that most people want to get rich quickly, hence they are not willing to learn a skill. They prefer to engage in illegal activities that will give them quick money.",

So no matter what you chose, you will have to invest some time and effort.Having said that, I've seen a lot of people from 3rd world countries working as Telegram/Discord admins so that seems like another option to earn extra income as it doesn't require any extra investment and its something that can be done on mobile phone. Big downside of almost every crypto related job (unless you are Solidity dev or something along those lines) is that it relies heavily on state of the market so in bear it might be much harder to find work.",
