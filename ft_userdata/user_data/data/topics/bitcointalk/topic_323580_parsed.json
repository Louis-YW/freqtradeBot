He also says if Hanneche manages to raise more than 15 BTC, he will carry a bitcoin flag with him, if one can be made before his departure from South Africa on November 5th.Thorkil Værge first mentioned the South Pole expediton here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=317249While penning this post, I just so happened to have https://blockchain.info/address/1Gt1anYr6gEuiNgacFouhy4RUNQFH3YY9Y opened on another tab, and people ARE currently donating.Please note in the last quote above that there's a request for a Bitcoin flag. It would be totally amazing if we could pull this outta our ass.~TMIBITW",

If that's the case, then we're ~$1K USD short, but seriously don't see a problem with that goal being reached.Having a flag shipped in time is probably not too much of an issue if only WE HAVE A BITCOIN FLAG.

Regular mail service to camps is available this time of the year, so there would be no problem with having a flag awaiting his arrival.I'm sure he mapped out the expedition so that he wouldn't be carrying ALL his supplies from the get-go, stopping at at least one base camp in route. Sword Smith would have to verify if, or if not, that's the case.~TMIBITW",
