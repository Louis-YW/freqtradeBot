      "body": "No miners don't drop when price drops. What happens is that miners try to wait a little longer before confirming transactions with the simple  logic that others trying to initiate or broadcast a transaction will tend to increase their fees so that their transactions will be confirmed faster instead of waiting in the MEMPOOL , in addition to them competing for transactions with higher fees . this is the reason  why nodes have a minimal purge fee. Mining requires a lot of hash rate especially if you are going to be confirming transactions. The hash power in turn also invites high electricity costs and for miners to be in profit, they would prefer higher fees.Infact it's important to know that the hash power required to confirm transactions is quite high therefore solo miners rarely confirm transactions rather they depend on Proof of work rewards for finding valid hashes.If miners increase and decrease when fee drops then during halving when fees were high there would have been a drastic increase in number of miners.",

This will discourage many miners to continue mining. But if that the price of bitcoin is increasing, this will encourage miners. Despite this is what that can happens in life, there are some exceptional time like 2022 when bitcoin price significantly reduced continuously but bitcoin mining hash rate increased continuously at the time.",

So, they don't wait and they always try to mine more blocks. If mining is not profitable for miners, they would stop mining, not that they would wait some time just to increase the fee. Bitcoin price has decreased by more than 10% in the last week. Did the fees increase? No. Miners are now confirming transactions paying around 3 sat/vbyte as fee.",

With same blockchain difficulty, if network hash rate drops, block times will increase and if with same blockchain difficulty, you have bigger network hashrate, block times will become shorter.Price drops can or can not be enough to force Bitcoin miners to leave Mining industry. There tough time when market crashes and stays in low price range for a long time, that cause significant temporary losses on weak bitcoin miners. They will have to leave, turn off their ASICs or even sale off their ASICs too.You can see times when Bitcoin miner capitulation happens in the past.https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/hash-ribbons/",

With that in mind, the miners have gone through so many cycles within the market and are not bothered with the natural cycle. But not all miners will be profitable or all will survive, miners will also compete and be eliminated like investors. Bitcoin mining is a business, so it will also be affected by many different factors, and some people will profit but others will also lose. So I think bitcoin price decline and prolongation is sometimes one of the reasons why some miners give up.Perhaps for organizations and mining companies, the decrease in bitcoin price is probably not a big problem for them because they have abundant budgets and capital resources as well as better plans. But for small organizations or individual mining farms, they will face more difficulties if the price of BTC falls seriously over the long term.",

But if the situation worsens, any person who is in business would give, knowing they were losing.Upon seeing the current situation, I don't think it was enough for them to stop. These miners have been in business for many years and have already adjusted to the volatile situation of the market. It is already in their minds that not always the price is high; sometimes it drops, which causes some profit decline. And I already know what the best thing to do is—not to give up.",

The block time can always be more or less than 10 minutes, regardless of whether the network hash rate has increased or decreased.If the total network hash rate increases, the average block time would be less than 10 minutes until the difficulty is adjusted, but we can still have many blocks mined in less than 10 minutes and even in few seconds.",

      "body": "Great question on how Bitcoin's price affects miners. Thinking less miners as the price declines is a common error, particularly in cases of a halving when rewards are half-cut. But folks, its not that straightforward. Historically, even with lower prices, the hashrate can actually go up.Miners are clever. Tough times change with the seasons. They identify ways to save money, use less energy, or even update to new machinery. Therefore, even if some less effective miners may quit, the stronger ones carry on mining and typically result in an even higher hash rate overall.This tells us something really important about Bitcoin and blockchain: its built to last. Its meant to get through difficult circumstances and emerge even more robust on the other side. That is the kind of system we need, folks; one that can flourish and adjust regardless of what the market presents.",

Blocks being mined more difficult doesn't mean they take more than 10 minutes to be mined.First of all note that the increase in difficulty is due to the increase in the total hash power and with increase in the total hash power, the average block time should decrease (not increase).Second, we have difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks to maintain the average block time of 10 minutes. It's possible that a block is mined in less than a few seconds and it's also possible that a block takes more than an hour to be mined, but the average block time is always (approximately) 10 minutes.",

Blocks being mined more difficult doesn't mean they take more than 10 minutes to be mined.Blocks can be found shortly one after another within several seconds, or fter less or more than 10 minutes - the average block time.With higher network difficulty, Bitcoin miners have to invest more to get enough powerful mining hashrate to compete with other miners from other mining pools to find block. In a simple way, same block time in 2024 and in 2017 does not mean same hash rate used to mine one block. Cost invests for mining in 2024 is higher than cost in 2017 or many years ago with smaller hash rate on the network and lower difficulty.",

If after the 2016 blocks the average mining time is lower than 10 minutes the difficulty target is adjusted to be higher than the existing one and if after the 2016 blocks mined the average time is higher than 10 minutes then the difficulty target is reduced to fit into this 10 minutes average limit. This is the reason why you see the total 210000 blocks needed for an halving to occur averagely falls into 4 years apart.",

That means blocks are found more slowly on average, so average block times are longer. When the difficulty is adjusted (every 2016 blocks), the average block time moves back to 10 minutes.However, the mining business is not that simple, so I doubt there is any real correlation between price changes and the block times in the short term.OTOH, the average block time is correlated with the change in price in the long term because the average block time used in the difficulty measurement lags the current average block time. This explains why times between halvings have been significantly shorter than the expected 4 years.",

I think amongst everyone in the crypto industry, the only demographic that never really at the very least is vocal about leaving their base is the mining sector. Like sure, there's going to be a couple of detractors here and there, this is a business venture after all and not everyone's going to weather the pressures of the market all the time, but relatively speaking, most of the people who have started mining as early as GPU mining was a thing still stuck around and remained operational even now. Might just be the case where these people's going to be the last to stand before 2140 comes around and the last bitcoin block gets mined lol. And even then I'm pretty sure they'll serve as validators of transactions, with that kind of security there's no reason why you'll have to leave your post as a miner.",
