I wouldn't state that Bitcoin has lost its identity because it's still decentralization But with its scalabilty and attractiveness as a store of value Many option to hold it while making Fiat for their everyday transactions This doesn't mean Bitcoin isn't used as a means of Payment. I pity who holds Dollar as an asset.",

Lots of different people find value in btc and they use it differently. We can’t stop people from trading bitcoin like it is another stock.

Just as a currency alone, less or few people would have been a part of this journey, what has successfully moved a lot of people towards adopting Bitcoin is due to its ability to give profits when controlled like an asset. With the recent knowledge and advancement, we can see different institutions beginning to accept Bitcoin as a standard payment option, this means the ideology about issuing as a currency is also advancing, El Salvador already adopted as a legal tender, now the US are attempting a bill as a reserve fund, everything surrounding Bitcoin benefits is showing signs of improvement and more adoption is possible as time continues.",

We had a KYC-free service years ago and now almost every bitcoin-related business asks their users to submit KYC documents. Years ago we could mine Bitcoin at home but today it's a commercial business and only big mining companies can mine it.Bitcoin mixers were legal and now you are a criminal if you use them.Decentralized Exchanges are also getting banned.What's the next step?This is why I think that Bitcoin is losing its identity.",

For many it's more of an asset, though, and it makes sense, considering how much Bitcoin is growing in value over time. So yes, the two aren't mutually exclusive.",

Bitcoin was always an asset and a digital currency, and it will always remain as an asset and also a digital currency. It depends on the mindset of the ones who buy it, if they buy it for holding then it's an asset for them, but if they buy it to purchase goods with it then it works as a way of payments for them.",

I'd never know if anyone here has adopted bitcoin as a primary currency in their daily lives, but I think it's unlikely there is. This adoption depends on local regulations, so use cases are hampered by this, especially if the government has not legalized it.Bitcoin does not lose its identity as a currency, even if you cannot use it as currency in your country. Until now I have not been able to use bitcoin as a currency or means of payment in my country, this is because regulations in my country have not legalized bitcoin as a legal means of payment. While in many other countries, bitcoin has been used as a means of payment and I really don't agree when someone says bitcoin is losing its identity.",

Isn't it kind of stupid to think like that?There will be a market volatility, we will never make such comments because Bitcoin is a permanent coin, it is kind of stupid to make different comments about it.

In my country, you might not be allowed to transfer more than a certain amount per day. There are some businessmen who use Bitcoin to pay their business partners. While some individuals see it as the best means to carry out international business transactions.

That doesn’t limit it to certain functions based on where it’s most frequently used.Same applies here with Bitcoin,We must come to terms with the fact that, it’s an evolving commodity and means to finance that is still trying to attain mainstream use and its limited supply provides investors with opportunity to make the most of it while they can, hence the idea of hodling.",
