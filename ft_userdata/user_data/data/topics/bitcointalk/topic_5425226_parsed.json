Mining a little of each, to be better positioned for an eventual climb in the future.",

Some of the preliminary pledges depend on the shipping date. For example, the “Early adopter” pledge costs ~€1,499.00 and it gets you 1x ARMedOne board shipping around July 2023. The “Kickstarter edition” pledge costs ~€1,699.00; the pledge includes 1x board, but it ships around August 2023. The third batch will cost ~€1,825.00 and it will ship around September 2023. The retail price is expected to be ~€1,999.00 after the campaign ends. https://linuxgizmos.com/armedone-cluster-board-supports-up-to-28x-popular-computer-modules/And what should the miner do for the next 7-8 months?

      "body": "the price may drop based on demand. To reach a much lower prices we have to reach a stretch goal. If we reach that we plan to add modules (options) for the same price. The Bord features some stuff the 35$ board wouldn’t do.For example you can Hotplug modules which means you can scale and upgrade / swap modules at any time.Also the board features 3Gbps internally between nodes which is more than others do.In order to cut down future module prices by removing the need to have internal Flash storage the Bord has microSD for each module slot.So in the next step (again a stretch-goal) we can provide our own Core-Modules which are more cost effective as there is no need for internal storage. About the delivery:The Baords will be produced and shipped in waves.(early birds first) It’s a sort of reserve time we planned if the demand is exceeding our expectations. If it goes over the top we may let produce them also in Asia. Right now it is made in Germany. We keep you updated. You may also like to join the discord to stay updated.About cpu Mining you can also check out XBTX which offers on chain tokenization (assets) similar to Ravencoin but with the Verium AlgorithmOverall the Board is just the base for the modules we plan. All we need is Ram and CPU so why not putting 2 or 4 cpus on one module ? Also we provide customs distributions and with quartex also a cloud os running on top of the Nodes which makes it more like a user friendly Desktop like experience utilizing the fact that you have a cluster of heterogeneous hardware.For miners it is a breeze to be able to swap modules on the fly against new fresh hardware. Just keep an eye 👁 out we keep you updated. Next week we show the production line Video / photos and you can see us as well.Edit:Excursion: https://quartexpascal.wordpress.com/project/introduction-to-quartex-media-desktop/If you know NAS desktops interfaces, you get the point about Quartex",

      "body": "Ok I can try to tell you how we plan to use it:We use Custom clusters of Odroid N2+ and VIM‘s for mining but also as root servers for others including accessible remote desktops.Since the SBC‘s (choosen for efficiency reasons) require a lot wiring we wanted to go a step further and optimize all that by getting a carrier for eternity.We made it to last generations of modules yet to come. We put them into Server cases and ordinary racks and can than swap and scale on demand during runtime. For mining we want to provide own custom modules.Some algo‘s work better on some ARM systems than anything amd or Intel offers.Being able to create and use excactly what matches the best (invest and efficiency) is great. Also it is nice if this thing acts like a server and can be easely controlled without much effort.Hosters and hashrate providers get a standardized setup (good for employees- and saves time every time you have to scale or to adapt). Maybe you also like to see FPGA or GPU modules.What we are also going to do is to offer custom cases (again a stretchgoal).Today after first coffee I had the idea to create a super duper early bird which includes an odroid N2+ based System as waiting time filler (can be send instant )We believe that cpu Mining is the most Democratic way of mining and would like to mix this with the fact that you get a edge computing cluster acting as your new way a Mac Pro should be like. Modular heterogenous mix of modules . Specific ones for specific tasks. This way your computer (therefore E-ATX standard) will be your own serverfarm at your fingertips. Choose server style cases, Tower or cubes and or custom cases similar to asics for extreme Temperatur regulations.Interesting feature is also that you can connect those carriers to each other and build Sandwiches (custom case) whiny requiring wires and psu only once.",

      "body": "Hmm interesting that you don't find it democratic : )I think the opossite: by offering a platform which is open to all kind of modules we provide a standard. This standard makes it less exensive as soon people start adopting.The prices we show is based on 100 only. So expect price cuts during the campaign -> we can't change prices but add stretch goals. So instead of everyone is cooking his own soup, it becomes an adaptable solution and home of new modules based on new tech. Also to be fair you have to count in the cost reductions for \"workhours\" and \"peripherals\" as you need only 1/28th of cables, psu's (even more as you can connect boards to each other), Cables, etc. Work reduction means:If you need to update to a new CPU-Core (ARM, x64, Fpga, Risc-V, etc) you can do that during runtime. No need to power off anything. No work to cut off cables, unpluf PSU's, swap psu's, add cables again, mount the board and so on...It is as easy and quick as adding a RAM module on a mainboard. CLICKSo if you think about Mining Farms and managing them, you will find it very cost effictive to be able to scale and upgrade them to new Technology in 1/28th of the time or even less compared to Servers / Rigs or SBC's. You are faster mining again, you have quicker access to new tech.Also logistic is much easier as the new \"Hardware\" is tiny as a SO-DIMM RAM Module. Much better than new Fullsize MAinbaords all the time and new CPU's and new RAM and whatever is required to make it run.. this is like comparing sending a RAM module via Post vs an Elephant by foot. So the shipping costs a Farm saves when upgrading to a new GEN of CPU's should be convincing enough.   Also the last years were showing a tendency to centralization of Blockchains. By having physical 28 servers (more if you use virtualization) inside a box you can help to decentralize multiple chains being them PoW or PoS(Masternode) based. So as enthusiast you can be more democractic at lower cost. If we reach the Target, we may also reach Stretch-goals and we can create own Core-Modules.If we make it, you can stay in touch via discord and the community which hopefully is born then, can build own modules. If there is enough demand, we built it on request. I think it's democratic : ) at least a good foundation for a democracy.There is also Open-Risc and Risc-V whch allows to design own opensource chips.",
