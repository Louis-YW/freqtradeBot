At the time of writing, number of total victims is 81,182 and total amount of stolen money is $35,978,485 so it's not a tiny problem.It started this year and has been a quickly growing scam industry. Majority of stolen assets have been from ETH chainData from Scamsniffer - DuneThis service provides users with a code that enables them to steal crypto, and service providers take 20% of the stolen loot.Morals aside, i admit giving a free updated scamming software is an ingenious business model for criminals, if you don't count the fact it's highly immoral and evil.You might have seen scammers (newb users) using this even in bitcointalk, linking fake websites that looks like legit known sites. Like paypal, exchanges, or airdrops etc. And those pages are offering to link your metamask, or asking login credentials or even a seed phrases. And moment you give any of them you'll obviously get your money stolen.So, let's talk. Where do you stand on this? Are you tempted to use this highly illegal service to scam people? Do you have high enough morals not to? Or would you use if you knew you didn't get caught?Source article is from earlier this year when only 16% of current amount were stolen: https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/5-9-million-stolen-by-scam-as-a-service-provider-called-inferno-drainer/",
