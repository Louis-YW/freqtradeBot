What of the average taxi driver wey dey try to ends meet? If Tinubu really get the hearts of Nigerians at heart, not just the elite, him and his government suppose put things in place to absorb some of the side effects wey their new policies get on the average household. Other expenses already dey for vehicle and them wan add more. No clarity on where all the money dey go and how them go use the revenue made from offsetting these taxes, subsidies, etc.",

Na so we dey hear o. From change mantra we don enter hope mantra. The policies this new government come with just dey bubble the country. I like the fact say we dey see am very clear but we no really know were the wind dey blow go but I believe say for sure say Naija go better. So far, from the appointments we don see, person fit  tell say Mr. President know wetin him dey do and him dey touch every parastatals and agencies together with the security apparatus of the country. Boarders don open for free flow of goods from the nearby countries dem wey dey  share boarders with Naija. Lastly, Mr. President don possibly see those loop holes wey dem dey use dey embezzzle funds from their so called government organizational/professional bodies and him don tell dem say from 1st of January come 2024 all of them no go recieve funds from federal government again make dem go generate funds for themselves. This one go make sense say as Mr. President dey do all these things, things g better for civil servants unto say salary increment go dey and their welfare go dey properly taken care.",

The 1000naira tax on motorists is uncalled for, there are so many things happening at the same time, first it was removal of fuel subsidy, then it was increase in electricity tariffs and as if that’s not enough you want the people to pay more tax. The only thing that has progressed in this administration is the salary of the presidency. Only a wicked government can do this.",

Every sector of the economy are trying very well to implement new policies, as if to say the hardship of subsidy removal isn't much burden already. One issue is that we are yet to hear is, how many new jobs/initiatives, open vacancy slots, are implemented to suit the hardship from these new implemented policies that require our tucked away funds. If it ain't tax today, it is payment tomorrow. No matter how much good their intentions seem even with this POC, it doesn't hide the fact that the ordinary Naija citizen is paying for a crime we have forgotten or had no knowledge we had committed.To pay 1k no be problem, the problem na say e no be only one time general payment. Na yearly payment. Also, has there been any new policy lately that hasn't been aimed at putting more money in federal government coffers?",

The move no bad at all,  1k annually proof of ownership of otheyhicles will help in a lot of ways that we can't put in writing on this thread,  and it is useful to both the revenue generation and security within the country can't be overemphasized because a lot of Cars on Nigeria roads are not registered to an owner or even if their registered,  most of them are not being used by the actual owners,  so for that if the policy of annual renewals of car ownership is fully implemented it will checkmate a lot of things and the number of unlicensed cars will reduce and crime can be caught down to the minimal level. I believe in the revenue-generating mechanism of the present government led by President Tinubu,  just like he did in Lagos during his tenure as the governor I believe the same approach will be employed at the national level to burst our internally generated revenue,  so aside from the advantages mentioned above this policy will also boost our internal revenue income.",
