  "content": "What happened:: ElontoTwitter is a fictitious token/project with no whitepaper, no history, and is now trading on Pancakeswap and Poocoin. It takes advantage of Elon Musk's newly bought Twitter to run its nonsense, leading people to assume it is in partnership with him. Please stay away from this project it's pure scam.A 3 days old site.

I also wonder how someone can easily get trapped when the URL name is really odd, elontotwitter? no way anyone will believe such URL and there are a bunch scam website with odd URL out of this forum. I can't imagine how this forum will be messed up with the Elon scam sites in this board.",

      "body": "Isn't this obvious scam? Does Elon need to create new token as part of announcement on what action he do? Obviously not because only scammer do this and people need common sense regarding on this situation since 100% scammers only do this so its really basic scam attempt so hopefully no newbie will get scam by this tokens. To many of this will pop up in future so its better to ignore those obvious shitty tokens and never think about flipping it.",

They'll help the project to meet CMC requirement for listing, like --fake-- daily trading volume, --fake-- bid/ask order, etc. And not only CMC, CG and other site alike too, as evidenced by an accidental self-incrimination by Tokpie during their case with one of their client",

You don't know scams exist till you are scammed, so many people learn about scams after being scammed. This kind of topic helps.",
