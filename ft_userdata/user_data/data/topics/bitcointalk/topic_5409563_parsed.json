Therefore, I prefer sports betting, and in general, I do not make it in order to earn money, but in order to add emotions when watching the game. The last time I bet on the game Real - Eintracht, but the game was so one-sided that I did not even have time to get nervous about my win.",

I don't gamble for a profit, I gamble to kill the hours ahead of me since I don't have anything else to do in the weekends anyway. The entertainment it gives me for a few hours is enough for me to forget about it for the whole week until I remember that I need to do something on the weekends. For sports betting that is a different thing. It always gives me something to look forward to especially if the sport/game that I'm watching is one that I've been following for a long time.",

It is mainly because I've won on my last gambling session and have experienced winning streak on my dice game. However, I've voted for \"Entertainment\" due to the fact that my feelings often change per session depending if I won or lose or even won a huge amount but end up losing everything.

It is actually a mixed emotion but as a gambler, I already know that gambling isn't for making money but just a sort of entertainment and pleasure.

In my last 10 sessions, I won something good just once but I didn't feel sad that I had lost more money by loosing more times than I won, I wasn't happy about it either, I just had the feeling of entertainment, after all that was my motivation and purpose for playing in the casino in the first place. Say my motivation had been solely to make money, I definitely would have been sad, possibly depressed. Plus I played with an amount that I could afford to loose and could spare for entertainment so it didn't get to me much.",

You expect that you should be very happy and relieved when you win something big, after you grinded for weeks for that win, but when you get that win, you feel \"empty\". I think the RTP on most casinos are so bad lately, that the period between big wins are so long, that people start to feel \"cheated\" and \"disappointed\" when they eventually win something. (If I gambled and lost say $5000 over 7 days and then win $1000... that win will actually feel like a $4000 loss)",

Win or lose, it's just a matter of me trying to enjoy the process. I do sometimes extend my sessions depending on what I generally feel though, like if I'm feeling pretty excited after I was supposed to end, I'd probably add a few more minutes into my game till I lose that excitement. I generally don't want to put my excitement out there while I finish gambling already since expectations may build up, so I just release it there and then.",
