I have no idea how it works it's better to give us a clear picture of your new platform, a video explainer is good so we can grasp the whole concept of your new platform, you mention that this is still a casino but I have a hard time to picture what kind of casino is this.",

The only way to deposit on this type of casino is to purchase a credits from resellers or OP which offering discount for bulk purchased of credits. This kind of system is too centralized and very hassle to use compared to the traditional casino.Most of the time this casino turn into scam once they failed on acquiring customers to cover there initial expenses for the casino development cost.",

Maybe @OP is still negotiating with potential buyers and not coming back here for a while.If I were a potential buyer, I would specify the site domain and buy it.
