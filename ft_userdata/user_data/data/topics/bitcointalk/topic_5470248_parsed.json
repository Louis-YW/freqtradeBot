That's not KuCoin's url the original url of KuCoin is https://www.kucoin.com/ and the one which you got is most probably another exchange that no one knows about yet. I won't call it a phishing site since it's UI and design is totally different from KuCoin's UI and design. I recommend you to avoid that site as it can be a trap by scammers to loot your money. I have checked the url and it doesn't have any traffic yet. The website was registered 17-09-2023 and it's just 26 days old. Be careful from such websites.You can find more information about the domain in this image.",

You should be a little more careful when sharing links publicly, especially to suspicious sites that could potentially be involved in phishing or host various types of malware. Best to obfuscate it or enclose it in [ code ] tags to prevent accidental clicking.As for the mentioned website, my anti-virus software has flagged it as infected with a malware, so I strongly recommend avoiding it.https://www.urlvoid.com/scan/kucoine.net/",

Hello OP, this is what @Stalker22, the above member means by saying make the link appear like code. We have a lot of newbies here who can just click on any link they see on the forum without reading the content of the thread and knowing that the link is not something that can be trusted but something they are warning users about, so it's either you make it as code like the above, which is preferable, or you change the colour to red to signify danger and should be avoided.Even without going deeper to research more about the link provided, just looking at the URL shows that it's a pure scam site, as it looks like a site that's trying to impersonate another URL to lure those who are not careful enough to their site and make them lose funds that they are not supposed to. They are likely phishing sites or a clone website from a real and existing one, and such should be avoided.",

The KuCoin you are referring to is a good and a legit cryptocurrency exchange that is good for trading of cryptocurrency, but this is not their official website.The official website for KuCoin is https://www.kucoin.com/. Although the link you bring is also an exchange which I am not familiar with, in fact this is my first time of seeing the exchange, I will advice you to avoid such exchanges that did not get reputation and recognition here in this forum.Furthermore, KuCoin is a KYC exchange, meaning you will have to submit some of your personal documents like international passport, Drivers license and so on before you can be able to trade with them, if you are a person that value privacy, you can trade with exchanges that are not requesting for KYC Here.",

I was quick to say it's a phishing site until I actually visited it and found that the UI and the site's appearance does not evoke confusion from the original KuCoin site. Seems like this one's more focused on the NFTs and its sale. In any case I would agree with you with the suggestion to not visit or use the site regardless. Shady sites that have no announcement channels here are often commonplaces for scams and defrauding their users, plus you literally don't know how the whole site works so it's much better to stick with what you're accustomed with. In any case, as for OP stick with the proven and tested sites like binance instead of exploring your options. As a newbie you need to first make sure you don't get scammed.",

Seems like this one's more focused on the NFTs and its sale. Indeed, either the owner of this site doesn't have the any bad intention to lure kucoin users or phished them, using almost identical name is a bad taste for a business.And for the post pertaining that its a malware, it should be considered as false negative coz only few AV detected them as a malware.

That in itself is a clear red flag. This platform could be presumed a fraud unless proven otherwise. No legit company or team would just agree to copy the name of a competitor and add a single letter to it to make it different. Well, unless they're Justin Sun.If you add to it the point raised by SamReomo that it's just 26 years old and that of panganib999's that the UI of both platforms are exactly similar, then we can judge right away that this Kucoine is a fraud.",

Tinder is not the place where you look for investment advice, and most of the accounts that tell you this, especially girls’ accounts, are either impersonation or fraud. They want you to invest your money in a guaranteed investment and suddenly everything disappears.Next time, ask and research, and if you have even 1% doubt, do not deposit your money.",

Remember that people on social media can fake themselves to the maximum level and hence take everyone you come across there with a grain of salt. These scammers patrol not just dating apps but any sort of communication method that comes up.Most catfishers are desperate, so before responding to anybody, be on guard. Unless you know the person in real you should not engage, even still their account could be a hacked one and attempting to scam someone quickly before they get locked.Anyway the thread has severed is purpose and should be locked now.
