  "content": "I think Bitcoin has a big problem with tainted coins and the demand to be a store of value.My example:X gets 1 BTC through a criminal act. X is trading something for 1 BTC with Y. The Police is blacklisting the 1 BTC and confiscated the 1 BTC from Y.This is a 100 percent loss of value for Y.Then the FBI is selling the 1 BTC, often under value. This is an overall decreasing of value for Bitcoin.Is there a possibility to protect user like Y for such a loss of value? And how do we protect the community from an overall loss of value?Another example:Y gets 1 BTC through a criminal act. The police is blacklisting the 1 BTC. So for X the 1 BTC is less worth than a normal 1 BTC. So there is a second market for Bitcoin's tainted coins, where the \"tainted\" BTC is less worth than the normal BTC. If somebody has a trick to wash it, isn't it draining value out of the ecosystem, too?And one additional question: Is it legal to get the transaction fees of illegal transactions?",

There's nothing to worry about since bitcoin has circulate appropriately so whatever negative things you thought like it will dump if someone sells you also need to consider that there are still more people willing to buy and that's how bitcoin survive for so many years.",

And they are well in circulation.Tainted bitcoins? Well, it depends greatly on who is looking at them. For now the majority tells that 1 BTC = 1 BTC and those telling stories about tainted coins have a different agenda.All in all, some (rather few) businesses pretend to have problems with tainted coins, but most of them don't do the right thing (alert the authorities and hand the funds to the right owners), instead they spread big words on tainted money and, when they get such funds may just try to get them for themselves.Quote from: Bialke on February 17, 2023, 11:14:56 AMAnd one additional question: Is it legal to get the transaction fees of illegal transactions?What if the miner has processed the transaction without knowing it's stolen money? Who decides what transaction is illegal (and does it makes any use if the miner has already processed it)? Who decides if the first one deciding the tx is illegal was deciding that correctly or not? (Because, sorry, but that's how law works).So the only sane approach is to leave miners process all the transactions (because any kind of censoring can lead to bigger problems overall) and get hold of stolen money as soon as that money reaches an exchange, for example.",

Someone did this with Tornado mixed coins, he sent mixed ETH to a lot of celebrities to impregnate their wallet. I think it's a good idea, it would show the absurdity of this system. The CEX work on a case by case basis, and in absolute terms someone who doesn't do anything dishonest will never get into trouble, but it would still be funny to see it happen.As for the question about legal fees or not, I think fortunately there is a huge world between us and that level of political/judicial persecution, I don't think the question even arises in reality.Pools and miners are not interested in who produces the transactions (I mean legal or not etc..), they just solve the blocks and share the reward + fees. Will we attack Visa or Mastercard if someone spends dirty money with their card? In this example, the banks are the CEX, and the CEX are already accountable. No reason to involve the miners in this mess haha.",

If you had the same problem but mixed your coins or put them through a dex or held them as a privacy coin, this wouldn't be a problem you'd ever have to deal with.Realistically:1. Exchange marks and seizes coins2. You explain how you got the coins and how you paid for them (showing proof where you can).3a. Exchange unlocks the coins when they're satisfied you've provided all the evidence needed.3b. You start mediation and then take the exchange to court for the money you've lost because what the exchange is doing isn't fully legal at this point.Washing coins probably damages the ecosystem as much as holding coins damages market cap (two very precise groups of people just attacking each other over something that doesn't matter as much as you'd expect it might if you listened to either group).",

      "body": "We've all touched tainted cash, the only difference is it's much easier to trace Bitcoin because of the public ledger that we rely. I'd like to think that criminals wouldn't want a permanent association of their Bitcoin to be tainted, and therefore they'd use cash instead. After all, cash is much easier to hide, and much easier to use. I know that isn't the case, but I don't think tainted Bitcoin will be a big problem. After all, they'll be able to somewhat detect when that money changed hands, and if you don't know that those coins are tainted then you aren't breaking the law. It's impossible for the average person to know if coins are tainted. You could potentially be investigated, if the authorities aren't sure if the coins have changed hands, but ultimately that's the very same as cash. If you use Dan Coopers cash, with the serials they'll likely flag that up if they notice it, and ask you in for questioning. Most of the world is innocent, and it would be a shame to limit a currency based on the select few that use it to break the law.",

      "body": "Thank you for all the responses!I think a core problem is, that BTC is often defined as an asset and not as money. As an asset it is a \"good\". In my country (Germany) it is called \"Hehlerei\", when you receive stolen goods - and you have no chance of get back the good, if it was taken by the police. Because you cannot own a good that you received unlawful. (After 10 years you can.)So yes, I see, that there are different laws in different countrys about that and about fractional ownership, f.E. when transactions and miner fees involved.Another thing is, unlawful transactions are forbidden to happen - so if cought, they are reversed - but, if they happening, they are lawful taxed by the state. And yes, we had some cases here in Germany. One case was \"shiney flakes\", an online drug market.   It is a different topic, but one more leak for a loss of value of Bitcoin is tax fraud with getting taxes back for losing coins. If you have a business and you trade with BTC, and you sent BTC to a wrong wallet, you can claim taxes back for the loss. I thing this is also a big deal for crypto as \"store of value\".Quote from: jackg on February 17, 2023, 04:00:50 PM2. You explain how you got the coins and how you paid for them (showing proof where you can).Negative, Sir. You can explain. But it is against the law to buy stolen goods. With intent or without intent. You buy a stolen bike, you do not get it back. You buy a stolen bike on the street, and you do not know it was stolen, you do not get the bike back and you will be charged, because before the deal you have to make sure that you do not trade stolen goods.Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 17, 2023, 11:30:15 AMOr you mean the government to seek for the fee? The fee likely is going to be little, it won't be worth going for. Also why going for the fee once the transaction was successful and not reversible in a way the fee paid can be reversed.Yes, I mean that. Not today, but it is coming - and it is right. You cannot make business with illegal assets. This is a problem.Quote from: NeuroticFish on February 17, 2023, 11:29:50 AMThere's a saying that all USD bills smell of cocain.Sir, this is a very good example.Traces of cocain are not forbidden. But if you try to wash It is not just money. Also clothings (assets) having traces of cocaine on it. But the thing is, there is a difference between asset (clothing) and forbidden asset (cocaine). And we were talking of the forbidden asset (the tainted coin). So 1g of 10kg cocaine is forbidden. And 0.01 BTC trading fee out of 1000 traded tainted BTC are still tainted.",

That would be a bit odd, there must be something that can help you.Plus, in case of Bitcoin, there's a very good chance that when you get coins from somewhere, maybe 1/100 of an input would be from \"bad sources\". Will you call that tainted? Most don't. Most businesses tend to work with a number of steps back and a certain percent of \"bad\". A skilled thief (ie one that's not doing an obvious theft that's known almost instantly by everybody) has very good chance to get the time to conceal his coins even under the legal (percent, steps) \"radar\" (PS: afaik the last heists were not made by thieves that skilled).

And that's because of the way bitcoin works. Technically the link between the miners' fee and the \"tainted transactions\" is lost.It's like for all the mined transactions the fees are sent into oblivion (destroyed) and spoof, the same amount gets added to the block reward (as newly created money).(So while there can be a debate whether miners should censor or not transaction - but you would not have enough good arguments in that - on the tx fee I think that you have an even weaker case.)",
