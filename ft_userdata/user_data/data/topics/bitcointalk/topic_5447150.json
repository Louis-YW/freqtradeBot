Most miner these days don't run full node. They only connect to mining pool where the pool give them some computational task.2. Since most miner connect to pool, that means most Bitcoin block is mined and broadcasted by few pools.3. There's no way to check how many miners involved to mine a block without trusting the pool.Mining pools are a large node. Will such centralized computing power affect the security of Bitcoin? Can several large mining pools jointly launch 51% computing power attacks",

These shares proofs would only be used if they discover a block, and could then be used to prove that up until the block was hit, they solved a certain amount of valid hashes per unit.
