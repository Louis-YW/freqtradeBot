When you are using a Web 3 connection for your account and wallet, you are entrusting that 3rd party with your funds security. If it happens that you have security leakage from someone else, this won't be an exemption for you to raise your suspicions.So for the safety of Bitcointalk, it's actually a bad idea. For the forum to maintain its name, such a thing should even be avoided. Let the admin have fewer things to worry about.",

May be web3 is something I don't understand but I am happy with the old school where I know how to keep my wallet secure. If bitcointalk needs to do anything, then it's the new forum software we have in work in progress. Convert the current forum into the new forum software.

Admittedly I don't know much about web3, as I'm perpetually late to the party when it comes to new tech and becoming familiar with it, but if we're talking about something as simple as logging onto a discussion forum....why complicate it?Â  It seems to me that even if there weren't security issues (and I'm just assuming there are based on what I'm reading), implementing a login function based on a link to a wallet would pose some privacy issues at the very least.Â  And yeah, those could be avoided by people who know what they're doing, but again why take a simple procedure and introduce problems and complexity to it when it isn't needed?Frankly I don't think bitcointalk as a website is ever going to grow out of its 2009 roots, either in appearance or in functionality.Â  But me?Â  I like it that way.Â  Then again, 2009 seems like it was yesterday; to younger members I'm sure everything here seems like a throwback to another era, one in which they either weren't born in or were very young.Â  On the other hand, one thing I've learned in life is that nothing stays the same forever.Â  Our beloved bitcointalk is bound to change sooner or later, web3 or no web3.",
