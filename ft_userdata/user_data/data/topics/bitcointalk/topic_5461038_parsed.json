His behavior is not different from the behavior of other politicians in most countries that do not tell the truth, or tell the half truth about most  things to the press and the citizens.",

Because Putin really always lies, you, as his propagandist, of which there are at least 1-2 on every forum, risk losing your job as a troll. In Russia, Putin has set up a troll factory to fool people with his false propaganda. By the way, you called me a propagandist, while they are here on this forum.",

They consciously lied to destroy a prosperous country because they don't like the leader. The lies also continued in Libya, where they have destroyed that country for generations.

But 'personal' doesn't always work when sinning against God. Consider Joshua 7:1 in the Bible: \"But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things; Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the Lord’s anger burned against Israel.\"If you read the whole chapter at https://biblehub.com/niv/joshua/7.htm, you will see that some of Israel's people died because of this sin of one Israelite.Further, there are at least several times in the Old Testament where God blamed the whole community for the sins of certain people in that community. Sometimes it was Israel. Sometimes it was other nations. Genesis 15:16 says: \"In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.\"",

Putin lies, but he still forces the entire Russian people to support his lies. And if anyone is against it, a prison or \"Novichok\" awaits him. But what is surprising is that the Russian people for the most part support Putin's lies, and in this respect lies the uniqueness of Russia and its people. The Russian people have lived their entire history in a lie. In Russia, everything is saturated with lies.
