Search the forum and you will find so many such marketing after the Russia VS NATO proxy war. It has become a new level of Bitcoin marketing strategy after continuing fall of banks in the US. Expecting a few more banks going down in the European union.",

Nowadays, we see all sorts of advertising regarding Bitcoin all over the place, in different countries and places, even in areas where Bitcoin is restricted. I really like the way the adoption is going and that more awareness is being created.Only the person who took the original photo will be able to identify how that picture best fits in that area. There could also possibly be benches around the corner where people sit and have fun, which the camera did not cover up, or that place could also be a bus stop. Either way, the place is an open place, which means a lot of people pass through it every day, and the person who posted it sees the place as the best place for that. Even if one doesn't have enough time to stand and read through all the content in it, they could possibly take photos of it and read it through on their way home or even during their free time. There will also be people who will make fun of the image; others will also find it informative, which will definitely create a lot of awareness and let a lot of people know about it.But funny enough, there are also a few Bitcoiners like me who have not actually read through the whole Bitcoin white paper; all I have been doing is going through a few posts where they post a few lines of the white paper information. I have downloaded the PDF but have not gathered enough time to read through it. If I come across such a situation in my street, it will really be a good opportunity for me to start somewhere.",

With that being said this is still bound to interest a couple of people who aren't really that informed about bitcoin, some nerds who wanted to know more about it, and a couple others who are aware of what bitcoin is, informed themselves about it, but are just hesitant to take the jump due to various reasons. (I'd say they'll think this is a sign from the heavens or a higher power urging them to take the step towards changing their lives forever on some Law of Attraction bs) But whatever the reason and intent is for creating this ad, it won't matter unless it works.

Even though it may be criticized by everyone, it is still a contributing point of view to help build and improve. However, it is still necessary to combine many other measures because we are living in the 4.0 era, so we need to make the most of the techniques we have inherited.

And I think that a lot of knowledge about its real use can be gained by reading the Bitcoin white paper. So I welcome and wish such initiatives. I also think like you that it is not something that should be first introduced to Google only through the Internet. Wherever it is placed on a bustop or street site I think it will catch the eye of many who don't know about it and that will serve its purpose.I now have a hope in my heart that one day I will also hang such billboards around me in my country to introduce and create people to Bitcoin in my country. As it now ban and illegal in my country. And that's why many people in our country have this misconception that Bitcoin is only used for illegal purposes, but I think they will get rid of this misconception if they read the Bitcoin white paper.",
