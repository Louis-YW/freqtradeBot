Crypto exchanges does not work like that, you do all on crypto exchange using a single app or site provided by the exchange that you are using. Can you connect Bybit with Metatrader? No.",

Cheapest way.First of all, I haven't tried that, and I don't do Forex trading either, dude, but I saw a tutorial on YouTube where Bybit is connected to MetaTrader 4. I'm just not sure if this is what you want to know, dude.This is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liaVSbE49tg, because the concept of forex trading is actually different from crypto trading, so you should also be asking about forex platforms. community is not here in the crypto community either. Or I hope you can at least do your own research if there is anything you want to know.",

No.I think there is a reason for the OP to ask that question, I don't use bybit but I have heard about bybit being linked to MT4 and traders can use MT4 for trading. This is really strange to me but I just found a link about this, I hope this is what you are looking for and it will help you, OP. But my question is, if you already have an account on bybit, why don't you trade directly on the bybit app instead of using MT4? I think using the official app is always better than using the MT4 or MT5 app.By the way, OP, be careful with bybit with the bad news about it recently.https://learn.bybit.com/mt4/mt4-crypto-trading/https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en-US/mt4",

Some say you can also trade crypto on Metatrader but I can't find a way to do. You are trying to miss thinks up for yourself. I don't know if bybit is connected to metatrader (4 or 5) without any problem. But why would you be making reference to crypto market and forex market? , they are not the same thing even though they operate in almost the same way in terms of modus of trade like indicators, candlestick or market analysis like FA, TA, sentiments or emotions. Basically, forex market use metatrader 4 or 5 to operate. So for the forex brokers, they have their website where through which deposit or withdrawal is done but they are connected to the trading platform or channel called metatrader and this is different from crypto exchange platforms where you trade direct from the exchange website. So I think this is basic for all forex trading and brokers if you are trading the financial market, currency, commodities etc. But you can now find some forex brokers adding some crypto pairs against USD like BTC/USD but it does not run 7 days a week like the crypto exchange, forex is up 5 working days which is Monday - Friday.",

Or I make my own software using the Bybit APIs, best solution maybe.Crypto Traders use trading bots to automate their tasks, try looking into them and see if some stuff you're looking for are possible with them. Just don't forget to set your bybit API key in a way where it's not possible to withdraw your funds with it to minimize additional exposure risk.For starters, you can start on this thread, see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5278392.0 (note that it has been awhile since it was last updated so there could be more providers for bybit now)",

Cheapest way.You know, I'm wondering why you still want to trade on MT4 when it's possible, and I think it's safer if you trade directly on Bybit; after all, it's even better to trade on MT4. And so far, my experience using Bybit via crypto trade has also been good.But anyway, whatever your deep reason is, we respect your choice anyway. All we do here on this forum platform is give reminders and a little caution on such things that you want to do. And I also think that you also need to do your own research on what you are asking here so that you are aware of whether what is being given to you by those who commented on you here is also appropriate.",

Cheapest way.Buddy I haven't tried it, but as for the tutorials I have seen some guys using the MT4 and ByBit. I think ByBit provides some kind of Bride to connect MT4. For any other way to connect, I'm really not familiar with it. As I don't use ByBit and MT4, or any type of such plugin I can't assure authenticity but here is what I found on a blog I'm quoting below the procedure to connect MT and Bybit. If you have some concerns about the bride I think you can go for some premium ones, as Ninja Bridge may cost around $100 Per month and Broker may cost around $200. So double check the official subscription while proceeding.To proceed check here..",

I don't know what is the reason why don't you just use Bybit solely even though you knew that you can trade using their platform.If the problem is that you just want a better chart, I would suggest tradingview. It is also have feature where you can execute a trade without going back to the exchange.",

I think using the official app is always better than using the MT4 or MT5 app.https://learn.bybit.com/mt4/mt4-crypto-trading/https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en-US/mt4The reason is that, for me it Is more convenient to trade on MT4 or MT5 than on the exchange platform. If Bybit has actually made their platform to be traded on the MT4 platform, So there are cases where you would want to take an instant trade, buy/sell order, and you realize that you have been logged out from the exchange, either due to maintenance or that you haven't logged in for some days, and you will now have to re-input your details back, but that scenario doesn't happen with MT4.",
