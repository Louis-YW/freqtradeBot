The primary issue is to run the portal without upfront money.There is no manipulation to cheat the winners or STOP the players from winning the betting games. If someone wins a game, the admin must pay the amount to build the reputation.  any suggestion?",

Many are asking for proof of funds and if this is your primary concern to run the casino without having money to prove that you can pay winners, I doubt it that there will be those folks that are willing to risk their money and deposit it to your casino.Quote from: maxtra on December 30, 2022, 12:01:35 PMIf someone wins a game, the admin must pay the amount to build the reputation.  Of course, you have to since you're the house and that's the usual transaction that happens from a casino when someone has won.",

It depends on their internal team where they will adjust the maximum bet or not, a greedy developer will not put any maximum limit since they're hope the high roller is lose. Some untrusted bookies will confiscate your winnings and give a fake investigation in order to postpone to pay your winnings until they get money from people that losses.",

Search up BitLucy.com in the forum and read what happened. They did the same exact thing, thinking they would make money off players, but it was a complete fail.",

      "body": "The main problem is trust, so the problem of \"providing money\" is associated with the \"problem of trust\". If you want to gain the trust of users and build a good reputation, you have to provide the necessary funds in the reserve fund to pay players profits. You cannot build a good reputation unless you pay the winners their winnings and this needs to provide the necessary money to cover the profits.I read a lot of threads here in the forum about casinos (some of them are famous) that don't pay winnings to the winners, this will lose their reputation and this will cause the casino to be shut down eventually due to loss of trust.",

You can see that many gambling sites have ended their business or ended up not paying their players because the business was no longer profitable for them, so they no longer had the funds to pay their players.There must be another reason on why some gambling sites can be unsuccessful. What if they lack something in terms of planning? This is why they spend boat loads of money in promotions. They think this can make them successful but they did not know that there are also other things that should be given an importance.Gambling is a profitable business if only done right because the games have a house edge and this was unlikely to be beaten by any gambler no matter what strategies they are preparing. I saw lots of threads here about it and all of them ended up the same. They are still a loser at the end and the gambling site remain to be victorious.",

      "body": "Well, when it comes to an ideal crypto payment gateway, I think it really boils down to a few key factors. Firstly, it should be easy to use and integrate with the platform or website. Secondly, it should offer a wide range of cryptocurrencies for users to choose from, so they can pay with the currency that suits them best. And thirdly, it should have strong security measures in place to protect against fraud and hacking.As for your situation with the sports betting portal, I suggest looking into crypto payment gateways that offer a pay-per-use model, where you only pay a fee when a transaction is made. This could help you avoid upfront costs while still providing a secure and convenient payment option for your users.",
