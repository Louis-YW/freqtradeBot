Most characters exhibited from children this days are being learnt from outside, most times schools and social gathering.I do no think a parent will ask his child to dip his hands into fire, every parents would want his child to be responsible and well doing but most children decides to be irresponsible and use less to their society.What is corrupting the children this days is the use of internet, even a 7yrs old child owns a smart phone and his free to access the internet not for knowledge acquiring but to enjoy social lives.The scripture will say, train up a child in a way he should grow and when he is old he won't depart from it. As you rightly said prayer is the strongest weapon",

      "body": "There is this popular saying that most children born around the year 2000 down are rude. As insensitive as it may sound,  it is actually true. The rate of moral decadence in our society today is alarming and parents need to be intentional in parenting. Parenting is a very big task which must not be neglected.  If you don't inculcate into the children the right values at their tender age, they will learn by themselves from social media or strangers and they might learn the wrong  thing.  Parents are working tirelessly to put food on the table and make name for themselves too in the society.  While they are at it, they tend to delegate their parental responsibilities to maids, relatives,  teachers and even strangers.  Giving room for the children to learn and know things they are not supposed to know. Parents should take breaks from their busy schedule and social media too to rescue their children and the next generation at large.  Teach the children the right values now or you will never have the opportunity to do it later.",

She/he came from them and that's why there's the bond which is stronger than any other connection from other people. But there are also parents that are no good in raising kids, they just want to have fun and all of a sudden created a human being that they can't handle because of being irresponsible. As for the teachers, there are teachers that do care that much to their students especially the little ones and in the grade schools.Quote from: Peter Faith on October 20, 2023, 01:01:34 PMIn this jet age they ( children) learn very fast from as early as zero years..Parents needs to be alert with the activities of their children until they get to adulthoodBut in all prayer is the strongest weaponI agree about prayer but remember that prayer without action is nothing. You keep on praying but as a parent, you do nothing to do what's best for your child. We as parents serve as their guardian automatically is already bonded to them until we die. This is the reality about being a parent. We will always be a parent to our kids and someday they will depart from us and will make their own families. But even with that, they're always our kids and we'll always be a parent to them no matter how old they grow and no matter how what happens and even the world turns upside down.",

      "body": "In America, one of the best things you can do is to change the birth certificates (BCs) for your children.BCs have a form in which they have been drawn up. The form matches a standard, simple transfer of property form like the Uniform Commercial Code shows. When you sign the BC, especially if you are the mother, you transfer the child into trust under the government. You wind up being second to the government in the trusteeship. Government becomes the reigning Trustee.The first thing to do is, when you sign any document with government, sign it on the signature with the words \"non-assumpsit\" ahead of your signature. Non-assumpsit means 'no contract'. Government will accept many of your 'agreements' with them this way. And you ultimately will not actually have made a contract with them.Regarding the BC, you probably want it for your child. There are benefits in life that your child can gain through having a BC. But there are protections from the long arm of the government if you don't have a BC for your child... although you might have to show it in court. But your strength will be greater if you can show that there wasn't any written agreement, and the benefits were simply given. Think it through.The next thing to do is to change your signature on any current BCs of your children. Change it so that the 'non-assumpsit' words are added to it. This may be difficult in some States, but it can be done.Home school your children, so that they are not indoctrinated by government's worldly indoctrination. Teach your children about Jesus-salvation, teaching them from the Bible.",

But they fail to know that the most important task of a parent is to properly raise children. Even during holidays, children are still sent out for what they call in my country \"Summer Lessons\" just to ensure that they don't stay at home. It is understandable when parents have to engage in these actions because of work but when it is done because of pleasure or the inability to take responsibility, then it is very wrong. Children of this age learn more from ICT, mostly social media. Parents should always monitor children's activities online to ensure that they are not been exposed to drugs, pornography, religious extremism, terrorism, underage gambling, and scams. It is also important for parents to know who the friends of their children are. They should ensure that they are hanging out with the right company. Don't also fail to correct and sometimes discipline the child when he is wrong. And also encourage and reward him when he does the right thing. Spend time with your children and always discuss how they are doing in school and other places. Be friendly so that they can always tell you how the feel about certain situations. Prayers are more potent when you play your role as a parent.",

      "body": "Parenting a child now in this modern world seems to be very difficult, sometimes parents don't have time for there kids. The major thing a child needs is just love and care. And every parents is expected to love his/her child. Not the common love we see or hear because no parent will love his kids and send the child far away for studies at that little age. And sometimes what the parent don't get to teach the child the child learnt it from school or friends. If a child will be useful and be of good value to the society the parents must play a huge role in the life of the child. For example let's look at the story of Ben Calson, he wrote a book \"think big\" one of my favorite, Ben Calson was the dullest student in his class but he said his mom played an important role in his life, she will always force him and scold him to read his books, his mom made reading habit to be part of him, that's what I call a good parenting, so if Ben mom did'nt scold him he would not be where he is today.Children these day lack to exhibit a reading habit all there attention is on social media, little kids these day I see dancing on tiktok I get amaze. Since the world is now a digital world but somethings should be regulated for our kids.",
