      "body": "It's crucial not to solely depend on any exchange. Instead, consider securing your crypto assets in cold storage devices such as Trezor or Ledger, as highlighted in our comprehensive exchange guide. Recent incidents, including the FTX crash, underscore the significance of safeguarding assets on hardware wallets.Moreover, the exchange mentioned above hasn't undergone review by our team. For a secure trading experience, we strongly recommend using platforms that have received recommendations on our platform.",
