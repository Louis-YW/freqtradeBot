Cloud mining topics have nothing to do with mining, hence no reason to stay in the mining area.2. So called cloud mining were profitable for the scammers and unprofitable for the rest.All this being said, did you ever use a cloud mining website in 2022 and managed to withdraw? And if you didn't, what are you talking about?!",

Cloud mining adds additional “middle men” to mining, which means that there are additional parties that will perform work, and earn their own profits when compared to mining on your own. At best, this results in diminished returns. The above also raises the risk that one or more entities will scam you and not perform as agreed. Obviously, there is also the risk that whoever is renting the hardware is outright scamming, which will lead to a total loss.",

Are you 100% sure that they are an actual cloud mining company? I am asking because some time ago I checked them out a bit, and for me it more seemed like cloud mining part was sort of a gimmick to attract new users and not an actual cloud mining company that mines something (iirc they are trading platforms of some sort).@Dubaian forget about cloud mining. It wasn't smart thing to do 5 years ago, its not now and it will stay the same in 5 years (beside the fact that 99.99% were scam). Just keep it simple and buy bitcoin instead and forget about cloud mining.",
