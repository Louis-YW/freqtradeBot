Yes, the first bits appear to be genuine.The coin had a late load date though in 2016: https://mempool.space/address/1Kh8qzin5kFVn6y8wePhNBQsrdmKEhcTK4Might have been when the coin sold or was confirmed received by the original owner, as CI was noted to load coins after customer reception.Quote from: owlcatz on December 03, 2023, 02:15:05 AMI had a few CI coins and I realized that often the laser-marked serial is either very hard to read, or had degraded beyond recognition - Not to say this had one, I have no idea, but I did have a coin where I brought it up in the sales thread, just can't find where/when at the moment as there were so many.  I know there has been some talk of certain CI coins showing first-bits degradation over the years. Seemingly, may be just dependent on said coin/paper....  And have not heard of the lasered numbering showing signs of degradation, but anything is possible As long as the first-bits are readable, CI has released all addresses for their coins except the Rocket silvers, which most addresses are in the Master Maker Thread here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2022902.msg58889653#msg58889653",
