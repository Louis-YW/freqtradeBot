There are others who have a very different perspective on the issue:QuoteUnited States Senator Ted Cruz wants to make the American state of Texas an oasis for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Speaking at the Texas Blockchain Summit 2022 in late November, the politician empathized how the crypto industry can be strategic for the U.S. energy supply and technological development. Cruz argued that Bitcoin mining could be used to monetize energy created by oil and gas extraction, emphasizing that mining activity can be used as an energy storage and supply alternative:    \"The beauty of it [Bitcoin mining] is when you've got substantial investment, as we do in Texas and Bitcoin mining, when you have an extreme weather event, either extreme heat, which is frequent in the state of Texas or extreme cold, which sometimes happens here, Bitcoin mining can be shut off in a fraction of a second. Making that electricity immediately available to the grid to heat or cool people's homes, to keep businesses running. That is an enormous reservoir of excess capacity that, I think, is very beneficial.\"",

Since last couple of months, the way FED and enforcement agencies are creating issues for the crypto companies, a harsh tax treatment was quite expected. This move might expedite the recession in US as more job cuts are becoming evident. Asian countries will surely be benefited out of this move as the crypto miners and web3 companies may move out to crypto friendly countries along with their jobs.",

If taxes on crypto mining in the United States are too high, then miners could move to a more favorable jurisdiction. Especially, as the limited supply of bitcoin increases competition among miners and the rewards for mining bitcoin diminish.What can the white house/american government do, are they going to change the tax law to 10%.Weird, America actually knew it was going to happen.QuoteWhile the administration's plan acknowledges the risk of miners moving abroad it does little to ensure that mining operations do not shuffle between states in search of the lowest tax rates,We'll see later, whether the 30% tax actually happens or......!",

Unfair rates will never encourage the business to be operated so either they will move to another country or will operate under the radar and paying no taxes at all so they are creating a revenue loss with unfair tax rates. But this is just from one agencies and other may have different view especially who understands the potential growth of blockchain technology in the future.",

There are others  Looks like you have no idea what you are talking about, you posted a link about Ted Cruz who is a Republican who is serving as a senator and White house is held by the Democratic Party and the president is one of the most intelligent person the world could produce as a leader (Sarcastic), forced to write a disclaimer as majority might not be following world politics. The Democratic party is against energy usage and following the WOKE agenda, if you want to see changes follow the Republicans at the moment and hopefully they will win the next time.Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with US or its politics, i am continents away from them but following global politics as some of the policies will have an impact globally.",

Although these states are bitcoin-friendly they will be powerless. Based on the legal doctrine of preemption the federal government has the power to reduce and eliminate any state law that conflicts with federal laws. But these states can challenge this unfavorable law in court. They can file a lawsuit seeking to pray the court to declare such a law unconstitutional. If the law is enforced, the best option for miners will be to leave the US territory to other lenient countries. Africa would have been a good destination if not for the lack of basic infrastructure such as constant and cheap power supply.",
