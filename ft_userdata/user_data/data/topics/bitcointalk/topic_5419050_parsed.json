Just like people trusting centralized projects like BNB, XRP and other sort of centralized projects.Quote from: KiaKia on November 01, 2022, 11:27:44 AMFor someone who doesn't like centralised projects do you think I should stay away from anything running on CRO? If you don't like centralized projects then just keep yourself away so that you don't associate with them. But if you see some opportunities that you can do some trades on it and make money as you dump it, you have the choice to make and you've got free will.",

      "body": "It's pretty centralised and gets controlled a lot by them (in things like staking) I'd stay away from it if you don't like centralisation. The same would go for binance coin.Eth is mentioned above as being centralised and I doubt that but its pos mechanism still needs to prove itself -   and it's also likely overvalued. Bitcoin is the most well known and most decentralised so far though.",

I know that this project belongs to Crypto.com, same as the smart contract too but a project that's 100% built on a centralised idea.....CRO chain itself centralized. CRO itself was pretty much the same like second layer solution that has been running by a few nodes that being trusted by crypto.com exchange site. There's no decentralized exchange site that has been running by a few nodes fully controlled by exchange site. Quote from: KiaKia on November 01, 2022, 11:27:44 AMIs it possible to trust any project running on such blockchain project? I am not sure that VVS finance is a dex either..it's always possible but this actually depends on so many factors. That's a new thing for me. Quote from: KiaKia on November 01, 2022, 11:27:44 AMFor someone who doesn't like centralised projects do you think I should stay away from anything running on CRO? You shall not stay away but always try to use your own research for that.",

VVS Finance is a fake decentralized project, although it's decentralized finance, but it doesn't have relation with decentralization.Not an empty shitcoin, though. You need to stake CRO in order to acquire different tiers of debit crypto cards which guarantee you cashback on purchases made with the card.I think it is one of the best altcoins around due to the features it proportionates customers. If it wasn't for crypto.com's debit card I would be in a complicated situation when transacting, swaping, exchanging crypto and using it as money. Even though the chain and the service is 100% centralized, it is still worthful and helpful.",
