  "content": "Nexa is a next era content platform designed to reward creators and readers for high-quality content and positive behavior. Unlike traditional social media platforms, Nexa focuses on content quality rather than popularity, offering a fairer and more inclusive environment for creators and readers alike.Nexa: Next Era Content Platform with Rewards for Positive BehaviorNexa is not a social media platform, but a next era content platform that rewards positive behavior among its users. The platform allows creators to publish their work, and readers to engage with them through commenting, sharing, and liking. The initial version of Nexa will aggregate content from various platforms such as Twitter and TikTok, and reward users for reading, promoting, and commenting on high-quality content.One of the main differences between the initial version of Nexa and other platforms is the focus on positive behavior. Nexa encourages users to engage with each other in a respectful and supportive manner. Users who post high-quality content, leave insightful comments, or promote positive messages will be rewarded with cryptocurrency. The more weight a user's contribution has, the more reward they will receive.Nexa's upgraded version will include a mechanism for mining rewards for positive behavior. Users can earn rewards for their high-quality work, comments, and promotion activities. The rewards will be related to the user's weight and their content's quality.Nexa aims to create a community of like-minded individuals who share a common interest in positive behavior and cryptocurrency. The platform is designed to provide an incentive for users to promote positivity and engage with others in a meaningful way. Join us and be part of the Nexa community today!Our development team is based in Canada and the US, and we are currently seeking seed funding for our $5 million valuation. We are committed to completing our initial version, which is currently in development, and will continue to update our progress here. While Nexa is not an open-source project in its early stages, similar platforms like Steemit exist in our market space.Our current fundraising target is $500,000, and if you invest in us, we promise to work hard and provide token rewards for our backers. However, since we cannot guarantee the future value of our tokens, we urge our investors to learn more about us and be cautious when considering investing in Nexa.If you are interested in learning more about Nexa, please contact us at nexa.land@aol.com for more information.",

      "body": "So basically your platform is like Hive.io? quite interesting considering that this content creation platform is quite popular with publishers because it empowers them with rewards.But platforms like this are also prone to closing, like read.cash and several other platforms that have stopped giving rewards to users because their economy is no longer stable. Hopefully this platform is not like that.",

While Nexa is not an open-source project in its early stages, similar platforms like Steemit exist in our market space.I think you should have appeared here on the forum with concrete things, you presented data that has no evidence, for example:1 - Team: you just said that your team is made up of people from Canada and the United States of America, but you didn't show who these people are and what they do in real life and what are the experiences you have in this area of your project and you spoke of millions of dollars that must be invested to materialize the project, but you did not present the operational costs in detail so that we can understand why you need 5 million dollars, you did not present the complete plan of profits vs. operating costs when the project was ready so that investors could analyze whether it would be worth investing in that project or not and what profit they could expect2 - Website: you still don't have a demo website for investors to see how the project would be, that is, you still don't have anything concrete to show investors and that will make investors not interested in your projectQuote from: catbay on March 30, 2023, 02:02:20 PMOur current fundraising target is $500,000, and if you invest in us, we promise to work hard and provide token rewards for our backers. However, since we cannot guarantee the future value of our tokens, we urge our investors to learn more about us and be cautious when considering investing in Nexa.you will have to show a signed wallet containing those 500 million dollars, and about the token value, honestly this is something much more difficult to predict the price, because this market is already saturated with altcoins and listing a new altcoin on an exchange like binance It is a very long process and not to mention that you have to spend money on token development, advertising and listing on exchanges. It's too risky to put money into it.Quote from: catbay on March 30, 2023, 02:02:20 PMIf you are interested in learning more about Nexa, please contact us at nexa.land@aol.com for more information.you need to be active on this thread",
