Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run theinstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL ispossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Oldwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.CompatibilityBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systemsusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  BitcoinCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not asfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core onunsupported systems.Notable changesGuigui#774 Fix crash on selecting \"Mask values\" in transaction viewRPC#29003 rpc: fix getrawtransaction segfaultWallet#29176 wallet: Fix use-after-free in WalletBatch::EraseRecords#29510 wallet: getrawchangeaddress and getnewaddress failures should not affect keypools for descriptor walletsP2P and network changes#29412 p2p: Don't process mutated blocks#29524 p2p: Don't consider blocks mutated if they don't connect to known prev blockCreditsThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:Martin ZumsandeSebastian FalbesonerMarcoFalkeUdjinM6dergoeggeGreg SandersAs well as to everyone that helped with translations onTransifex.",
