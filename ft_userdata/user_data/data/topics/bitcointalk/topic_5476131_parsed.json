  "content": "The nano ledger s has issues where the screen can dim and not work or it works but it's too dim to use.  There is a battery with the nano ledger s so it eventually goes out right in every nano ledger s?  Had a nano ledger s where the screen dim and stopped working.  I'm curious is there anyone here that is still using a nano ledger s and it has lasted 5 years or longer?  It seems after a few years, the dim screen happens eventually or not?  I guess it last usually 3 years or so before it goes out at the most for most people?I know the nano ledger x also has a battery and a lot of people complain about the x battery issues.Now since the nano ledger s plus has no battery, are there people that has issues with it such as the screen dim or it doesn't turn on?",

I discovered this video  where he explain how to remove and install a new screen for your ledger.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZyHwA2lkwMI just opened my ledger , cleaned it with I cleaned it with ethyl alcohol and closed it again. It is now good as new (just a small black line in the screen).I bought a new one here in aliexpress https://aliexpress.com/item/1005006180243667.html, but i didnt use it yet. I think this is not good for Plus model, but maybe you can find one for you My device is 6 years old and it is now still working now. I just cleaned inside it to keep it working",
