Sometimes it works but after paying so much commission to brokers they understand something is wrong and decide to change their trading style. If the trader has no trading plan, it becomes gambling which can lead to a burst account balance sooner or later, from my personal experience. Using trailer stops on profit zones and having pre-determined stop loss zone will save traders with experience in this field, IMO.",

      "body": "Another thing you need to add is self-control. There is one thing I have noticed regarding trading, whether futures trading, day trading, or even the forex market. One just needs to have his targets mapped out for the day, and once those targets are reached, you stop and close for the day regardless of whether your trade is on the positive or negative side. When most newbies are losing on trades, they get so emotional that they can't even control their anger. They just keep on trading without proper analysis of the market because they want to gain back all that they have lost, which ends up putting them at greater risk. My advice is that once you enter any trade and you happen to notice that your strategy is not working for you that very day, you stop for the day and take a rest, so as not to increase your chances of losing your entire fund. Which might even turn you to be looking like a gambling addict.",

Those traders who didn't use stop-loss orders may also be more likely to engage in emotional trading, as they may be more inclined to hold onto losing positions in the hope of a market reversal.  It should also monitor their stop-loss orders regularly and adjust them as needed based on market conditions.Another is to develop your trading strategy, it can help you stay focused, avoid impulsive trading decisions, and increase your chances of success.If you don't have all of these, it's hard to deal with the market movement.",

It’s not about starting big, it’s all about you knowing what you are doing, you might start big and lose all your money and you might start small and grow your account, it’s about you investing big, it’s all about you knowing what you are doing.Quote from: Kara3 on April 24, 2023, 09:32:31 PM* Over trading-- it's very important for a day trader to limit the number of trade he/she took in a day.If you are a beginner and you open too much trade, then you get confused at the end you end up losing money in all the trades, you shouldn’t be too desperate to make profit, it’s not all about you opening multiple trade, you can open a trade and make Good profit and if you open multiple trade you will endup losing money. Just make sure your analysis is right and focus on just few trades you can manage.Quote from: Kara3 on April 24, 2023, 09:32:31 PM* Lack of trading plan-- develop a strategy an stick to it, do not ever enters a trade blindly, if not the market will remove you blindly.Newbies lack trading strategies, that’s why some of them are always ending up looking for trading signals, some of them don’t really know anything about trading before they start trading, their are lots of signal providers now, so they are being deceived by those people. Some traders don’t know anything about trading and they are not ready to learn, they just want to make money, if you don’t have strategy you will be losing money.Quote from: Kara3 on April 24, 2023, 09:32:31 PM* Failure to use stop-loss-- to me it's the most important thing I do while trading, an it's always close to my entry price, I do it that way so that if the trade didn't go as planned, I won't lose more than 10% of my margin.I don't if anyone have more to add, so I can also learn?Stop-loss is good but not mandatory, if you believe in your analysis and you will be online to monitor your trade then it’s not mandatory to use stop loss, but if you are the busy type then stop loss is not really a bad idea, and also i do recommend newbies to use stop loss, it will help them cut their lost incase if their analysis is wrong and the trade goes against them.",

      "body": "OP, I think the first mistake beginners make is not really having a defined knowledge of trading before they put in money to trade, and secondly, not knowing how to manage their losses before starting. Also, seeing trading as a major source of income to only rely on is a mistake newbies can make.When they are pushing too hard to make profit every day, they encounter losses, which will lead them to over-trade like you made mention of over trading, and at some point they are not going to make the right decision for the trade as they will just be focused on making the profit and covering losses that have encountered. A newbie who has not yet developed their skills on how to handle losses can suffer countless losses.For example, a friend invested $500 into trading, at some point he was only left with $200 due to losses, so he just came up with the decision to trade with all the remaining $200, saying \"he doesn't care if that remaining fund is gone as well.\" Trading is not gambling, so it should not be treated as gambling, just as some newbies do.",

Both over trading types are bad as it will cause you future losses.Quote* Lack of trading plan-- develop a strategy an stick to it, do not ever enters a trade blindly, if not the market will remove you blindly.Making your trading plan is good but not all plans are good.

Many people get their funds stolen because they keep it in a hot wallet and on Windows 10 which is full of bugs. They get it stolen even without downloading anything fishy. Hence why you need a hardware wallet to protect yourself.Another issue is that they invest in way too many scams. Nobody wants to invest in bitcoin because the gains won't be 100x. So they invest in alt coins like Pepe and they are surprised that they end up getting rugged. And lastly the worse is leverage. Many people shouldn't be trading on 100x or 50x leverage. The markets are way too volatile and its easy to get wicked out in minutes with that leverage.",

They are hoping to win without any organized planning and for me it is the reason why they are consistently losing. Trading is not about luck, it is about probabilities and you can have your edge if you have organized plan that you can use in order to react when the opportunity comes. What is this organize planning that I'm talking about? For me an organized plan consist of knowing when you will enter, knowing how to spot a trend, knowing how to plot support and resistance, knowing when you will cut your losses, knowing how much money you will spend and lastly knowing what kind of strategy that you will use.If you have these in your plan, then it is considered that you have organized planning. If you enter in a trade without a plan, it is considered as FOMO and FOMO is one of the factors why traders are keep losing in trading. In order to avoid it, you should have a organized plan that will guide you and help you to have wins in your trading career.",

I believe when a trader is doing high risk trading then he or she is over trading because at a little change in direction, the account of the trader can wipe off. So having a moderate number of trading and good money management, is right psychology for trading.Quote from: Kara3 on April 24, 2023, 09:32:31 PM* Failure to use stop-loss-- to me it's the most important thing I do while trading, an it's always close to my entry price, I do it that way so that if the trade didn't go as planned, I won't lose more than 10% of my margin.Keeping your stop loss close to entry price is good like you do because it doesn't eat up much of your balance when goes wrong but at the same time, that will also not give your trade space to \"breath\" and you will find your trade always logging you out in stop loss at little shift in your entry price. My suggestion is to have a certain measurement of percentage in risk for a trade you are taking.",
