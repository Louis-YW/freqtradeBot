      "body": "Nice to see Encrypgen/IndyGeneUS on here, been following them for a while now, they seem completely under the radar.They are a first mover but have always stuck to the science/business part of things instead of doing (crypto) marketing, which has only seem to have increased (or decreased if you will) since IndyGeneUS acquired them.Which makes sense, since they don't benefit from either a high nor a low token evaluation and have acquired several thousand datasets they still need to sequence.Most promising, except for the huge WGS dataset Indy is reported to be indexing, is that contrary to some of their competitors (which do invest heavily in the marketing aspect) is that they are sequence agnostic, so everyone is able to upload and sell their data regardless of which company did the sequencing.Expect this one to blow up hard if/when they ever finish the GeneChain v2.",
