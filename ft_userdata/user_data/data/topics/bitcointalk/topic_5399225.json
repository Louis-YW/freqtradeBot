  "content": "Hey everyone,A user created a bounty of $50 to somehow make ckpool run on Ubuntu 18.04, so I got onto it and was able to run it successfully (pic rel: https://i.imgur.com/IyeJA3Z.png)I am sharing the guide with everyone.Since the og thread of CK pool has been locked and depreciated, I am creating a new thread.You can follow it here:https://github.com/edgycorner/CK-Pool-installation-with-Bitcoin-Core-22.0-with-fixes-on-Ubuntu-I am pretty confident that it should run with other versions of Ubuntu and >=Bitcoin core 22.0There's one minor change in the ckpool code, you need to allocate empty string to flags in coinbaseaux response. If you don't then it will cause a runtime error \"No flags in coinbaseaux of GBT JSON\".Source:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19182#issuecomment-1013989241You need to make a few changes in src/bitcoin.c before building ckpool(follow Step 10 of the guide)Feel free to post your errors on this thread. I am not super talented in C, but I will try my best to solve them for you.Enjoy!",
