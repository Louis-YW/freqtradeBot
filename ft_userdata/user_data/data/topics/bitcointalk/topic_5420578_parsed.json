And why the main person involved is so closely related to the politics via his mother?Maybe it's not a coincidence, a lot of events lead up to it. The SBF went public and funded the Democratic Party before the election, and the SBF also previously offered to enter into the twitter deal with Elon but was turned down. While CZ also became a shareholder when he donated 500 million to Elon in the twitter deal and after a few days owning TW, Elon also openly supported the republican party. In a sense, the battle of the two exchanges is related to US politics.",

This father is also the boss of Gary Gensler back when he was still teaching at MIT. A conspiracy theory would like this but somehow a relationship was bind by a scam plan.",
