  "content": "Climate change doesn't really bring any problems to nature. Nature takes care of itself. Do you remember that the northern lands were warm years ago? They still find mammoths frozen in the ice in northern Siberia... eating grass that is only found in warmer lands. Now the Polar bears are loving the warmth.Climate-Change is only something the elite are using to scare you into giving them control over your lives.Hand-picked breaking news headlines:Note that the articles on this page change every day.https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/09/climate-activists-are-silent-on-polar-bears-because-their-doom-mongering-blew-up-in-their-faces/Climate Activists are Silent on Polar Bears Because their Doom-Mongering Blew Up in their FacesA Grist article last week pandered to activist polar bear specialists over their failed climate change agenda as it tried to minimize why the climate movement doesn’t talk about polar bears anymore. Apparently, the Arctic icon has “largely fallen out of fashion” through “overexposure” resulting in polar bear images invoking “cynicism and fatigue.” But that isn’t really true, is it?While there is an admission that the over-hyped lies about starving bears promoted by National Geographic in 2017 and 2018 were a factor, there is no mention in the article of the well-known, documented evidence of scientists’ own failed assumptions that polar bears require summer sea ice for survival have had any impact on public opinion (Amstrup et al. 2007; Crockford 2015, 2019, 2022, 2023; Lippold et al. 2019; Rode et al. 2021).Thriving populations in the Chukchi Sea and elsewhere amid low summer ice levels have busted the myth that polar bears need ice year-round.Andrew Derocher was also allowed to repeat, unchallenged, the ridiculous narrative he and his activist supporters have peddled before, that insists the polar bear had become a climate change icon by accident rather than design, a lie I addressed in detail last year. Some excerpts from that 2022 post are copied below....",

Even if they can survive, certainly they’re over exposed to predators like orcas and falling victim to exhaustion and drowning. Maybe I’m misinformed, but I think polar bears are likely to become extinct in the next 100 years.",

      "body": "I have not read those articles, but I also believe that Climate change agenda is something that has been very helpful for many tech companies to sell the recycled things for a much higher price tag. A few of them even made this agenda part of their marking that they stopped giving adaptors with the smartphones for the same purpose and saved money during the fake marketing to fool us.Nature is far more powerful then the way those activists have shown us, and they are mostly producing the articles and books related to climate change to scare us out, and at the same time grab money out of our pockets. I have even heard some videos that were saying that the Earth's climate levels have reached alarming stages and if we do not reduce the carbon emissions then things will be very different from today, and the global temperature will reach the alarming peaks.Sometimes, I even believe their words and I'm quite sure many others also do the same, but still other times we understand that they are doing such things to fool us out. The living beings have been adapting to the nature since thousands of years and they will continue to do that. The survival of the fittest will always be there and the ones who support climate change will also be there, and that's why someone with good understanding of things should try to avoid the climate change thing and continue to live his/her life in the way it is. There are many myth that needs to be busted and the Polar bears seems to be playing their role to bust this fake information regarding climate change. Although, I do support the plantation of many trees and reduction of carbon emissions, but I also know that our those small steps won't stop huge factories to stop their operations which are ultimately being the cause of such kind of emissions.",

Maybe I’m misinformed, but I think polar bears are likely to become extinct in the next 100 years. No-ice would be bad, especially for our drinks. But there is still land for polar bears and Eskimos to stand on. And a no-ice situation isn't something that will happen in the near future, anyway. Besides, the polar bears survived when the polar regions didn't have any ice thousands of years ago, but were warm. Of course, just because the bears are thriving doesn't mean that they always will be. However, less ice gives them more ice table edges to stand on as they scoop fish out of the water.Quote from: Gyfts on August 10, 2023, 01:59:15 PMEven if polar bears survive in low ice climates, the argument the activists would use are that sea levels would rise and affect human populations or other wild life.I don't think it's a tenable argument for obvious reasons, though.

I mean, if the leaders of the global warming cult really wanted, they could simply nuke a couple of giant volcanoes into activity, and darken our skies with so much dust that almost no sunlight would get through to warm the earth.They won't do this however... because they are a bunch of BSers and don't want the climate to change much if any. All they want is to put fear into our hearts so that we place our lives under their control to be saved. But then they will have us.",

We are an species who have managed to bend the will of nature to achieve our own purposes, we keep dams up, build cities in the middle of the desert, and manage to turn mass into energy to fuel houses and bombs. There are even scientist who talk about weather/climate control. We have already been proven to be able to make species disappear, a good example for it would be the dodo, and it can happen again with polar bears and other animals.",
