  "content": "As the title says, Google plans to start accepting crypto payments for their cloud service early next year via partnership with Coinbase. No matter  what people think about Coinbase and centralized exchanges in general this is a good news and a step in the right direction regarding crypto adoption. Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/11/google-partners-with-coinbase-to-accept-crypto-payments-for-cloud-services/Google (GOOGL) will start accepting crypto payments for cloud services early next year, according to a press release.Announced Tuesday at Google’s Cloud Next conference, the tech giant said it will receive crypto payment via an integration with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN).Crypto payments will initially be rolled out to a handful of customers involved in the Web3 industry. Google will also user Coinbase's custody service, Coinbase Prime.",

I don't think that it is realistic to expect from such a big company like Google to start accept bitcoin directly P2P. I mean, it would be great of course, but even this is a positive thing. Slow and steady wins the race so who knows, in a few years they might start accepting bitcoin directly.",

They're merely accepting payments through Coinbase, like they accept payments through PayPal.Yes, but they are large enough to do their own credit card processing and banking yet they still use other people to do that. At a guess, they really don't want to deal with any of the financial processing things themselves. They are large enough to be able to negotiate good rates with processors so why bother to invest the time & money & other resources when you can just sign on the line and let someone else deal with the headache.-Dave",

Lolz.  Google could have been better at this by developing something their own, unique product which will attract more and more peeps with whole new experience of making payment through their “trusted brand” like Google. It’s not for the first time they are using the third parties. Like in india they are using UPI and created Google Pay which uses traditional UPI method and keep promoting the app with new promos and stuff.  However, better options soon came into the market and they are now far far better than GPAY. That’s why it’s better they launch something unique. :-D",
