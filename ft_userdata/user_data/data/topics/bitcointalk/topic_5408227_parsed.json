We barely know where you're located, and are you really sure that you're ready to take up suggestions from strangers on a public forum? If you're planning to establish a hedge fund, you should already got these things sorted out because you might already have some surface knowledge on how much the lease is for buildings/office space on your area. IMO, better use that money you got from the banks on other ventures instead. It'll be hard to trust you with the money upon checking your post history.",

      "body": "Open a hedge fund office in a country with tax shelters. Depositors can transfer their withdrawal funds directly into a tax shelter of their choice, while going through a minimum of financial networks and middle men.Another good location could be an area where dark pools and HFT trading is coupled with unusually high internet speed. Algorithmic trades are executed at high speed. A split second advantage in high speed broadband can translate to an advantage and greater profits over competition.Another good thing to check with hedge funds is insurance options. Investors like their funds being protected by a solid insurance policy against theft, etc. Some countries are better for this, than others. ThePirateBay and crypto both popularized locations in international waters to escape regulatory guidelines and set their own rules. If it were possible to locate a hedge fund in space, on mars or the moon. To escape regulation and rules. That could be an attractive option for some.",
