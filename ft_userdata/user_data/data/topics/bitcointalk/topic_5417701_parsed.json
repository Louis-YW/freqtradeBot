  "content": "As you know, as far as we as Europeans are concerned, we are in the middle of an energy crisis, and winter has not even started yet.Between rising gas, electricity, wood, and other prices, coupled with less electricity production than we need, gas shortage...Not even sure about having heat at home for the whole winter... or for a very very high priceThe European Commission has published a paper on energy policy for the Member States.And guess what. Crypto mining is on its roadmap among the many electricity restrictions to come.The document is not exclusively about cryptos. It's about \"the plan on digitalising the energy system\". But notice point #3 \"Does the Action Plan tackle cryptocurrencies.\"the Commission strongly requests to lower the electricity consumption of crypto players,... up to stop crypto mining... In another word, shut down your ASICS immediately. (they also want to stop the fiscal measures benefitting miners but that's another matter)QuoteGiven the current energy crisis and the heightened risks for the coming winter, the Commission urges Member States to implement targeted and ambitious measures to lower the electricity consumption of crypto-asset actors, in line with the proposed Council Regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. In case, there is a need for load shedding in the electricity systems, the Member States must also be ready to stop crypto-assets mining. In the longer-term perspective, it is also crucial to put an end to tax breaks and other fiscal measures benefitting crypto-miners currently in force in certain Member States.On the other hand, lighting up the streets in the middle of the night when no one is around is not a problem[moderator's note: fixed date format]",

Can't say renewable energy will be cheap because if it's the only source, it will not be cheap. It must be mandatory also for people who have turbines and solar panels to join the grid.

It's hard to please people, because they will always find a reason to complain - like some people in my neighborhood who never turn off the lights, and then complain that they have high electricity bills.Quote from: bittraffic on October 21, 2022, 02:47:40 AMIf there is a great way to benefit from mining, I think it's in winter months so it can heat up a room and at the same time make BTC out of it. Are there any mining rigs that are quiet or relatively quiet? I live in the belief that BTC mining is very noisy, so it is not suitable to be located in the premises where we live. Perhaps the solution is a sound-insulated room from which warm air would then be brought to the rooms we want to heat. A few years ago someone invented something similar in Russia, I remember we discussed it on the forum.",

I have bookmarked your post as a reference on where I have heard this speculation first hehehe. In any case, creating a department where they can standardise an industry is giving them the power to control a whole industry. They will certainly make it sure that bitcoin will not pass their energy efficiency label.This will be dangerous for users because the proof of work cryptcoins that might pass will be having the risk of 51% attacks.

In America, the problem caused by their government is they limited the drilling of oil and production of fossil fuel based sources of fuel. If the government was serious about solving this problem they should lift the limit and allow their oil producers to drill more. There are some articles that mentioned that the oil reserves of America is decreasing and more reduction might force them to ration fuel.@cr1776. They can ban but they cannot enforce the ban.

      "body": "@bbc.reporterStealing electricity is when you use the energy of someone else, or do not pay your. But using your electricity while you're not allowed is something else. I'm not sure if it could be considered stealing.If we consider a miner as an individual, yes sure he could continue to mine bitcoin at home and stay unnoticed but if a government really wants to stop mining, it could be quite easy to do so.For example, there are plenty of people who have been caught growing cannabis in their homes.And it's easy to find out. If you have two people in your household and you consume as much as a household of six people, then you are doing something wrong at home.And it's easier nowadays for countries (like mine) where we now have smart electricity meters (even for the water)If we consider a miner a company, it's even easier. Since the company is supposed to be closed (no activity so you close the company). A bit like during the lockdowns with covid.If a company declares its monthly income to pay taxes, then it has had an activity. How can it carry out its activity as it is not supposed to use electricity?Anyway, if you think twice about this European directive, it will depend on the willingness of European countries to really limit energy consumption. I mean, there will certainly be several countries that will say well fuck, there are more important things to worry about and mining is insignificant",

However, this is a temporary measure. But for Russia, the negative effect will be much stronger, and most importantly, for a very long term.

Yes, but that's the exact reason I mentioned the numbers.Of course, nobody can force every citizen in the EU to stop stealing electricity for any kind of activity, nobody can ban everyone running an Appolo miner that draws just 200w, and there will be people who will still avoid this ban even with ASIC miners.For example, in my case, it would be easy to hide one or two ASICs in the farm run by a family just as I run a few now completely legally and paying my bill, but in all these cases where somebody can hide a few miners, the overall number won't matter compared to the actual hashrate.
