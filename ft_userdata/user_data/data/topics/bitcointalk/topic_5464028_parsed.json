The lunar module crashed during landing. It was not enough that the communist ideology destroyed the USSR, so a person with a diploma from the university of Marxism-Leninism was entrusted with such a complex scientific and technical project. Ragozin, who for many years led this space project, once again proved the viciousness of the theory of Communism. Ragozin obviously did not care how to overcome the gravity of the Earth, whether on a trampoline or on a rocket. Now his advice to Elon Musk to use a trampoline is clear.08/21/2023",
