It's my OpinionStill early to get yourself a professional Name/BrandAlso the withdrawal method none of it is BTC so i Â don't think your Casino site or whatever belongs to this ForumAnd another noteÂ  : if your site is legit then its perfect for money laundry just deposit crypto and only way to withdraw is fiat you might get in trouble with that fiat payment providersBut all of it looks ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º russian so you might get away with AML troubles.",
