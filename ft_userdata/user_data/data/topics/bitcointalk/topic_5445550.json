  "content": "Very recently in my country, there has been an upsurge in scarcity of fiat money, The world is evolving and so also every spheres of life keeps advancing. It is no longer a novelle thing that carrying cash has its limitations and does harm than good, examining the current finding made by the Nigerian government. This is the more reason the Nigerian government presently adopts the Cashless policy which is aimed at reducing the issues of kidnapping, corruption and insecurities in the country.  A lot of people can barely withdraw their money, the banks are not ready to give you money in large sum, people go as far as buying the countries currency notes, this situation has made a lot of people go into untold financial crisis, because a large chunk of the population are heavy dependent on fiat money. Even the banking system are not prepared for the cashless policy this I understand by the series of network failures and lost of money by bank customers through electronic cash transactions.This whole situation reminds me of the beauty Bitcoin has brought, a decentralised currency that makes your financial life self-controlling, government innuendos doesn't affect it in any way, because at all times, your in control of your asset.  Cryptocurrency  as a financial digital currency has made a huge impact in the present world. Bitcoin the most popular coin which has made numerous individual in attaining their financial goals. Cases of excessive control by the centralized financial systems has made number of persons loose their faith in their financial institution as the safety of their finances is not guaranteed. In the case of BTC, the security of ones investment is prioritized because your details is confidential to oneself alone. It's like owning your own future without external interference, and I suggest that some of the financial crisis most of these developing countries are facing can be resolved through their adoption of bitcoin in their country just as El Salvador did and are having a positive impact of it on their economy.",

I don't see in any way where this cashless policy reduces any of your aforementioned crimes, kidnappings, corruption, and insecurities. That might have been their public reason for the cashless policy, but its unofficial reason was the redesigning of the old note into a new one in order not to reach some certain politicians, who they believe hold huge amounts of the old currency and it's preventing it from circulation, which they all planned to use during the past election, which to some point does help in reducing vote buying.Quote from: Spaceman1000$ on March 19, 2023, 04:48:24 PM without external interference, and I suggest that some of the financial crisis most of these developing countries are facing can be resolved through their adoption of bitcoin in their country just as El Salvador did and are having a positive impact of it on their economy.El Salvador's government took a great step by making Bitcoin a legal tender, which is a great achievement for the Bitcoin community in general.The adoption of Bitcoin by the control government, which is the opposition party to the government, is titled to be a mandate upon its people. It's not all situations that I believe Bitcoin being introduced can solve. Even without the Nigerian public accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender, I still believe based on past statistics that Nigeria has the highest number of Bitcoin adopters, more than El Salvador. I really don't view Bitcoin as something that can solve any country's economic crisis by just adopting it. Bitcoin doesn't perform magic.",

Those in Government does whatever they thought of with our money, the Politician carries our money in a Sack bags leaving You and I under restriction of cash flow, there is no way this cashless policies have tried to stop corruption in Nigerian.

The thing is what is the difference when the transaction due to the limitation is covered with the same fee once a person is to withdraw their savings to cash after they convert Bitcoin or any form of online transfers since it still undergo with the processing of the bank and thus the same limitations and charges is applied.I understand as long as our fund stays in Bitcoin government won't be able to control them but as the stated concern when we are about to use or convert BTC to fiat and withdraw it to use for local purchases, I believe there is no difference.  So it is more likely those who wanted to escape or avoid limitations should do online transactions with Bitcoin and the same issue arises about local merchants that accept Bitcoin as a mode of online payment is somehow scarce.In the end, we need more local merchants to accept Bitcoin if we wanted to capitalize on the freedom of transaction but still, the issue of the legality of accepting Bitcoin is another concern.",

Adoption of bitcoin will not suddenly solve the financial crisis some countries are facing. Many factors put together result in a host of financial crisis, and until those factors are individually dealt with and addressed, there will always be a recurrence of financial crisis. Bitcoin adoption can be a part of the solution, but it is not the whole solution to that problem.",

And talking about the money scarcity, it's only for their selfish interest. Most importantly, they made the naira so scarce because of the just concluded election and that's it.",

I think, it's definitely worth considering alternative currencies like Bitcoin, especially given its decentralized nature and the control it gives individuals over their own assets. Secondly, interesting to see how El Salvador has already embraced Bitcoin and is reaping the benefits of its adoption. So, could be a viable solution for other developing countries facing similar financial crises. However, it's important to also consider the potential risks and challenges that may arise with the adoption of cryptocurrency and weigh them against the benefits.",

If Bitcoin isn't accepted in any local exchange in your country, then you can seek out an online exchange instead. In my case, my country has not yet legalized Bitcoin as an official asset. Therefore, I always sell my Bitcoin to a reputable buyer whom I know in person, and this method has worked well every time, I never had a problem with it cause I trust the person I'm dealing with and I've known him for years already.",
