  "content": "Acceptance of gays ,lesbianism and transgenders is determined by the way of life and the belief in the society they find themselves at.In the western world it is easily acceptable, even some clergy men accept such while in countries like africa, it is considered to be a taboo ,it is against the african belief and tradition even as the acceptance and domination of the western world,it is considered a crime and purnishable by law if found guilty. Same sex marriage is not going to be possible in african countries. African are very strict and do not condule what they see as nonsense,they maintain and adhere strictly to their way of life and belief  .",

Personally I am not against the homosexual, Lesbian or Transgender but the country where we belong determine what we can do, we still can move to other place where you got the support no need to stuck inside the box forever.",

      "body": "Just look at many of these hypocrite companies' social media logo during this Pride month, compare the Western branch with those in China and the Middle East. That should show you were it's acceptable or not. Even these companies aren't delusional enough to insist on celebrating it where it's unacceptable. I'm fine with people being able to live their lives without being harassed though it seems that the lgbt is being pushed in the West to normalize the people that call themselves \"MAP\". It seems to be a slippery slope.",

It looks absurd to hear. Africa is more traditional reflecting in her leaders. I remember few years back in Africa, some countries were persuaded to adopt the liberal system but most countries refused and that caused depriving of aids and other support and relieve services from some organisations and countries in the developed community. Although not making it public or legal in Africa doesn't mean that some practice of such is not going on.",

Although not making it public or legal in Africa doesn't mean that some practice of such is not going on.It was Barack Obama who tried it when he was the president of the USA. He felt that he would force Africa into accepting his proposal because Africans could not live without aids from the US. Even Kenya which was the country of his origin refused his proposal. It is true that Africa is a traditional continent but there are still some people who are exposed to this western culture that allows homosexuality. Even there are religious people in Africa who practice homosexuality, both Christians and Muslims.",

      "body": "Well, it should be remembered that homosexuality was punishable by imprisonment in many places last century. In England it was decriminalized in 1967 but in Scotland it took until 1980 and Northern Ireland in 1982. Prior to those dates, homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was a criminal act (source).It should also be noted that the WHO ceased to considerate homosexuality as a mental illness in 1990.So the prohibitions on the subject that exist today in other countries are like the ones we had until recently.The problem in this regard is Europe, which receives the most African immigration. A lot of feminism, a lot of instilling in children that there are 82 genders and at the same time applauding massive African immigration, mostly Islamic, which produces a cultural clash.We see the example in the suburbs of Paris, as where the Champions League final was played. You have mostly Islamic neighborhoods with second or third generation French people who do not integrate. Forget about the 82 genders in those areas.Shameful images emerge of the muggings at the Stade de FranceThiago's wife details 'scary' Champions League final as 'robbers tried to assault us'Of course, Macron blamed the robberies, threats and assaults on the British, lol.",

It has now gone to ridiculous levels that you can get cancelled for trying to answer the \"What is a woman?\" question. You've probably heard of the issue with \"Lia\" Thomas. It's frustrating to see these happening.",
