Just yesterday,  CZ wey be CEO and Founder of Binance, don talk say e guilty to violate money laundering rules. E don agree say e go pay one fine of $50 million. and also agree say e go step down as the CEO as part of the guilty plea. And that same yesterday CZ don officially resign and e don bid bye bye to en office as the CEO of Binance, although e still make himself accessible to the company say them fit still consult am anytime at all. You go also like to know say Binance sef don Plead guilty and dem charge dem. Dem don also gree say dem go pay fine of $4.3 billion and dem go do restitution to the government join. E be like say the matter don serious well well.. Now my concern be say, e be like say the future of Binance dey uncertain. With all the tension and negative news wey surround the company, e possible say e go hard for dem to survive. Even if dem don name new CEO, people still dey withdraw their money from the exchange because of fear say the exchange fit crash, e fit affect Binance seriously. The tragedy and the bad publicity fit make people lose trust for the company, and this go affect how people take see and trust the exchange. We no fit talk for sure wetin go happen, but Binance go need find way take handle this matter and try regain the trust of their users. Wetin you think for this matter?",

Na binance be one of the most trusted exchange not only for Nigeria but for the entire world, so with kind of money laundering em come go put em hand. Like this na very big part of the company reputation don spoil like this, any way the reason I believe wey make am  just agree to stepdown freely na because maybe em no want the company to just die like that, but the thing wey still dey border me na, how em take get the mind to just freely give up the company like that, abi no be everything wey that news carry??? But this one sef na one reason wey go still act as experience to those wey dey keep their money for exchange, the main purpose of exchange wey i dey see na just to use am swap coins and to exchange crypto to fiat nothing else, so if anybody get coin for binance just go sell am or transfer am to wallet.",

This is the more reason why it isn't advisable to leave ones cryptos on an exchange because of stories of this nature. Now everybody will be very scared and careful with binance because with the recent development now they actually gonna battle trust issues.",

Binance that is not even registered in Nigeria, just like other exchanges that are also not registered but providing P2P exchange for Nigerians. If there is no Binance again, Nigeria will move to other exchanges. But if no Binance again, this will significantly affect the crypto market, but bitcoin will survive and other exchanges will later grow. It is also worth knowing that CZ is just not the CEO again but Binance is still existing. CZ has announced new CEO on Twitter yesterday. Richard Teng is the new Binance CEO.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1727063503125766367",

Anyhow e be we must survive many worst case has happened over crypto space yet nothing changes rather their competitors took over, it's would likely be to Binance if people noticed any foul play from them they don't have any plans than to switch to other exchange they will have trust and put their funds.Just that we are used to Binance like something most of us here love using, even me self also love using Binance but if I sense whatever that is not trusted I moved from there and starts using other exchange.",

Now that Richard Teng has be replaced CZ as the new binance CEO, it show that there will be positive results that will allow investors to achieve what they have never achieve before in binance to happen in this Richard Teng government because many people want to see new policy that will encourage them to trust binance again.We need to apply wisdom with binance now because, for Richard Teng to become a new binance CEO show that many things is about to happen that will make people money to be at risk because if CZ can be guilty on such crime show that he will be punish any moment from now and it will make some strange things happen to binance users if Richard Teng fail to play his role.",

E be like say the matter don serious well well.. Now my concern be say, e be like say the future of Binance dey uncertain. Binance is one of the exchange with the largest trading volume of over $70b if not the leading exchange in cryptocurrencies, known for their low trading and transaction fees changes when compared to other exchanges. It  can be argued that despite binance being a CEX it enjoys a bigger trust level than some Dex exchanges and this is as a result of the reputation it has been able to established, preserve and it's pivot role to crypto adoption since it's inception.Changpeng Zhao made a smart move in the interest of binance and it's community by resigning from his position as CEO giving way to a new era, and with his resignation some tensions and sentiments that are mounted on the company owing to CEO position  might  be withdrawn with a new phase of business for binance.QuoteWith all the tension and negative news wey surround the company, e possible say e go hard for dem to survive. Even if dem don name new CEO, people still dey withdraw their money from the exchange because of fear say the exchange fit crash, e fit affect Binance seriously. The tragedy and the bad publicity fit make people lose trust for the company, and this go affect how people take see and trust the exchange. We no fit talk for sure wetin go happen, but Binance go need find way take handle this matter and try regain the trust of their users. Wetin you think for this matter? It is common to see binance users expressing FUD as a result of this tragedy  making rapid withdrawals of their funds, it's a critical moment for the community but saying that binance will crash based on this event is an impossible projection for a multi billion dollars company with such financial details as quoted below (as at the time this comment was made).QuoteCurrently, there are 364 coins and 1193 trading pairs available on the exchange. Binance 24h volume is reported to be at $13,816,296,673.96, a change of 25.6% in the last 24 hours. The most active trading pair is BTC/FDUSD with a 24h volume of $2,056,014,317.23. Binance has $67,542,544,852.76 in Exchange Reserves.  source.",

Now wey this thing don be like this, how people go take do am?My brother I want you to understand one thing first and that thing be say Crypto is bigger than one person. And I want you to understand that no single individual or government can bring down bitcoin or crypto currency trading. Yes if a company like binance has a case and the case and they lost the case that doesn't mean it is the end of crypto trading in our country or around the world. So you saying that with what has happened to CZ of binance how a big country like Nigeria that is ranked high in crypto trading is highly not a good representation of the ideology behind bitcoin creation. Bitcoin will continue to exist even when we all are gone. So irrespective of who is going down in cryptocurrency industry, crypto will continue trading. What we can only see in the market is a temporary dip which is common in the crypto world when there is panic in the market.
