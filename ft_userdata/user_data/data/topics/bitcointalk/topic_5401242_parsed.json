      "body": "You can try the FinderOuter. The GUI is relatively simple, read the quick guide in github. With only 1 missing word, it should take few seconds. Alternatively, use btcrecover; note that it's harder to setup and use than FinderOuter. Edit: I assume you're just missing 1 word. Your English aren't the best as BitMaxz says.",

If you know the exact position of that word then finding the correct one shouldn't take more than a milliseconds using any automated tool. You can even do it manually.If there are more than one word missing or you don't know the exact position then you can try FinderOuter as suggested above by BlackHatCoiner or BTCRecover (you can read about how it works and how to use it from here:https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For both tools, knowing one of the children private keys or addresses will help to speed up the recovery process.",

I'm a bit confused it seems that you have 3 missing words the first, middle, and the last word, or does your friend only have 2 words the first and the last word?Anyway, I think all you need is already posted above. What I would you to do before you use those tools above after downloading them make sure to run them offline or run them on an Airgapped PC for safety purposes.",

Do you mean that the FinderOuter tool is slow? It seems this tool currently does not support GPU so the speed depends on your Ram and CPU.",

These will be the fastest way to attempt to recover your seed phrase.If you don't know one of the addresses and its derivation path from the wallet, then you should use btcrecover with an address database instead: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Creating_and_Using_AddressDB/",
