For example, the way I see it, Bitcoin will likely survive 90% of currently publicly traded companies. But on the other hand it's unlikely to outlive land ownership. Gold is, in my highly speculative opinion, somewhere in the middle, depending on whether mankind will ever manage to mine precious metals outside of earth.But I'm biased, of course, and just wildly speculating. So don't base any decision making on it.",

The coin has done well for itself in years and would see more adoptions afterwards. But there would always be an alternative that would want to displace it over time which would be the ulterior plan of the government to tap into the blockchain technology but in a more centralized manner, thereby waging war on the exiting ones later.Aside from this, I see no threat to the future of Bitcoin in both the near and far terms.",

Some people hope that with the existence of blockchain and cryptography technology, Bitcoin can help address some security and privacy problems in the current payment system.It is important to remember that although Bitcoin has the potential to be an efficient and secure payment tool, there are still many things that need to be learned and resolved before the technology can be widely used. As with anything new and emerging, there are still many unknowns and risks to consider.Therefore, to understand and consider the potential risks and benefits before investing in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency technology, it is advisable to consult with financial and technology experts or discuss in forums and seek information that can help you understand the risks and make the right decisions.",

Relying on hope is not what got bitcoin to a 400 billion dollar market cap.Yes I agreed with you, I do not totally put my hope on it, though humans sometimes we feel insecure over what you're doing. I know many people do not believe on bitcoin maybe because of past experience on internet but is good to if what you're doing has a future to hold on to, with that you will be comfortably introducing to others. People worries too much this days probably because of price depreciating to this point and the pulled out of some countries bitcoin investment like China.

It is well deep rooted asset now and its everywhere, those who have accessed, downloaded a wallet, surfed a chain, mining devices and framework around the globe and basically internet. There is no way this data will get deleted overnight and the fail safe coding was already done by the satoshi. That is why we have hundreds and thousands of confirmation of every transaction which means that much times it was checked and verified by the miners and it's being store in the nodes. Practically the database has been copied so many times that it is now next to impossible to delete or manipulate. Thus, it will keep running even I am in my corpse suit in 80 years from now.",

Therefore, the goal for Bitcoin is that it will develop further as a decentralized, digital money that offers a substitute for established fiat currencies.

It is too soon to tell because not even a generation has passed since bitcoin was created, I believe it has the potential to be an asset like that similar to what we see with gold today, but potential is not the same as being a reality, who knows what it may happen during the next decades which could change everything and then bitcoin is no longer the asset we thought it was, so like always we need to keep our eyes open and see how this market develops before we make any hasty conclusion.",
