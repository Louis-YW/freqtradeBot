Cash app rejected my Bitcoin deposit for no reason and then when I reversed it into my coinbase it got stuck on the blockchain. CashApp sent it with a very very low fee which I had no say so over and they won't do anything to help me.I don't have enough money to pay the fees on viabtc... the only money I have is the BTC that's pending  I need it really bad please help me...95fbf6da860e75ff47a1096583771001e3498702a818b72d4a25024d07ca5181",

That's what true accelerators do, (not scammers like you've encountered) they have a pool in which they include the tx they want to be confirmed despite low fees.But no small miner here has that hashing power to help you.Now, since the free one isn't working then you have two choices:- wait...and that can be a long wait and you tx will either get confirmed or dropped and then you can go and ask cashapp to send it again- pay for a real accelerator, viabtc is a bit way to expensive but binance pool or mempool.space itself might be cheaper, what I got it's 20-25$ , your choice, at least those are for sure not scammers.Quote from: Ultegra134 on November 29, 2023, 07:40:05 AMWhat happens if it never goes through? Does it return back to the sender, if so, how long does that take, because it's already 21 days the transaction was broadcasted.If it gets dropped completely then is as it never happed in the first place, as for the time there is no actual rule, it depends too much on the connected nodes and their size, I've seen tx getting confirmed after 6 months in the mempool, plus rebroadcasting it as the OP did does help a bit to keep it alive if small nodes drop it temporary and now they are have free space to hold it again.",

However, how is your reply anywhere helpful to the OP? You're claiming that he wouldn't have such an issue with Bitcoin SV, how is that of any help? Transaction accelerators are the only possible solution to quicken the resolution of OPs issue. Personally, I never faced such an issue before, the OP has fallen in a pitfall of another 3rd party platform, if he had conducted the transaction himself, it would have gone through just fine.I don't understand though, you're in a forum named after Bitcoin, do you actually believe that people are going to accept your opinion regarding a Bitcoin fork?",

As for the OP and his problem, maybe he won't need a transaction accelerator because the mempool is slowly emptying, and maybe his transaction will be confirmed in the next 2-3 days. If he waited 3 weeks, maybe he should wait another 3 days, but if he has $20 to pay for acceleration, it will definitely not be an expensive lesson to be a little more careful with the services he will use in the future.",

You said you use Coinbase. That is custodial, and yes, if so, you can't bump the fee, because of how the Coinbase software is designed. If the wallet software you use is one of the reputable open-source, then it is most likely supporting RBF or CPFP (which is not needed nowadays with Full RBF). PS: Ignore the troll.",

Coinbase wallet and exchange are two different accounts so if you are receiving funds to your exchange's bitcoin address then it will be only shown there. If I am not wrong, I already replied to you about why you can't use free TX acceleration on another thread.The positive thing is the Mempool has been clearing for the past couple of days, so if it goes at this rate then your TX will be confirmed in a week (max).

Consider it a lesson learned. If you have no choice but to use custodial services, at least consider using a non custodial wallet in the middle. Instead of sending directly from cash app to coinbase, if you have sent from cash app to your own wallet then to coinbase then, at least, you could have the choice to accelerate the stuck transaction since you could be either the receiving or the sending party!",

Today we had a 30sats/vbyte before It is climbing back up again. As for the dropping of the transaction I don’t think OP will get that now because first it looks like the transaction is been rebroadcasted by the CashApp repeatedly since the transaction as been there for three weeks now and this will not help in the dropping of the transaction. Also yes the purge is set at 9sats/vbyte but that is not the general rule because node have different capacity of how many transactions can be stored on their mempool and some could still have transactions with fees lower than that purge value in their mempool and that will cause it not to be totally dropped from the pool.",

Surely op accelerated this tx, because fee rate in the mempool hasn't dropped as low as the fee rate they attached to their tx.",
