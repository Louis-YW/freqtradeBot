And the last one could be, C++ allowed the Bitcoin developers to have direct access to the systems, enabling them to write code that interacts efficiently with the system resources.  Whatever the reason is, as long as it operates in a decentralized way and C++ was suitable for it.",

I vaguely remember reading a similar comment years ago, but with less substance and also less infotainment factor.You mentioned the low error-to-codel-ratio could be an indication for a team working behind the pseudonym of Satoshi - how likely do you personally rate this hypothesis to be true and are there other indicators pointing in that direction?",

I think Satoshi chose to write Bitcoin in C++ programming language because he was good at that language and his main programming language at that time might be C++ because of the wide acceptability. He might have also tried the thing using other codes and failed to get it into the state that C++ helped him to get. I might be wrong but that's what I think of right now.Everyone knows that C++ was and is one of the most famous programming languages out there and many of the top software creators have mastered the language and have built applications specifically in that language.  Some of those well known applications that have been built using C++ code are Adobe Photoshop, Google chrome, Git, Dropbox, and many others. The most of the AAA titles use that language for creating those high graphics games. Even the operating systems are mainly codded with C++ programming language.In 2008 the best language for programmers was C++ and there were many guides, and tutorials available for that language. Other languages weren't as efficient and as useful for creating high quality software piece in those times, the best programmers of the era chose C++ for their projects and most of those applications are still based on the same code with fixed bugs and added features.So, if we keep all those things in our mind than it was a good decision to chose C++ over other programming languages to create a safe and useful digital currency for the world. Even if we leave the coding language behind, it's still a inspiring thing to notice that someone like Satoshi gave us a gift in the form of Bitcoin and he was so sincere that he left it in the hands of the community. If fame was his intention then he would never disappear from the scene, and trust me he would be among the richest and most famous people of the world if he didn't chose to disappear.",

One reason is probably the time-period they learned computer-science related stuff - until the early 2000s c++ was still very popular, before the uprising of Javascript and other web-focused languages.Another very important aspect as to why c++ is probably one of the best fits for Bitcoin Core is it's closeness to Assembly. C and C++ allow low-level memory management and offer one of best performances compared to a ton of newer languages.These are just my amateur guesses though.",
