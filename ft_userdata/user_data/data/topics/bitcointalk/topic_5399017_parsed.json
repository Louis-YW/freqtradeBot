Although each of these coins has its own risks and uncertainties, this diversification seems more or less safe, and these stablecoins are very widespread, they have stood the test of time, and they don't lose their dollar peg as much.",

Given the problems that have arisen with algorithmic stablecoins, you should refrain from using them. In other cases, you should consider saving your funds in USDC and BUSD stablecoins.",

Yeah, I know it has it's own issues before but so far it remain as the only stable coins that might have corned the market since it's inception. And hopefully it will not have the same problem as Luna because that will be a disaster and it could even have a huge impact, bigger than Luna effect.",

It is definitely more transparent than the most popular USDT. But it doesn't mean that putting my funds in USDC is making my funds safer. If you are avoiding the volatility of crypto for a short while, then it is good enough. But if your funds are kept in it for a long time, I'd rather keep it in Bitcoin.",

That's the bad thing on USDT since it's not 100% backed with the real USD and there's a case where USDT can be frozen even inside on your wallet. But many people doesn't really care with that since they're not the one who face that's case, in the end it's not safe since it has a risk.Choose the decentralized stable coin e.g. DAI as the alternative.",

These are top trustworthy and best secure stable coin . You can easily use them for trading without any worry . USDT has the support of Tether . It is the first stable coin .  And usdc minted on Etherium . These sources are also reputable so I think those will be best for you .",

The USDT case is still unclear, which must have detected a problem in it and I definitely prefer BUSD,USDC because there is no indication of a problem. We are really careful about this so that it doesn't happen again like the UST that went down badly. I hope that in the future problems like USDT can be resolved and not harm investors",
