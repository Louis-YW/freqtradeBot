  "content": "i was going through the pawprofit forum when i came across this thread about flash bitcoin and immediately i reported the post and it got deleted but recently, i think earlier today, someone made another thread https://pawprofitforum.com/threads/where-to-buy-flash-bitcoin.294/post-336 with a more convincing elaboration about the flash bitcoin and at this point, i'm really confused as to the basic motive behind the flash bitcoin, because personally for me, i think the idea behind it was for scam purpose and if greatly embraced, might do more harm than good and i have to bring the topic on here for more proper discussion as to what the major motive of flash bitcoin iswill be glad to have more people share their ideas to help safe other people from possible harm as these flash bitcoin can even be swapped to other coins",

It is a coin in my wallet, assumes it is a non custodial wallet, and it should not leave out my wallet if I don't send it out.It's my non custodial wallet, my private key, and my coin with full control by myself, if it leaves out of my wallet without my action, it's scam.Reading the topic title, I think it is Flash Bitcoin as another Bitcoin fork or another scam altcoin that tries to use Bitcoin in its name.",

While I admit it's a good thing, I'm however slightly interested on whatever mental gymnastic the scammer wrote as you have said it's a more convincing elaboration. ðŸ¤”It would've been nice if the full post was quoted instead. But I'm assuming the core idea is just the same that has been going around in bitcointalk as well, no?
