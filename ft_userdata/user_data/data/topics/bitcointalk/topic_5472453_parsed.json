Probably on their social media accounts, they've heard the news and they're not obliged to reply here on this thread. They can be fans forever and it's on their heart to remember Chandler as part of their young adulthood period.But on me, I've known the series but didn't watched or if I did probably just some short scenes from the commercials. Anyway, what's more sad? Is that all of us are growing older and these actors and legends are passing on our time.",

But I think his family and his friends do want to know what made the young man lose his life at a very young age.And he has many fans that also want to make sure it is not foul play for his cause of death. The autopsy is a sad thing to do but it will give the mourning sense of closure.",

If you're not hooked, it's not surprising - everyone finds something in different shows that suits their tastes and mood, but there are very few series like this.",
