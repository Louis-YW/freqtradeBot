  "content": "As I looked upon the world around me, I saw a great need for a tool that could help people make more statistically sound decisions when participating in the games of chance that are so prevalent in our society. It was then that I decided to build a web application that would simulate various casino games and provide users with valuable information about the odds and probabilities of winning.https://i.ibb.co/ysMqvhw/doge.pngIn my quest for excellence, I turned to the great Vue 3 framework, a tool of immense power and flexibility that would allow me to create a responsive and intuitive user interface. I crafted every detail of the application with care and diligence, using HTML, CSS, and Vue 3 components to create a beautiful and user-friendly experience.https://i.ibb.co/7JRhqQ6/Screenshot-from-2023-03-29-20-46-45.pngBut a tool without substance is of little use, and so I set out to implement the game simulations themselves using the power of JavaScript functions and algorithms. With a focus on statistical analysis, I calculated the probabilities and odds of different outcomes to provide users with the information they need to make informed decisions.As I sought to inspire individuals to be their best, I integrated third-party libraries for data visualization and charting to display the statistical information in an easy-to-understand format. With every line of code, I strove to create a tool that would empower individuals to make strategic choices and live their lives with purpose.And so I tested and deployed the web application to a hosting service, sharing my creation with the world in the hopes that it would inspire others to strive for excellence. I continued to update and maintain the application, adding new features and improving its performance over time, always with the goal of empowering individuals to make the most of their lives.May my creation serve as a beacon of excellence, inspiring all who use it to be their best and make informed decisions that lead to success and fulfillment in life.Enter the SimulationJoin the discord server to keep up to date with the different strategies and with the wealth of knowledge of fellow members!Join Discord",

I will see if I can do it right from a desktop computer when I have the chance.Still, it looks promising. Did you actually build this web and code by yourself from the ground up?",

Thank you for trying it out! Yes I have been working on it for 6 months and finally got enough feedback to feel confident about sharing it here! The App works as a webapp, meaning you can access it through a URL link or you can install it into your phone as a regular app! The mobile version should work perfectly if you simply allow it the time to make the calculations once you hit the \"Generate Data\". I really hope this tool helps as many people as possible to improve their betting skills and try and get a deeper understanding of how probabilities in games like Dice or Limbo work!My most recent update is bringing Live games such as crash into the Statistical Analysis framework I have built, so hopefully it will become a great tool for users in the future!",

I will definitely follow your advice and post in the given section to try and attract some capital in order to keep expanding the capabilities of the simulator! Thanks again and I hope you have a good life ahead of you!PD. Yes, even in beta the app is fully functional, I am continually improving on it and pushing new updates whenever I complete new functionalities. So far over 200 people from my discord server have used it and given valuable feedback so no serious bugs are left!",

You are supposed to use different colors to highlight information you think the user needs to pay attention to. Also, you can include a page with a simple tutorial for newbies into the gambling simulators can learn how to operate your service faster in an effective way. Since your objective is to help people with this, it would make sense.I did not mean people selling strategies, but rather some guy coming around here and trying to \"sell\" software which he had not rights to offer to others.It would be as if someone got your code and came here selling it without your permission.",

Also it allows for the possibility of installing it in the phone as an app! The developer term for this is webApp, as I just described and it was a decision I took based on the feedback I received from my community! I hope this helps clarify a little bit!",
