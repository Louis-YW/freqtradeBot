And now it's you who has lost money with altcoins I assume. Did all that take place in different time frames or were both of you losing money and making bad investment decisions at the same time?Those two cases will hopefully be enough to make you see things a bit clearer from now on. One thing you should remember is you and your friend didn't lose money because of the way crypto and bitcoin works. Therefore, the industry isn't accountable and responsible for your actions. If you send bitcoin to a scammer or you get phished or hacked, it's not the network that made a mistake. In fact, the blockchain worked the way it was configured to operate. That means allowing the people who control the private keys to spend the coins protected by it. It's important to use common sense and make decisions calmly. Don't let euphoria or FOMO trick you into making irreversible mistakes.",

Well i hope you've truly learnt your lessons because in this network people hardly do that, there are investors who jump on every new project and investment, despite the fact that they have lost so much money to pump and dump coins, but they still jump an any new one that's released, just blatant rinse and repeat.",

First of all, everyone should know what exactly you are investing in, and secondly, social networks are a place where you don't trust unknown people, regardless of their sweet talk. I would therefore conclude that it would be better if people did not learn from their mistakes, but if this happens, it is important to admit to yourself what happened and find the strength to start again.The most important thing is not to repeat the same mistake, and this means that you should not trust unknown people who promise success overnight and that you should take every piece of information with a grain of salt - ask questions, look for more sources and determine what is true and what is false.",

Don't be discouraged if you lose money from a poor investment decision. Just try to do what you can to mitigate your losses, learn from the experience and move on. It is hard to see great opportunities when you are limited by a small viewpoint. One of the things I always like to say is that sometimes it is necessary to take a step back and really think about what is happening in the market. Don't let other people's opinions influence your own; listen to them, consider the points they make, but then look at everything from multiple angles and make your own decision. Try to see for yourself how things could play out in reality rather than falling victim to each new hype. It is going to be an exciting ten years for crypto and I hope you will be a part of it!",
