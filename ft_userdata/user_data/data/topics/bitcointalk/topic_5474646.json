  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk community,It's been a long six years since I first created this account, going by the name 'dzypher' to keep a low profile. Back then, my only intention was to be a silent observer, to be a tiny part of the Bitcointalk history without actively participating in discussions. However, life has a way of surprising us, and today, I feel compelled to break my silence and share a personal triumph with all of you.Cancer, a word that changes everything, became an unexpected chapter in my life. But here I am, on the other side of it, not just surviving but thriving. The bills, reminders of the battle fought, are now being covered by the earnings from my ventures into ALTCOINS and MINING. It's amazing how the crypto world, which started as an exploration, has become a lifeline in overcoming life's challenges.During those tough days on the hospital bed, surrounded by the hum of machines and the sterile hospital environment, my mind was far from idle. Years of delving into the intricacies of crypto and blockchain fueled my imagination. It was during those moments of solitude that a vision emerged – a desire to tackle the complexities of cross-border fiat payments using blockchain technology. A goal to make these transactions more seamless, secure, and accessible.Beyond the digital space, I'm eager to connect with those who share a passion for crypto and blockchain. So, if anyone's up for it, I'd love to have a virtual coffee with you. An online gathering where we can share ideas, insights, and maybe form connections that go beyond the digital boundaries of this forum.Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I'm looking forward to engaging with this dynamic community and exploring the endless possibilities that the crypto world offers. Feel free to drop a comment if you'd like to join me for an online coffee or share your thoughts on my journey and aspirations. Cheers!",

We all have those battles we fight every day, but some battles are tougher than others. It's nice to know that you won the battle.I am just curious on what altcoins you did mine at that time and are you still mining them?",

Glad to see you could survive from your cancer caused by crypto. That proves that there is a real use case of crypto just like money.

      "body": "Bravo to a survivor this is most exciting news and story to hear that another member here was able to survive a terminal disease like cancer and you were able to make it out with different goals and ambitions with more reasons to live,  this is an amazing story and a motivation to many that may find themselves in such situation. Although it may not be so much of a deal to some of those who have in-depth knowledge on the mentioned projects since a lot of them have been performing poorly since their lunch and could be a big discouragement for others who may be in such situations and looking for an investment that can truly earn them profits, but since in the ops situation is about recovery from such deadly situation as this,  it has become important to look away from the performance of those coins to see how his recovering process have been motivated via his active participation in mining those coins and not really on the profits making of the investment at some point.",

What's more, the thoughts of crypto related matters kept your mind active throughout your solitary moments. And coming back to fully engage in crypro business is truly heroic, i wish you the very best as you continue in this path. I'm also happy for the OP's luck in making profit in his altcoin venture, to pay his bills, some people who are into altcoin investments are not that lucky, as they have lost their assets in failed altcoins. It's good that you chose ethereum, it's a top altcoin that is reliable and has proven its worth in the crypto market.",

If he does mentioned that his mining and investment did let him survive those medical expenses then we could actually say that it is really that something positive but for those NFT's mentioned above or gamewhich we know that they arent doing good as of now, assuming that his/her cancer treatment in past 2 years or more then we could actually say that it is really indeed relevant with those times which earnings could really be able to patch up.Only a few could really be able to go or deal with mining venture knowing that GPU's or ASICs arent really that cheap and this is why it would really be only a few could really be able to touch up this space because of the cost. Some could able to afford but the electricity cost is too high then it would be no sense on doing so.@OP, life challenges is inevitable and good thing that you do able to survive yours.   Live life to the fullest specially that you haveovercome a very big challenge that you have in life.",

While I'm in the hospital, I've been using the time to spread out my investments. I've decided to put some money into a new business venture, specifically my third coffee shop, which is set to open on December 12. I appreciate the reminder about the importance of staying on top of these things.

The bearish trend has wiped out all of my spirits to farm through play to earn game. In the past two years, my investment journey hit a rough patch. I faced significant losses, reaching five digits, and it was mainly due to my involvement with Axie Infinity and Pegaxy, which didn't go as planned. After learning from these experiences, I've adjusted my strategy. Now, I aim to get in on opportunities early and exit swiftly. This way, I hope to mitigate risks and ensure a more secure investment approach, steering clear of the pitfalls that led to my previous setbacks with Axie Infinity and Pegaxy.",
