When selling majors(BTC, ETH), I mostly just put in sell offers. When selling low caps with low liquidity, I mostly just slowly but surely put in sell offers as to not fill the orderbook with a scary huge sell order. On the other hand, if I see bad news and the market barely reacted yet, I just market sell.",

Just choose an exchange with enough liquidity so that your market sales won't be affecting the price. Choosing to sell via limit or market order depends what you are doing. If you have an exit target you could set up limit orders, or even an iceberg order. If you just want to get out, you can slowly just market sell and save time. But again, liquidity is the key, there's no point trying to sell something even with limit order when there's not enough buy orders. And if you would do that you would have to wait that someone would use your limit order via arbitrage trading. It's just better to use legit sites with good liquidity and save time.",

If I sell because I needed the exchange itself or I need to convert it to a different coin so that I could withdraw it with cheaper fees, I would sell it immediately. But if I sell it because I am trading, then I won't convert it immediately. I will have to create an order for it with the exact selling price that I want. That's what trading is basically, making orders both buy and sell according to your analysis.",

The current prices are so low that I would recommend to buy than to sell. But for the sake of your question I assume that I would need to sell my coins now. Buying and selling is a very similar transaction and I would use the same strategy. Instead of selling all my coins at once I recommend to sell them over time. The timing question is the biggest challenge in trading, nobody knows when is the best time to buy or to sell. That's why I would always choose to sell my coins over several months than at one point in time. The only exception would be if there is a new project that is very promising. If there is the chance to make a big short term profit than I would switch all my money into the new coin.",

If I need the money right away then I just sell it on the market offers. Its not like a huge difference when bid on a sell offer. But If Im not on a rush then I just hold a good position on my liking and wait for it. Thats what I do when I am doing trading but not all the time since nowadays its quite bearish so its hard to do a short term trading.",

They are forcing you to sell your coins for the instant price they want (cheapest one), since you can't increase it a little, but only to a much more expensive price, nobody is going to purchase soon.",

If someone knows that the price may go up, then why should the sell it instantly in the first place? Because they need the money instantly. So they sell at market price. Other reason could be the fear of price dump. If someone trade their assets emotionally and think that they made a mistake and wants to keep the remaining assets from going down, then they sell immediately. In this case, this needs to be avoided. But if someone is in need of money instantly, then they will sell. And also it's their personal choice.",
