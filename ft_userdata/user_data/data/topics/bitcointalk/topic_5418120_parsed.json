It’s a big risk to invest in memecoins but if you do, don’t risk too much because most of them don’t have longevity imo.",

It's not even a shit coin season but this is a bearish season. So many shit coin goes dead due to the low liquidity and demand. that's a way to generate money easily but you can also lose all of your money at once when the dev will be rugpulling your money from the defi.",

Developers will have to find a way to make money, so they will create this shitcoin and promote it like it's a hidden gem or something and then people are going to buy. It's just more evident in the bear market, because the market is dry and everything is being magnify as all eyes on the new and latest project that is coming out. And it's either a shitcoin and meme coin. remember when the Queen died, many meme coins suddenly appear?, check them out, they are all dead, (no pun intended).",

A lot of them can easily be manipulated and some of them already have a lot of investors but you can't really tell from the volume and trading history until they announce that something is happening on that coin. I managed to get in on some shitcoins in the past and made some money, but ultimately left because the profits are not that good and most of the people that are in the said project together during accumulation phase are greedy and shuts down any buy order that could eclipse their stash. Best to stay on proven coins for the long term, but for the gamble, the shits, and the giggles, you can always go for shitcoins and memecoins.",

Season of memecoin is already over after Shiba Inu copy Doge because Doge alone is a shitcoin and the rest that copy it is shittier than ever. All tokens including top coins is already on bear season. Shitcoin and Meme coin is not exempted to this thread because those people that buying these tokens are now prioritizing on safety of there assets rather than risk it on this kind of nvestment.",

They are not yet done because these developers continue to create nonsense coins and spread them to the market. I couldn't expect their end but instead, I was aware of the situation that meme coins will still be multiplying more and more knowing that there a lot of people are blind enough not to see them. That is why we should be resourceful, we need to check the potentiality of the project, and much better to stay away from these meme coins if we wanted to be sure that we never fall into the wrong investment.",

Memes or shitcoins are useless, their purpose is born to manipulate and inflate, so investing in them should only be done during the bull season. Because in a bull market the new entrants to the market are so big it's easy for Fomoe to the hype, it's pretty easy to invest in memes to make a profit. But during bear season when most people seek safe haven and don't want to take risks, investing in memes is like committing suicide.",

If you have money that are of no use to you, you may actively consider investing in shitcoins for a short period of time. But don't risk any large amount to it. Such kind of nonsense will always remain a part of the bigger crypto market. It has started with the ICO boom of 2017 and I don't see any end to it unfortunately!",

They have a weak resistance toward this season so their inability to handle it is too visible. I agree that not all meme coins are shitcoins because even during this situation, there are meme coins that are showing good potential which could be good proof that they're also a good investment for the long-term run. Doge and Shiba are some coins proving that meme coins could also be profitable.",

The longer bear market continuation goes on, the more useless coins will be delisted in the crypto industry. Memecoins are usually pumped by famous individuals or influencers for business purposes, otherwise, we all know there is no value behind these projects. most of these coins are only for short-term purposes of possibly earning profits from trading. other then that, i don't think they are worth holding in the long run. once you got your profits, discard and move on. don't look back.as we all know, the \"devs\" of this type of coin are not here for long mission of work, but only to get as much money as they can and run away afterwards.though they don't deserve a place in this market, however, we can't control these people to create crappy projects as we have no regulations on such matter.",
