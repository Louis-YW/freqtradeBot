  "content": "hey guys, i am writing this post to get some help from you guys! i have some small assets in one wallet which has been infected by bot! each transaction i am sending for the gas fee (matic) is getting sent out to a wallet automatically! i can not move any of my tokens. i have searched many websites watched many videos and it isn't working thus i am loosing more money trying. i have came across a video in YouTube where he explained how you can send fee from your receiver wallet (which is not hacked/new wallet/where you are able to keep your gas fee) to withdraw the assets in your hacked wallet.i tried to contact him and he said that he uses a bot which is paid. and I can't afford to buy that bot for 250$ that's a huge price for me. and i was wondering if anyone can share me their knowledge on how can i pay fee from receiver's wallet to recover my assets from hacked one! the amount in the hacked wallet is low as i mentioned before.. so if anyone can help me here, will be awesome! i know many of us are facing this bot scam everywhere and it has become a pain... please share with us how can we recover this assets and if you know how to use the \"pay fee from receiver's wallet \" then please share with us... [note: the bot used in that costs $250. I don't have much to buy that! so if there's anyone facing the same problem and want to recover their tokens. please contact me. we can split the buying price and recover our assets. the owner has told me that i can share it with others too! so i thin if we can recover our assets from this then 3/4$ investment won't be a big amount if we can split the price into that amount.. please let me know. but it's totally up to you. here's the link to the video. you can do you own research on this to validate if this is legit or not. https://youtu.be/W9cUpNJHhEA]Mods, please don't delete this post. i posted this on off topic section and there was no reply. i thought people in this section can help!",

Since you're mention tokens which is centralized and the developer has a control over your tokens, technically they can freeze the token and the transaction is reversible, they can send it back to your wallet. But since $250 is small money for them, they wouldn't help you and you'll get blamed since you're not be careful with your wallets. This is why you must use hardware wallet.",

If it's a small amount then you should forget about it and don't try to get it back, it will make you fall into other traps and lose more money. I don't trust that youtuber's bot, that could be another trap you'll fall into if you're trying to figure out how to get your small fortune back. Protect yourself in this market, nobody helps you but yourself, once you get hacked and your private key is exposed, forget it and use a new wallet.",

A small amount of assets? then what do you want to do if the assets you have in the hacked wallet are only small assets that may not be valuable anymore. and then you continue to send fees for gas costs ( Matic )stop, and don't do it again. it will just waste the fee you send.Quote from: tjtonmoy on October 29, 2022, 12:57:18 AMi tried to contact him and he said that he uses a bot which is paid. and I can't afford to buy that bot for 250$ that's a huge price for me. and i was wondering if anyone can share me their knowledge on how can i pay fee from receiver's wallet to recover my assets from hacked one! You are too fascinated by bots that are not created by you and the bot is also not known about its security. $250 for a bot is of course quite expensive, because it is only to recover or send \"a small amount of assets\" from a hacked wallet, whereas creating a wallet is even free and you can create as many as you want. It's different if the hacked wallet has assets of up to thousands or hundreds of dollars.You say that the wallet is infected by a bot, of course this is a mistake you did. always looking for bots that are not really important and even infect your wallet. you have to change your mindset, don't be too easy to use bots that are not clear, of course it's just a trap.Nothing will be recovered when the scammer has got your wallet, it will only be a wallet that contains garbage and valuable assets will certainly be moved. so forget it and create a new wallet, then make sure you are more vigilant and don't fall into the trap of scammers with all kinds of other bots.",

What wallet do you use? Also, do you have an idea how it got compromised?If it's a case of granting permission to the wrong (d)app or script then you can manually find a way to disable it.Give full details and avoid getting scammed again into paying for a bot to help you fix your existing bot issue.",

That kind of feature is unattainable in a Polygon chain/system, meanwhile, I'm pretty sure that the paid bot you mentioned is a scam.Actually, the problem you mentioned is a typical scam scheme. In which, the scammer is asking for help while giving their private key, they lure the victim by storing some amount of token, when the victim sends a gas fee, it will automatically being sent again to another wallet because there is already a bot that did those things. So, it is kinda weird that your account is the one that got infected.",

      "body": "As much as we would like to help you bro, there's no way we could recover the funds from your wallet if you have no idea who the hacker is. Bitcoin is encrypted in such a way that you just couldn't track anyone which of course has its pros and cons as in your case. Let this be a lesson not only to you but to everyone as well that you have to always be wary of your clicks on the internet and where you login. Good for you that you only lost 250 bucks, some lost hundreds and thousands of dollars from the lack of care. As for that matter, here's a few tips you could observe as a bitcoin owner: -Store your bitcoins and other cryptocurrency in proprietary cold wallets-Suspicious links (links sent to you anonymously, with spelling errors (eg. fecabook . com), or plain old suspicious  )should be LEFT ALONE, do not click it, do not delete it, matter of fact do not interact with it at all.- Be careful with your transactions, always use a burner wallet with only the right amount of money when buying stuff on the internet and transacting with cryptoand last but not least: -Always exercise caution with every click you make online.Again, let this be a lesson that.",
