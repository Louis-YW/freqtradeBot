  "content": "In general, there are two ways to acquire bitcoins: buying them with real money or \"mining\" them. The process of mining is the process of acquiring bitcoin, and therefore mining is mining for coins.So let's start with buying coins. Many people think that buying currency is like buying stocks. The threshold is low and anyone can buy it directly. In addition, they believe that the cost of buying coins is low, so they only need to pay the money to buy coins. But buying currency such as investing in stocks, the income is also big risk, you buy currency in the hand, the price of the currency rises you earn, the price of the currency falls you compensate. And the early need to do a lot of homework, which is similar to buying stocks, which requires you to understand the background of the investors all kinds of information, need to in-depth understanding of all kinds of basic information, according to their own cognition to make choices.In fact, you can invest Bitcoin quantitatively every day. You only need to invest once to obtain long-term returns. As long as your machine is up and running, it generates a certain amount of bitcoins every day, and the benefits are endless. Acquiring bitcoins this way does not require you to watch the price every day, wait for the price to rise later, and directly trade in cash. Relatively speaking, cloud mining is the lowest cost.Although the return of buying currency is high, the risk and return coexist, so investors also need to bear the risk of the currency price falling. And mining money is drought and flood guarantee. As an investor, we should take a long-term view of mining machine production.",

Although I have heard of the likes of ViaBTC and NiceHash and Genesis and others and a handful are vouching them, the bottom line has always been that cloud mining is either (1) outright scam or Ponzi or (2) that it is not a good investment or (3) the terms and conditions of these cloud mining companies are obviously unfair which means everything is only advantageous to them and highly disadvantageous to their clients. So if you want to get into Bitcoin mining by way of cloud mining, you'd better buy Bitcoin and HODL.",

So you do need to worry about the price. It also means it heavily depends on the electricity price you are paying, if it is low then you can compete otherwise if your electricity costs a lot (like these days in EU) it is not possible to make a profit by mining and you're better off buying bitcoin.QuoteRelatively speaking, cloud mining is the lowest cost.Actually the cost of cloud mining is extremely high since the majority of them are scams or Ponzi schemes and will take your money and run.",

If you want to work your way up to owning a bitcoin, you should rather buy small amounts on a regular basis, when the price is low. When the price increase.... sell for a profit and wait for the price to drop again.. then use that profit and buy more bitcoin. (before you know it, you will own a full bitcoin)  Investing in ASICS (Hardware) to mine Bitcoin is not profitable for the small miners and the additional cost to run the miners make it even less profitable.",

The process of mining is the process of acquiring bitcoin, and therefore mining is mining for coins.There are two ways to acquire bitcoin: either by \"economic means\" or \"political means.\" Economic means include but are not limited to purchasing, earning, mining, donations, and other activities that involve mutually agreed, voluntary exchanges completely free of any coercion and aggression. Both purchasing and mining involve putting some effort in order to obtain desired currency in a peaceful manner. Both these activities can facilitate non-KYC acquisitions of bitcoin and therefore are of the same importance for people valuing their privacy. Political means, on the other hand, always involve aggression against other people and include but are not limited to confiscation, stealing, taxes, seizure, inflation, and any other activities that imply involuntary deprivation of funds and enrichment at the expense of others. If there is anything an honest bitcoiner must be squarely and totally against, it is the acquisition of bitcoin using aggressive political means that, more often than not, are being employed by the most powerful entities, which are governments. In other words, as long as the method you are obtaining bitcoin doesn't infringe on the private property rights of other people, you are doing it right. Both mining and buying are fine.",

That is not good for small miners.When you need money instantly, you can not sell your ASICs and other devices instantly to get money.

Since, there will come a time where that mining device has either deteriorated beyond repair or simply doesn't cut it much longer. Depending on your electrical costs, and your personal circumstances,  you might not be using the mining equipment to its full potential. Whereas, buying Bitcoin you know exactly what you're going to get at the moment of purchase, while mining you generally have a good idea, there's a few other things that could potentially go wrong during the equipments life span. As for cloud mining, I'd stay away personally. Whenever you involve a third party, there's room for getting screwed, which is something that Bitcoin was designed to mitigate.",

      "body": "My take on answering this question is that I think today, just like a decade ago, most miners are some kind of 'nerds' of Bitcoin mining it for the sake of sustaining the Bitcoin network.  There of course are the largest miners that are few but very wealthy in equipment, and there are of course those who purchase many miners hoping to make a profit but giving up in the end.With how volatile things are today, I think mining is not worth it much anymore unless you have a very large budget.  You have so many things to take into account.  Mining rigs are limited.  GPU's (Bitcoin is not GPU mineable by default but I am putting this here just for the sake of the argument) have volatile stock and prices.  Electricity costs are also volatile, but mostly increasing.  There are some countries pulling out the crackdown card on mining.  You need maintenance for your rigs.  You have to know what you are doing and, last but not least, you have to pay electricity which is pretty much like exchanging electricity for Bitcoin and your equipment will need upgrade every now and then.So due to the last paragraph, I rather buy Bitcoin and DCA than start mining.  I much rather prefer the way without headaches.  If I had the time and budget, maybe I would consider running a Bitcoin mining farm.-Regards,PrivacyG",
