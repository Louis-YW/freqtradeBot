  "content": "Alright folks, unless there is another major crypto company/protocol collapse, the bottom is almost certainly in and there is a good chance Bitcoin will start rising out of this bottom range in a few months.So now is the time to accumulate if you haven't started yet!Who's gonna be DCA'ing into Bitcoin this Winter and Spring while prices are still super low?I managed to pick up 0.5 BTC last year but I started a bit early before LUNA even collapsed so I had an average buy-in in the $24,000s.But now Bitcoin has been sitting solidly in the mid-teens for a while so super cheap Bitcoin is ripe for the picking!I just picked up 0.1 BTC today with my trading profits during these first nine days of the year.Hoping to add well more than 0.5 BTC to my long term stash by the end of the year. My goal is to add 1 BTC total between 2023 and 2024 before the bull market really starts cooking again.For those of you still trying to build out a Bitcoin stash you can be happy with, including those of you trying to get up to being a whole-coiner, this will likely be the last year you can make significant progress on that as it'll start getting real hard to accumulate tenths of a bitcoin when the price is mid five figures, high five figures, and in the six figures.Who is accumulating and how much are you hoping to add to your stash this year?",

But there is no guarantee that this is a sign that Bitcoin is now going to recover. There is reason to believe that this could just be a bear trap. It is very possible that hours from now the price would just go back to the $16,000 level. But I couldn't care less. This is a bear season and this is a good time to stack more.",

I wasn't talking about the pump in the market the past day or two leading to things moving up now.Not sure where 'Fundamentals Of' and 'mk4' got that idea from lol. I literally said I expect Bitcoin to break out of the bottom in a few months, aka not anytime soon.I was pretty much saying the opposite of over-bullishness lol. I expect the bottom to persist for a few more months which makes this Winter and likely into the Spring a fantastic time to accumulate at the bottom.I was talking about accumulating this year, and especially at super low prices while the market is still at the bottom over the next few months.Now is the time to accumulate precisely because the market isn't at all bullish, but rather it is grinding along the bottom of the bear market. This is exactly when people should be accumulating! Not sure how those two commenters got my message so wrong haha",

And who knows 2023 might be exactly the same.Yup, I experienced both of those. Never know how long a bottom will be. 2019 the bottom was only about half as long as 2015. Hey I was one of those who quit in mid-2015 thinking Bitcoin had run its course. Only realized Bitcoin was here to stay and is the future once I saw it had fully recovered and was back over $1000 in early 2017.As far as this bottom goes, well the $15k bottom has only been in for two months since FTX, but Bitcoin has generally been in the teens and low 20s since what...July? That's half a year now. I do think FTX set the market back a few months, and looking at macro stuff, I wouldn't expect the bottom to be over and for Bitcoin to start grinding its way back up to $25k and beyond until late Spring or early Summer. Hence the thread: it's accumulating time!!! Bitcoin has solidly defended the lows from the FTX collapse for the past two months so things look fairly safe from going to new lows unless there is another major industry collapse - and since last January the only time Bitcoin has hit new lows is when there is some major industry collapse (LUNA, Celsius, FTX). And if it does go lower....great, that means slightly cheaper Bitcoin and probably even more time to accumulate!Bitcoiners likely have several months, maybe even like half a year, to accumulate now at super low prices. And this should be the last time that it is fairly easy for those with some disposable income to accumulate on the order of tenths of a Bitcoin. By next bear market people will be scraping together just a few hundredths of a bitcoin at a time. So for those people who are gradually working on becoming whole-coiners, accumulating this winter and spring is absolutely crucial to achieving their goal!",

We think now is the right move to collect bitcoin, before resistance sets in this year, so that we can take advantage of maximum return opportunities.Therefore, it seems that this year bitcoin will experience a gradual recovery, although it is not certain in which month. If following the four-year scheme, it should be this year that bitcoin starts showing a gradual recovery before hitting the next ATH.",
