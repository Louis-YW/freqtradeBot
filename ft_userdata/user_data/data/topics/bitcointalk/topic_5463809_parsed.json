  "content": "I hate Reddit, and because this community is very sensitive with privacy, I want some help regarding which mobile OS best fits my needs.So, I recently stumbled across this paper, which describes how a deep-learning attack can be executed to de-anonymize you if smartphone is near the keyboard: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01074.pdf. Their research shows that with the acoustic side channel attacks they've executed, there is 95% accuracy on phone-recorded laptop keystrokes. This means that even if you're running some super privacy-respecting software like Tails, if you're carrying a smartphone around you, there is chance that the closed-source Android OS can use VoIP and de-anonymize that little privacy square left. As the icing on the cake, I'm interested in running a transparent, privacy-focused mobile OS to sleep easy. It has to fulfill the following criteria:It has to be Android-based.Has to have serious development (not a project that can be abandoned the other month).I will be able to have apps like Instagram, Messenger, Discord, and anything that uses micro-G. (and support notifications without problems)It needs to be open-source and privacy-focused.I have concluded GrapheneOS, LineageOS and CalyxOS are what govern the space, but I'm quite lost to be honest. I want to read your thoughts on this. Edit: I tried GrapheneOS. Read: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463809.msg63022282#msg63022282",

      "body": "I know of Calyx OS. It is open source but only working mostly on Google devices, but probably on few other devices. If you can use it, it would be better than google. This OS was created for privacy reasons. LineageOS support more devices but very few too. GrapheneOSis only working on Google devices.My advise is that if you have computer, use it for privacy things like wallet instead. I have not seen developers that say these mobile phone OS are good, but Linux on computer is highly recommended.Those apps or sites like Instagram and Facebook messenger have nothing to do with privacy, they are privacy invading.",

Their research shows that with the acoustic side channel attacks they've executed,I did not quite understand you need a OS which should be based on Android and at the same time it must not be an Android? Because you said:Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 19, 2023, 02:24:18 PMthere is chance that the closed-source Android OS can use VoIP and de-anonymize that little privacy square left. Well, the problem you are discussing here is, if my smartphone is near the keyboard then the strikes on the keyboard could be recorded as when we hit any key a sound is created and then by using DL attackers could synchronize those keystrokes to make useful meanings such as while we are types our phones numbers, or email or Pin codes etc.The things which i do not understand here is: FirstIf attackers could use your phone to get the audio of your keystrokes then your phone is already compromised so don't you worry about that instead of worrying about keystrokes audio leaking.SecondIf you think it is a risk then why taking such risk. Put your phone away from the keyboard matter solved.ThirdIf you still thing that you can not resist to keep your phone away by your keyboard side then use a touch keyboard where no sound will be created or buy a laptop like the new Lenovo Yoga laptop which have touch screen key board. If not then buy only a touch screen keyboard and you would be good to go.Talking about Lenovo Yoga Book 9i --------- https://mashable.com/archive/cool-leaf-keyboard",

I very much like Android as an OS however, and there exist open-source alternatives like LineageOS and CalyxOS, which are Android-based. Hmm Ok got your point. LineageOS is discontinued so there will be update problems like you wanted to use all types of social media platforms. But CalyxOS seems to be a good option here why don't you try that. But I visited the CalyXOS they have less visitors means the users of this OS must be lower too. I have found some other options for you which are following:https://grapheneos.org/https://resurrectionremix.com/https://paranoidandroid.co/ ---> It seems it has some limitations like it might not be run on Samsung phones as by visiting the website you can see on which smartphones you could install it. IMHO I can say Grapheneos is a better option here but just to clarify I did not tried any of these before instead did some researched as this really excited me after knowing that we can also install OS on our phones other than some Android OS. Why I never thought of it because I never thought or being to careful to find that it's a problem or it might become one just like you pointed out that these issues might provide opportunity to hacker to compromise your device.

What about the third option but I think you are also looking at a cheap option too instead of spending more money on such devices I think downloading and installing a new OS is better option.",

As a LineageOS user, I have to tell you that it's a lot better, even if you don't have privacy concerns as I do. The OS runs smoothly, there are no advertisements (as with Samsung and Xiaomi) in default apps, it runs faster etc.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 20, 2023, 11:16:51 AMIf you're that paranoid, you could just move your smartphone away from your keyboard or cover your smartphone microphone. I don't understand why I'm being called a paranoid here. I don't find neither Xiaomi nor Google trustworthy with my privacy. Both are data sharks, and both rely on personal data to survive. It makes no sense to trust their word that they don't spy the device, even if I haven't given the permission. They have quite an awful history with securing privacy.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 20, 2023, 11:16:51 AMLineageOS definitely doesn't match your requirement since their website/wiki doesn't state anything about privacy-focused feature.They aren't privacy focused, but that's enough:Quote from: https://lineageos.org/Your data, your rules.

Here are some key differences comparably to LineageOS:- Allows you to give network permission whenever you install an app. That means if an app is malicious and doesn't get network and storage permission, it can't harm you. Not sure if Lineage lacked that feature, but it definitely didn't prompt me for network permission during installation. - Sandboxed Google services. Let's be honest, we all need Google services. That sandbox solution is these services without the tradeoff of allowing Google messing with your phone as it gets limited permission. More info: https://grapheneos.org/features#sandboxed-google-play- Comes with a privacy-focused, lightweight browser called \"Vanadium\": https://grapheneos.org/features#vanadium- It signals when a hardware component is used. For example, if an app uses microphone, it will signal that microphone is used, which is useful if you want to know what closed-source apps are doing in the background.

However, none of these are privacy focused. Graphene team aims to provide both sufficient privacy and security with Vanadium: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing. It is also a fork of Chromium, so I presume it inherits serious development. Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 20, 2023, 11:15:23 AMJust wondering, which Vanced you use? Since the original/first one forced to be shutdown by google, it's hard to track which fork is legit or works.I recently stumbled across Revanced: https://revanced.app/, which is pretty much the same thing (except that this one works).

I think someone had conducted an anonymous poll where the same picture was taken by lots of phones, and it let you vote for the best picture; people unknowingly chose the 6A one.

Almost every week you get constant updates, and do not worry, your OS isn't going to get old, they are very active and always throw me the latest Android Version and patches. 2. It's very stable, I am so much liking this OS, I mean everything works out of the box and I wished this was how I purchased my phone in the first place.3. Unlimited customization options are available, and this includes privacy control via app permissions, unlike the old OS I was using before. 4. It's fully open-source and it comes with De-Google, Google apps isn't included and if you need you will have to flash Gapps minis or other Gapps package, Bank apps work and no single app had any hiccups. I've not tested Graphene OS but it's for the Google Pixel phones, if you have google phones it could be the best choice but on other android phones Lineage OS rocks. Switch to Lineage OS if you are concerned about your Privacy.Feel free to ask me anything about LineageOS.",
