Following the thread, finance on TikTok has become so popular that it has got its own portmanteau. Dubbed FinTok, finance-related content has seen a meteoric rise along with the social network itself. Last year, the #Crypto hashtag blew up, getting 1.9 billion videos. Uploads tagged #NFT increased by a mind-melting 93,000% (further fueled by the general boom in NFT interest). And, videos with the #StockTok hashtag garnered 1.4 billion views.It’s no surprise that Gen Z is not only embracing cryptocurrency but also educating themselves regarding finance. According to Credit Suisse’s global investment returns yearbook, Gen Z will earn a third less on traditional stock and bond investments than past generations.For the future and health of the digital asset market, DeFi firms need to engage the right audiences in specific ways targeted to those demographics. If we want the blooming era comes back once again and new investors, maybe Tiktok will be a nice social media to target.",
