  "content": "While viewing many of the course reseller sites, I see a google drive link with the name \"@@@@@2021\", its filled with about 30-50 thousand self-improvement and occult courses, some of them are private. Most resellers use the same google drive shared drive, and I would like access to this shared drive and I am willing to pay for it . Here is an image of what the course drive looks like. This is an image of the drive: https://imgur.com/a/22lSmbtPlease do not message me asking to buy google shared drives with Udemy and/or graphic design or tech courses. Im not interested that, I'm only interested in this specific google drive/shared drive with self-improvement and Occult courses. Thanks in advance.",
