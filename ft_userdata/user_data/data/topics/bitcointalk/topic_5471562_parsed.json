And really they are the class of people who are involved in self medication, it is when their sickness get aggravated that they visit the hospital but by then, the damage has already been done.Health is wealth is very significant because there are people who are rich but have health challenges that they can't enjoy the money they have either they are restricted from eating a particular kind of food or they are hospitalized from time to time. It is very important that we take care of our health at least while young so that as we age, we also keep maintaining it that way. I understand that fruits are very important to the body and organs of the body so lets try to keep a routine with fruits.",

What's the essence of making money without being alive to enjoy itA young entrepreneur recently opened one of the biggest clothing shop in my environ. He bought a building in a choiced area, demolished it and built the clothing shop. The shop is well stocked with clothing from different parts of the world. I was in a cab and we drove passed the shop and it was closed. The cab man informed us that the young man died yesterday. I was shocked because I just saw him recently. But the most shocking part of the story is that his brothers and sisters have started fighting over his property. His elder sister rushed to the house immediately he died and drove out all his cars. His younger brother had to change the keys of his house and took possession of the belongings. His elder brother is now in custody of the clothing shop. If you think taking care of your business is more important than your health, this might be what will happen when you leave.",

I've met with a number of people who hold bitcoin and they eat well, work out and are well organized.Holding bitcoin is not something you get into for a year and then get out and forget about. You want to live long to enjoy the fruit of your work, am I right? I moved to a small town to live far from the noise and pollution and I enjoy it. I can take a walk in the woods whenever I want and not meet a single human for hours. I recommend you to go somewhere clean if you can, somewhere that's natural. Life is too short to live it in a concrete block where you wake up to the noise of police sirens or your neighbors arguing.",

What's the essence of making money without being alive to enjoy itThere is no point in having money if you don't have a pleasant life to enjoy it with. Self-medication is extremely harmful to one's health. Even as a medical practitioner, it is not always advisable to self-medicate; instead, go to the hospital or find a trusted colleague to do so for you. Self-medication has several negative impacts on the human body for individuals who engage in it. They take dosages and administer medications or injections to themselves without consulting a doctor on how to take them.Quote from: Obim34 on October 25, 2023, 05:03:01 PMLet's take this from two very perspective, the perspective of :The shop or business is there only means of survival and they basically do not have anything at hand to go for the checkup so they need to stay and make sales before going for the check up. Sometimes the person might become unfortunate but in this case the person is not to be blamed. There is no excuse for anyone's carelessness or negligence for proper health examination. Your business or the money you make from it cannot exist if you are not in excellent health to take care of it. Even if you don't have the money for the checkup, you can always borrow it and have it refunded once you're healthy again. There is a justification for delaying paying bills, but there is no excuse for dying as a result of medical negligence.",

What's the essence of making money without being alive to enjoy itThis is a very vital topic because these days everyone is all concerned about making ends means without giving their health a thought, sometimes when a symptom shows up on one's body instead of seeking for medical attention they will too busy to run test and know the reason why such symptom come up simply because they're too committed to their jobs and works, sometimes we allow symptoms to multiply in our body system before we seek medical care. It is important to note that out of mind is out of sight as one's health should be of utmost priority. Without the body being physically alright then whatever thing one is doing might be endangered since the body isn't okay. We should always learn to check our body system from time to time to know if they're physically and mentally okay.",

What's the essence of making money without being alive to enjoy itFirst and foremost, it is important to learn how to outsource for other people to assist you manage your business, especially when it's a large business. That is why partnership businesses flourish more than sole proprietorship businesses. As a sole proprietor, you will have to make yourself available during the business hour to ensure that the business thrives, most especially as the business is based on commodities. Even in Sole Proprietorship business, try to get an assistant, someone trustworthy who can stand in for you at some period of time, while you take a break.The aphorism that says, 'Health is Wealth', is vehemently important for any business person. Make sure that your health is more priorized than your wealth. Whilst you are working very hard to sustain your business, treat yourself good. Eat good food, sleep well, work on your circadian rhythm and take breaks when necessary.I want to also use this opportunity to advise businesspeople to diversify, have multiple streams of income. Once one business of yours is thriving, start building another one. So that you can generate more money from different businesses at different times.",

To be honest I find that it’s poor or low income people who eat junk food & drink too much alcohol. The saying is true, what it the point having extreke wealth if you’re not healthy enough to enjoy it.Rich people are well informed that is the thing. They are not only informed about how to grow their income and protect it but they are also informed about how to keep a healthy life so that they can also enjoy the wealth they have acquired. They go as far as having personal physicians that keep them informed about what they need to do to keep fit and the kind of food that they need inside the body, so it is a simple truth that the rich are better informed on what importance is health because they want to be alive to enjoy their money.",

It's mean sometime health is wealth health can make a person wealthy but not because if you are healthy person you can do anything what do you want to do. Everyone has a dream in life. If you are not proper healthy and fit but you have a lot of wealth you can't complete your dream if you are not comfortable with your health. If you are wealth person but you are unhealthy then you can't make your dream success. On the other side you are healthy person but you don't have enough wealth to make your dream success you can do hard work to make wealth and you know hard work is the pillar of success. So healthy person can do anything on the other side if you are a wealthy person but you are unhealthy you can't do anything in life that's why people says health is wealth. Not wealth make health.",

I am like that person and I don't bother to take care of myself because I can still see that I am strong. That's what the others probably are feeling as well as a bread winner and does the same thing. The time spent going to the hospital and effort from doing so is much better if it's spent to the work or business. And the problem is that, we'll only approach the doctors and the hospitals when what we're feeling is no longer normal and is already on the depth of being severe.I know that health is important because we can't work if we're on the bed of diseases but can't also blame those people that are ignoring themselves and forgets to check themselves if they're still healthy or no longer. With the fast kind of life today, the mortality rate is increasing because of how technologies are making time flies so fast and we're also getting more exposure to the radiation being emitted by gadgets and devices that we use.",
