      "body": "bitcoin is accepted as currency in the US/EU which means alot of US/EU controls around the edges of bitcoin(businesses) which china does not want to be handstrung(puppet) to.NFT however are a different category. more of a digital property thus not under the same regulations which means china can utilise without having to work with or be ordered by US/EU to comply with things.china was going to ban bitcoin and then create its own regulation framework to then permit bitcoin use again for chinese citizens, but seeing how the US was trying to demand other countries to communicate, comply, follow US regulations.. china just didnt bother to push for its own regulations there were not many chinese based businesses and services thus most businesses were already US/EU regulated. and it would end up leading to US involvement in chinese affairs.chinese government didnt see the overall benefits of accepting bitcoin over the headaches of US government involvement. so just left it at banned status(this may change if enough chinese business lobby to want to be involved and want to develop their own regulations away from US/EU regulations)what china would see is that soon even NFT might end up transitioning into the realms of some regulatory system which might change china's mind about allowing involvement in NFThowever for now NFT are not regulated by any regulator, and everything is more person to persona personal claims/use of court systems. so the methodology of NFT is under standard property protection laws. where people set their own personal licence. policy/permits of use over their NFT. where people submit their own court order claim requests should they know/receive information that something is being used against those policies.",

And perhaps the next step is for them to create NFT infrastructure for whatever purpose it may serve them. And NFT doesn't present the same danger and challenges that bitcoin has to offer to them.",

As to China's decision causing other countries to follow their steps, I don't think so. This is not as if Bitcoin plays a central role in terms of China's power play. The first currency it wants to take down from the global stage must be the USD. And right now it seems China is already beginning to implement the renminbi-standard in lieu of USD-standard. Bitcoins isn't in anyway threatened.",

This I am stating in association with crypto space and not the regular government control assets. The fact is, we are in crypto because we want our own freedom and we want to accomplish the tag line “Be your own bank”. Obviously if China states NFT is under their control then there is no point in investing into it. Considering China past decision, they may ban it in the future and who knows those Chinese might be holding millions of dollars in NFT and may end up loosing all of it. This would be similar case to ban on crypto mining in china territory. It would be highly risky to get into it for chinese.",

By now you should have known China for the centralized ways of leadership, that don't admit the existence of anything that will go off beyond their control system, if the launch NFT, it will be of a good advantage to then because they have a big role to play in determining the control and fate of how the Token runs, while they can't achieve this with bitcoin, they are less concerned about the risk and scam in token as long as they will persuade their people to go for it, remember they had their CBDC as well to counter bitcoin, China are just a centralized system extremist.",

The Chinese citizens can still do transactions outside of the \"Centralized\" exchanges, as long as there is no contact with Fiat. The moment when FIAT comes into the picture, it enters the controlled financial system. The Chinese government knows this and that is why they banned \"Bitcoin\"..... they want 100% control and oversight of every aspect of the Chinese citizens. (We saw what happened lately with Chinese deposits in Banks)",

It'd probably also be against them if they were to turn it back after so long. I'd actually imagine that China is using the idea of NFT minus the usage of it in a decentralized blockchain, basically putting the idea to use but under their own control and administration. I'd say it's actually like China to do it like that. I wouldn't really mind it imo unless you're a Chinese citizen, I'd reckon the system they use (or planning to use) would mostly be centered around their country anyway and doesn't really reach out in foreign countries.",

Bitcoin promotes freedom and it's a bad thing for the Chinese people to feel that because they would eventually ask for more.It is a common thing that China always wants to stand out from everyone else.  And wants to build themselves as the only strong and developed country in the world. So they want to keep everything under their control even bitcoin.  When they felt that Bitcoin could not be controlled in any way.  Then they banned Bitcoin",

And yeah, it was a blow on the mining market when mining was banned, but it's been a while, and I don't think any further decisions China makes will make any difference to the global market. What's more interesting to me is what the op means by 'countries under China'. While China's world's second economy, I don't know much about the impact it has on other countries and which ones (excluding projects like with the railways or interdependence with the US in many areas). Are there countries that follow China's financial policies and would become hostile to Bitcoin because China did?",
