And also try to check whether or not such a prediction thread already exists before because we have other football prediction threads already in discussions for the various leagues.",

You are free to share your predictions here so that others can also look at it and share their views on it. You will see people that will even use your prediction to see if it will work. This is when you have predicted one or two correctly. The forum is open for anyone to share his knowledge on what other forum members don't know so that one can learn from you. Like the first poster said, only create one thread and keep on updating the thread. Also check to see if there is any related topic like a prediction thread,where you can go and also comment or post yours there. I look forward to see how your predictions will look like.",

You can only put your affiliate link on your signature space once you already rank up.It’s either you will create your own prediction thread or post your prediction on a discussion thread dedicated for the specific sports you are about to predict given that it’s already available on the gambling discussion.",

You said you don't have any purpose and that is nice if you want to do the charity of helping users here benefit for free on your probable wisdom on football and other sports.You don't have to force users here because they already know what is good. So if you happen to give best support for their gambling experience surely your thread will be visited always, everyone wants to have additional money.",

I have seen so many members here try to replicate this action of yours but they all always give up and most of the predictions were pretty good for a start but as times goes it just get worst. For me since you said you want to be given prediction on games I think you should try and gain some ground here because the community as I know doesn't really value anything from newbie account.",

You should elaborate further on your prediction, such as:manchester united vs liverpoolIn this game, Manchester United comes from x defeats and wins in the last games, while Liverpool comes from x wins and x draws in the last games, both teams have an h2h of X, both teams have the following injured players.you detail step by step how you analyzed until you arrive at your prediction for this game. With this you will have a good quality post. I hope I helped you",

But you can also create your own separate thread so you can track all your picks. You can make a summary of all your winnings and losses every now and then. People will follow you more once you can show a good winning percentage. I remember when I was following an e-sport tipster a few years ago. It was profitable but in the following year, it was the opposite. So I guess tipsters also have bad and good seasons which is the same reason why I never tried paying subscription fees to some tipsters.",

Not saying you will end up the same with them so the question is, how long can you keep up. Regardless of the purpose, I think it's doesn't make sense to just create a prediction thread with literally, only prediction with no analysis involved. It's like a spam thread or post for me. Try to become different and give your prediction a healthy analysis.But for me, you can share your prediction and analysis, while at the same time joining the discussion with your fellow football enthusiast if you found a thread dedicated for football.",
