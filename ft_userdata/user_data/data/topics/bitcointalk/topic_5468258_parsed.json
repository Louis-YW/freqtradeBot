Good morning naija!!!In as much as I know we are the architects of our failures. Though we need God to intervene at this critical time but just the bible says that faith without work is useless so how can we be expecting God to answer our prayers when we no do anything that will back up the prayers? For me o the kingdom of God suffers violence and the violent ones took it by force, so if we know wake up now and hijack our destiny by force it will be a very big disaster to our upcoming generation. We need to hold the bull by the horn, that is, do the right thing at the right time before we seek for manners from heaven. No farmer wey dey go harvest for where him no sow and anything wey person so na in him go reap even if you no reap am directly at least you have loved ones, relatives, children so your actions may affect these people one wey or the other so if it troubles them it will also backfire back to you. Make we remove sentiments and work selflessly towards the betterment of our society. So definitely we need prayer but make e be say we don put something for ground before we dey expect miracle. Na the duty of you and I to redirect our selfish path and embrace a lifestyle worthy of emulation. If we no do wellÂ  e go dey hard for our children to remember us tomorrow because na person wey do dem dey remember",

All if you factor dem together con recollect the struggles and tussles wey we don undergo, you fit come into conclusion say, na serious and deep prayers we need. And it has to be intentional and collectively.I'm pretty sure that's what the president is buttressing on. We have been stagnant as a nation and have a very long way to go. The expectations and burdens on us as rhe giant of Africa and the different corrupt cases wey dey happen on daily basis. E reach make we enter serious prayers o. One thing wey i like na the mentioning wey mr president mention am say make we help am, help ourselves with prayers. And as of the need to remind us. Yes. Our presido need remind us o because if you dey look for environment where dem dey injure people pass, hypocritically, na Nigerians. That's why dem talk say change begins with me and you.

We are praying, God is answering, but I believe that what you can do for yourself or for others, you don't need to ask for prayers to do it. You should allow God use you to answer others prayers and that's what is expected of him as the president. He's been elevated to the position, why not him use his good office to provide the answer to the prayers of people.
