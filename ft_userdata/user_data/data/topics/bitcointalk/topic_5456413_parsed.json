The freebitco site is being used globally and people from all around the world access this site.Also, if they have restricted the egypt ip addresses, it is advised not to use VPN to access the site. Because if they caught you using VPN, they will close your account and you will lose all your funds. I feel sorry for you but its time you move on to some another gambling site which is allowed in your country.",

As per my initial analysis from SimilarWeb, Freebitco has a 26% user audience from Russia. And if Egypt does not fall in the top 5 countries for freebitco.This means that there is be almost zero effect if the site is banned in Egypt, except for the few users who were playing at freebitco, they would be affected of course.",
