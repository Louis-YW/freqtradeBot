I've sent a bunch of metal over seas and always went with metal art or metal paper weight. Sometimes to skirt taxes in their end I assume but always to skirt theft. Plus - tape is your friend! Duct brand heavy duty tape so that the package can surive a flood. Completely wrapped - multiple levels - near 100% delivery when packaged correctly and securely",

Completely wrapped - multiple levels - near 100% delivery when packaged correctly and securely Sadly I have to agree with you guys on this. It's sad that you pretty much have to lie, but it's not our fault that we are forced in to that position..customs is so bad around the globe, they are constantly \"confiscating\" (stealing) items from us. ¬†Then the Euro Vat tax is just an absolute scam in and of itself. ¬†The taping the shit out of the box is definitely a good idea. Here in the US the best/safest way to ship items is pretty much via \"registered mail\". ¬†They tape the boxes up really well with their special tape. ¬†This is to prevent theft. ¬†You can use a customs forms labeling the items something like \"kids play tokens\" or something of that nature.",

      "body": "Hi buddies ! ¬†hope you all are fine ! So yes, customs are really not cool! and as ChiBitCTy says, it's unfortunately but the best way to be safe is to lie.from experience everything that has a small value and well packaged in cardboard envelopes with lot of tapes goes without worries, but I think that the same envelope with too large a value exposed would indeed be risky, apart from customs the packages go through so many hands, and they are all human, so emotions could take over in front of such a large sum.till today i have sent more than 1000 chips/coins, and 0 package was lost or stolen with good packaging and low value declaration, if the values ‚Äã‚Äãwere bigger or the declaration too explicit I think it would not be the same numbers",

Customs made the recipient physically come down and show ID to pick it up and sign a bunch of junk.... ¬† This was via FedEx.... Long story short, it was \"stuck\" in Memphis TN warehouse for weeks, just getting scanned nightly, causing all sorts of drama and restlessness upon both parties. It was finally received in the end, but it was a long month for both parties.... Now I'm not gonna tell anyone to lie on customs forms ofc, so I personally avoid gold shipments across international borders just for such reasons, but you get the point I think...",
