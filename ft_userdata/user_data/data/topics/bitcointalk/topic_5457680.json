As you can see if bitcoin has been recovering again to the 31k while at the same time BCH was also gradually increasing a lot. It's caused by bitcoin hype has been also making BCH pumped by bitcoin whales. This is not something new. If you are watching the market carefully and you will also see if another bitcoin fork coin like BSV has been also facing massive increase pretty much the same like bitcoin. This is a common scenario in the crypto as crypto related to the bitcoin like bitcoin cash and sv increased a lot once bitcoin pumped so high. It's been manipulated by btc whales. You will be seeing if BCH is likely increasing even more if bitcoin will do it.",

We are talking about BCH because the price has pumped.. only because that ... not new usecase, adoption etc. And the price pumped up probably due to a pump and dump event combined with a short squeeze. It will end up in a dump because BCH is dead.",

This is just situational but an altcoin that's pumping is no longer surprising when we're getting close to the bitcoin halving. It's getting the attention because of the pump but it will not be surprising that it will also fall after wards just as what happens to the majority of the altcoins every after pump.Quote from: X-ray on June 26, 2023, 11:37:41 PMIt's been manipulated by btc whales.

Even I'm sad about selling my bch portfolio a while ago. I enjoyed holding BCH for sometimes, made profits through bch.

Thats a dead shitcoin area.3- zero adoption - literally no one is using it. ATMs do not offer BCH, online payment services with crypto do not offer BCH (they even have doge but not bch)4- no progress, no new utilities5- no media attention before this pump and dump event. Even Roger Ver, the biggest BCH shiller has already given up on BCH, the last of his statements I saw was about ETH",

Market makers may have seen that the BCH market is pretty easily manipulated at this point and decided to take advantage of it. Nothing just happens in the financial markets.
