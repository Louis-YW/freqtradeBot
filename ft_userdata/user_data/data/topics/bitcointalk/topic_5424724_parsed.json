Luna isn't the first asset that crashed and it's surely not the last one. The crypto graveyard has around 2000 dead coins and tokens. The users of Mt. Gox or Cryptopia also didn't believe anything could go wrong, but one morning they woke up to a nightmare. And those investors are still waiting for reimbursements.

If a token is available on DEX and CEX, what will you choose?On these decentralized exchanges, each of your swap will need a fee for an on-chain transaction and for slippage. Fee you pay for slippage is higher than either taker or maker trading fee on centralized exchanges.QuoteYou like order book features?

Not only was it realistic that what you are talking about would fail, but a lot of other things that many believe in today would also fail. In any case, good for you if you decided not to trust centralized projects anymore, because it means that you finally understood why Bitcoin exists.Quote from: Pmalek on November 30, 2022, 02:31:10 PMThe users of Mt.

Obviously, no one wants to remember their failures, but people who don't learn from the past are doomed to have even worse things happen to them in the future.",

Bitcoin drop or crash will not cause that kind of panic with Luna or others, it only time for new investors to be happy going into the market and old hodlers too because they now buy cheap they know bitcoin price come to appreciate. It is the experience I have for now in cryptocurrency. In the past it happen bitcoin drop to below $5,000 but went back higher during the halving. The expectation is soon coming for another bull.

Start Using the likes of Uniswap, DoDo, Biswap, Sushiswap and pancakeswap.You like order book features? Yes few Dex have this already, e.g dYdX, Raydium, serum and Posi exchange.Do not equate Bitcoin with dexes. Dexes got hacked in the past. Perhaps some of the hacks were inside jobs. It's not enough to be decentralized and open source to be safe. A scam can be open source too. What makes Bitcoin different from \"crypto\" is that Bitcoin was reviewed by lots of professionals who didn't find anything malicious in its code. And it is being developed very carefully so most bugs get caught early. And still Bitcoin had some incidents in the past. But \"crypto\" is being developed very hastily, no one bothers reviewing it, so there's a big incentive for hackers to find exploits on live networks and steal millions.",

Literally, it's seen as mismanagement of funds or tokens and that's what is taken as the \"reason why any exchange goes down\". We don't even know if it's something they' all cahooted and agreed to fold up with people's fund in there (this infact, is what everyone normal person would be thinking but, who knows?)? ... If genuinely, it's due to management process (cus thos whole damn thing ain't easy), then it's not really Thier fault, but how bout the damages? Seee.... That's why I'd swirl gently to your perspective and adopt that idea and I'd also urge everyone to do so.Sandra 🧑",

I expected $14000 because it would be closer to the extent of price fall in 2018 but not even up to that extent. But with the look of things, it is possible that $15400 could be the lowest price bitcoin if this month is followed by a slightly bull market with no FTX-like news again which could make people panic.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on December 01, 2022, 04:46:35 AMAny project that stop getting the support of the community due to some reason can crash irrespective of them been centralized or decentralized.

Yes few Dex have this already, e.g dYdX, Raydium, serum and Posi exchange.Yes on all of this but I will not believe if someone gave an exact date. I assume any project in crypto might failed even on the stock exchange because there’s no company that is bankruptcy proof regardless if it’s decentralized or centralized. Your perception on loss free in business is not there’s no business that promise 100% safe from bankruptcy to there customer.DEX is really the safest way to trade but it’s not advisable for day trading or regular trades because the price spread and slippage percentage per order is very high. The fee on some blockchain like Ethereum which has the most volume on DEX charge insane fee that’s why many pro traders choose CEX as there main trading platform to there trading.Good to see that you are now shifting to the right platform to purchase crypto safely. I only suggest to avoid project that exposed to SBF because there’s a chance that they will suffer same fate with FTX in the future. Raydium and Serum are the project that I’m talking about.",
