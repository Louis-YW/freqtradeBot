I think it will provide you with a list of the latest active servers as well.Don't forget to back up first your private or master key(s) if you want to do so.",

I assume, the first thing they would do when they face connection issues is to visit the official website to seek for help and reading that warning message can help them figure out what's going on.I would understand it if the message they replaced it with was more important but, imo, it's not. Just my opinion, though.",

It's likely to cause or have issues.",
