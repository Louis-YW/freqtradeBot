  "content": "The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Diana Mondino, recently confirmed that in Argentina you can make contracts paid in Bitcoin:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/argentinas-minister-of-foreign-affairs-affirms-bitcoin-acceptance-for-contract-agreementsRecently, there was a story about a guy in Argentina who did just that to rent an apartment:Quote from: https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/a-guy-just-signed-a-contract-to-rent-an-apartment-using-bitcoin-likely-a-world-first/articleshow/106904593.cms\"A guy just signed a contract to rent an apartment using bitcoin, likely a world first\"Here is the original story, in Spanish: https://www.pagina12.com.ar/703173-en-rosario-se-firmo-el-primer-contrato-de-alquiler-en-bitcoiThe first thing to consider is that the price in the contract is set in USDT, not even USD. The contract says 100 USDT, which is today the equivalent of $100. Here is the original in Spanish that mentions this:QuoteSegún consta en el contrato, el monto del alquiler será de la cantidad de bitcoins (BTC) equivalente a \"100 Tether tokens USDT\", una criptomoneda \"estable\" o stablecoin que cotiza 1 a 1 con el dólar. Es decir, 100 dólares, o 0,0021 BTC.Now, first of all that sounds very cheap for a full month of rent, but the most interesting part to me is that the price was set in USDT, which can at any time depeg: https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-and-why-do-stablecoins-depeg So, any month, those 100 USDT can represent a completely different amount of USD, which will then be converted to BTC.The second thing to highlight here is that they are not paying the BTC directly to the other person wallet. They are using a centralized exchange called Fiwind, and basically they deposit their Argentinean Peso into the platform, exchange it to BTC, and then transfer the BTC in the platform to the landlord, monthly:QuoteAsí, el inquilino deberá, mensualmente, transferir los pesos argentinos \"que estén en la cuenta bancaria o billetera virtual del usuario\" a la plataforma Fiwind, y una vez allí convertirlos a la criptomoneda deseada (en este caso, Bitcoin). Luego, ese monto en criptomoneda será transferido al propietario en la misma plataforma, sin costo.Apparently the centralized exchange is part of the contract, so maybe they are doing it this way to get all their fees from this person, and get some PR on the side.It is a bit of a shame really, when they could have easily just paid directly from one person to another. The details of this story reveal that it's not really a direct peer to peer transfer, but a convoluted payment involving a third party. Might as well just pay it directly in Argentinean Pesos, or USD since they are setting it to $100 USD.Missed opportunity. I think the main point here is setting the price in USD equivalent instead of the Argentinean Peso which devalues a lot over time.",

I guess we are seeing that come to reality today because for an active government official to rent apartment with Bitcoin in a country where the president is restructuring the governance, is an indication that Bitcoin is a welcomed in the country. Since late last year,  Argentina approves Bitcoin as its official currency, no wonder Elon Musk is passionate about Argentina because whether we believe it or not, Elon Musk has become the new face of freedom. What this development will do is that by the time more countries see the success recorded by Bitcoin in the countries where it has been allowed to flourished, they will begin to shift towards legalizing Bitcoin and this is something huge for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community.",

I think if the option was to be left in your hands Alone the price fluctuation will cause problems, because you will definitely be on the advantage in any of the options picked. Personally what I will do is regularly stack up bitcoin and see if they appreciate so as to cover for my future payments. But the bigger issue is having to buy specifically from that exchange.

The only two things I have seen is officially legalizing it or placing restrictions on it. The choice of what to treat it as, is always the investors choice. Currently many people like to lean towards it as an rather than a currency",

In my country, here are a few local shops that are crypto-friendly and accept payment only when you are sending directly from your Binance Pay to theirs.  My question is: why are they going through all those long processes or even deceiving themselves when they can just conclude and seal a contract using their local fiat, since there is no privacy protection or even decentralisation in that transaction, and if the person receiving the money needs some Bitcoin or any crypto, they can go ahead and purchase it with the money received from the business.",

So, if they're going to receive in USDT or in BTC, that's much better and they're doing the landlords a favor. Another factor is about the landlord knowing cryptos and that's why it's fine since there is an agreement and the renter will have no problem explaining that his payments are going to be with these cryptocurrencies which logically can be said as another form of money, it has monetary value and liquid so there won't have any problems for the landlord if he wants to convert it however he want and as soon as he receives the payment.I hope that more establishments and landlords will do this, not just there but also in every part of the world.",

If this is about the land of rent, then this has to have a proper contract with a proper handling of bitcoin because there will be no fixed amount in crypto currency, so anytime the rent fee could change, and there should be a way to handle that situation in a contract to avoid conflict.
