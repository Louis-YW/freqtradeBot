It is no doubt that bitcoin is here to stay and as long as a place is reachable by the internet then it means that bitcoin is and can be accessible there.And no matter what and how many backlashes there will be for it, it will continue to thrive and it is like an unstoppable train. Still, the typical reminder that we used to say, \"only invest what you can afford to lose.\"",

The more people spread the word about crypto currencies, the more easier it will be for people to make bitcoin a mainstream currency. But just letting them know about bitcoin isn't the only thing you should be doing. You should let them know about the risks involved and how to keep their coins safe. If you don't and they end up losing their money, they will feel cheated and blamed you and crypto currencies for everything.Quote from: uche6215 on February 04, 2023, 02:21:49 PMHahaha you said something funny.You said only invest what you can afford to lose.Yes That's it you can't just borrow money and then invest in on something.But they also said no REWARD COME WITHOUT RISK. True, no reward comes without risk. But that doesn't mean that you should be taking stupid risks. Also see the risk-reward ratio. You don't want to be risking millions for few peanuts.",

In my country, there are a lot of people who didn't hear anything about Bitcoin. It is not possible for a single person to teach a lot of people at the same time. But it is a good way to spread the term Bitcoin to those people who don't know anything about Bitcoin. May be they will be able to learn from their own research and by best effort.",

Buying Bitcoin may not be a wise idea for them, even if you gift it to them.It's nice to see people profiting from bitcoin, but things aren't always rosy.",

And what lessons we can derived out of it? as the supplying is dwindling every year because the demand is going up as there are investors coming up every year, which means the price could literally shoot up in the next 10 years or so.Right now, we are still in the bear market, so it's better to accumulate as much as we can.Doesn't mean that we need to buy 1 BTC right away, take it slow, used DCA and only invest what you can afford to lose.

Don't let us explain wrongly which will later lead to misunderstandings about what we explain and what they digest.I agree we have to provide knowledge about bitcoin to ordinary people, but before that we have to know what bitcoin is thoroughly.",

Introducing someone to bitcoin doesn't make you a successful trader. When you introduce people to bitcoin you are just promoting the currency and that's very commendable. For me I see Bitcoin as an investment and not really a currency because my country is not bitcoin friendly. I am also sure that with more awareness Bitcoin adoption will definitely increase because it has many advantage over fiat and people are gradually identifying them. We expect that last year's exchange drama would not repeat itself this year. But, it seems bitcoin is gradually becoming immune to these external influences.",

For example Binance. Everyone can use this exchange, because they accept KYC in the form of sim cards, ID cards and passports. However, fiat deposits as basic investment capital are only available for a few currencies. Even for those who are new, it can be difficult to understand about bank to crypto exchange transactions. But for those of us who have been here for years, of course this is not a problem. So, I think people know crypto, but don't know how to earn crypto. This means that education or understanding of crypto is still lacking. In fact, they often try to invest in crypto but in the end they are trapped by scammers due to a lack of understanding or knowledge about crypto.",
