We can't dictate you whether you shall buy now or not. So far solana is always showing us a good development result and that's why this coin can be considered as a major coin right now. It's always become a very good investment for long term. During the market crash and any coin will always become a legit investment except those garbage coin which has no value and scam token. You must aware if there are bunch of tokens right now. Solana is worth for long term investment.",

But Solana is a very unique project due to their exciting feature fast, secure, scalable, and decentralized. Solana is 3800 times faster than ETH 10000 times than BTC.  If you want to invest in Solana for short term at the current marketplace so bro is not the right time to invest. you have still wait for their buying zone with DCA of your portfolio & if you want to buy for long-term investment so it's not bad at the current price of 34$. I am not a finical adviser but it's my opinion.",

It could be a good idea to consider buying some quantity little by little to avoid the risk of buying a lot and the value still reduces. So plan your strategy and remember to only invest with your spare funds.",

Aside from Solana having already reached high, it has also shown a lot of problems. It has experienced network shutdowns already. That's a big no no for me. If this repeats, investors might finally realize it's not a good choice and lose trust. This is will result in massive dumping. What happened to Terra (LUNA) could happen to Solana as well.",

The only thing that i can suggest you are if you are feeling confidence with the current price and then you can try to invest in solana. You can also try to divide your money to invest in another crypto as well. it doesn't matter what kind of coin as long as that's top coin. These days there are bunch of top coins already undervalued caused by the dump. Solana is also one of the best choice for now.",

I think it's a good time to buy Sol at this price, as it's over 70% off ATH. Since we can't determine whether the market will rise or fall, you should use DCA to be able to buy the best prices possible instead of buying once.",

I can say that i also have Solana in my personal watchlist to invest into. I still have a little bit of stablecoins laying around that are doing nothing and that i want to invest into promising projects of which i think can do a x10 from it's current price in the mid- and longterm future. Solana is one of those.I personally will not invest until the price per Sol goes down to below 30 USD, maybe even below 25 $ depending on the market at that moment. I think a few more negative days like today and we will see those prices.",

Really found some solid teams with good experience in blockchain projects. Solana has great ideas and plans to achieve the idea step by step. This shows that the development team is willing to be more open and function better as a team because of it. I personally believe there is a great community behind this project that is working towards a brighter future and sometimes SOL is starting to move on its own not joining BTC.",
