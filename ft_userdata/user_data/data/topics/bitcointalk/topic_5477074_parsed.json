And then you find this place of them all a forum for Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts, it's a nice forum with smart members purely financial indeed.   But why the hell would someone give their hard earned money to a window shopper? You can also do what we do here, work, buy crypto and save it.But you know what? YOU need to create YOUR own success. Don't be weak and embarrass yourself like this and ask others for money when you an adult, you look like a loser to be honest.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0 here go and look for some trading advice and start yourself, don't ask anyone else to do the work for you. Trust me, when you done you will feel proud over yourself and get inspiration to climb even higher in life. It's an addiction to chase success and you will love it. I promise!",

      "body": "That's Reasonable - I'll start reading these threads - For side interest - At least it'll be an opportunity to learn about what more people are doing out there! And I might even get into it at some point.  I've been leery of getting involved with something I know so little about, and did come here on the wrong premise, I suppose - But I do respect what you guys seem to be very knowledgeable about - I Guess I will close this loan request here although, I must still find a solution to my need of $25 dollars. But Since, I'll be getting paid on Tuesday, It shouldn't be a big deal. Okay! Thx!",

They will know your face, your location or even have some of your documents so that in case you default it, they know where to get you from?Why choose to get a loan from the forum if you have no collateral?",
