(If you ran it for the month of July do you pay it out at end of month, or as the 1-100 win?)How many tasks should you have to complete? (How many task should be completed on your social media channels to win?)I guess the best way to communicate for the winners would be email?

Most airdrops that succesfully release their projects have a simple one. Limited is good to make the value of that bevome worth it. If the project is in seed or private round, youll definitely need more airdrop program to help gain awareness of your project.Try to check projects on icodrops with airdrops, maybe youll get idea on good process.",

Quote from: CryptoHealthPLus on June 29, 2022, 06:43:27 PMDo you do it for a limited time with a limited amount of people that win? (Run 1 month, 1st 100, get 1000 CHP coins?)Sometime airdrop were only being limited based on the various metrics. Quote from: CryptoHealthPLus on June 29, 2022, 06:43:27 PMWhen do you pay it out at the end or as it is live? (If you ran it for the month of July do you pay it out at end of month, or as the 1-100 win?)It's your choice when you wanna pay the airdrop. You can pay airdrop anytime. The date doesn't matter a lot. Some projects were even paying the airdrop after the network going full launch. Quote from: CryptoHealthPLus on June 29, 2022, 06:43:27 PMHow many tasks should you have to complete? (How many task should be completed on your social media channels to win?)That depends on what will be your qualifications. Any projects were doing airdrop have different qualifications.

I guess the best way to communicate for the winners would be email? Airdrops are a marketing campaign often used by virtual currency startups, but they only work if a lot of people are interested in the product. To ensure the success of an Airdrop, it is important that you know your target audience well.Awarding prizes to winners using the airdrop technique is an excellent method of enabling a smooth and simple awarding without leaving anyone behind or interrupting the event. It would be wise to consider these techniques especially if you are planning your own award event or giveaway.My opinion for Airdrop Winners should be emailed their claim instructions. In addition, you are extending their communication to a commonly used channel of information to inform other members of the community about products and update to them.",

There are amazing raffle systems that check the participants and see what they are doing. This is why I personally believe that the best case would be using a premade system that checks all of these. I personally prefer sweepwidget over gleam.io to be fair. Not that gleam is a bad one, but it is one that rarely works properly and constantly creates trouble for the giveaway maker, and that is why sweepwidget is better.Plus, the design is very different, that one has a much better design whereas gleam.io has such a big early 2000's type of look which doesn't really fly well with the crypto community, you need a much better look to get people interested.",

By having any partnership with certain trusted platforms that have been several times related to airdrop programs. like what @lobo13hf said. Btw, is Crypto Health Plus  listed in any exchange even DEX? It will be evry successful if the participants know that the token or coin has been listed in any exchange or going to be listed soon in certain exchanges. Quote from: CryptoHealthPLus on June 29, 2022, 06:43:27 PMDo you do it for a limited time with a limited amount of people that win? (Run 1 month, 1st 100, get 1000 CHP coins?)Limited people and times will be good I think, for it is related to the amount of reward that each person will probably get. If the reward is considerably not worthy, people will feel lazy to do the airdrop.Quote from: CryptoHealthPLus on June 29, 2022, 06:43:27 PMWhen do you pay it out at the end or as it is live? (If you ran it for the month of July do you pay it out at end of month, or as the 1-100 win?)If this is about fixed payment for each, as long as the participant has finished the requirement, they can get the rewards, it will be okay enough and will make more participants be more exciting to do Moreover if it is limited, the participants will do it quickly. Quote from: CryptoHealthPLus on June 29, 2022, 06:43:27 PMI guess the best way to communicate for the winners would be email?Do you ahve telergam group? This will become the main things that is commonly done by mostly airdroppers to explain the winner in general but if this is more specifically, it is good by email.",
