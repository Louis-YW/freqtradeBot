After all, what is required for transfer is just ERC20 address. What is so special with coinbase that you want to do a transfer to a person owing an account there?How about us who don't like that coinbase KYC? Do we stand any chance?",

I have never used Coinbase but maybe you can leave feedback to another user or make a report or something.Everything doesn't need to be as it looks.Â  Quote from: alterra57 on November 20, 2023, 11:46:19 AMI don't know how Coinbase works nowadays but sometimes they won't allow someone to withdraw to a 3rd party wallet for whatever reason.
