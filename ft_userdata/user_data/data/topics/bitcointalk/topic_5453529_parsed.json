More than half of finance professionals said gold is what they would buy if the US government fails to honor its obligations.\"___But more than 20% of Professional investors and more than 25% of Retail investors will bail out their Treasury and dollar investments. Or I do not understand the meaning of the US default?",

Gold is the typical go to assets of most investors that doesn’t have exposure or mislead by mainstream media about Bitcoin since Gold is physical. Most investors in the financial world is still old school when it comes to investment.I think the result is still good seeing Bitcoin on 3rd rank that overtake USD and YUAN which is the most popular fiat right now. It shows how people value more Bitcoin than worthless fiat which is the goal.",

It's a precious metal and if dollar losses its value the gold will get pumped and specially for the ones who bought it with dollar will gain edge over others. The investors will make profits with peace of mind, and that's a win-win situation.Those investors who decided to invest in Bitcoin are also among the smart ones because in such financial collapses the Bitcoin is expected to go higher in value due to the investments that the investors put into it. There is also a huge chance of a bull run in the coming months and the ones who invest in it can multiply their investment with the king of crypto world.The treasuries are also okay in such times because they can get such pumps as well in financial hard times. However, I would never prefer them over gold or Bitcoin because both of those are the best as a investment in such times and their returns on investments are quite higher with those two.",
