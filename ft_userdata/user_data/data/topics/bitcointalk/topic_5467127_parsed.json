I know it can be frustrating but you were the one who made a mistake, perhaps being more patient would not be a bad idea.I think from the manner in which the OP wrote, he is resigned to waiting. It is basically an error on his part and he seems to understand that but having to wait endlessly for a resolution is not acceptable. It has been over week and he has not been contacted.Quote from: acroman08 on September 17, 2023, 09:18:21 PManyway, I sent their forum representative a PM informing him about this case, there is no guarantee but he might be able to make a follow-up about your issue and hasten the process of it being resolved.That was a positive step by you. Hopefully their forum representative will be in contact with the OP soon.",

My observation is that cases like this require quite complicated technical solutions.By the way, how much is this accident worth?Quote from: PX-Z on September 17, 2023, 10:39:18 PM-snip-What kind of wallet are using btw, you should replace it for safety in the future.All non-custodial wallets usually only provide unobtrusive warnings as memo are only optional requests. This will not prevent the same error if the user is not careful.",
