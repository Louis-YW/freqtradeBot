On the one hand it may be due to a normal delay between the withdrawal request and approval, and, on the other hand, if it is not so you should give more data and provide everything you can as screenshots because in this section there are many accusations of which a large percentage is then shown that it was the player who actually broke the rules.",

You should clarify complete detailsmof your case because your statement doesn't make sense. Probably its due to language barrier but you should clarify how long does your transaction pending and what is the exact reply of the support on your case.I experienced long withdrawal waiting on Duelbits using Dogecoin before that took me 4hrs to process. I contacted live support then the withdrawal process immediately. Sometime their automatic withdrawal system commit some error that cause delay.",

Did you try contacting their forum representative first or posted anything on their Bitcointalk announcement thread yet?",

Probably its due to language barrier but you should clarify how long does your transaction pending and what is the exact reply of the support on your case.Their accusations are not very complete and it is not clear what they are accusing without evidence, so if the withdrawal process is not instant then it is better to wait because sometimes there are delays, but the problem is OP said he didn't make a mistake and or wasn't locked? This confused me. Quote from: dimonstration on April 15, 2023, 04:08:14 PMI experienced long withdrawal waiting on Duelbits using Dogecoin before that took me 4hrs to process.

I am agree with this point of view, seems to me like a simple case of pending transaction. Duelbits didn't cancel the payment and lock the account --at least that's what I get from OP's very limited description-- it's simply pending, OP should have tried to get in touch with their representative through chat or on their ann thread first instead of directly moving to this accusation thread.",

As far as the information gathered, it's said that it's not the actual casino's (Duelbits) problem but it's their provider.And with such problems of withdrawal delay, he's best to approach and just talk to them since they're approachable and very reputable that are not going to devastate the current reputation that they currently have. There's no update on their thread and from OP so I'm guessing that they're into negotiation and hopefully it ends up as a solved concern.",
