My advice for now is to continue to DCA. For people that are holding already, they should not sell, bitcoin all-time-high is coming, which would be after halving. For people that wants to buy the deep, they should be patient, or they can DCA, or they can do that now because the profit is coming. The best period to buy bitcoin is not yet over.",

      "body": "I think it's the best time to do both, especially hodling. Selling now will only make you incur additional losses, which you never expected, but hodling gives you a higher chance of getting both your profit and invested capital back in the next bull run. If you still have some spare money to buy more in this present market condition, then that's a choice for you to make, but there is no guarantee of what will come next in the market; we might still see more dips in the coming days or a price sparkle back to normal. It's just a two-way street; the choice is yours to make, and the amount you have at hand will also decide. Because the market is experiencing a drop based on the fuzz caused by the SEC and panic sellers, it doesn't give you the right to use your funds, which you budget for your daily expenses, because the money might not be ready and available when you might need it to cover up those expenses. Invest what you want to use, but don't be in a hurry to use.",

The dominance of bitcoin is still not contested and the halving that is approaching will further increase the dominance hopefully, so DCA at this price is still a good investment idea because soon the appreciation of price will be achieved. I won't dump now but to invest more.",

We'll be having the halving by next year so as the bull run will be followed by then if we'll based on the market cycle. But it all sums on what are the prices you think are affordable to you. $25k could be a good price when the holder aims to have it sold at $50k or more. And if you are undecided, much better to just follow the DCA approach.",

So there is still a possibility that the price may decrease more if you don't use stop-loss you may lose more.Unless you believe the issue on both Binance and Coinbase will solve early then DCA will work and if you can wait for long to hold while buying the dip.",

Anyway, Every dip that involves FUD news is a strong buy signal. This kind of news about SEC suing crypto company is not new and will not gonna give huge impact in the long run for crypto market. Buying more and holding your old holdings is the best thing to do in time like this that everyone is panicking on news. It’s not a collapse but an attack to start a collapse. Binance has a lot of time to react and defend themselves. This is just temporary.Buy the dip!",

So don't hesitate to buy on the Dip if it's Bitcoin, because in the few months that we've been through this year, Bitcoin has also gotten a little pump more often after a brief dip like it did in the past two days.",

It will be a great celebration for those that will endure to maintain hodling in this season because bullish market is very close.",

You HODL what you have and keep buying. Like Oshondy says:Quote from: Oshosondy on June 06, 2023, 10:32:32 AMMy advice for now is to continue to DCA. Trying to time the market is very difficult and most times counterproductive. DCA is better but it is not necessary to follow the simple DCA strategy, which consists of always buying exactly the same amount on the same day and at the same regular interval. You can take advantage of low market moments to buy more and bullish moments, when ATHs are beating, to make partial sales. We are now clearly in the first case.",

Again, if you guys are unsure and skeptical on when will be the perfect time to buy bitcoin, because basically nobody knows how sharp the correction is or the bottom, then the perfect thing to do is to DCA. Hodl is always a good opportunity, obviously and missing a dip is a missed opportunity as well. So, you have to look at bitcoin's ATH and do the math from there according to the current price today for you to somehow ease the difficulty of making decisions. Don't wait for the $25k, start buying fractions now might be a bit deeper as bitcoin starts recovering now.",
