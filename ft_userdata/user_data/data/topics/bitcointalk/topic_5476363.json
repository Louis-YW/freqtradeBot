  "content": "Hello,I have a small question for the mod of Archival board: on Dec 2nd I reported a post made by FIODNederland, with the following comment: \"Breaking rule 32. Posting multiple posts in a row (excluding bumps and reserved posts by the thread starter) is not allowed.\".This post was the second post in a row made by the above mentioned user. However, my report was flagged as \"Bad\":Just curious: why was it flagged as \"Bad\"? In the past I reported hundreds, if not thousands, such consecutive posts and my reports were flagged as \"Good\" and the posts were deleted. However, now the opposite happened. I would appreciate if the mod in charge will explain me this resolution.",

I personally wouldn't have marked it bad and sometimes in cases like this I would probably just choose not to handle it either way and if all mods do the same then it will just be purged anyway. Theymos has PMd op about it, but if the thread is locked/archived then you can certainly argue it might be an unnecessary report. The double posting is generally only really an issue when people make multi-posts to milk their signature campaign which at one point was quite prolific.",
