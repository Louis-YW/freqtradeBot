Why I agree that not all new projects are scam, always ensure that you do your own research before putting your hard earn money into a project, otherwise you will wake up to discover that the devs have disappeared with your money.I have a personal experience, a friend and a mentor told me about a new project that was looking very promising, he advised that I invest in it. So, I did even without doing my little investigating, not too long, the dev pulled out liquidity and that was the end of the road for the project.So, that's how I lost my investment in that project, though I didn't put much, just about 10$, but a lost is a lost.Please, be careful out there, the devs are not smiling And if you must invest in a project you are not too sure of, always put something small, don't go all in, you might end up regretting.",

Anyway theres a lot of factors to do and thats gonna be crucial when investing. $10 or $1k there is no difference but that will still be at risk, but gaining profits are also can be considered.You need to have a lot of researches before putting any money on it.",

They simply are pump and dumps and you lose money when you don't accept that they are pump and dumps! For example the biggest altcoins in top 10 list are also pump and dumps since they have no other utility in real world. So when you don't know how to make profit from such schemes you always end up with your pants down during the dump and lose money specially if you are one of those people who decided to bag hold and hope for the recovery instead of cutting your losses and exiting.",

Developers, on the contrary, will smile at the top of their lungs to lure you into an investment trap. But the thought of why everything is so beautiful should always be pulsing in your head. No one will ever create ideal conditions because there is no need to pay for what can be stolen. Unfortunately, in our time, this rule has become popular, and when tempted to invest or not, try not to catch yourself in doubt. If in doubt, and intuition does not fail you, close the page and do not come back.",

Never brag friendship, family, emotions into finance which is really danger to the money.",

      "body": "A new project should have a community on telegram or discord where every trouble encountered by users can be found. When investing in new projects always reach out to other investors in the community who had a dispute, discuss with them to know their thoughts about the project, how their use case can benefit the cryptocurrency market in the future, and verify with them if their problems were resolved. If the project is a coin, I'd advise you not to purchase yet, unless you have some bucks to throw in after doing your diligence research. Though recently, the cryptocurrency market is in trouble even real projects are not an exception to the attacks hackers launch every day in the market, as investors we are to capitalize on risks. A new project may not have enough security to secure its users or refund them if there get hacked and money is lost. However, it's a general barrier, some big projects escape with people's money without refunds after getting hacked, but new projects can easily go scot-free unlike established projects. On the side of developers, many are here to make money, once their project starts attracting people, gradually they'll think of a way to rug pull and run an exit scam. Probably, they'll move ahead to create a fresh project and promote it with all they've made from their previous scam. That's why most time I wonder how fresh projects get to the top easily. Some get investor cool, but others are promoted with scam money. Hence developers are becoming lazy to create a unique web-based project, they're, most a times, going to launch another project that'll look similar to the previous ones. So, investors always watch out for projects that look quite similar; same idea, UI, and goal to scam projects. They're likely to be the same team in another coat.",

Everyone who is pulling out liquidity is just a scammer. Anyone can create a token, you don't need to be a developer to do so. And these days they can pretty much do every step of design with ai. Make AI to write generic crypto whitepapers, roadmaps, descriptions... And spice it up with Midjourney's AI graphics. So they don't even have to even work on that anymore.That's all they are. Scammers. Dev starts being Dev instead of scammer after he starts developing. That doesn't rule out scamming in the future though.",
