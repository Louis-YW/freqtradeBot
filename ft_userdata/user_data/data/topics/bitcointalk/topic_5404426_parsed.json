I can't commit right at this moment but do want, thanks!Hiya, ZipReg.Great question! We originally made 100 sets. However, we've used a few sets to experiment with different finishes, stamping techniques, and aerodynamic characteristics. After all the testing, I believe the unofficial number of available sets is somewhere around 95, give or take. Plenty for everyone! On a different note, I'd like to thank everyone for all the positive interest in this new project. We still have several sets available, so order now while supplies last.Thanks again, everyone!

      "body": "Sorry for my absence lately, everyone. I've been working on five different BP® projects that should all be released within the next 4 weeks. Ugh! So much work. But still not enough to properly excuse my lack of replies. That's just my naturally forgetful mind. PreciousMetapsICT: Your order was shipped a few days ago, and USPS says that it's out for delivery, so it should arrive today. There was a slight delay due to questions about the bead blasted finish. The bead blasted finish looks a little nicer than the brushed finish that I originally wanted, so we went with that for the release. However, we found out that the bead blasted finish is super delicate and shows every little scrape and scuff. So after some experiments, we switched back to a 1200g brushed finish, which is a good compromise of the two finishes, I think. Fine enough to be attractive, but easy to re-finish yourself with a little bit of 0000 steel wool or a bottle of Brasso. But in appreciation of your patience, each of the original orders of 3 stars went out with an extra 4th star. The 4th star is considered a factory second / blemished item, so you won't have to feel bad if it gets scuffed or dinged by whatever you might choose to do with it...and the tree in your backyard. Thank you, FattCatt. In the meantime, please look forward to a big multi-projects update later today, and thank you again for flying BP® Airlines.Regards,Chris@TBPCo.",
