CZ has been bailing out platforms in the cryptospace that are at risk of bankruptcy or those that have been bankrupted already. Is this the activity of company that is at risk to be bankrupt? Head scratching if you say yes.On Kraken, it has been online for a very long time without problems, without big scandals and I reckon it certainly will continue to exist without problems and without scandals.",

Second, your coins on exchanges are not yours on blockchain.It is not a wise question to ask because any exchange can be the next to be hacked. You can receive a coin from a friend, seen as tainted from the exchanges and be seized or your account can be frozen. The question can be 'what is the best exchange for trading', not the safest because all exchanges are not safe. Use open source noncustodial cold storage option to hold your coins which is the safest.Try as much as possible to stay away from exchanges and hold your coins on a cold wallet, or hardware wallet.",

Still, it does not justify as to how you will be going to hold your money using an exchange. In fact, knowing that your coins are stored off of an exchange can save you a lot of headaches, especially when the big trading platforms go south. You also don't want to consider fund reimbursements promised by exchanges as insurance though!!Plus, knowing which red flags are associated with bankruptcy is not important because remember exchanges are safe until such time it didn't.

      "body": "From the list I strongly believe that to make this a fair comparison for all, we have to consider how many countries are able to access these platforms and I think crypto.com and bybit doesn't cover most countries...which means they are low risk takers and don't move on to my finalists but could be considered safe in their small markets  On the contrary Binance seems to be the big dog of the industry and have fought off several hurdles such as regulation blocks which was used to slow them down, but they made it out alive and still hold top spot and pretty much have all the experience & they have seen it all in regards to safety which probably has forced them to have put measures to protect their clients assets in case something unfortunate happens which makes them the safest bet here.As for Kucoin, well these guys could have taken top spot  as they have been in this business for such a long time and understand the industry well, but they seem to be keeping a low profile in terms of making their presence known which suggests they are comfortable were they are. In terms of a safety, they have had less incidents of exchange compromises which makes them another safe platform to consider. But remember, \"not your private key not your coins\" so remain cautious when using any of these exchanges.",

As for trading, which is why centralized platforms exist, then I guess it should be most important that they have liquidity, as few fees as possible and KYC, which is not a nightmare.

Head scratching if you say yes.It's your personal matter, if you want to believe that CZ is a person of high trust who does good for all of us, then live in that belief. Until recently, you had a very positive opinion about Bankman, and it turned out that he is not exactly the most intelligent, quite the opposite.Quote from: bbc.reporter on May 18, 2022, 12:45:48 AMAre we witnessing the emergence of the biggest bitcoin antagonist in the cryptospace? I think Sam Bankman-Fried is one of the most intelligent founders in the cryptospace, however, I am starting to be more skeptical about his agenda. In the article, he mentioned that bitcoin may have a future as an asset, a commodity or a store of value. I am scratching my head on what he might be implying in his statement. Is he telling us that bitcoin will not forever be no.1 in market capitalization?",

Gox, QuadrigaCX, FTX, and countless others.If you think that Binance's behavior right now is a guarantee that it isn't going bankrupt anytime, you could have been fooled more easily by FTX's behavior mere months before it collapsed. You should indeed be shaking your head with that logic of yours.Who would have thought that FTX would crumble down after bailing out Voyager and BlockFi, looked into buying Robinhood, considered bailing out Celsius as well, and had billions ready to save crypto firms that lost liquidity amidst the crypto winter?Who would have imagined that the CEO of FTX who donated many millions to politicians, even mentioned that he could donate a \"soft ceiling\" of $1 billion in the 2024 elections, is actually running a bankrupt company?Who would expect that the platform that squandered so much money on very expensive ads like the Super Bowl, naming rights on Miami Heat's Arena, UC Berkeley football field, Mercedes F1 team, and others is actually going insolvent soon?Who would have expected that the exchange that has stars like Steph Curry, Naomi Osaka, Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, and others under its payroll is actually having financial troubles within?Binance's activities right now are incomparable to that of FTX months ago, and yet FTX suddenly died. Is it, therefore, a surprise to you if Binance would also die anytime?",

The exact opposite (emphasis mine):Quote from: https://www.binance.com/en/termsTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL BINANCE, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SUPPLIERS OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, INFORMATION, REVENUE, PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESSES OR FINANCIAL BENEFITS) ARISING OUT OF BINANCE SERVICES, ANY PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF BINANCE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT, SERVICE OR OTHER ITEM PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF BINANCE AND ITS AFFILIATES, WHETHER UNDER CONTRACT, STATUTE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORYSomething unfortunate happens - the customers lose everything and agree that Binance are not responsible in any way. We gave all your money to random third parties? We went bankrupt? We were hacked and lost everything? Whoopsie! Not our problem. In such an event the average user of Binance will be in the exact same position as the average user of FTX, of Celsius, of Voyager, etc. They will be classed as an unsecured creditor, meaning they will be dead last on the list of entities who get compensation and will therefore be unlikely to see a single satoshi of any coins they have lost.Quote from: Darker45 on December 23, 2022, 03:05:41 AM-snip-That's how the saying goes - the empty vessel makes the most noise. Often the platforms which are struggling the most will spend the most on advertising and partnerships and sponsorships and all the rest to make them appear in a much stronger position than they actually are. Meanwhile actually strong projects (such as Bisq) essentially have no advertising at all.It's a mirror image of the whole of crypto itself. Bitcoin, a truly decentralized coin has essentially zero advertising budget, but is and always has been the safest and most secure coin. Centralized shitcoins, on the other hand, spend millions on advertising, airdrops, flashy websites, signature campaigns, social media campaigns, YouTube sponsorships, and so on on, and end up collapsing or scamming and everyone losing their money.",
