  "content": "This article is basically only about Covid. But the big point is that if vitamin D3 were supplemented for almost every disease and malady, the people would be so healthy that it would put the medical out of business. Healthy people are happy and productive people. The medical is a leach on society, murdering people by not advising them on the way to remain healthy.Big Tech censorship of vitamin D as covid treatment KILLED 116,000 Americans so far, warns the Health Ranger, who was banned by YouTube, Twitter and Facebook for telling the TRUTHQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-11-25-censorship-vitamind-covid-killed-116000-americans.html# In his Nov. 21, 2022, Situation Update, the Health Ranger discussed a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports which claims 116,000 American lives could have been saved from Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) death had these individuals taken more immune-boosting vitamin D.Not only that, but another four million “cases” of the Fauci Flu could have avoided hospitalization or injury had these people known that optimizing vitamin D levels through regular sun exposure or supplementation is absolutely critical for maintaining health and well-being.“The research on this was known by Trump administration people, by Biden, by Fauci, the CDC, the NIH, the AMA, the AAFP and truly the FDA as well: they knew that vitamin D saved lives and they decided to suppress it,” the Health Ranger explained.“And this shows that Dr. Eric Nepute is correct, and he’s being sued for half a trillion dollars by the DoJ over this.”Nepute, in case you missed it, faces federal charges for selling supplements out of his chiropractic business that contain vitamin D, as well as other immune-boosting nutrients such as zinc. More on that is available in our earlier coverage.How many Americans are needlessly getting sick and dying because they’re vitamin D deficient?It is truly a shame that the government withheld the truth about vitamin D from the American public throughout the scamdemic. Many people already know about it, but many others do not – and had they known, they could have avoided the worst of it.Not only that, but Big Tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter actively censored accounts that drew attention to vitamin D as a viable remedy for the Fauci Flu. The Health Ranger is one of them, though Natural News has been banned from social media for many years now.“The censorship of people like myself and others like Dr. Joseph Mercola cost the lives of 116,000 Americans that we know of so far,” the Health Ranger said. “Because without censorship, we would have been very successful at getting out the message on vitamin D and zinc and quercetin and ivermectin.”...",
