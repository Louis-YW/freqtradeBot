  "content": "QuotePassword manager giant LastPass has confirmed that cybercriminals stole its customers’ encrypted password vaults, which store its customers’ passwords and other secrets, in a data breach earlier this year.In an updated blog post on its disclosure, LastPass CEO Karim Toubba said the intruders took a copy of a backup of customer vault data by using cloud storage keys stolen from a LastPass employee. The cache of customer password vaults is stored in a “proprietary binary format” that contains both unencrypted and encrypted vault data, but technical and security details of this proprietary format weren’t specified. The unencrypted data includes vault-stored web addresses. It’s not clear how recent the stolen backups are.LastPass said customers’ password vaults are encrypted and can only be unlocked with the customers’ master password, which is only known to the customer. But the company warned that the cybercriminals behind the intrusion “may attempt to use brute force to guess your master password and decrypt the copies of vault data they took.”Toubba said that the cybercriminals also took vast reams of customer data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers and some billing information.https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/lastpass-customer-password-vaults-stolen/We should never trust our data to those big corporations.Hackers got Employees keys  , customers passwords, name, billing information,  email..What the fuck! This is a password manager. How does this kind of shit happens?And why do people share so much sensitive information (such as billing information) with a password manager?Password managers are a must today. You should always use a different password , and a strong one  and we can't remind all of them But the problem is which pass manager to choose.Keypass and bitwarden are probably the best.Protecting our passwords is similar to protecting our bitcoin and our exchange accounts.",

It is not a matter of trust; rather, it is a matter of verifying the type of password manager we use; is it open source? Is it AES-256 encrypted end-to-end? These are questions that anyone should consider before storing or using a password manager for sensitive information. Is it necessary to have one for those of us who have multiple social accounts, as well as for those of us who use different passwords for each of our online accounts? You need a password manager if you are the type who uses \"forgot password\" after a short period of time. Last time I checked, Last Pass was not open source, which is a red flag.Bitwarden; is one of the best and this is what i use ( open source )If these companies are not held accountable for selling and leaking private data to hackers, these \"oh we got hacked\" BS excuses will continue, and people will continue to lose money and private documents to criminals.",

Online hackers can not hack my wallet, can not steal my passwords. They can't.Basic backups are enough.Let us not forget that password managers are not exclusively about \"storing\" your logins, passwords, and other sensitive information. They also help you organize your passwords and generate them in a secure manner using strong random number generators. They protect you from reusing passwords: they will warn you if some of your passwords aren't unique, and they incentivize you to change your credentials more frequently. They offer auto-filling functionality that is very handy and also may theoretically protect you from keyloggers since you no longer need to enter information manually with the keyboard. This is not to say that I am in support of LastPass (I stopped using this password manager a long time ago), but DIY solutions like pieces of paper with passwords written on them don't guarantee that your passwords are unhackable and random because the human brain can't do real randomness.",

Now if this url data can be associated to the customer identification data that they mention in the last paragraph (unencrypted presumably), then they can create a pretty targeted database for phishing/smishing, whereby they’d be able to tailor the phishing message to a particular site that the user has an account on, with a wide variery of choices derived from the complete dataset.",
