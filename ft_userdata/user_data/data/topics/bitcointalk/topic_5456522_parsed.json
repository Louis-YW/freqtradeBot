Simply search @WechatVerificationBot using telegram or go to https://t.me/wechatverificationbotYou can even buy a fully verified account there with wechat pay enabledHow can someone sell his or her verified account to somebody they have no knowledge about. Do you not think selling such an account verified with seller details would put such account owner at risk if the buyer plans buying and using it for nefarious act.How sure are we that you putting up this post is genuine looking at your profile, you have nothing to loose of you make away with funds fr potential buyers here but I can assure you, members here are wise and smart to fall for this trap OP. If truly you are genuine OP, I would advise you use the service of an escrow for payment so as to create room for transparency and when that is done I think it will boast a little confidence in your deal because nobody would want to risk his or her fund with a newbie with no activities and reputation here.",

Instead of addressing the issues or answering the queries. OP just decided to delete what he posted and created a new locked post in the Marketplace board - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458438.0This means he's targeting unsuspecting newbies.
