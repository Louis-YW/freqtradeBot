I am talking about your first link. Probably the problem is from your side not the forum.You can look at the image option on your browser settings, it could have been changed to text only. But this would be the case if other images are not also showing for you.",

Your post and joker_josue's post showing image perfectly to,  also this in Orpichukwu quoted posts it's fine.I don't think issue is with Bitcointalk image proxy, check your machine might be some antivirus or adblocker is blocking the images.I happened to me once, usually I block images specifically from websites like reddit (due to NSFW nature) while browsing and I accidently blocked bitcointalk too and after spinning head around figured out issue was from my side",

I recommend you to clear the cache of your browser and disable the extensions which might be casing such error. I think the issue is with the browser that you're using and clearing out the cache might solve the issue.",

I was affected, that day, for a few hours I was unable to see images on the forum.Imagine my despair when I entered the forum and saw that the images hosted on TalkImg were not appearing. Until I realized that the problem was with my Internet provider, I went around trying to solve a problem, which in reality doesn't exist with my service.",

As a result, this seems to be just your problem, perhaps due to your internet connection or provider.Quote",

Is it just me or it happens to everyone?I was going to say, take an SS and show us how is it showing on your side hehe. Well, Things are working fine by my side, I don't know what might be causing this on your side, but maybe you should try to clear the history cache or maybe change the browser for a while to just check whether it is an issue of the browser or of the internet. Maybe at the time of the creation of this thread, they might be down, but now some time has passed so that might be the reason that we are not seeing any issues now.",

Tried using Firefox on my mobile phone and it seems working for me and not an issue. If clearing cache won't solve the problem then maybe uninstall and reinstall the browse may have work or update to the latest version might work. Whenever I came across an issue within a browser is I always uninstall and reinstall the app if clearing chache won't work in my case but now, no issue at the moment.",
