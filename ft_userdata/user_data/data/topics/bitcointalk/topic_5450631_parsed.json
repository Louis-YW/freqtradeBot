I think there was no print or anything that made it distinguishable from a regular one, right?And what's an OTP card?",

I think there was no print or anything that made it distinguishable from a regular one, right?And what's an OTP card?    The OTP card is a ONE TIME PASSWORD card MTGOX came out with as follows..        Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has announced some new updates and features to its platform including a one-time password (OTP) card.This battery-powered password generator is linked to a user's account, and can be used for an additional layer of security, either by storing a unique password or generating a new one every time a user performs actions such as logging in or initiating a withdrawal online.The card costs $39.99 and is shipping now. For more information about the Mt. Gox OTP card, the exchange has produced a resource guide.     You can read more about it on my thread that I made years ago  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3557001.0     I was fortunate to be able to find two of these thru the years of hunting for them",
