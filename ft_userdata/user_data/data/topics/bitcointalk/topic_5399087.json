  "content": "What is the minimum transaction value to be accepted by the nodes?EDIT:I tested it ...1. Took UTXO 2c88d249902586908e55116527ff8cb4c14975bd233cb93a2b759db43a3fe358 vout 0 and created several transactions. Each transaction had 1 input and 18 outputs with increasing values (+1 sat), so a whole range could be tested at once eg. 200 sats - 217 sats, if valid or not.2. Broadcast the transactions via different providers. It wasn't accepted until 546 sat output. Below, you can see the error messages.https://blockchair.comresult: Invalid transaction. Error: dusthttps://blockstream.inforesult: sendrawtransaction RPC error: {\"code\":-26,\"message\":\"dust\"}https://btc.networkresult: Not a valid transaction hash!https://bitaps.comresult: Mempool accept test failed: dust3. The first accepted transaction you can check here:tx hash e849378d3aedb4152aad3ac71f0c15f44ed3e29c90b6e2c1b25a2c8d23d34d62 block 736,966 minimum 546 sats, 18 outputs, each +1 satI also wanted to know if it's 546 or 547 sats that is accepted. Now we know that it's 546 sats for non-segwit addresses.EDIT (2):Quote from: LoyceV on May 19, 2022, 06:54:10 AMTo complete the test, you should do the same to a Bech32 address...Tested it with a TX to the address bc1qwpc320c70sz7mf7v6vyu5v7lzjv3hlsa23d8ew (from a nice bitcointalk user   )This time I made 3 transactions: 293 sats, 294 sats and 295 sats as I knew the limit 294 sats, but didn't know what was the accepted value.Broadcast 293 sats transaction via same providers:https://blockchair.comresult: Invalid transaction. Error: dusthttps://blockstream.inforesult: sendrawtransaction RPC error: {\"code\":-26,\"message\":\"dust\"}https://btc.networkresult: Not a valid transaction hash!https://bitaps.comresult: Mempool accept test failed: dustBroadcast 294 sats transaction ... accepted:tx hash 42bd160a3a473cbe73c4178e126921b45697e810913c8bb21c610025462076bd block 737,081Now we know that the lowest accepted value for segwit addresses is 294 sats.",

Although you will have great difficulty trying to broadcast such a transaction, there is nothing which says it cannot be mined in to a block. The two most likely ways that this transaction ended up in a block was either that one or more nodes had altered their dustRelayFee setting to accept transactions which create smaller outputs, or a miner decided to include it directly in to the block they were mining.Quote from: Charles-Tim on May 17, 2022, 08:44:04 PMI thought nodes validate confirmed transactionsNodes verify both unconfirmed transactions, which they add to their mempool, and transactions included in the blocks they receive.Quote from: Charles-Tim on May 17, 2022, 08:44:04 PMCan a transaction not up to the minimum amount of bitcoin be broadcasted into the mempool, included into a block and got confirmed but later got invadated by nodes?If a transaction is included in a block, but a node deems that transaction invalid, then the node will reject the entire block as invalid.

I am curious to figure out whether this minimum size would be even smaller if the fee sent was just 1 sat/byte (ditto for the legacy transactions).It has nothing to do with the fee rates of a transaction.The fees as stated in the code is actually referring to the dust relay fee instead of the actual transaction fee. This is a user-configurable parameter but the standard is kept at 3sat/byte to maintain the 546sat dust limit that was before the introduction of this dust relay fee. But yes, if the user changes the dust relay fee, then their node would see a different dust limit.",
