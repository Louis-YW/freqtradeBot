Looks like the next bull run is near. The next bull run won't come soon. It won't come when a next halving is still far. Bitcoin bull runs are triggered by its halving every four years.Next year 2023, we can have a mini bull run similar to a mini bull run in 2019. Having 100% increase for your portfolio in a mini bull run is good enough. Zoom out the chart and see what occurred in 2019 and how that mini bull run started and ended as well as how Bitcoin ended that year compares to its price at beginning of 2019.",

Looks like the next bull run is near. Its good to see that a leading presidential candidate is a supporter of bitcoin. Lets just hope that he wins the elections. But I am sure that many influential economics in World Bank, International Monetary Funds, Paris Club and other international lending organization that are controlled by politicians that are bent on controlling the financial sector of most nations would do everything possible to make him loose the elections. They would ensure they influence the voters and the electoral body to ensure that Javier Gerardo Milei losses the election because if Argentina because a core Bitcoin nation, it would be a big blow to these bitcoin haters.",

It remains to be seen whether the current presidential candidate is serious about what he is saying or just a populist looking for additional votes, but somehow it doesn't seem to me that Milei can get away with his radical ideas.QuoteBitcoin is the natural reaction against the Central Bank scammers and to make money private again. […] In economies with high inflation, the scam problem is bigger. That’s why, as I suggest, you can propose to close the Central Bank. 7 years ago, the same story, only with a different name, very interesting Argentina’s New President Might Just be a Bitcoin Supporter",

Looks like the next bull run is near. That's a good sign to hear since if their leading presidential candidate is open for crypto currency then we can say that cryptocurrency circulation or the adoption might go wider in their country. But all of this is  just a hearsay yet since he didn't win and show his performance towards this issues. Maybe if he can successfully got a set and say something good words about it maybe we can see some changes on bitcoin, but this doesn't mean it will have a bull run but rather a short term hype only.",

I wouldn't say that he is that powerful though, if he ever wins the Presidential election, then maybe we can brand him like that and who knows how he will turn his country to pro-Bitcoin like Bukele of El Salvador.It's worth noting though that he is a new breed of politicians.QuoteMilei, who is currently running for Argentina’s 2023 presidential election, can be classified as a die-hard Bitcoiner who preaches the Austrian school of economic thought and calls himself an “anarcho-capitalist.” In previous interviews, he said he wants to “kick the ass of Keynesians and collectivists” and is raffling off his monthly salary to counter a government that he believes is “stealing” from ordinary Argentine citizens.https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-presidential-candidate-preaches-bitcoin/And maybe this is going to be the one that will push Bitcoin to it's new high in 2024 or at least 6 digits minimum when President of a country backing up it up as legal tender.",

They may be seeing some good progress with El Salvador that's why most of them wanted to also implement it in their country to try and maybe become the reason for the increase of their economy.",

To think that one man's opinion will cause some massive bull run that will launch Bitcoin above $100k is childish to say the least, because if we should have learned anything from the example of El Salvador, it is that \"legal tender\" means almost nothing if people they don't want to use Bitcoin as a currency.I really don't understand what is so attractive about the idea that politicians give some kind of approval for Bitcoin, when it basically functions without any permission from the Genesis block until today.",

Just use it as way to make pseudonymous transactions along with the data integrity man. Who cares what politician says or Hollywood actor says.

It will not also lead to massive adoption by other countries, you should also remember that not everyone will use bitcoin if after adoption.Politician can not influence the price of bitcoin since it is not controlled by the government. Sometimes politicians use this as a strategy for the youths to vote them into power but after they have won the election,they will go against bitcoin adoption.",

He can do the same as El Salvador and have the peso run free in parallel with bitcoin until people by themselves stop using the worthless peso.The only purpose of a central bank is to aid local banks in case of bankruns, bankruns exist due to fractional reserve. People should know better than trusting their money to banks or the State coming to aid them, so its a State protected \"business\" (distortion) which makes zero sense.Historically it happens they were also put in control of money emission, which becomes obsolete with Bitcoin.",

He is a far-right politician, supporter of Trump and Bolsonaro, a person who denies climate change and supports an antisemitic conspiracy theory of cultural Marxism (I'm just taking info from Wikipedia here). Honestly, I hope he doesn't win the elections, despite the fact that having a strongly pro-Bitcoin president of a big country would be good. Given his political strategy, what he says about Bitcoin and the Central Bank must simply reflect the opinion of his electorate. It also especially makes sense in Argentina to not trust the bank and fiat, given that their inflation is incredibly bad (6th worst inflation in the world). Hopefully, another person with more reasonable political views will come to power and also be supportive of Bitcoin there.",

Other leaders who have not adopted its use, I believe, are simply skeptical and waiting to see the outcome of those countries that have legalized and adopted its use, such as the case of the El-Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele who have already adopted its use. We anticipate greater global adoption and use in the coming years.",

During times like this, politicians appear with the perfect solutions for problems which haven't been solved so far. Before and during the elections, politicians are idealists and compromised, full of principles and morals, committed with their countrymen till the end.However, once the elections are over and the winner takes place, the scenario completely changes. All those promises made during the campaign can't be executed anymore, because \"Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable — the art of the next best\", as said Otto von Bismarck. Then time passes, nothing concrete is done, oppositors are considered guilty by the government for not achieving what they promised, and then another party takes place on the next elections. The cycle repeats itself endlessly.That is why we shouldn't put the focus of our lives in major changes. Those politicians and their lackeys are living from this burlesque, while we, common citizens are wasting our times expecting something good will come from them. I think we should care for our own lives, individually, and make progress on this field.The subject pointed here is bitcoin adoption, so it's perfect that we can adopt and use bitcoin with or without a supportive bitcoin government taking place. In fact, those politicians will make no difference in our lives and no difference regards bitcoin adoption at all...",
