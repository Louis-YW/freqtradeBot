  "content": "Printing 10 quadrillion euros against 10 quadrillion dollars by 2025 will be a challenge.In order to maintain the value of the dollar, it will be necessary to print the same number of euros and other currencies against it, It will be the first time that the world has not prepared to deal with major crises in 2025, which the world has not prepared, Because it's bitcoin and doesn't mean ten quadrilion or more, it's a ditch where infinite fiat will need to be printed,",

Second, many companies or businesses can get loans because there is a lot of money printed.And of course, when that happens, he will also be able to reduce the average percentage of the unemployment problem in their countries. But there is also a risk; one of them is the possibility of hyperinflation, and the second is that the value of the dollar and euro can also decrease for sure.",

I really wish people would make the effort to understand things before coming to stupid conclusions and before typing such things think for a moment if they are actually true and reflect reality.There are a ton of misconceptions, such as a government printing money obviously triggers inflation, which is not always the case, see Japan for example which is in deflation despite increasing x7 times the monetary mass and Turkey experiencing 60% inflation despite printing less than Japan by 2 times compared to GDP.US printed 3 trillion in 2020, if what you think would be true we would already have had to see the $ collapse against every pair by at least 20%, it doesn't!Do you know who else printed money at a rate of 30 billion per year? BTC did!Somehow it's not stopping it from going higher, I wonder why!",
