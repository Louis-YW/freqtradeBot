The problem does not lie in how you communicate, but in your attempt to hide things. If you put money in escrow, you will inevitably find everyone involved.",

Its not easy managing two to three accounts, how much more 10 of it. I wish you all the luck you can get but it'll be more ideal to spread the job across people (that's if the job is real and ideal) else it will overwhelm you at some point in time.And always seek some contributions from the forum as more people might be into it same job you want to adventure into.",
