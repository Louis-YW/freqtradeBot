      "body": "It is certainly an interesting concept for a government to offer financial incentives to encourage citizens to move to certain areas. There may be potential benefits to this approach, such as boosting the economy and population of the targeted regions, and potentially easing overcrowding or resource strains in larger cities like Tokyo.",

I don’t think it is a good direction to concentrate all talents in first-tier cities. There will be a lot of resource conflicts, which will make the new generation of employed people feel tremendous pressure, which will reduce happiness. We forget, Isn't our life a struggle for happiness? It's not about grabbing resources, fighting as the purpose of life.",

      "body": "How did the Japanese government come up with this idea, how many years of research on the demographics in Tokyo? I think this is a very smart idea considering that there is an overpopulation in the city of Tokyo. In Asian cultures especially in Tokyo if you are poor, you are frowned upon. If you work in a business type professional environment setting you are highly looked up. Moving to the city is where you have higher chances of being successful and have lots of money. So those that have that mentality move towards Tokyo to become something and make a living. I can see how this would move their standards in a different route with the population in Tokyo and help the country of Japan control the population including the environment.",

      "body": "That’s crazy, living in Tokyo is very, very expensive so I’m not sure if $7,500 is enough to tempt people to leave, who are obviously already quite comfortable financially.I can see the temptation to live in a quieter, slower paced city or town. I’m just not sure how many people this government offer will appeal to as current Tokyo citizens are already kinda rich. It costs a lot to live there.Maybe there is a minority in the city who suffer from a level of poverty, this offer could appeal to them.",
