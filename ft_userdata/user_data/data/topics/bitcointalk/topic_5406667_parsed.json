  "content": "Almost all countries, especially central banks globally, are busy with preparations for digital currencies issued by central banks. In fact, according to a survey by the Bank for International Settlements, almost 90% of central banks are heading towards Digital Currency and some have even been piloted.However, regarding the chosen digital currency, it turns out that there are various kinds of different responses from each country. Some prefer privately issued Tokens such as USDT, USDC and others which we usually call Stablecoins. For example, the Governor of the Australian Central Bank Prefers Privately Issued Tokens Over CBDC.and the CEO of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, also agrees with the opinion of the Governor of the Central Bank of Australia, Phillip Lowe, who says that regulated Private Tokens (Stablecoins) are better than Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). this was expressed directly by Philip Lowe at the G20 Event. perhaps there are many from other countries who agree with Philip Lowe. (Note: The G20 is a multilateral cooperation forum consisting of 19 major countries and the European Union (EU). The G20 represents more than 60 percent of the world's population, 75 percent of global trade and 80 percent of the world's GDP.however disaster that befell TerraUSD may be a consideration and influence the choices of various countries when deciding between a stablecoin or a CBDC.what is your view regarding this issue. If you as a citizen of a country are given the opportunity or are invited to choose which digital currency your country will use, which one would you prefer between Stablecoin and CBDC?Reference sources news and images : https://beincrypto.com/https://nocash.ro/cbdc-and-stablecoins-early-coexistence-on-an-uncertain-road/",

You cannot make a pseudo anonymous transaction using CBDC, but you can using stable coins.Stable coins run in a lot of different blockchains, so you can make trades in DEX and similar software without doing KYC, for example. You won't be able to do so in CBDC.There will be a great surveillance over CBDC. It will be much similar to fiat.",

On the other hand, stable coins like tether are creations as a result of the existence of the blockchain. And when not decentralized, it's difficult to be trusted. If you save your money in CBDC and inflation hits your country, the value of your money will lose and even the stable coins aren't immune to inflation. Well, since there is bitcoin, I can choose CBDC over other centralized stable coins.",

CBDCs are designed to make the financial system more centralized by removing the middlemen-the banks and the financial service providers. Stablecoins on the other hand are simply adding an unnecessary middleman between fiat money and the customers.The only purpose of stablecoins is to make cryptocurrency trading more convenient by adding a less volatile pseudo-financial asset.What's the point of using a stablecoin that is backed by fiat money, when you could use fiat money directly? I believe that stablecoins have no other utility besides crypto trading.With CBDCs we will borrow money directly from the central banks in the future. I'm not sure if this going to be good or bad. It definitely has pros and cons and we will need a more in-depth analysis.",

Like now, not all payments are done with CC. Some are in cash, some are done as bank transfer and so on.Even more: the system, although trackable, it won't be transparent. So only certain agencies will have access for the tracking information.I see no risk for defense or other sensitive payments... (unless done by complete idiots, obviously).",

Even right now you would have to submit all the documents and stuff and then you would be able to avail the exchange. Therefore it does not really differ.",

While 90% is among the surveyed 81 banks, the number for global representation is two-thirds, considering of central banks consider CBDCs. Considerations, though, don't entail actual adoption. It can just be in terms of investigating pros and cons, perhaps experimenting with a limited launch. In any case, I don't think it's a big threat to the crypto market. As for stablecoins which aren't issued by banks, perhaps CBDCs can be a good competition to them.",

As long as it will be in the mainstream where many platforms or services supports it but for now I will go for stable coins. Stable coins have many uses other than trading. You can use it for gambling, lending, staking, sending/receiving money, etc. In terms of borrowing maybe cbdc is good compare to other borrowing service because this one is direct with the bank. You are sure that the transaction are safe and secure, and maybe the fees are fairer.

      "body": "If every bank produced their own stablecoin, there would be a huge problem of interoperability. For example, I have Bank of America coins but the merchant only accepts Wells Fargo coins. A few coins would be manageable, but if there are 1000 coins it would never work.So, that brings up the next problem. If there can only be a few coins, it would put small banks out of business because they couldn't compete with the big banks.Regardless, the idea of a CBDC really doesn't make sense. A CBDC would not provide any benefit beyond what banks and central banks already provide. At least in the U.S., the Federal Reserve is run by banks, so it would not do anything that would put banks out of business.Quote from: davis196 on July 20, 2022, 10:13:09 AMWhat's the point of using a stablecoin that is backed by fiat money, when you could use fiat money directly?

Both are bad choices, of course, but it is rather odd for a country to use a currency issued and controlled by a private company. I don't agree with Lowe that a private company is better than the government in setting up a digital currency and that there would be a high cost in doing this. First, the government has so much money than private companies. It could hire the best people; it could also train its own to come up with a great design for its digital currency. Second, the costs of regularly issuing new bills and coins are probably way higher than designing a digital currency. And once a CBDC is issued, maintenance is very low. A CBDC can't be crumpled, folded, creased, and so on. It doesn't deteriorate like bills. It doesn't have a lifespan.",

Of course, they may sell CBDCs as good for businesses, which will no longer have to pay big fees to VISA/MasterCard, instead they will pay a symbolic fee (if any) for the use of the database (CBDCs) coin.
