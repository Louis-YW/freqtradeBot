Have you thought about the option of selling it out of Amazon, you could get a domain and mount a website with WordPress and woocommerce for selling it without having to pay commissions to a 3rd party like amazon, that would be a better way to make some passive income from your book, or you could even create a thread just for selling the book, you should think about it.",

To follow up on seoincorporation's idea, have you thought about maybe letting people pay in Bitcoin? That could be kinda neat and fit with the folks who might read what you wrote and  i mean, it probably lines up.  So maybe think about doing that?Wishing you the absolute best with your new book and sales launch!",

To be honest, it's very important to know Bitcoin history and Bitcoin technology as well. A lot of people don't know much about Bitcoin, and they just consider it an investment asset. Glad to see you spent a lot of time to present Bitcoin history as a book. Best wishes for you, keep it up.",
