  "content": "A few weeks ago, the user SISAR wrote an interesting post on the Croatian local board. He mentioned the integration of Bitcoin with the ICP blockchain. It sounded interesting, so I checked it out a little bit and decided to create this discussion thread where we can talk about what and if this means anything for Bitcoin.I found a YouTube video from September 2021. This is a community talk with one of their researchers/engineers where the integration of Bitcoin and the ICP blockchain was introduced to the public. Here are the most important parts of the clip:The goal is to integrate Bitcoin on top of the ICP by enabling Bitcoin smart contracts to run in canisters on the Internet Computer (IC). The idea is to make Bitcoin transactions possible from BTC canister smart contracts to the Bitcoin blockchain. The canisters will run smart contracts and can be configured to accept Bitcoin. Using the smart contract logic, one canister can move these coins elsewhere if the smart contract conditions are met. This way, the limited smart contract functionalities of Bitcoin supposedly get improved. To make all this work, ICP needs to integrate with the Bitcoin network so that blockchain data gets fed into the Internet Computer and knowledge about UTXOs becomes available to the canisters. Canisters need this data to make transactions that could then be submitted to the Bitcoin network and included in blocks. They call this a direct integration because they don’t use bridges or second layers on top of the blockchain. ICP replica nodes communicate with actual Bitcoin nodes, and they will validate all blocks themselves. To fight concerns regarding centralization, each replica node will connect to one random node from the BTC blockchain. The canisters store real Bitcoins, not wrapped tokens that can be swapped for native BTCs, as is the case on some other platforms. It’s essential to mention that ICP still relies on the throughput of Bitcoin’s blockchain with this approach. The other thing is the way these containers work. IC containers use open-source code, but they are different from Ethereum’s smart contracts. On Ethereum, once a smart contract is live, you can’t change it and modify the code. But on ICP, you should know who the controller of a canister is. It can be a person who is the controller. In that case, changes to the smart contract logic can be made even after a contract has gone live. Theoretically, the code can be changed to move all the coins to an address controlled by this person. There are canisters that aren’t humanly controlled, though, and they are based exclusively on code. In this example, they work similarly to ETH smart contracts and can’t be modified after going live. I don’t know if you can create your own canisters or not, but trusting random people is not a good approach. The private key for the Bitcoin addresses will not be stored anywhere, according to the ICP engineer. Instead, it will be split up into shares. No single share can be used to retrieve/bruteforce the entire private key (supposedly). Each replica node has access to its share of the private key. The shares from several nodes have to be used to sign a transaction. My question here is what happens if one or more malicious node operators have access to the private keys, and what kind of “access” do they even have? Those interested in this proposal's architecture and technical details can fast-forward to 17:15 in the video, which provides more advanced information.   There is also a second video that deals with the Threshold ECDSA Signing. More about the content of that video in this post.In May 2022, a tweet said that the Internet Computer can now sign Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions with keys not known to anyone else. More information about the ECDSA signing is available on GitHub.The last piece of information says that ICP canisters now have access to BTC testnet UTXOs and balances. A Bitcoin integration demo is available on GitHub. I am curious what everybody thinks about this.Sources and more info:1.   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1230285.msg60202950#msg602029502.   https://twitter.com/ICDevs_org/status/15277285253562818563.   https://twitter.com/manudrijvers/status/15316441876318371854.   https://github.com/ninegua/ecdsa_example5.   https://github.com/ielashi/bitcoin-integration-demo6.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxBIvPhPzzc7.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulbKPwv6_s",

It's not meant to push any suggestions, and you are free to make any assumptions you see fit as long as you stay on topic. Quote from: franky1 on June 10, 2022, 10:23:00 AM.. reality is ICP is a smaller network changing its rules to be able to talk to bitcoin.. not the other way round. That's correct.Quote from: franky1 on June 10, 2022, 10:23:00 AMseems the topic creator started by making it sound like ICP is the assumed main network, which bitcoin wanted to join as if ICP is important.. ICP is the main network in the ICP ecosystem. ICP wanted to integrate BTC and ETH, not the other way around. Your assumptions are just that, your assumptions.   Quote from: franky1 on June 10, 2022, 10:23:00 AMalso their buzzwords of \"cannisters\" and the private key split into \"shares\" seems they are trying to not want to just explain that its multisig locked funds on bitcoin. and offering pegged value tokens on a different network I am not sure how it works. Didn't find any mention of multisig in the sources I shared in OP. Whether or not they intentionally don't want to talk about it, I don't know. Feel free to dig deeper and share what you find.Quote from: franky1 on June 10, 2022, 10:23:00 AMhaving an altnet that requires other people to control the signing of transactions is a risk.. refusing to sign or holding funds at hostage unless certain users do something the signers want.. is a risk of trust.. but also having the rules change after the funds are locked.. is another risk. I agree. Canisters where a person is the controller are a two-edged sword. They can make positive changes like correcting vulnerable code in the future, but they can also make malicious and selfish decisions that benefit them personally.  Quote from: franky1 on June 10, 2022, 10:23:00 AMall i see is paragraphs of different ways to mention bitcoin integration. but not much detail on what function and features the altnet actually gives users.. in short.. not a great advert and seems not an important network to care about.. First of all, it's not an advert. It's a discussion about something I found interesting like onboarding Bitcoin in its native form (if that is trues) into a secondary blockchain. I have no idea what functions, features, or benefits (if any) you get by using ICP nor is that the focus of the discussion. This is exclusively to talk about the integration part. BTC on ICP, BTC with ICP, ICP with/together with BTC... use any wording you like.  Quote from: franky1 on June 10, 2022, 10:23:00 AM...but not actually explaining what users features/benefits and utility will be once they have riskily locked up their bitcoin to play around on the altnet.. You have to research what ICP is meant for to get the answer to that question. I didn't. I watched the second video I mentioned in OP that talks about ECDSA signatures. It's another community talk with one of the project’s researchers, who discussed the threshold ECDSA signatures. For the IC canisters to hold and perform BTC transactions, they need the ability to create ECDSA signatures. To do it securely, a secure and distributed signing protocol is required. Similarly to what was mentioned in the first video, they are talking about a private key that will be divided into several parts and distributed among the Bitcoin replica nodes in the 2nd one as well. The replica nodes must agree on the ECDSA signature based on an arbitrary policy enforced by the canister. Individual shares are combined to create the signature when they come to an agreement. The ICSs trust model is such that a 1/3 of the replica nodes could go rogue. However, it should still be possible to resume standard network functionality (apparently). The efficiency of getting a signature from a canister must not be affected even with some nodes being offline or malicious. Even if all replica nodes were to go offline, the network must maintain a way to provide signatures for transactions and recover coins. Replica nodes will periodically be shuffled and change places with nodes from other subnets to prevent or minimize the potential of malicious colluding between node operators.It’s essential to mention that maintaining and holding private keys in canisters will require a certain cost. That’s because they have to be shared among multiple nodes. The shares need to be distributed again in case of canister upgrades, security updates, etc. ICP plans to create a mechanism to recover private keys in case all nodes go down.  A master private key (a small number of shares of it) will be shared across several subnets. This distributed master private key is supposed to solve the loss of signing capabilities in case all the nodes of one canister go offline. The master keys will only be shared with “high-security” subnets. Not all subnets will work with ECDSA signatures. In case of subnet failure, one master private key will never be reconstructed in one single place. The question is, how do they determine which ones are of the highest security and which ones aren’t? Those who want to understand the process better can take a look at the video themselves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulbKPwv6_s",

I am happy that somebody takes the time and see/try to debunk whether this IC is something good indeed or not really.Until now it looks dangerous/exploitable. Possibly a bit overcomplicated too (but it's just a feeling.From what I see: * Ill intended smart contract owner can get too much power if he wants to and nobody can stop him.* We have to trust that the private key doesn't get recomposed by malicious actors* We have to trust that there won't be too many rogue nodes* We have to trust that the distributed master private key doesn't get recomposed/used by bad actorsI won't say yet that it's a bad concept, but I fear that are too many points where something can go wrong (and as usual, I would be happy to see I was wrong and worried for nothing).",

No, I don't think so. A confirmed transaction remains a confirmed transaction. They can't revert anything that happened on Bitcoin's blockchain. I think that an example was given in one of the videos to highlight possible dangers of human-controlled containers. So they talked about lending and borrowing use-cases for Bitcoin. A malicious human-controller could perhaps change the smart contract logic so that withdrawals could only be done to a specific BTC address (one that belongs to them). Since they have both human and non-human controlled containers, and they will make the decision which of them will be allowed to work with Bitcoin based on some security standards, the human-controlled group should never have access in the first place.",

(when you translate their jargon into common words) hardly any talk about what each subnet can do beyond create new subnets(which technically even bitcoin could do. but thats not its main utility factor, which is why its not mentioned as much, where bitcoin actually does mention and promotes its actual use cases)",

I'm not sure how true that is.  I don't know much about ICP, other than it was pumped by Coinbase to be one of the largest cryptos out of nowhere, then crashed and burned everyone who touched it.  I've never heard anyone saying anything about it other than that it was a scam, so I'm a bit surprised to see someone on these forums pushing it like it's some sort of addition to Bitcoin.Should we take ICP seriously?  Does it solve some issue or add value to Bitcoin in a way that I am not understanding?",

Who is doing the pushing in your opinion? Me? This is a forum to discuss anything and everything related to Bitcoin and there is no pushing of anything. Like I told Franky at the beginning, the idea of having Bitcoin in what I though was in its native form (but it isn't) move around on an alternative chain seemed interesting and worth discussing. But after the assessment he made, there doesn't seem to be anything there that has any real value for Bitcoin. Or to sum it up:Quote from: franky1 on June 16, 2022, 06:44:27 PMjust add it to the pile of other schemes and crapcoins over the years and move on",

      "body": "bitcoin for years now has had the ability to put funds into a multisig.where by.. for years now anyone using any coding language can make another network with any rule /function/utility they like whereby they can atleast form a modicum of trust that the bitcoin funds cant move unless the full multisig parties all sign.. whereby on the other network they can all create a message and sign a message to validate the collateral exists within the parties. as a sort of contract/certificate of trusted ownership..  and they can then create their own token on the other network to represent the locked collateral on the bitcoin network confirmed transaction..its not complicated, its not rocket science. its so easy anyone can do it in any coding language or level of ability, or contract/genesis/pre-mine format they please. they can create any network they like that has any function/utility they like. it doesnt require some special language interpreter that needs to translate things, nor anything which requires bitcoin to change to function with the new network..yep people since 2014 could have put funds into a multisig and then created something like a NFT blockchain where the tokens were BTC collateral backed tokens.",
