The answer won't be complete, because the knowledge of mankind isn't complete. But first, doesn't your browser have a spellchecker?When Jesus was being tempted in the wilderness after not eating for 40 days and nights, the Tempter (Satan) came to Him and said, \"If you are the Son of God, command that these stones be made into bread.\" Jesus answered, \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\"What words have come out of the mouth of God? Consider creation... the 6 days that God spoke everything into being. God made the physics of the universe. Nobody - not even scientists - know all the physics that God spoke into the universe. In fact, Jesus is the only man Who knows all the physics of God, because, \"In Him are found all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\" This is the same Jesus Who said, \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\" So, to start with, we need to recognize that all of our health and miracle-doing have to do with \"every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\" In other words, the universe is a unit, one unit, and whatever happens anywhere affects everything everywhere.More directly speaking, speaking to your points, when is it that you are contradicting the things that you ask for, and the healthfullness that you want to have, simply by being ignorant of how things work, but also by wanting things that are against God and the physics of the universe? Ephesians 4:10:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htmHe who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe. So, maybe you don't have the great faith in Jesus that you think you have.This is a simple answer, and really, just a start. There is so much more, that a book could be written. Rather, fill yourself on the book that has been written, the Bible... especially the New Testament. Find out if you really have the faith that you think you have, because, \"Faith comes by hearing, and hearing comes by the word of Christ.\" Really fill yourself, all the time, throughout the day... every day.",

Being a Christian alone cannot put food on your table any one who believes that is only being ignorant, the Bible book of 2 Thessalonians 3:1 will give you more insight about the topic of the Op but saying that Jesus Christ became poor that you might be rich doesn't mean he expects you to fold your arms and expect money to come to your that's crazy.",

You want to be in your house and angels will knock on your door and give you a briefcase filled with dollars or maybe send some Bitcoin to your wallet. If you like have knowledge of the entire Bible, if you are so lazy or uninformed to work hard and smart, you will remain poor. Some religious people are lazy because they believe that God will do everything for them, so they just relax and wait on God. I feel pained when I see people gathering in churches on Monday mornings, clapping, singing, and praying to God to give them riches. Instead of them going out and looking for how to earn a living no matter how small, the prefer to wait on God to provide all their needs. I know many people that don't belong to any religious creed but they are very rich because they practice the principles of wealth.OP you also need to know that Christ never promised that every Christian will be materially or financially based on world standards. If you can provide all your needs, you are rich. We also should note that Jesus promised us wealth but not on earth. Don't forget that he is preparing a place for us in heaven where the streets are made of gold.",

God is not your serf! He is not a Jeene that grants whiches all day long just because you are christian. what do you think. For me it sounds like you DO really KNOW exactly what God wants and what we are supposed to be ore become in his eyes, but if you know so much, there is no need for you to believe anymore. For me a true believer doesnt know anything about god. We just believe. But not such absurd things like you.if you want to know why you are not rhich right know, dont blame god, he gave you the free will, so blame yourself!",

      "body": "For me the problem is that you lump together all types of Christianity and all types of people who are in some way Christian, while some are active believers, while others are by family upbringing but are not very active. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Max Weber showed, or at least tried to show how Protestantism played an essential role in the development of capitalism because for Protestants doing well in business in this life was a sign that they would do well in the next. Meanwhile, Catholics were more concerned with suffering in this life, because God would reward them in the next for all that suffering. This is put in a crude and very summarised way, but it serves to give you an idea. So, you cannot talk about Christians and say that they are all poor because that is a generalisation that has nothing to do with reality. Among Christians there are very different economic situations today, which are not determined by their Christianity, and in any case if they are Protestants, they are more likely to do well economically.",

I have come across people who are supposed to work to earn money but instead they just pray and ask God to give them money. Life does not work This way, even the bible talks about works written in  several parts, God does not give money from above without work. You must work first and he will bless the work of your hands, praying without work is laziness.",

I got you. But let me clear you on some things;1. Being a Christian is not just a status, it's a lifestyle. You can't claim to be living a Christlike life but people around you can't say same.2. Being a Christian doesn't automatically make you a spirit. You are a human and hence you must work to earn a living. Quote Yes in deed as a christian,christ like and christ followers and we are surposed to have every things in as a redemmed child of God,as bible said. You can't just because of your status as a Christian expect things to fall on your lap without working for it, bruh. Even Christ, while on Earth was a carpenter. Even though he had the power to live comfortably, he still chose to earn his living. So? Who then are you emulating if you sit idle and expect manna to fall from heaven?",

A true believer of Christ wants to live like Christ like being meek and not commit all atrocities that politicians commit and embezzle common wealth and store for their families. A Christian wants to meet up with God in heaven and so they always concern themselves with salvation and not greed for money. Like the bible said the love of money is the route of evil. Riches come from God so if it comes to a Christian that will be fine and if it doesn't, fine also is the life of a true Christian.",
