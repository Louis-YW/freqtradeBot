But if you talking about cryptocurrency then that is a different ball game entirely as I will not panic for a passive hacker if am holding Bitcoin because he can't hack the Bitcoin network to steal data as that can only be done using the source code.",

I do not know anything about the hacker you are talking about but the presence of hackers in this market is nothing new, and over the years we have seen several exchanges, casinos, wallets and coins being hacked and despite all of that the market still remains strong.So while we need to always worry about securing our coins properly so we do not lose them to hackers or to scammers, it doesn't seem to make any sense to worry too much about any hacker in particular.",

Quote from: ahmia39 on September 12, 2022, 05:56:19 PMSo what if the hacker moves to the crypto world?So far Bjorka has mainly attacked government data, cryptocurrency is not related to government data, so it is highly unlikely that Bjorka will shift attention to the crypto space shortly. The government of Indonesia are already taking measures to ensure that they clamp down on this hacker and have put this hacker at the center of their focus, They may record success soon before maybe Bjorka decides to switch attention to cryptocurrency.",

If there is a scammer, this is where we must be able to see the movement and accuracy before we invest in the cryptocurrency market,",
