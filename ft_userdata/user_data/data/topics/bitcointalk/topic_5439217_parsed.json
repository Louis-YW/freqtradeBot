For example, they launched the Dubai Metaverse strategy and issued a number of licenses to top international exchanges. In October 2022, 21 Shares launched the first Bitcoin ETP in the Middle East. It is traded on the Nasdaq Dubai international financial exchange under the ABTC ticker.As of January 2023, more than 500 crypto startups have registered in the Dubai Free Economic Zone. This is a very good result!In my opinion, while some countries are focused on tightening controls, Dubai's experimental approach could become a benchmark for other regions.",

This is a very good result!In my opinion, while some countries are focused on tightening controls, Dubai's experimental approach could become a benchmark for other regions.Is there any notable startup/business registered in DMCC? I tried looking into their website but I can't find any names that I recognized. Granted I'm not up to date with new crypto startups nowadays, but considering they have such a large number of registered companies, I thought I'd recognize one or two[1]. According to some news that I read, the majority of those numbers are small businesses, while larger one such as Binance is yet to register here. They probably don't need it anyway since most programs that I see are about kickstarting their business and networking support. Most of their claims of successful members also refer to local businesses.

It is tedious to obtain additional permits if you want to expand the market.Some reports claim the due diligence process to register as a member is quite strict, but there is no comparison to other regions/countries so that's that. From the way I see it, an established business looking to open a branch in Dubai would likely benefit more. That being said, I can see how a new business registers an office there and just hire overseas freelancers to cut cost[2].

This is not something new or surprising in a country like the UAE, which began issuing legislation suitable for crypto more than a year ago, including:- Ruler of Dubai announces a law regulating digital currencies on March 9, 2022: Source- The Binance platform obtained a business license on March 16 of the same year: Source- Crypto.com and Bybit announced the establishment of a regional headquarters in Dubai on March 29, 2022: Source-Finally, the Kraken platform obtains a license to operate in the Abu Dhabi market and enables users to use services in the local currency: SourceThis is in addition to the fact that the collapsed platform, FTX, had also obtained a work permit in Dubai on March 15, 2022: Source",

For me, this is not news and not a problem, if banks do not accept monero, I will change it to bitcoin. In Dubai, there is currently no verification of the source of funds, and many crypto users buy expensive real estate without verification. I think that this will end quickly, and property owners will be asked where they have so much money from and whether they paid taxes.",
