The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has posted LGBTQI+ Youth – Like All Americans, They Deserve Evidence-Based Care, in which Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA, shares how to engage LGBTQI+ youth, the evidence behind the positive effects of gender affirming care, and available resources for LGBTQI+ youth, their families, providers, community organizations, and government agencies.Complete lunacy. All of it. They'll use euphemisms in order to avoid being explicit about the invasiveness of these operations. They'll throw in the usual buzzwords like \"evidence based\" to make it sound as if these operations are not barbaric. It was only recently the far left have been pushing for these things. They've been embolden over the last few years.",

But I support this proposed executive order because this transgender surgery on children is inhuman, barbaric, and the highest form of child abuse. This transgender madness is causing more harm than good. Children should be allowed to grow up and make decisions concerning their identity or sex and not be forced or persuaded to embark on this harmful transgender journey. The population of most European countries is shrinking thanks to the recognition and promotion of transgender identity and rights. As much as it is not acceptable to discriminate against these special persons but using taxpayers' money to fund and promote these acts on children should be highly discouraged.",

God forbid one day the media tears you apart for trying to rid the US government of several corrupt tenured swamp creatures. As for racism, during the Trump presidency we had THE LOWEST BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 17 YEARS https://www.westernjournal.com/black-unemployment-rate-trump-lowest-17-years/ If lowering the unemployment for black people is racist, consider him very very racist.",

The moment you start truing to teach kids though is where red flags start & there should be jail sentences. It’s pedophilia & perverted to try & teach children about this kind of stuff.I don’t know what happened to the world but all this woke stuff is detrimental to humanity, 100% haram.",

If you wish to do such let it be on your own body. When the kid grows up he or she can decide on what to do with his or her own body. I don't support this at all.",
