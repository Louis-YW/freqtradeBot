Avoid many sites, there are many of them that are hyip or scammers that will completely go away with your money as you invest.Know that 1 BTC is equals to 1 BTC, if the coin increases more in value as it is compared to fiat, then your asset worth proportionally increase more in value because it is bitcoin.

So what you seem to propose/dream of is some sort of manipulation of the free market.Well.. bad news: there will always be exchanges that won't obey your \"rules\" and there will always be entities (people, companies) who will want to acquire more bitcoin (whether from exchanges, or from other entities), or there will be people working for it, there will always be entities selling bitcoin (either on exchanges, either directly p2p). There's literally no way to really restrict anybody from buying or selling bitcoin.Sorry, as you see, what you propose is highly unrealistic.PS. You said \"stable coin\". Stable.. compared to what? Other fiat currency? Which would be that and why? Or maybe gold? Or...? (In reality no financial value is really stable..)",

Quote from: NeuroticFish on July 12, 2022, 12:18:23 PMStable.. compared to what?Exactly.Stability is synonym to \"resistance to change\". But, according to what? Bitcoins don't change and neither does their supply. The only thing that does change is the demand. But, if you change the supply according to the demand, so the price remains somewhat stable, then you make it susceptible to censorship. One party needs to be responsible for this job, and history has shown that whoever was, abused it.",

But how can bitcoin become the currency of the world when its value fluctuates. One more thing, it must be admitted that bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as an asset class, a speculative asset class with the expectation of generating great returns. In my opinion, bitcoin is a currency, but it is also an asset, it depends on the needs of the individual.",

      "body": "even if you tagged code into the blockchain to suggest an offer price people may still not agree on that because someone acquiring coin in one country have a different price point than another country. bitcoin does have a very smooth and slow progressive value underlying bitcoin price. but doesnt need this value to be 'tagged' into the code of a block template.the price point of yesterday, today and tomorrow are based on markets of individuals. however market prices are above this value. and they are not stable and wont be stable, due to speculationnot all people of all countries can acquire bitcoin at its value(most efficient cost). different countries different people have different costs above the bottom and so each person then assigns their own preferred price point where they see as reachable.EG kazahkstan see the price vs value as being equal/profitable to sell where as japan whose normal costs are higher see bitcoin as incredibly cheap to buy. for each buyer wanting to buy low and each seller wanting to sell high. there will never be a unanimous agreement.....another option think about would be to 'decouple' bitcoin from the dollar completely and change market measures to being something like 'minimum wage units' where people make bids and asks measures in seconds, minutes, hours. instead of cents and dollars. that way all countries can all equally buy bitcoin at the same rate(same real life labour/time), thus equalling out the imbalance of different countries price points.. EG every country would buy 1 bitcoin for say 1950 hours today. which then gets translated to their local currencies amount of local currency they would have to payEG US $10/hour = US pays $19,500 for 1btcEG INR 22.5/hour - indians pay $595 for 1btcboth of which is equal and fair in their regional areas as its the same labour and time they spend investing.which can then make bitcoin more stable.. while then causing the disruption and volatility on the wallstreet forex instead, by making countries play the forex markets for arbitrage to profit from. but we all know countries would see that as a 'national security' attack on the fiat system. so thats a pipe dream too",
