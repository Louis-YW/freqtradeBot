It's because of genuine interest in the forum and common sense, right? Look at the post history of the user who has been banned (https://ninjastic.space/search?author=Rosemar41). He had zero interest in the forum except spam in order to increase the activity score and farm the account. If even the pop-up containing the rules was there, trust me he would ignore it, just like people ignore reading terms and conditions when signing up for a site.",

Although it wasn't that easy with me, but what mostly assisted me was being around my local board it was then I was able to have the patient to read rules and regulations across the forum. Still I believe there are some people who doesn't have that mind of devoting time that to read and understand things properly.From the post history as said he has no interest in the forum.Anyway thanks for image displayed.. I believe his case is a dead one now.",

A pop-up message would certainly guide them to the right link but in the case of the Rosemar41 account, there was no attempt by the operator at making the account a useful contributor in any capacity. Those one-liners were a clear indicator of what that account was intending to be.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on July 17, 2023, 09:57:31 PMAlready Nuked as expectedI am glad the moderators were very fast and took notice of my request to have the account banned.Quote from: Nwada001 on July 17, 2023, 10:00:08 PMAll the user posts have already been taken down by moderators, and the account has been banned.

And currently the big issue behind is UI and efficient hands on the beginner help. Like, i think all the basic rules for a newbie must be shown at the reply page when they are making a reply or making a topic.There must be a set of rules shown to them so that before writing anything they quickly goes through them and if the rules are provided in a way where the checkpoint are also provided then i don't think any member will be banned due to such mistakes.",
