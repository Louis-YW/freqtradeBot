This time around use a higher transaction fee because I don’t think the mempool will actually get close to 1sats/vbyte anytime soon. We are currently facing ordinal attacks again and no one is sure of when they will go awayQuote from: Findingnemo on September 07, 2023, 07:10:42 PMQuote from: Zaguru12 on September 07, 2023, 07:11:22 PMbumping features so the best thing to do is to double spend it to another address. This time around use a higher transaction fee because OP mentioned Etoro it's an exchange platform so how is it really possible for him to double spend the funds? Yeah just got to look through it now and read some reviews that it’s CEX and has the bad habit of even processing transactions late. Double spending or any form of bumping is actually going to work. OP just needs to remain patient that the transaction gets dropped soon. But how on earth can a fee be set at less than 2sats/vbyte. Definitely one of the worst CEX out there with this kind of stuff here",

'Not your keys, not your cryptos' Ok, I’ll try the CPFP method, it’s being sent to one of my other wallets. I’ve not had to do it before so I’ll have a look into it. Thanks. I’m just confused why the transaction hasn’t just failed and been sent back to the wallet. Could the etoro wallet be continuously broadcasting?",

But it is only possible if the receiving end is a noncustodial wallet, not an exchange address.Etoro is known for delayed withdrawals so all you can do is wait. His transaction has been  broadcasted  but with very low fee of 1,265 sats, thus you are correct, the only way for him is either to wait or use CPFP  if he is in control of receiving address. There is less obvious way to use CPFP to bump fee from the change address ( controlled by eToro staff) , but to do this OP should address support  and I don't think they will fulfill his request.Quote from: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/69c65094fa9139ab15a98fd0929b7fec666c5a8d7abee4d24c2114f01b1b3900",

      "body": "I doubt OP can do CPFP. OP, the transaction has been made 4 weeks ago and with the fee rate of only 1 sat/vbyte. Almost no node has your transaction in their mempool and it's very unlikely that you can broadcast a transaction using the unconfirmed output created on the transaction in question. If you import your address/private key in electrum or any other wallet, I doubt you can see the incoming unconfirmed transaction. The only thing you can do now is to contact Etoro again and ask them to broadcast a new transaction with higher fee rate.Quote from: albert0bsd on September 08, 2023, 01:57:08 AMThis mean that you need to move that balance paying some 40 sat/vB to move both TX.In the unlikely event OP can do CPFP, 40 sat/vbyte wouldn't be enough.The transaction in question has the virtual size of 1250 vbytes and assuming the new transaction will include 1 segwit 1 input and 1 output, its virtual size would be around 110 vbyte. If OP use the fee rate of 40 sat/vbyte for the new transaction, the total fee (the fee paid for two transactions) would be around 5650 satoshi and the combined fee would be only 4 sat/vbyte.OP should use the fee rate of 175 sat/vbyte for the new transaction, so that the combined fee is 15 sat/vbyte.",

Furthermore, please note that there may be further delays in the execution of transfer requests.Note: Requests are not processed on weekends and/or national holidays.This is because all transfers are subject to a manual review.
