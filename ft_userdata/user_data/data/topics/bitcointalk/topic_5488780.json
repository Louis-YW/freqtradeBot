The virus started in a nation that has technically banned Bitcoin mining and restricted other Bitcoin-related activities, so how would they benefit from it? It might make some sense to state that Bitcoin whales took advantage of the COVID situation to promote FUD to enable them to buy cheap Bitcoin. It is normal for people to sell their coins out of fear of the unknown, so your prediction is not strange.",

I maybe believe in that OP about how bitcoin will reach new heights, but the idea that someone intentionally spread COVID just so many people could buy bitcoin at its cheap price makes it hard to believe in it. Even if there's someone who plans to cause COVID, I don't think it is because of bitcoin. Now, OP, even though you are right about the bitcoin part, many will still laugh at you about your statement. Maybe if you have proof that it actually happens, then that's when we will believe in you, but saying you are right or that your theory is right because of the bitcoin price is not enough as proof that your theory is true. Let's be rational here and blame others or come up with a theory without proper proof because you could affect someone, and pandemic is a sensitive discussion. Do you think if other people read your statement, they will still have a positive impression on bitcoin? I think not.",
