  "content": "Questions for quantitative studyHello,At the University I took a course where I have to write a thesis about a subject I am free to choose. Since I was reading the Fiat standard by Saifedean Ammous, I had the idea to pick a subject about fiat.I have to hand out a set of questions to 10 people, and it can be online so I would like to ask these questions here. If you have time I would appreciate if you can answer it. Thanks!What part of your wealth do you hold in fiat? If less than 50%, how would you classify each category of your wealth?How much did your wealth grow thanks to the corona story? (stimulus, Â etc)Does the instability of the price of Bitcoin affect you or the way you think about your investment? Yes/No and why?Do you favor fiat over Bitcoin in the short-term? Same question in the long-term? Why?Do you feel affected by market cycles regarding Bitcoin? If yes, from when did you begin investing in Bitcoin?Are you affected by inflation? What range of services or commodity affects you and from when?Do you feel optimistic or pessimistic for the future? Yes/No and Why?Do you have any investment in gold and if not do you plan to invest in gold or silver?Do you feel your assets are safe when holding fiat? When holding Bitcoin?Thank you for answering the questions above if you have time!",
