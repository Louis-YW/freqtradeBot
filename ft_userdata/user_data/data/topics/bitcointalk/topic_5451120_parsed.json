You should have lost more rather than what you have got from participated in the launch pool. I saw if all of small farmers in the launchpool was facing the lose rather than getting profit. It's caused by the price of BNB has been going down during the launch pool perior. You get very small amounts of money with good amounts of BNB. My friend was losing caused by he participated in launch pool.",

It appears that the sole method of eligibility for the airdrop was by participating in the Sui discord. Who could have anticipated this requirement?Most airdrops require community engagement, nobody will reward just about anyone that does not support the community and leave out those who commit themselves to support the community.Most airdrops use discord as a criteria, the more active you are their discord the higher your chances. Reason why the level process is introduce to reward active and commited community members.",

I was only lucky to get a a slot for their Kucoin exchange allowlist Pool B. But I joined the General sale but failed to secure a slot.
