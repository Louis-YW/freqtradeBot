  "content": "Hi there,I'm quite new to the community here but was nonetheless hoping to get some valuable feedback on a new venture of ours. My brother and I have been working on this project for a couple of months now and its high time we got some input from people. The name of the project is Ampla. I'll do my best now to give you guys the elevator pitch on what we're about:Ampla is an innovative trading solution allowing users to not only buy the newest tech from both established and up-and-coming brands, but also trade what we call “product tokens” to hopefully make some money. Our vision is to bring the same active participation everyday individuals experience in financial markets to product markets. Offering unparalleled product insights, price transparency and generally a more intimate involvement in the development, production, and even selling of your favorite tech devices.Anyway, would love to hear any thoughts and feedback. You can get some more information from our site: https://www.theampla.com",

      "body": "Not necessarily, I know it can be confusing since we refer to the assets as tokens and have tokens on the site ahaha. To tell you the truth we thought taking a traditional centralized trading platform approach would be easier for us- particularly with our backgrounds. But having said that, we are more than open to decentralizing trading, we just have yet to fully understand the benefits for our particular business.",
