Many people will continue to prefer Ethereum and BTC than BUSD because, they have tested it in the past and they believed that BUSD cannot give what BTC and Ethereum will give in a long term investment.",

Or have i missed some news where the founder, that is Charles Cascarilla to my knowledge has said about BUSD? Because last i heard he said we will fight the issue in the court. But i think that this issue could move to the future as at the moment regulators have their hands full when there seems to be ironically real banks falling in US more then crypto exchanges.",

This is a rhetorical response and should not be taken as he not having trust in BUSD. I don't think BUSD is the problem, it is a PASO problem and has other products too that are a big concern for them like PASOGold. This is part of the circle that FUD will continue to flow around and people need to be careful on who to take serious now because I have a feeling that at the end of the day BUSD will be fine, provided USDC and especially if Tether USDT is fine",

BUSD stablecoin was launched in partnership by two companies - Binance and Paxos. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to attribute the founding of BUSD to a single individual.On February 13, the Paxos CEO and Co-Founder of BUSD, Charles Cascarilla, released a statement concerning the future of the cryptocurrency: QuoteBUSD will remain fully supported by Paxos and redeemable to onboarded customers through at least February 2024. New and existing Paxos customers will be able to redeem their funds in US dollars or convert their BUSD tokens to Pax Dollar (USDP), a regulated US dollar-backed stablecoin also issued by Paxos Trust.The complete statement can be found here: https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/",

To be safe, Bitcoin and top altcoins are more ok to deal with right now because there’s a lot of issues going on with the stablecoins, though if BUSD drops most probably Binance itself will also be affected and this might be the start of another panic in the market.",

Busd is a stable coin and I will not be afraid to hold.FUD is more likely. But the tweets seem right, they basically exchange the BUSD for Ethereum or Bitcoin or BNB. But doesn't mean that they will start not to support BUSD anymore. BUSD still got a high market cap right now and a lot of volume too. And even Binance is still supporting Binance and I believe it's still their major stablecoin right now.I agree with you that if you want to be safe, you can just easily convert your BUSD to other stablecoins or much better to Bitcoin then you don't need to worry anymore.",

We need to think how market players are fooling the retailers.  Before the fud attack against stable coins and more transparency is provided by stable coin companies, I smell high risk if we store our money in stable coins. Not all of them are bad or will die but we don't know what stable coins are good and healthy as well as what stable coins are unhealthy and have risk to be collapsed.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is your best choice.Ethereum is good as it is a strongest altcoin but after a switch to Proof of Stake and becomes a more centralized network, I am really hesitating to pick ETH.BNB is likely my third choice but as said they are centralized too and Binance is a most favorite aim of fud and regulation attacks.Bitcoin is best and safest coin.",

But with the series of depegging that has happened with other stablecoins, it's good to be aware of anything possible to happen. In my perspective, if you're keeping your fund mostly in BUSD and you've got a reason for that then you just have to make sure that you can get out of the kitchen ASAP when you feel the heat is starting to burn the entire area. If you get what I mean, that has something to do being diligent in every situation that's happening in the crypto market and not just only with this concern against Binance/Paxos/BUSD.",

The future might be at risk with Stablecoins but I believe they can survive on this, this is just a temporary set-back, we will see a stronger stablecoins in the future but then again, have a better plan with your investments and maximize using those stablecoins.",
