  "content": "Hi,For the last months I have been a sports valuebetter. For those of you that don't know how valuebetting works I would like you to read this article: https://sportssmartbetting.com/how-much-can-you-make-from-value-betting/ written by Sam from Sportssmartbetting. In Summary, valuebetting is one of the few available ways of winning the \"game\" against bookies. Taking advantage of slow updated/overpriced Odds from bookies to bet with value. The true odds of an event/sport is often the one from PinnacleSports. When Pinnacle changes odds for the betting events, other websites take time to also reflect those changes. That's where valuebetting comes in. Let's suppose you are betting on a match of tennis betwenn Alcaraz and Djokovic. Alcaraz has 2.1 Odds to Win and Djokovic 1.8 Odds to Win. Pinnacle has new information on the market and lowers the odds of Djokovic from 1.8 to 1.6. In bet365 probably Djokovic 1.8 Odds will stay the same for a few more minutes. If we bet there at 1.8 we have an edge over the market because we are taking a better price and returns.I have been earning my share of money but want to capitalize my earnings also from sharing my valuebetting picks and a way of automating them. Meaning that you don't need to be in front of the computer to follow my picks/bets. This is the service i'm presenting here in this thread:https://smartbet.io/pagepicks/picks?source=FireAtlantis%3ETMFootballEV - i have started very recently to automatize my betting picks with Smarbet.io on bet365 (only football bets) and I expect the ROI to be between 7% and 9% for all bets. Right now is at 19% but we only have a sample of 84bets.Update as of 29/09/2023:https://ibb.co/sjfDM0YAs an example, if you had bet 10$ in each bet from my automation tool you would have staked 840$ (10$ * 84 Bets) and would have own from them exactly 163.88$.So how does automation works:- The user can define which stake he wants to use (size of stake, if its flat or relative to amount in the betting account, how much drop % of odds is he willing to accept, if he wants to bet only 1 bet per event or if he accepts multiple bets per event.- The bet365 account credentials have to be shared into the software in order for automation to occur.- The software automates betting in just a few seconds getting ahead of human betting each means that we will get better odds. So as soon as my bets/picks are sent to the software every BOT that follows my bets/picks will get the bets on their behalf.Actually is quite easy to define the settings and starting.Now, of course this automation costs money:- Smartbet.io charges 2% of stake (minimum of 9 cents) per bet placed. - I charge 0.5% of stake (no minimum) per bet placed.- Lets take the example from the above results for you to see how much you spent in automation vs how much you have earned from my service:    - 10$ stake * 0,02% =  20 cents     - 10$ stake * 0.005% = 5 cents    - For each placed bet you would spend 25 cents. 84 bets placed * 25 cents = 21$    - 163.88$ - 21 $ = 142.88$ (amount won with costs already deducted. - This is a very good result from only 48hours of betting.Please take into consideration that valuebetting is profitable. We might have losses for the first 10 or 100 bets, because variance happens, but in the long run it's highly profitable. The more bets are placed the better the outcome in the end. We are playing a game where we have an advantage over the bookie so taking that advantage means betting the most out of it to reduce variance as soon as possible. Please continue following my valuebetting journey and if you have any doubts i can help you.Other things I can help:- If you would like to have bets for different sports (Basketball, Handball, Tennis, Ice Hockey, Baseball) i can also automatize it and have it available for you to try.- I'm working together with a developer and can automatize betting for your source of picks for a few bookies (Pinaccle, Bet365, WilliamHill, Ladbrokes, Unibet, Bwin). So let's imagine you have a source of picks of yourself (picks that you choose to place in these bookies, or picks that you get from valuebetting software, I can automate betting for those picks in any of these bookies. I work together with my developer to build a script that scrapes those softwares and automatically places bets in your bookies.I will be available to answer any questions about this service, help set an account and try the automation tool.Also i will offer a 100% discount on my 0.05% commission for a few bets for anyone to try the automation tool without even having to pay for my commission.  I will be updating this thread everyday with the results of the Automation Service - https://smartbet.io/pagepicks/picks?source=FireAtlantis%3ETMFootballEVThanks again.
