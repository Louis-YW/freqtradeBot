So you could just buy a very good VPN service that offers Turkish IP address so that when you relocate to the US, you keep using the VPN service.You could cash out using p2p exchanges like bisq or the c2c marketplace available in Binance.Alternatively, you can try using \"decentralized\" derivatives exchangelikeLike dydx (they still block US IP addresses, again you will have to used VPN. The advantage is, no KYC for now), Apollox DEX, Helix, Read all the terms and conditions first plus DYOR",

So, guys what is your advice about it?Futures trading is prohibited for everyone in the United States. But if you want to do future trading there, you can definitely do future trading using VPN system. Then you can deposit money into your account using p2p system. Then you can use p2p system for withdraw. But everything should be used with your privacy. And in case of problem you can contact Binance support team.",

So, guys what is your advice about it?I think you need to make a new account at binance US and simply login your turkish account on Binance Global app will not work.Also, regarding the withdrawal, you need to create a bank account too in the US and then you may withdraw at the US bank. Or better optin may be to use the P2P and withdrawal to the cash app.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on December 18, 2022, 11:37:37 PMFutures trading is banned for anyone in the US jurisdiction. I heard that Kraken still alllows it for some users in the US. I don't know how they are able to allow future or margin trading when it is banned in the US",

I don't know how they are able to allow future or margin trading when it is banned in the US  According from kraken's support article, futures trading is restricted in the USA with no exceptions, see: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023786632-Kraken-Futures-eligibilityI say no exceptions as there is no asterisk beside USA to denote if there is any unlike other countries like UK.Margin trading however is okay but only if you meet their criteria, see: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061972272-Margin-trading-and-Eligible-Contract-Participant-ECP-self-certification-for-U-S-clientsSo perhaps what you heard is about margin trading?",
