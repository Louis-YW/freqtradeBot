  "content": "These days, the keyword zk is hot again thanks to CZ, everyone who hits zk will fly )) By the way, the market sucks a little, I have a chance to find out about this.It's a bit late in the trend, but Vitalik also said that zkRollup will dominate the L2 game, so the game is still long.In this post, I just share the good things I found out, if I'm wrong, please comment. Basic will include:Distinguishing the secondary ratio named zkWhy Vitalik follows the bulls zkRollupWhat is ZK (OR ZKP), ZKEVM, ZKROLLUP?At first, I thought this new one was 1, but after seeing it for a while, I saw it differently. Style: zk and the rest =)).Evaluations of the definition are:zk (Zero Knowledge) is a cryptographic technology that only proves something without having to show what it is. For example: I can prove that I am over 18 years old without showing my ID card (maybe going to a bar for example).EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) - Ethereum virtual machine. When the blockchain is built to be EVM-compatible, it means that it is compatible with Ethereum. Developers can copy project code on Ethereum across the blockchain without much editing.Rollup: A technology used to develop L2.→ zkp: Zero Knowledge Proof Technology.→ zkEVM: Blockchain compatible with Ethereum using Zero Knowledge technology.→ zkRollup: L2 Rollup mechanism combines ZKP.Therefore, if you see the word \"zk\", it is not sure that it is L2, it could still be L1 like Mina Protocol.WHY VITALIK THOUGHT ZKROLLUP AND L2 WINNERS?This one has to ask the question \"How many L2 guys are there\", because there must be at least 2 L2 guys together to create a war.The most popular today, there are certainly only 2 forms, zkRollup and Optimistic Rollup. This is also the L2 fight that Vitalik just wants to pursue.Accordingly, the first reason for scoring zkRollup is because users do not need to wait 7 days for the transaction to be confirmed.But why is there a 7 day number? Because that's the amount of time it takes the Optimistic Rollup to validate a transaction.The second is because zkRollup helps users not need to show proof and still prove the transaction. Going back to the original example, you need to show your ID to prove you are over 18 years old, but then what if a bad guy steals information?However, Vitalik also thinks that because it is easier to build the project, the Optimistic Rollup will win in the short term. But that was before zkEVM was born.Now zkEVM has made it easier for developers to deploy projects without learning a new language.But in zkEVM alone, there are dozens of other types, such as:Fully compatible with EthereumCompatible with EVMAlmost like compatible with EVMCompatible with high-level programming languages",
