Not sure which I installed but one is available here: https://geth.ethereum.org/You might not need a node to interact with ethereum though, I think you can do a lot of things from a wallet.",

This is sort of what I was thinking as I was reading this.  Are you sure you need a full node?  What are you doing that makes you think that you need a full node?  My understanding is that running an ETH full node requires a ton of space and is a total pain in the ass.  The beauty of smart chains though is that you can interact with the chain without needing a node.  Maybe you misunderstood your friend and he was talking about uploading a smart contract to the chain as opposed to downloading the chain?  I think more information from you would likely lead to the advice of just using smart contracts on the chain and avoiding a node.",
