I started with 125x on the exchange I first used to trade crypto futures and I lost money massively. I even changed it to 50x, later 20x, later 10x. All I still noticed was that the leverage used was too much. The best is to go 1x, or 2x if you are more certain about the market to go in your direction. But according to your explanation, it is like you are supply crude oil in real life to people, which is trading though but not the trading like spot, margin, option or futures which we are discussing about on this board.

Is to never think of trading as a means of making money. This will help him to be patient and to trade rightly if he reads other ways to succeed in trading. Trading is good, but it becomes like gambling because people just think they can start trading today and earn the same day.",

If they by anyway can gain profit in this market but are too greedy and don't cash out to retrieve their initial capital, later they will have some serious lost trades which eat all profit they earned and part of their initial capital too.You can start with $1000 and take a long time with many successful trades to make it to $5000. However, from $5000, if you have two lost trades with 50% for each, you wil have your total capital drops to $2500 and $1250, mostly drops back to where you started.For people who are greedy, they usually will use leverages which will cause forced liquidations and loss would be bigger than 50%.",

Greediness awoke due to the emotional mindset of a trader who is doing trading or business without a proper target to achieve. As if you guys have set a certain target to achieve as you mentioned to stop your partners to stop the trade and book capital but their emotions were being played by the market as well as emotional sentiments to get more money. While if they have a proper mindset and idea of the risk they can face, maybe you guys could save yourself. Overall, the market as well as incidents are unpredictable, so we can not blame ourselves when our fortune is not in our favor. Like you guys could make profits if you were not chased by hoodlums. But we all got an instinct as call us to not do more greedy but still, we ignore it and move on and face the consequences.",

There are too many people who end up trading the wrong thing and that is why they end up losing money as well, I would prefer not to do something like that and instead make a profit by investing smartly, if I buy bitcoin then there is a very little chance that I would ever lose money, I would wait even if it is low and when it finally goes back up, even after a year, I will sell when I am in profit.But when you are trading, you do not have that much time so you need to use stop loss and never go down too much, if you get out quickly when things go south, that means you can recover later since it would be a small loss that can be gained back quickly.",

Greed is not measurable, even in our small profits, we turned out to be selfish with the sole desire to wait for it smashed our top TP without noticing a breakout or retest in the market charts. Discipline is required, setting a daily target of either closing the market for the day with $100 profits but at the end of the day, a trader might have liquidated his account all because of greed.

All of the strategies and edges have probabilities and you will choose only few that is fit to your habits, character and personalities. Guys beware to the fake traders out there who keep posting their wins in trading and keep saying that they do not incur any losses. Those traders are probably a scam who are focusing to get money from their victims. If you want to trade and have a mindset that you can avoid losses here in trading, then you have a wrong mindset because losses are unavoidable due to its nature which is there is no certainty. But how we can earn money in trading if there is no guarantee? It is where the strategies and patterns comes up, the charts are usually generating similar patterns that have been existed in the past wherein you can base your decision on it. All you need to do is how much money you will risk in a particular trade, it is about the money that you can afford to lose. After that you must execute your plans confidently. If your bias did not happen, you must not experience any negative emotion because if you do, it only means that you did not fully accept the risk.",

The only problem is that you don't lose. Avoid buying coins that has been pumped and only trade legitimate projects and not those that'll scam you or dump their tokens on you when you buy the coins. When trading, avoid greed and don't start trading when you haven't learnt the basic of trading. Just like your friends, many traders fail to remove their initial capital before reinvesting into the market. It doesn't matter how good you're, you'll fail some trade so always take profits.",

Just like in trading, It is not everybody that removes their capital and trade with profi. The larger the capital the larger the profits that you can get with little trading leverage. But when you trade with only profits, you would not have the volume that will give you enough profit. That is the same thing that applies to your petroleum business you did with your friends. With h the capital you will agree that you would get larger amount of petroleum and make more profits. It is unfortunate that the environment you are is not secured or could it be that the kind of business that you are doing in with your friends is not legitimate. For good traders, is it is not advisable for them to withdraw their profits everytime. Accumulation is the key and it will give rise to a more larger profit with little effort.",

You should be rich by now since history has proven that whoever owns the crude oil owns the nation man. Coming to the valid points here: 1) Yes you should start using your profits to re-invest in the next cycle. 2) The capital should be stopped right after decent profits and I am talking about the net profits, not the gross ones. If you follow this compounding method then no one can stop you from making more profits. Even if you lose, you will lose the profits but you are not in loss ideally considering you had your capital withdrawn already.",
