      "body": "Price lowered.  I'd point out that these are sold out on their site, so this is the fastest way to get your hands on one of these silent 'built for home use' miners.  If you're looking to dump your Bitcoin in this latest crash and want to start mining, this is a great opportunity to do so.  Also willing to listen to offers if you think this price is too high, but I'm definitely not interested in selling for a discount below the retail price, given that these miners sell out every batch so there is clearly demand.  Shoot me a message if you're interested and we can try to work out a deal.  Good luck!",

      "body": "Price dropped again...  With these being sold out so fast on the website there's clearly demand for them.  The cheapest one is selling on eBay currently for $900...  I'd rather deal in straight crypto but there's a lot of room in there for profit if someone wanted to take a risk and try to resell this for dollars on eBay or wherever people are selling things online these days.  I have multiple of them, which is why I'm selling one.  There's nothing wrong with it or anything.  Let me know if anyone has any questions.BTC to the moon!",
