  "content": "Death will surely be felt by all beings. All living things will die, people who love each other will part. And when we grow old, we will definitely remember all the experiences of our youth, both sweet and bitter. When you remember it, you will feel a different feeling, a feeling that sometimes you really want to replay that moment. Regarding death, no one knows for sure when it will come. Everyone has their own destiny line.And before the time of death comes, we must fight for the life we ​​live. We experience sweet and bitter. We must have felt tears accompanied by laughter. So, I just want to tell for me and for you guys. That is, do not despair and give up. No matter how dark your suffering in the past is, it will definitely lead to a bright future. As long as we fight and don't give up. It is impossible for our lives to continue to be dark, there will definitely be light.so cheer up everyone!!",

I know many people who passed away at a young age. It is sad to think of things that they could not do and did not live in the moments with no regrets.",

      "body": "I don’t like to think about death & negative things like that. Obviously we all die eventually, it’s guaranteed but best to be positive & put your mind at ease. My advice is to surround yourself with positive people & do things you enjoy. Don’t waste your life because you only get one.Try not to have any regrets, be a good person & do right by your family. Try & leave a good impression on people whilst you are alive on this world.",
