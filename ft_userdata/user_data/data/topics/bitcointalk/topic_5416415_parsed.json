  "content": "Ray Dalio, an American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of the world's largest hedge fund. And he says it happened before.So today I want to talk about how the world works and how do we deal with it according to Ray Dalio.Watch full video here üëâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8&t=13sSo, how does the world work? For every powerful nation there is a big cycle - the rise and fall.It all goes like this: 1. Peace, prosperity and productivity. 2. Financial bubble and big wealth gap. 3. Financial bust and economic downturn. 4. Printing money and credit. 5. Revolutions and wars. 6. Debt and political restructuring. 7. New world order. ¬†üîÅAnd repeat.We are part of the changing world order ‚Äì we see the early decline of American \"empire\" as well as the rise of the Chinese. For previous empires the transition of power happened in 10-20 years.There are few principles that can help us navigate through these times successfully: üîπPrinciple 1. When central banks print a lot of money, buy stocks, gold, and commodities. Their value will rise while value of paper money will fall.üîπPrinciple 2. To understand what is coming at you, you need to understand what happened before you. Ever wondered how did the \"roaring\" twenties bubble turn into 1930s depression? üîπPrinciple 3. A Nation's Greatest war is with Itself. Over whether or not it can make the hard decisions needed to sustain success. üîπPrinciple 4. We need to earn more than we spend. üîπPrinciple 5. Treat each other well. ¬†These two are self-explanatory.Never before we've seen the falling elites clinging to power and money. ¬†But from the looks of things now ‚Äì that's the kind of events that are about to happen. ¬†We don't know the level of their madness and we don't know what lengths they are willing to go to. The possibilities are endless.",

      "body": "Economic downturn is a consequence of economic prosperity and not necessarily a means to an end.The British empire was still the British empire after some major stagnations (like 1850). Most empires are no more and international markets correlate to each other more than ever. The US will probably give way to more than one country if it starts to decline (China probably won't see much growth and is seeing its own economic downturn even before rejecting western vaccines).",

So its possible that this time is not about \"transition of power in 10-20 years\" but rather several generations (fe. 100 years) of poverty after centuries of prosperity for whole word.",

      "body": "It's important that these sort of narratives that try to explain the world in a handful of stages or something like this are not scientific because it's just choosing the events that fit into the picture while ignoring other events. While there are periods of prosperity of global economy and times when it faces big difficulties, political events and things like 'political restructuring', 'new world order' are quite abstract, less measurable and a matter of debate. Politics doesn't perfectly align with economics, and by highlighting different events people can create different narratives.Also Principle 3 about nation's greatest war being with itself - well tell that to countries which are being torn by wars waged upon them by a foreign enemy. Ukraine's greatest war is now with Russia, not internal and not about policies related to economic prosperity at all. As for Principle 4 - it's super easy to say 'earn more than you spend' when you're a billionaire, and it's way harder said than done for the majority of people.",

In other words when economy falls apart, the stock market falls apart too. It is stupid to invest in stocks at times like this.As for commodities, it is not possible to physically buy them. For example you can't buy natural gas that is going up in value and store it!The only thing left is gold which could be a good option.",

I hope yunno that everyone's not gonna dance to your tune?!It is good to study history and it's very ideal or rather, seemingly logical to assume them to the present or the future but it's also good understand some terms properly just so you can diversify and extract whatever meaning out of a word's ambiguity.Lemme make you understand that bitcoin LEANS on FIAT and survives a step from its evolution and also faces the retardation innit too. Remember, the bulls had money already, a long time ago, until Bitcoin was evolved. Alot of peeps hodling coins have made trnxs, the type that their country's currency was converted. Have you ever asked yourself what happens when Dollar falls ? The impact it's creates on every marketing strategy? That's because Bitcoin isn't a Perfect currency. I see it as a store if value for the time being.The ill-logic behind how an economy of a county makes progression on a gross or net rate is still unknown to me or you.However, Fiat won't be easily toppled; if it is , then it'll take a longer time .Sandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

Ray Dalio looked at the pattern in the past and how it could possibly happen again and it seems like we are there. It would be very devastating if US prefers war before its decline. It's best to just accept and develop the Isolated continent of America to establish the multipolar world order and NOT the new world order.",

In a world where only one person rules the nation, if that person is a good person, then he could improve the nation, but not on an individual level, you would live a horrible life, but the nation will be strong, look at China, they caused a lot of worker deaths and harsh conditions and cheap manufacturing, but that did allow them to gain a ton of USA debt, but regular person didn't profit from it.In comparison look at USA, they are crumbling, their finances are terrible, they have so much debt, high inflation, but everyone would prefer to be an American with a job then a Chinese person with a job, that‚Äôs the difference.",

The US is simply out of the way of global conflicts, wherever a ww3 will erupt it will for sure not be in North America, unless somehow Canada decided to invade, which would be probably the surprise of the millennium.And this brings up the need for defense and the loss of possible revenue, the British had to protect colonies all over the world, the Romans had to protect cities thousands of km from the capital, and France, Germany, Russia, and Turkey all had troubles at the border and risked formerly annexed territories to run amok, in the US, where is this danger? Well, nowhere!Quote from: Crazy_Bitcoin on October 08, 2022, 03:13:14 PMWe are part of the changing world order ‚Äì we see the early decline of American \"empire\" as well as the rise of the Chinese.Yeah yeah, my grandfather was promised that in newspapers, and my father was told so on the radio, I'm reading this all day on the internet and I have a feeling even in induced telepathic orgies my grandson will hear the same.",
