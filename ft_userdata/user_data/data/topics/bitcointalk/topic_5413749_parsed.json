  "content": "Meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is now officially the second largest proof-of-work (PoW) crypto in terms of market cap, following the Ethereum network's proof-of-stake upgrade on Sept. 15. Bitcoin (BTC) of course remains miles ahead of Dogecoin’s market cap of $7.83 billion, though the well-followed memecoin is still comfortably ahead of the third place PoW cryptocurrency Ethereum Classic (ETC) (with a market cap of $4.69 billion), Litecoin (LTC)  ($4.01 billion) and Monero (XMR) ($2.65 billion).One Dogecoin fan appeared to be in disbelief of Dogecoin’s rise to become the second largest PoW cryptocurrency, stating “who would have thought that this would happen. Congrats #Dogefam.”(Source: Cointelegraph)",

I doubt that further speculation is required on making this kind of info type thread. Doge will never beat Bitcoin on top because Ethereum didn’t manage that task for many years of being number 2. I think the main question here is if Doge will pursue PoS too.",

In general i think that the time of Proof-of-Work coin is coming to an end slowly but surely. Bitcoin will of course be an exception from that because i highly doubt, that they will also move to proof of stake in the future because bitcoin mining is just way to big of a business i think with mining farms in China having invested millions and millions of dollars into mining gear.New projects though will probably not choose proof of work anymore as their consensus mechanism as it is just not fitting in todays mentality where the protection of the environment and the climate change are such big topics in the media.",

It was also a \"way to big of a business\". Next GPU minable coin after ETH is now ETC with only 2% of marketcap. Means that 95% of gpu computing power will not find alternative and will have to dump hardware on gamers witch will most likely not absorb it.",

PoW or not, it is a bad coin to invest into and it shouldn't really be in the top ten to start off with.Yeah Dogecoin will never get close to its 2021 high of 77 cents or whatever it was. Dogecoin got popular because Musk was stupidly promoting it a ton and happened to be doing that during a bull market when a ton of people come into the market not having a clue what they are doing. Now Dogecoin is a known thing and Musk has much less ability to pump it and people are far less likely to blindly buy into it since the big Musk pump already happened in the past. Now that 2021 Musk pump is over Doge will continue to fall toward zero against Bitcoin, just like essentially every other crypto does.",

If Dogcoin can became second largest POW cryptocurrency show that any moment from now it will have more population like Bitcoin, because Bitcoin team are still working harder to make bitcoin remain the king among other cryptocurrencies.",
