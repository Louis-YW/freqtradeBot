Why casinos not ask of proof of income before deposit, but asking when withdrawing. I do not always like casinos for easy registration and deposit and a hard way of withdrawing.",

Casino doesn’t care if you are playing with all your money from your salary because they are business and not a financial manager that guides there customer about there spending. Requiring proof of income to customers just for withdrawal will never justify what it will be used for. KYC is already getting to much conflict on many customers so what’s more for this extra requirement for withdrawal.Casino asking for this kind of documents is surely just want to have reason for players to not withdraw the amount. Typically casino that has low bankroll to let go withdrawal. This will not gonna pass no ,atter what the reason casino will justify for applying this rules.",

What they just want to see is that you've got a proof of income. I guess you've made this topic because you've seen also another thread wherein the OP has been asked for proof of income by another known casino. If a gambler sends all of his salary to the casino, I can think of many factors. 1. It could be his other income and there's still got enough money for his needs.2. He's single and living with his parents that doesn't need to think much about priorities.3. He's got a lot of savings so whether he wins or not with that amount he deposits, he's still going to live well enough.",

What's next? The casino asking you to prove that you are healthy and that you don't have any \"forbidden diseases\"? The only type of private businesses, that can ask you to prove your income are commercial banks(when you apply for a consumer loan or mortgage).Any other business asking you for your salary or income is doing something sketchy.Stating that such \"proof of income\" requirement has something to do with a \"responsible gambling\" policy seems like total BS to me.",

It's different when you deposited $500 but you managed to win huge money on that site, they might ask your KYC and other things. But that's also happened on few sites, most of popular sites won't even ask you anything even you won huge amount from their site",

I would never accept such a requirement because , as someone already said, what I do in my life os no casino business; I can understand they may adduce anti money laundering reasons and stuff like that but if those were the real reasons they should ask before accepting my money as deposits and and not only at the moment I ask for a withdrawal.",

There will be no other reason this question is asked than being curious, some people knows how gambling sites can easily seize customers money during withdrawal. I think that is the reason for the question. I do not think gambling sites can be that not professional to request for statement of account or proof of income than not been to only make sure the person is earning the money or not.",

It would be different if in the terms of service of that specific casino would state that they will reserve the right to suspend accounts of people who are spending recklessly on gambling (which would be unlikely to happen) again, they would need to keep in consideration the personal situation of the user and I doubt any service would go so far to analyze users.",
