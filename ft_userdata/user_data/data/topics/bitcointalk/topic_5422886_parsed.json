After Bitcoin, for me, it is the best.I also really expect that the price of Litecoin can really reach this. But in fact, seeing how the progress of Litecoin in the last bullish era, this seems like LTC is left behind the new coins. Well, I am still holding LTC since 2020, because I really expect that the price of LTC would be exactly skyrocket in the bullish at that time. But the times proved that it couldn't be. I am now still holding the Litcoin. Hopefully as what you also expect that Litecoin will be skyrocket much higher again in the next bullish era.",

And as long as it will be treated as a small brother to Bitcoin or sort of a genie pig, a test platform, then it will be in the market.Good for you if you are still holding Litecoin. It had a good run in the last bull run, although it didn't get the love from the altcoin market and people forget that Litecoin is good for long term hold. Yeah, $500k in the future is doable, it might take year though before we achieved that price.",

LTC was once a potential coin but now it is no longer strong enough to compete with today's new altcoins. What I like most about LTC is that it has low transaction fees and is also very fast, but to find a coin with similar features we also have a lot of choices.$500 target is not a very high target but I have my doubts about LTC because looking at the price history from hitting an ATH of $360 in 2017 last year, it has surpassed the old ATH but only at level 380 dollars, the difference is not too much so the target of $ 500, I find it not very feasible.",

Although it came across with various issues before, the fact that it is still acknowledge by investors as a good coin to invest, simply proves that it really is. If ever there will be future developments with litecoin, I think it would be a better investment and a coin to be used in daily transactions.

This doesn't mean that it will be exactly like this, but it seems to me that Litecoin is a half-dead. I don't believe in the future of this project and that it will gain wide popularity and use, which will allow LTC to rise in price significantly. I know that the litecoin network has a lot of users, that there are more \"points\" accepting LTC as payment, but the premonition that this is \"an exhausted horse, slowly losing its strength and position\" doesn't leave me.",

Basically, someone who could destroy the whole project if they leave, or die, which is exactly the opposite of what Satoshi did, he ended up going away to make sure that bitcoin grew without him.That is why I believe that we shouldn't be really investing into anything that has anything centralized. On the other hand, litecoin doesn't have it, sure charlie lee is there but he is nobody, he is just a good investor, just like vitalik, they are not the owners and they can leave and nothing happens, which was proven in litecoins case many times.",
