I am not newbie, and I have been using Trust Wallet for more than four years, even with more significant amounts without any problem, a topic that confused me:I installed the trust wallet app in the Samsung Secure folder with only V2ray VPN and no other app (the Samsung Secure folder is a sandbox environment with an additional security layer guaranteed by Samsung Knox); also, Kaspersky and Avast were enabled on my device! I don't understand how I got hacked!! I am sure that no one had my key phrases! I didn't connect my wallet to anything, any airdrop, any NFT ...The strange point is that the hacker or thief still hasn't cashed out after three months. Even if he/she does, I can't do anything, but it's strange to me why he/she doesn't.Sadly, All the wealth I had built up over the years is gone, and I don't know what to do.",

We have seen a lot of fabricated stories here on this forum shared by users who want to seek sympathy from community members.  But let's give you the benefit of the doubt. Even if you are sure that you did not expose your phrase to anyone, how sure are you that since you have been using the phone to browse through the internet, you might not have clicked on a phishing link that might have installed malware on your phone?  And secondly, where did you store the backup of that wallet you are talking about? Was it also inside the phone, or did you store the wallet backup somewhere else? Because you can't tell me that you will have a holding of $43k without thinking of backing the wallet up.  Another thing too: can you share with us the wallet that was hacked and the balance emptied? At least have a have a wallet that holds such an amount that was moved out recently, and if that's done, will you also be able to sign in a message if you are asked to in the wallet?",

As you already know, there is nothing that anyone here can do to help you.Based on Op, post and above reply I guessed he posted this because the hacker has not moved the funds which is quite surprising him to him.Though I'm still wondering like Xal0lex why he chooses not to share the address or is requesting to show it to moderators only",

But one thing is very important that why you kept your hard earned bitcoins in a wallet, why you didn't keep them in a hardware wallet. Also why do you choose to have all your bitcoins in one wallet why don't you store your bitcoins in multiple wallets? Lastly, in case you have been hacked, no one can assure you that your hacked bitcoins can be recovered.  If the hacker wants to give you back you can give back but if he doesn't then your bitcoins will be lost forever.",

I think he meant BTC worth $43,00043,000 BTC is now worth , No way someone can keep such an amount in a closed source software wallet especially given that he has been doing crypto for a while.Also, I don't think Bingx and most exchanges can let you withdraw 43,000 BTC at once. Max daily limit at Bingx is $5M for an account with advanced verification.OP, I have a feeling your seed phrase somehow leaked somewhere. The other loophole was using trust wallet, which is not an open source wallet. I think they even had a bug that was exploited sometime back involving their app.Trust Wallet to reimburse users after $170,000 security incident",

I've read all you had to say in the subsequent replies but you have always dodged the proof, so how do we believe you even if we want to?However, for educational and preventive purposes, giving your child the phone you have the crypto wallet is not a matter, but if you are not the only one having access to the child while he/she holds the phone unlocked, then it is an issue. You might not know when someone will be monitoring you due to what they see in it, and if the person is experienced with cryptocurrency, such might find a way to search you better and eventually locate the seed phrase in your drawer, trust nobody about it.At times too, it may not be an internal job, your phone could be hacked. This is why it is dangerous to download games and many others that could be dangerous on our phones, especially phones with financial assets. What if malicious files are attached? Malware may be included depending on the source of the download.",
