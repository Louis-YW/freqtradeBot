The main question is did they do anything besides list it and give a basic description?As far as I have seen, Coinbase lists a lot of things and just gives a basic description that is basically a copy of the whitepaper and then tags on the DYOR warnings.Everyone with at least 1 functioning brain-cell could see it was a scam from miles away. But then again so could people who looked at Nikola a couple of years ago and Medallion Financial since 2018 and so on. But greed will make people stupid(er).-Dave",

      "body": "They have zero chances of getting anything and they know itQuoteAlthough Coinbase’s website stated that TerraUSD is not “backed by US dollars in a bank account,” it failed to explain that TerraUSD is not backed byany fiat currency or other tangible asset. This omission is and was material to Plaintiffs and Class Members, and it was misleading because it implied thatTerraUSD had benefits and qualities which it did not actually haveThey are clinging to definitions on the front webpage and ignoring everything in the terms and conditions and the legal page, unfortunately for them, it has the same chance as suing Heineken not making you instantly party on a yacht-like in the advertising.",

AKA 1000msat for 1 sat backed means there is the Y of X .. where X is stored somewhere and kept safe EG 1sat locked for each 1000msat so be warned if altnets and sidechains and situations which offer a pegged or alternate token for something else that may be backed or not, might change their rulestake grey scale shares. each day they deplete in their peg between how many shares you get for your coin you use to buy the shares. and after you bought them your shares deplete each day which they call their 'fee'",

Telling watchers to buy the flower (shitcoin) of the week because it will be worth millions asap lol.I don't remember any recent examples, at least not in the US, but remember onecoin for example. Some promoters have been sued. In the old time, the same was valid with Herbalife or TelexFree or not long ago with bitconnect or trafficmoonson. I didn't read the news about it but it appears Elon is sued, so it's possible to prosecute a person. Take the example of market manipulation, I don't think you need to be licensed to be sued in justice. See with Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather about EthereumMax",

If this legal proceeding ends up in favor of the law firm that filed the lawsuit, this might snowball into a bigger problem which involves a lot, if not all, crypto exchanges around the world. This might become a precedent for future cases against crypto exchanges not just for listing stablecoins which claim to have enough reserve but also for listing thousands of other coins that are even more questionable than TerraUSD.  But whatever happened to caveat emptor? Surely, Coinbase is not offering outright scams to its customers with the assurance that they are all legit. I don't think they lack disclaimers and warnings of risks. Definitely, the standard of admission for coins is not so high. If it were so, Coinbase wouldn't have admitted almost all of them. But responsibility isn't exclusive to Coinbase.",
