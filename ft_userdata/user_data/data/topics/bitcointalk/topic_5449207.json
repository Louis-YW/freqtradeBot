Reselling script maybe it will bring less profit, but it also requires less investment in promotion.We are fighting here against such scam producers but unfortunately, I have seen similar scripts being sold on some very reputable platforms like Codecanon.",

      "body": "He is not only a scammer but an hacker as well. Those innocent people who pay him for the script will lose their money, their account details, and credit card details. I don't know how could people do such things without any shame, everyone should be careful from such scammers. I think he's probably selling this script on many forums and social media groups, and there will be many innocent people who will pay this guy by falling in the trap. They will lose money, their account details, their credit cards details as well as their personal files.Such people have no morals and they can misuse those details to defame others. I suggest everyone to be careful from this user, also from others calming such things. It's impossible to generate 100 Bitcoin with such fake scripts. How could a script generate $3 million worth of coins a day? Anyone with commonsense knows that such kind of claims are not but scams to trap innocent people.",
