I would suggest you find all account sellers, to associate maybe in some kind of union and legally seek justice for you. if all account sellers rebelled here, with all their accounts from stock, I believe that it could not go unnoticed and they would surely get the justice they deserved.

He's obviously already tagged as an account seller, so why make up this story?You have a point there, and the case now seems more complicated and impossible to say who is telling the truth. Where can we draw the line in this kind of case? I think members should not go that far in trying to expose an account seller because it may taint their reputation, for example you try to buy an account to expose the account seller, and while the investigation is still ongoing, the account seller reports you here as an account buyer, it will be difficult to prove your innocence, especially when you are not a member that is known to be trusted in the forum.",

However, I'm a bit surprised that you care about all this since selling accounts seems to be your main business.",

Whatever his reasons were, hZti exposed this guy as an account seller and exposed his alt accounts, which is why this guy is now pissed and wants revenge. If he had posted first, the situation would probably be in his favor.AccountsLegend, I know you're pissed at hZti for exposing you, but he won't be tagged for it.

(account sales)But, if you contacted a couple of trusted forum members with a reason why you think MJ was not doing things securely, and told them what / how you were doing what you were going to do I would not have an issue with it. Just my opinion here so.....It is also a matter of 'level' you and I have both been here a while have decent trust and feedback. BUT I have not been scambusting or going after account sellers or anything like that. And, as far as I can see neither have you. So we would have to come up with a much more detailed reason of doing what we would be doing then someone who has dug into people doing 'bad' things. I would let some members who have found some real issues with what others are doing slide a bit more on proof then us who have not. Everyone obviously has their own level of comfort. -Dave",

Unfortunately that doesn't happen and is 1 reason an account could demand a decent price. This thread made me think a lot about starting a thread to discuss the risk/benefits, pros/cons of account sales, but their are so many points to make, refute, and concur with that it will require a large amount of effort to start with so many subtopics to touch on.. Besides the obvious economical benefits in sheer GDP and untapped value of this forum, interest in this forum it would generate, increasing the actual use of cryptocurrency in our community, thriving lending environment, etc., I believe a good case could be made that account sales do a lot to lessen petty theft/scams and misbehavior that dont have much deterrent without account value..  It used to be pretty easy to determine that an account could be trusted a certain amount due to the sheer fact that only an imbecile would scam for an amount less than their account is worth and therefore destroy that value.. No collateral loans for maybe 50% of account value, account collateral loans for maybe 80% of account value with signed message proving ownership and the right to liquidate said account (look how long lenders don't even tag for defaulted loans anymore because they will loose all hope of recovering, even keep it secret in hope), you could go fist in trade with other accounts up to a certain amount of the accounts value and generally trust the deal, etc, etc.. Quote from: examplens on July 31, 2022, 09:14:05 AMOP, why did you wait so long to tag him?2 years to tag a defaulted loan in waiting for ALL hope to be lost..

That also means that accounts with negative feedback probably can't be sold, or they can be sold to shady gambling websites like 1xbit and adkinsomething, and than used for promotion.Trust reset would be interesting to have in theory but it's impossible to work properly in real life, and you can't track what everyone is doing with their accounts.I guess we could add a rule that all trust is put on hold if account is inactive for longer amounts of time, and after that reset can be activate.",
