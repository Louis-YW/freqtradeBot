  "content": "It hit me some days ago, that bitcoin is honest1btc = 1btcBitcoin transactions have no hidden chargesThere can never be more than 21 million bitcoins.. and many moreThere are a lot of people who are not honest with bitcoin. They come in sitting on the fence. They have the shitcoin mentality to take profits and disappear. That is why most of them \"weak hands\" were the first to be shaken off during this persistent bear market. Be honest with bitcoin. If you are investing for the long term, invest and hodl. Please, do not listen to the rumor mongers. If your intention is to be a futures trader stay true to it. Do not be neither here nor there.The summary is that bitcoin is never going to lie to you, so you should lie to yourself about your intentions with it because if you do, you will end up getting hurt.Mr Tiger",

I mean, this is a new technology, which almost everyone when they come into Bitcoin doesn't fully understand, minus a few exceptions. The vast majority will learn more about Bitcoin as they go on, and therefore their opinion of it will change. When I got into Bitcoin first of all, I didn't think it was going to change my life. I was just looking for an alternative, and it bare no more weight than that. Now, I'm probably what you'd consider a long term holder or at the very least someone who will likely be using Bitcoin for as long as it exists, just so I don't have to use banks, and let them dictate to you what you can purchase with your money or the chance of them going bankrupt in the future, and you only getting back what the government will guarantee, which varies on country. So, I don't think you need to be absolutely sure why you're into Bitcoin right now. If it serves a purpose now, it doesn't mean it forever will, and visa versa.",

So if people start taking advantage of its volatile nature for profit making either short or long term, that doesn't mean they are unhonest people. Because everybodys reasons to owning Bitcoin is to make a decent profit over time, of which others make theirs daily or weekly through the help of \"Dollar Cost Averaging\", so if you can't make yours that way, you probably just hodl and stop seeing others as unhonest.",

I've noticed (and I'm sure some others have too) that mostly some new members have a similar attitude towards Bitcoin because, like the OP, at one point comparing Bitcoin with fiat currencies and the banking system, they realize how much honesty they can find in Bitcoin.As @Welsh wrote, this perception can change over time, because Bitcoin is something new and fascinating to everyone at one point in time. For some, that time lasts longer, for others shorter, which does not mean that I look at Bitcoin much differently today than when I first became seriously interested in it.",

Bitcoin's attachment to its USD price is not to be discounted. While 1BTC is always equal to 1BTC, it is never the same when 1BTC=$50,000 and then when on to 1BTC=$16,000. So it's not dishonest if somebody who HODLed finally sell his Bitcoin at $60,000 and bought it back at $20,000. There's no dishonesty there. The same is true when a trader shifts to HODLing when trading is already becoming both unprofitable and stressful. About rumors and news and anything that affects Bitcoin's price, it is often advised to buy the rumor, sell the news. Even with FUDs and fake news, big decisions could be made without necessarily believing in them. There's no dishonesty here as well.",
