  "content": "It's been four months since I started accepting Bitcoin payments in my furniture company, and I am delighted by all the help and suggestions I got from this forum when I started. God has also helped me, and my business has been very successful. Since I started accepting Bitcoin payment, I have made new friends and new customers as well, and this means of payment gives me the joy of emulating and utilizing the best technology of this generation, which is Bitcoin through blockchain transactions.Â Through this means of payment, I have had about 18 friends who really took an interest in having me teach them and show them things about Bitcoin investment, but out of that number, 6 are business owners who also developed an interest in accepting Bitcoin payment, though they are yet to kick off. I am not usually free to do the lecture class, but I still devote time to teach them the things I know while also referring them to this forum because I know the forum will not allow its members to make a mistake so long as they ask questions.I say a great thanks to the forum and member, from whom I have taken their idea and added to mine, which is the reason why this thread is going live today. I say thanks toLuciusYOSHIEglendallDie_emptykamvretostompixgoldkingcoinerJayJuanGee and I cannot list out all of you whose suggestions were really helpful, and all those thoughts and pieces of advice always got me referring myself back to my old thread and taking a few pieces of advice. It is not worthless to be here at all.I am not too good with Microsoft Excel, but I just try my best to get my bar chart arranged; please don't criticize me for it. I made a total of $6,867+ of sales in January, including my local currency, Bitcoin, and USDT, which accounted for only 33.8% of Bitcoin payment received. For February, I did make a total of $4,676, of which 20.7% was only payment accepted in Bitcoin. In the month of March, I did not see much payment coming in bitcoin; I made a total sale of $5,644, of which the bitcoin payment received was just about 10% of the total sale, I received more of local currency payment. It seems my customers had the urge to hold due to price Surg. In these three months, I would not say I have really saved a lot of profit in bitcoin, just like I said I would keep my profits in bitcoin and only convert my costs to fiat, but I have been able to hold the amount of bitcoin I have not held since I started bitcoin investment, and I am still appreciative of what I hold, and luckily for me, I have had about a total of 54 customers that paid with bitcoin and USDT, of which only one female paid me with bitcoin and the rest were males.I will appreciate some more suggestions and help, because I don't believe I could have done these without all your help.Also, for my friends who want to accept Bitcoin payments, is it wise to advise them to go ahead with it?I have been maintaining a 10% discount for those who pay with Bitcoin; is it okay if I stop the discount now?thank all, Dr.Strange ðŸ‘º",

I guess they see how your business is doing after accepting bitcoin and they want to make the change too. Itâ€™s a good idea for them to start as long as they know the risk involved talking about price volatility. I think youâ€™re in the best place to know if you should remove the discount or now. We canâ€™t give an accurate evaluation without knowing how the business runs.",

This definitely has a lot to do about the community where your business is situated, a business area where there are more less knowledgeable people when it comes to internet or rather a community where there is hardly internet connection will definitely have find it hard to get customers that will pay in bitcoin. The kind of business been run also determines this, a customer that is likely paying 10$ for goods or services will prefer to use the fiat payment method. A countryâ€™s treatment of bitcoin would also have great influence on the number customers.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on April 03, 2023, 12:59:25 PMAlso, for my friends who want to accept Bitcoin payments, is it wise to advise them to go ahead with it?I have been maintaining a 10% discount for those who pay with Bitcoin; is it okay if I stop the discount now?You could advice them since many people in your community are bitcoiners and are ready to pay with bitcoin but they shouldnâ€™t keep everything in bitcoin. Rather have some (major part to be specific) in local currency to able to hold in peace. I think once you are satisfied with the number of customers you have gotten through your business scheme then it is proper to return maybe gradually to the market price to avoid running into loss just for the sake of accepting bitcoin as replacement. You can start by reducing the discount to 7%, then 4% and the back to the normal price",

QuoteI have been maintaining a 10% discount for those who pay with Bitcoin; is it okay if I stop the discount now?as far as I've seen, you still don't have a stable percentage of bitcoin payments, it could even be said that you have a downward trend. 33% > 20.7% > 10%. if the price structure of the product allows such a discount, I would keep it. a long period is certainly needed to determine the profitability of this type of discount.I believe that it is also important how much bitcoin payment has brought new customers or if it is just the old ones who use the discount.",

I hope to see more updates with even better stats in the future. And by the way, Op I don't believe you're the type who would make the mistake of leaving your fund in an exchange most especially now that your business is doing great, the image in your op shows that your bitcoin is currently in Binance exchange make sure you move it as soon as possible to your non-custodial wallet to avoid story that touches the heart. Or perhaps you want to convert the funds to fiat, whichever it is make sure it does not remain in binance.",

I.e, Are they satisfied with what you impacted on them to be able to carry out such action?If they said \"Yes\" Then they may go ahead accepting bitcoin as means of payment. But however, they have to understand about the price fluctuation maybe if they would adopt to your method of savings and operations.QuoteI have been maintaining a 10% discount for those who pay with Bitcoin; is it okay if I stop the discount now?Usually bonus or discounting always have some sets of time frame to function, if you feels the time frame given to them have elapsed then you don't have to bother yourself about the discount anymore.So is your personal choice to set a limit for instance, giving from today till June this year then discount stop, then by December you may open a December discount to run from 15 of December to 15 of January 2024 December hot deal. With this strategies you would always have your customers patronizing you due to your kindness and love towards them.",

I want to also advise that you should carry out a business review to ensure that the 10% discount is not affecting the business negatively. Don't forget that all the gain you have currently is not your net profit. At end of the business year, you would have to pay your office and showroom rent, government rates other expenses. It is great you have gotten a good number of customers that are paying with Bitcoin. Just ensure you offer quality products and services your business will keep growing. You don't advise people to start using Bitcoin in their businesses because your location might be different and government policies also differ. Business owners should engage in a comprehensive study of their business environment to know if it Bitcoin payment option will be good.",

I would not push anyone into something by force, even if I was good at something, but I would help them if they really want to do it.As for the discount, I would personally keep it if you can afford it, because that's how you actually attract customers to pay with Bitcoin - although you can reduce it to 5% for one month or try to see what would happen if you completely remove it.",

It's fantastic that you made such large profit sales and were paid in bitcoin from January to March. Although I am not in the selling or buying business, I did learn something useful from the way you save with bitcoin by converting the costs to fiat and leaving the profit in bitcoin. This method eliminates the risk of the business collapsing because the capital will not be affected by volatility as it would if it were stored in bitcoin. And there is the possibility of increased savings if the profit stored in bitcoin is held for a long time.QuoteI will appreciate some more suggestions and help, because I don't believe I could have done these without all your help.Also, for my friends who want to accept Bitcoin payments, is it wise to advise them to go ahead with it?I have been maintaining a 10% discount for those who pay with Bitcoin; is it okay if I stop the discount now?thank all, Dr.Strange ðŸ‘ºPerhaps the lower prices you offer to customers who pay with bitcoin are what drew more customers to you.
