Also bitcoin has some characteristics that the banking system and fiat do not have. They are alternatives to one another but bitcoin is far better and worth holding as an investment.",

But obviously not everyone would want to do that, there will surely be more people who are totally comfortable with the present order of things and do not want a change. Then even for the people who want to control their finances through BTC, they must still have a certain percent of it in fiat for spending and other necessary payments.",

      "body": "Quote from: #Greatest on January 23, 2024, 02:58:44 PMWhat do you think?I understand your point, you are looking at it from the perspective of the much fascinating evolution of currencies from the Barter form of exchange to the transformation of the currencies over the centuries.The very known first form of money was through the trade by barter system where people engaged in the direct exchange of goods and services. During this period, the people value worths of goods to be exchanged by their desired goods or services. But because there was inefficiency and limitations in this form of exchange or transaction, people of the ancient time thought of the need to migrate to the commodity money. In this kind of transaction, exchanges where done with items that had value in the eyes of the people of then, such items included precious stones, cattles, etc and these commodities which also included salts were widely known, valued and accepted in markets. From these commodity money, there was the introduction of the metal coins which were the currencies we all experienced at a point in time and are still experiencing today in some parts of the world. Governments also adopted and started minting these currencies for the market and individual use. At a point in time, the government then introduced the paper money to ease trading since most of these metal coins where heavy and there was a monumental thought that the metals could also be transformed to just paper monies where you have the value of the money printed on currencies. These improvements also led to the invention of banknotes and the banking system itself which is yet one of the most valuable industries in the world now.Now, with the advancement in the emerging internet, information technology and the fintech, these notes have been digitalized which brought about the advent of the cryptocurrencies through the invention of the Bitcoin currency by Satoshi Nakomoto as another digital currency that have its own value based on the decentralized blockchain technology. These cryptocurrencies operate independently and are only valued or devalued by its users making in it possible for more transparent and universal transactions.Having journey through the abovementioned evolution of currencies, I think it is only normal for a curious mind to ask if it will replace the current paper money and banknotes. The most sincere and straightforward answer to give to such question is that the future of Bitcoin is still very much unpredictable and it will not be a decision that will be taken by people alone but governments of different nations, and with the current realities, that won't be possible any moment from now.",

Bitcoin cannot handle the volume that that traditional banking system handles in 1 hour.

What do you think?Bitcoin can't erase the traditional banking system because Bitcoin has nothing to do with it. What is a traditional banking system? Banks give loans, receive repayments and also accept deposits to give away money again with interest. How can Bitcoin replace that? Do you think that loans in such a volatile currency is a good idea? Or do you think that banks will lose their control and influence? Bitcoin can't handle large volume of transactions and how do you think that it will handle massive volume that banks have? Bitcoin was not created to erase the traditional banking system, it was created to offer you P2P payment method but it wasn't meant for widespread acceptance too. Read Bitcoin Whitepaper, understand how Bitcoin works and you'll understand that Bitcoin doesn't have the potential to challenge the aspects of traditional banking system. It's a different thing.",

But then, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide alternative options and challenge certain aspects of the traditional banking system .. What do you think?Bitcoin isn't going to erase or replace traditional banking system. As far as I can see, banks are actually introducing Bitcoin and crypto assets to their offerered services to customers, so they are bringing crypto to the traditional banking system in a centralized way. It means you won't have total control over your assets, like you would in a decentralized system. You buy Bitcoin, but who controls it are the banksters. You can't even send your BTCs to another wallets and addresses, as they only allow you to sell it for fiat and then use the fiat as you wish.Mortgages, loans and financial services can be offered through Bitcoin currency, but not by autonomous individuals inside a decentralized system. Rather, such BTC services will still be offered by banks. The system adapts itself to the current conditions to remain untouchable and ruling the masses. The idea we, independent citizens, are going to be \"free\" someday in this world from financial institutions and centralized parties is just an illusion.",

Satoshi had the craziest idea to create this huge project if he with such vision didn’t see it totally overthrowing the bank system then there is a pick there that it can’t. In as much as bitcoin has many advantages that many of us have adores it is will want it to be the main currency for exchanges there are demerits of it that isn’t taking it to that level of total replacement of the traditional currency. A clear example of this; is the ongoing crisis surrounding the congestion on its network making transactions slower except if you wish to pay the erroneous fees to get it confirmed in the next available block. Also bitcoin might look a bit confusing for old age and less educated people and also works in areas where they are only internet network. All this wouldn’t allow it take the center position someone like me will want but honestly I like it been an alternative and a better one like this to ease my problems that the traditional system couldn’t solve, like easy cross boarder transactions and a very good store of value",
