Coin has a potential retracement2. Good for future purpose3. Gives a good profit 4. Hold for a long term and etc.Always make a plan not just execute it every time a position or investment.",

      "body": "By the way, nice poem. But don't get too emotional about it. There are numerous opportunities to purchase Bitcoin that we are overlooking. For example, a few days ago, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $15K, but many people expected it to drop even further and thus failed to accumulate. As a result, it was a good time to buy. We miss the chance such opportunities and later regret it. Furthermore, the current price is sufficient to accumulate. When deciding whether or not to buy, think deeply rather than becoming emotional. If you want to make quick money, don't buy when the market is suddenly pumped.",

But for bitcoin investors, keep buying as much as you can. Do not pressure yourself to buy more than you can afford to buy. The bear market is still long. We have almost 14months to be in the bear market, so buy according to your pocket and do not complain.This is the time to know true believers. But my regards go to those people that bought at $50k and above. I know the language of buy more will be sounding strange to you.

Well truly as you said there's no time for any analysis, seeing the current market price at around 16k it's a perfect opportunity to buy ,not just buying are you willing and strong enough to hodl for a long term investment to have a reasonable profit? In the past years when I just heard about bitcoin I thought it was just a platform where you can just make millions from a short time interval and that was due to the wrong view I was exposed to about bitcoin by my friends. But the forum has helped me alot to understand that bitcoin doesn't work like that  . after understanding the whole concept around bitcoin investment I started having a regretful feeling and I was like if I can go back to those early years of bitcoin when the price was still suitable to buy  and hodl up my btc in a long term investment and have an amazing profits. And truly my prayers have been answered currently the market has given me another opportunity to buy and hodl cause am certain that I will be smiling in the near future when the market pumps up.So mates this is the year to invest more and hodl your coin. don't  get a regretful feelings when btc will be experiencing another bull run. For me am still buying",

People need to peruse this poem with deep meaning so that they will not interpret it in a wrong way that will seems easy just to keep buying even when the market is not certain or going down.

For long-term investments, dong DCA is much better to do, buying every time the price drops and crashes, because we will not know if the price will continue dropping again or not. That is why although we don't do exact analysis, we must still have good management of our funds, so we may not bee too greedy to buy the Bitcoin all at one time. Quote from: Zilon on November 26, 2022, 07:54:48 AMKeep buying as you buyKeep buying as long as we still have free funds to buy, not using daily funds or savings fro buying Bitcoin. Buying wisely and smartly to avoid every regret in the crypto investment. ALways think for long term investment or holding if you don't wnat to do such analysis on the market.",

Even at that, you stil get to buy coin anyway should there be funds enough for a purchase.In essence, analysis is a total necessity. Its better to be wrong and learn than to be careless on the importance of analysis and be ignorant. You can base your trades on luck, on a notion of accepting whatever comes at you. Yeah, you might not he able to be in full control but you could be in some control and only analysis could help you through that. Analysis is just how trading aren't gambling.",

I wonder where all those institutional investors are who bought bitcoin at much higher prices. Where are they now? I think in order to be such an adherent and idealist of bitcoin, a person still needs understanding and faith. Just from post to post, the statement that there will be growth someday and that you should deprive yourself of everything but buy bitcoin will not always work.Those who do invest evaluate all the risks and invest the money that does not affect today's life.
