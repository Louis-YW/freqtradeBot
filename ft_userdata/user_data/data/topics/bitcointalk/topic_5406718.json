  "content": "Welcome To newcasinos.io ???Firstly, I just want to confirm if this is the correct place to be posting the advertisement for the new website I am working on?Now that that's out the way, I hope I don't get verbally whipped for sharing this! Newcasinos.io is a very fresh online casino directory.Our overall goal is to provide our viewers with the information they can actually use to become better online gamblers.Today there are a plethora of online casinos and an even greater number of websites that review them.So how does newcasinos.io aim to separate itself from its competitors?Well, we wish to involve our viewers in the process of creating the content we will eventually publish.I'm still new to Bitcoin Talk and don't know if this is frowned upon, but if you could please take a quick look at our website and simply let us know what information you feel needs to be included. Here is the link:https://newcasinos.io",

The question is, how is the rating generated? I don't see the login page on your site which means (which I understand) the rating is not generated from user reviews.",

I believe that you will have more people interested in your serviceHere: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=56.0Also, always look at what you post and how it looks. for example, the link to your site is not well placed at all. clicking on it does not lead to your page.all reviews deal with \"successful\" casinos and possible bonuses, and awards... have you thought about making some sort of casino blacklist? Will it be possible to find such information on your website?",

From there hardly I knew about one casino and the rest were completely new to me.So I want to know how do you estimate the trending factor and list the casinos in your site.Also as there are no user reviews, so it’s seems me to like paid advertisements.The site is just useless if it can’t provide honest reviews. Waiting for your answers OP.",

You have used 3 colour format for the background (white, light ash and dark ash). And you used the dark ash background in every details page except the review pages of the casino. The dark ash background doesn't looking good as you have written the details in black colour. Moreover, some titles are getting mixed when I'm accessing the website from my phone.But there is no issues like that on desktop. About the reviews you made, currently you have made the review of 10-12 casinos. Where most of those casinos are unknown to the forum members, except one or two. I don't see the popular casinos review there. However, your directory is looking good as you have given a lot of details in every page.",
