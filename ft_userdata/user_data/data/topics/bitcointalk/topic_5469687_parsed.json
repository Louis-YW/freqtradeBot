  "content": "According to the reports of Elliptic, QuoteThe value of illicit crypto laundered through cross-chain crime has reached a record $7 billion, new figures published today by Elliptic can reveal. Cross-chain crime refers to the swapping of cryptoassets between different tokens or blockchains – often in rapid succession and with no legitimate business purpose – to obfuscate their criminal origin. Known also as “chain-” or “asset-hopping”, cross-chain crime is on course to become the dominant means of laundering cryptoassets.Of course, there is still the traditional way of hiding everything through mixers, but now they are using sophisticated methods as well and now they are called cross-chain crime. And North Korea's Lazarus group alone, have laundered over $900 million using this method to hid their trail.https://www.elliptic.co/blog/record-7-billion-in-crypto-laundered-through-cross-chain-servicesAnd theft is the predominant activities that this criminals do, and then followed by scammers/ponzi schemes.Just crazy numbers though and it's going to be very difficult to catch them at hand as there are new methods to hide or obfuscated their origin.",

Such statistics cannot be trusted because it is very difficult to track all the methods that criminals follow. They are always developing new methods of concealment.Of course, the value of stolen coins can be known and tracked, but this is impossible if they are laundered on bridges and decentralized exchanges, as the report states:QuoteDEXs: decentralized services – often running on smart contracts – that allow cross-asset swaps on the same blockchain.Cross-chain bridges: services that are typically decentralized that allow cross-chain swaps across assets on different blockchain platforms.Coin swap services: centralized and typically anonymous services that allow exchanges between different assets without the need to create an account or submit identity verification. This means that the stolen coins will enter one of these decentral services and then another clean coin will exit on a different network. These stolen coins will enter the new network as clean coins. How can we distinguish between them in this case?",

And most of these services are perfectly monitored by security companies, which will then transfer the data to Interpol. Tornado Cash is closed, although many criminal coins passed through it.

Although sooner or later the authorities are going to caught up with them.In this case, not only they used used mixer, and as we all know, authorities might be watching every crypto mixer right now and see if criminals are using it to launder their money. So the have to devise a new plan how to outsmart them by using cross-chain method and hopping. @stompix - maybe @zazad is referring to this one? https://tornado.cashBut I do agree that tornado cash contract is immutable.",

Since I read this study, I feel that this is the purpose of it, since centralized exchanges have become almost completely under the control of the government, so they will now go to accuse these decentralized services to form the appropriate legal ground to enact legislation against them.Of course, there are some decentralized services that are already used to launder money, but not all of them. Additionally, if they enact laws to ban these services, criminals will find other ways to continue their work. Criminals are constantly evolving their methods before and after Crypto.",

Initially it was mixer, then authorities goes and shut down some of them.

Yeah, it might be true that the government are stepping up and putting a lot of pressures on this criminals. But it seems that they are always one step of the game, but like the dark web, or the silk road, it took years for the US government to really shut it down for good. And so it proliferated, drugs, guns, anything illegal is there, you can buy it anonymously.And then they go after bitcoin tumbler and mixer, it's no secret, CM was top on the list, established in 2017 and it takes them another 6 years to bring them down as well. But then many grows like mushroom and for sure it might be years before we will here another mixer shutting down. But they are not going to wait for it, criminals are taking advantage of cross-chain and hide again.",

It does not mean that nobody is using mixers for crime, but it does indicate that the number of people who are trying to launder money with a mixer is much less than the bridges and exchanges that people are trying to use for that purpose.That is because these services support multiple cryptos which your average criminal can find simple to comprehend how to bounce money back and forward. While a mixer usually supports only one type of cryptocurrency, usually Bitcoin.",
