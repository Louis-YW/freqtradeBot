So, there is not about just a good utility and Tokenomics, you have to ask too many questions, make researches to improve the chance of successful investment.",

      "body": "Project Tokenomic is one of the most important aspect that an investor need to pay close attention to when making an investment decisions on what project token to invest on and this should be done at the first stage of the process, that is why most financial adviser are always suggesting that an investor do their own research (DYOR). Because what make the different between token A vs B is in the token supply distribution, and utilization on a good eco system that will aid to token activities to flourish and gain good tracking in it data that will result in a positive market outcome. But one of the other factors that affect a project's performance is getting listed on the wrong exchange, bad exchange for a good token will result in project destruction even if the token already has a good use case and is a utility token with a large community of supporters. This may not entirely be the fault of the team, but the team is still responsible for choosing the exchange that token should be listed on, I have seen some tokens, which perform well on a good exchange but once their get exposed to the wrong market the token gets drained up",

If you are not careful you will lose money.But if you are a risk taker and you are really well in that field, like doing research and good at identifying quality projects, then it's all good, trust your knowledge. Overall, be safe, because it's already proven by time, a lot of altcoins already come and go since day 1, after Bitcoin created.",

Indeed true.Initially, I was eager to invest in APTOS coin, but after seeing their tokenomics I changed my mind.The issue is. 82% of the supply is staked. And nearly 94k new coins are coming in the market on the daily bases.I think it would was good if locked tokens were not given any staking rewards.Quote from: Outhue on December 18, 2022, 09:50:21 AMNo matter how tempted you are to invest in a project always learn its tokenomics first.

That's how they move and the saddest part, the investors are mostly affected left with the tokens that they've created with no value.",
