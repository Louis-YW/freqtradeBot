It can, we know this and we have seen this, which is why we shouldn't be really worried about the current situation.Maybe the OP just treat these little declines on the price as a sign for something much worse later on. It is said that alts follow the command of BTC and if we looked at BTC right now, it is recovering again. By this said, altcoins should also recover. I am the exact opposite of what the OP is thinking right now.Plus, there is also no major negative news that is being reported in cryptos which can trigger a dump in their prices, not like last year where we have lots of it and then there is also a bear market. What we have right now are only a recovery and a small bull run in preparation for the bigger one. This is why were unlikely going to experience a blood bath not even for altcoins.",

But just like you, I don't know what's the reason why there was a sudden push a while ago.While after this push, I am now expecting that we might see some bloods again on the weekend.",

This is basically a proof that the market could always recover at all times very quickly and we should be quite happy and alright with whatever we have. I am not saying it is an easy thing nor a hard thing for it to recover but it is certainly a sudden thing. You may think it took over a year for it to start going up, but the reality is that it took just one afternoon for it to start going up. So that means anything could happen suddenly and we should not be too pessimistic about the past.",

Which basically answers this question, but of course the month is not over yet, we have 10 more days to go and that means anything could happen, we may end up with a big drop and if that happens then it will be a blood bath.But for now, it looks like a green day for everyone and the prices are higher. Of course not all of them are higher like the others, some like polygon are higher than what bnb did, but there are reasons for that of course.

I think market will tilt a lot in next hours but generally if we are not sure what will a next movement of market, it is very safely to exit position and wait for market movement and confirmation of its next trend before opening new positions.Safety first. Safely protect our capital is most important. Market is always here and we can join it many times in future.",
