Inflation is an integral part of the economy. When it goes beyond control, that's when the worry starts. Otherwise inflation is very normal. If inflation becomes zero, that's a sign of recession! So there's no way the price of commodity will ever come down to previous level ever. Some certain commodity may go down for some specific government policies, but it is impossible for the whole market to come down to previous level.",

In most cases, any news that affects the price of a commodity, for better or for worse, can have a major impact on the price of the commodity. The impact of monetary policy on these price trends varies. On the one hand, rising interest rates fueling inflation may also hurt commodity prices. In my opinion, it takes time for the commodity to return to its price if you look at the current situation.The best way to protect yourself from these price swings is to create an emergency fund that you can rely on when the going gets tough. An emergency fund won't prevent you from buying food the day before payday, but it should be able to help you for some time.",

A lot of supermarkets have products they make a loss on to remain competitive with other supermarkets in the UK (especially things like milk and bread). I think the same thing will start to happen again later as cheaper products are found the replace what's currently around or people replace things that went up in price with other things.A lot of the current pricing that went up is likely to be due to oil prices rising too which is something I'd expect to drop after a year or two.Also depending on your country, your wages will probably rise (emerging economies) or inflation will probably drop or go negative (developed economies).",

I'm wondering if it's possible that the price of commodities will return to its previous years. If so, how or what will cause it to happen. It is definitely possible for commodities to return to previous year prices. Think of it this way. There are regions of africa where the average monthly wage is around $700 per month. People there can afford to pay their bills and feed themselves, comfortably. At a fraction of the cost of living expenses abroad. If food can affordably be produced in developing nations, for a fraction of the price that americans and europeans pay for it in their home countries. Then there must be some wiggle room for food production being made more efficient. Due to food production costs being so much higher than the barebones baseline of developing nations.Those in rural areas, might transition to fishing and hunting to reduce food costs. Rising cost of food is a supply issue which can be solved by boosting production. If everyone in the world started planting some type of food crop today. That could go a long way towards improving food sustainability for the future.",

Yes it will continue to rise and no one can stop that, it's just that crisis are making things so fast and we are force to deal with such expensive necessities. We have to be more wise now on handling our finances, spend only on what's important and don't over spend. Commodities might go back to normal price but expect for the price to rise again eventually, imagine the old price of burger are now different and that is inflation.",

Oil is like the indicator of the entire economy and whenever it goes up, everything is affected but it's also affected by some other commodities. Inflation is inevitable and we have to bear with it and think of things of dealing with it like more sources of income, living more with a frugal life and have a budgeting that you'll set and follow for you to have a tighter pocket and spending habits.",

      "body": "The answer is actually a bit more complicated than it might seem because the core of inflation is bifurcated with respect to supply and demand.The war in Ukraine resulted in an artificial shortage of energy and subsequent supply that caused prices to go up because demand either remained stagnant or increased. Commodities predictably went up in price which caused the inflation rate in most European countries to increase given the increased price of goods. Presumably when the war ends, prices go down as supply increases and demand maintains itself to 2021 levels (pre-war).However, the above analysis is predicated on demand remaining stagnant which you cannot assume. The COVID-19 related spending spree saw a demand increase because the money supply was injected with nothing more than a bunch of worthless paper. Essentially, the government saw it more prudent to keep economies shut and instead provide economic stimulation to the tune of trillions across Europe and the U.S combined. If money supply is increased, then demand will go up. Combine an increase in demand with a decrease in supply, then you get double digit inflation levels.Only expect the the rate of price increases (aka inflation) to go down to the extent the supply shortages can correct itself post war. COVID-19 money printing demand increases cannot be controlled and will drive inflation. Don't anticipate the absolute prices to go down, of course. They never do.",

You don't travel freely and the numbers of passengers are reduced to take care of contact and this is the beginning of the increase in prices.To me the rollbacks are just not seen because the inflation is higher now in the last two years of covid-19 compared to the last 10 years back.

Even if things will go back to normal but when it's come to the price reduction of most goods and commodities, it's going to take time and businessmen are also taking advantage of it.It's hard to reduce it back from what we've used to see and that's why, acceptance is the key on this and we have to move on and deal with the current situation.Everyone has to deal with it and look at the situation, they've come to us altogether.

Immediately price of goods or services goes up due to some challenges it would never come back to normal. Even if the problem is fixed the price would still be high.It is the responsibility of the government to analyze the economy to ascertain the right price for goods and services based on the current level of inflation. The results of this analysis would be used to regulate the pricing of goods and services to ensure that the citizens are not exploited. But when this government agencies fail to carry-out their regulatory function, greedy companies and individuals would take advantage of consumers.Yes I expect that if peace returns to Russia and Ukraine and the supply of gas, oil, and agricultural products stabilizes the price of good should come back to normal. But like I stated, it would only happen if the government is doing its job.",
