      "body": "Quote from: zsky on June 23, 2023, 07:24:13 AMsatellite?What is his specific role?please informThere seems to be some question as to what exactly are we doing, here's a deeper dive into our exciting project!At present, we're in an experimental phase, closely monitoring several low earth orbit CubeSats. As these satellites pass overhead, we're capturing some of their telemetry data and logging it onto the Tribe blockchain. This is a significant step forward, as it's the first time we've successfully integrated satellite data into our blockchain. üõ∞Ô∏èBut this is just the beginning. Our vision for the future is much broader. One of the main use cases we're working towards is enabling IoT and M2M micropayments for remote devices. Imagine a remote weather station or a wildlife tracking device in a location with no traditional internet connectivity. With our system, these devices could send their data via passing satellites, and the data could be logged onto the Tribe blockchain. This could enable micropayments for data transactions, opening up new possibilities for data monetization and resource allocation.We're excited about the potential of this technology and are working hard to make this vision a reality. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible with Tribe. The future is truly in the stars! üåüThis also opens up many other use cases, here are a few ideas,¬†**Wildlife Tracking**: Tracking devices on wildlife could record location data and other information, which could then be sent to the satellite network and recorded on the Tribe blockchain. This would provide a secure, tamper-proof record of wildlife movements, which could be invaluable for conservation efforts.**Remote Infrastructure Monitoring**: Infrastructure in remote areas, such as pipelines, power lines, or roads, could be monitored using sensors. Any significant events or changes could be recorded on the Tribe blockchain, providing a reliable record that could aid in maintenance and repair efforts.**Emergency Alerts**: In areas with limited connectivity, the Tribe blockchain could be used to send emergency alerts. For example, a remote weather station could detect a coming storm and broadcast an alert via the satellite network. This alert could be recorded on the Tribe blockchain, providing a verifiable record of the alert.**Remote Health Monitoring**: Health data from patients in remote areas could be recorded on the Tribe blockchain. This could provide a secure, tamper-proof record of the patient's health over time, which could be invaluable for remote healthcare services.**Agricultural Data Collection**: In remote farming areas, data about soil conditions, weather, crop growth, etc., could be collected and sent to the satellite network, which then gets recorded on the Tribe blockchain. This could help in monitoring crop health, planning harvests, and predicting yields.**Location Stamping**: For devices or assets that are being tracked via satellite, a hash of their location data could be stored on the Tribe blockchain at regular intervals. This would provide a tamper-proof record of the asset's location over time.**Short Message Service**: The Tribe blockchain could be used to send short, secure messages. This could be useful in a variety of applications, such as secure communication between devices in an IoT network.",

      "body": "Why incorporate satellite data into the Tribe blockchain?At Tribe, we're working on an innovative system that leverages the capabilities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to enable data transmission from remote locations, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices.Our focus is not on providing continuous global coverage like systems such as Starlink, but rather on creating a network that can handle intermittent data transmission. As long as there are multiple satellite passes per day, our system can effectively serve its purpose.The key advantage of using LEO satellites in our system is their accessibility for low-power devices. These devices can directly upload data to the satellites using a simple antenna, without the need for expensive transmitters and/or dish installations. This makes our system practical and cost-effective for remote IoT and M2M applications.Our system essentially functions as a store-and-forward mechanism. When a satellite passes overhead, devices transmit their data, which is then stored on the satellite. The satellite subsequently forwards the data to a ground station when it comes into range. This data is then logged onto the Tribe blockchain, providing a secure and immutable record of the data transmission.Furthermore, we're exploring the potential of integrating a micropayment system into this network. This could enable devices to make small payments for the data they transmit, opening up new possibilities for data monetization and resource allocation.We're also considering the concept of a Super Masternode with direct satellite connectivity. This could provide valuable services and functionality within the constraints of the 160-byte limit for the transactions on the Tribe blockchain.In summary, we're building a system that leverages the unique advantages of LEO satellites to enable data transmission from remote locations, with potential applications in IoT and M2M communications. While it may not offer continuous global coverage, it serves the specific purpose of facilitating communication between devices in remote locations, and holds significant potential for future advancements.",

We've been working hard behind the scenes and are proud to announce the deployment of our new Discord bot!This bot is not just any bot - it's designed to fetch and post satellite data directly into our Discord channel. This is a significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to integrate open-source satellite project infrastructure into Tribe.Here's a brief overview of what we've accomplished:Data Fetching: The bot fetches the latest satellite data from a file that is updated with new data from our CubeSats. This data is in hexadecimal format.Data Processing: The bot then converts this hexadecimal data into ASCII, providing us with readable information about our satellite network. This includes details like the ground station, satellite, modulation, frequency, spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth, received time, signal RSSI, and signal SNR.Data Posting: The bot posts this processed data to our 'satellite-feed' Discord channel every 60 seconds. This allows us to monitor the status of our satellites in real-time.Data Comparison: To avoid spamming the channel with redundant information, the bot only posts new data if it's different from the last sent data. This ensures that we're always kept up-to-date with the latest changes in our satellite network.We believe this bot will greatly enhance our ability to monitor and manage our satellite network, and we're excited to see it in action. As always, we're committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Tribe, and we're grateful for your continued support as we embark on this exciting journey.Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!",

      "body": "üéâ Exciting news, Tribe community! üéâWe've taken a significant step towards ensuring the longevity and resilience of the Tribe blockchain with the introduction of our solar-powered AtomicPi miner. This unique setup, which we like to think of as our very own land-based Tribe mining satellite, is designed to keep the Tribe blockchain alive and kicking, even in the event that no other miners are active.Here's how it works: The heart of the system is an AtomicPi, a compact yet powerful single-board computer, running our Tribe wallet on Linux. This little powerhouse is responsible for the actual mining work, crunching the numbers to find new blocks and keep the blockchain moving.But what makes this setup truly special is its energy source. The AtomicPi is powered entirely by solar energy, harvested by a 360-watt solar panel. The energy collected by the panel is managed by a solar charge controller, which ensures the system operates efficiently and safely. The power is stored in two Trojan 6 volt T105 batteries, providing a reliable source of energy for the AtomicPi.The entire system is regulated by a voltage regulator, ensuring the AtomicPi receives a steady and safe supply of power. This means our miner can keep working around the clock, regardless of the weather or time of day.While the mining speed of this setup may not match that of larger, grid-powered mining rigs, its true value lies in its resilience. As long as the sun keeps shining, our solar-powered miner will keep working on the Tribe blockchain. This ensures that even if all other miners were to stop, the Tribe blockchain would live on.This is just one of the innovative ways we're working to secure the future of Tribe.
