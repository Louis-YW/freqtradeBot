You only get scammed when you try to buy or sell Bitcoin using scam exchanges or trust random scammers online claiming to be Bitcoin merchants. QuoteThis platform is to enlighten the society that there are real investment platforms and also people earn bitcoins for a living, so they should give it a try and invest so they can also earn This statement is kind of confusing but Bitcointalk purpose is to connect Bitcoin enthusiasts, the platform isn't an investment platform or place to earn Bitcoin for a living, anything that you earn while you're on the forum should be seen as a privilege and not as a main source of income. People welcomed here aren't people that their sole purpose of been on the forum is to earn but to learn.Quotealso when it comes to this particular fear I think the environment where one is actually staying also contributes to thisThe only time I can think about our environment contributing to the fear of we not investing in Bitcoin is when they're banned in our country but to date no country has officially banned Bitcoin and when you talk about other types of fear, the internet is opened to everyone to do their search and we shouldn't be influence by what others are saying concerning bitcoin but DYOR to find out the truth or you'll be deceived and miss out on an opportunity to invest in Bitcoin early (again).",

Because you accepted the idea when it was first introduced to you doesn't mean people around you will do same. A mistake we shouldn't commit is to force or try to convince people about investing in bitcoin when they haven't willingly out of their volition agreed to. The best is to ask them to do their own research and with time they will voluntarily adopt the idea just like in this thread BITCOIN: Give people time",

I wouldn't hold it against them in the slightest of their refusal to invest in bitcoin. They do remember the lost financial experience they suffered at the hands of scammers who ask them to invest in bitcoin, the same way you do as introducing bitcoin to them as a tool for investment. One would not fully accept investing in bitcoin with simple convincing, without doubting it, that you plan to defraud him as well, after having that kind of experience years or months ago. Don't feel bad if a friend of yours thinks poorly of bitcoin. Due to his prior Bitcoin experience, he is simply acting on that. It's possible that someone stole his money by convincing him to invest in bitcoin.",

This is going to save you from trouble, debates, and your most precious times. If you tell them tons of good things about Bitcoin, they will remember nothing and if you tell them one bad thing about it like its volatility which is mostly a bad thing to many then they will remember it as a bad thing wholly. In general these internet scams, it's true that it has discouraged a lot of people from looking into Bitcoins and taking an interest in them. But we can't blame them if they're missing it and protecting themselves as if they're on the bad side upon showing interest in it. As for investing in Bitcoin, we shouldn't invest in platforms but in actual Bitcoin. That's the misconception when people think in order for them to invest in Bitcoin, it should be in a platform.",

The thing you need to do first is to make him understand what bitcoin truly is, and when the person in question has a full understanding of bitcoin, that's when you can invite him over to invest in it. But what's the point of inviting someone who doesn't have an interest in bitcoin?
