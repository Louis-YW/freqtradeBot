I suggest you to include all information as much as possible because you were talking to a high reputed platform, sportsbet.io to be exact. Scamming $1400 is too little for them to ruin their reputation.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0",

Even I dont bet on single game .. Only combos..what exactly are you saying here? is there any confirmation for this claim?have you contacted them at all or tried to contact them and ask for an explanation? you have already withdrawn $8k, why do you think they allowed withdraw $8k and stopped $1400? Also, in which time period everything happens?are you sure that you have not violated anything from their TOS for a single moment?So many questions, you should definitely present a proper scam accusation with all the evidence.",

Even I dont bet on single game .. Only combos..My Deposite : $3000Stolen Amount : $1400You withdraw $8000 from their site and now you claim that they scammed you of $1500. Is this logical? If they are scammers, they will not make you withdraw any funds, after your account has been locked. Did you get a message from Sportsbet informing you of the reason for the lock? Have you seen the general rules of betting on their site? Have you read their terms & conditions? I advise you to contact their support, you may know from them the reason that led to locking your account and confiscating the funds, or to contact Steve in this forum, as mentioned by the person above me.QuoteSportsbet.io has the right to confiscate any deposits on accounts registered by users previously found in violation or disregard of previous warnings of the terms and conditions.[1] https://sportsbet.io/help-centre/help-other/help-other-terms-and-conditions/general-terms-conditions[2] https://sportsbet.io/help-centre/help-place-a-bet/help-placing-a-bet-general-betting-rules",

Was this the answer of their customer support, do you have a screenshot of the conversation? Am asking this because no professional support agent would ever say something like that and sportsbet has a good reputation, afaik.I just checked sportsbet's announcement thread and Steve already responded to your comment there (which seems to be deleted) stating that they have contacted you. Check your emails.",

Every casino is not like 1xcraps. You do not have any idea about Sportsbets reputation. I believe there is a misunderstanding or maybe something else. Every casinos are not the same. If community see such behavior from a casino. The Community DT members always ask you for proves and if you can show them, The casino account will get negative feedback. So, Don't throw stones blindly.",

Even I dont bet on single game .. Only combos..Those sites that can pay 8000$ out of 9400$ cant be scams. I think there is something wrong either on the bet or there might have been any policy violation for et or the account. Better try to reach the site so that you can get a solution; I think they will handle the issue positively.",
