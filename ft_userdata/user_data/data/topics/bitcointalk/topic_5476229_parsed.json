      "body": "I'm not sure, but I don't think you can verify PGP signatures with Electrum. You'll need software like GnuPG or VeraCrypt to do this.The process is relatively simple:Quote1. You download the public key (.asc file) of the software author.2. Check the public key’s fingerprint to ensure that it’s the correct key.3. Import the correct public key to your GPG public keyring.4. Download the PGP signature file (.sig) of the software.5. Use public key to verify PGP signature. If the signature is correct, then the software wasn’t tampered with.https://www.linuxbabe.com/security/verify-pgp-signature-software-downloads-linux",

Electrum binaries are signed with ThomasV's public key. On Linux, you can import that key using the following command: gpg --import ThomasV.asc. Here are tutorials for Windows and macOS. When you import a key, you should check its fingerprint using independent sources, such as here, or use the Web of Trust.",

It doesn't have access to your wallet's private keys to sign transactions.",

PGP signature ensure the authenticity of a file or a message. If I send you a signed message, you can verify it to be sure it was me who sent it.However, even if you download a fake app and connect your hw device to it, It won't be able to access your coins. It can change some data like the recipient address and the sent amount but it still need your confirmation to sign the transaction. All the information will be displayed on your hw device screen before you click on the confirmation button to sign the transaction and approve it.",

It seems like the instructions are not in order I guess?What operating system are you using?For Windows, this explanation is brief ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzOHLL_dKCMFor Linux there is one code you can use which is explained  ---> https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-verify-your-electrum-download/Follow the instructions and take a screenshot if nothing works (make sure to hide sensitive information)Thanks that's most helpful guide posted so far, but in that video I'm sent to a file to download when I click signatures next to electrum download file but it doesn't bring to a webapge to copy and paste the text like the youtube video shows it just a file that when I open it now with GPG4Win/Kleopatra installed it brings up a bunch of options 1st one stating I got 3 signatures that cannot be verified?I'm stuck now at the Command Prompt part of the video and I thought it was because I installed the files onto my desktop instead of the downloads folders so I typed in that location instead but it just says it won't work? Wtf am I doing wrong damnit! This whole entire proccess is sooo discouraging and I felt fairly knowledgeable and confident regarding this until now.OMG I'm  beginning to remember why I gave up on trying to accomplish this seemingly mandatory task FFS!",

You should import it in to Kleoparta by clicking on \"Notepad\", pasting it in, and then clicking on \"Import Notepad\".Quote from: Thomas29 on December 03, 2023, 07:36:01 AMThanks that's most helpful guide posted so far, but in that video I'm sent to a file to download when I click signatures next to electrum download file but it doesn't bring to a webapge to copy and paste the text like the youtube video shows it just a file that when I open it now with GPG4Win/Kleopatra installed it brings up a bunch of options 1st one stating I got 3 signatures that cannot be verified?You are almost there. You have confirmed that the Electrum file you have downloaded has been signed by three sets of keys. It is telling you the signatures cannot be verified because you have not yet told Kleopatra that you trust those three sets of keys as belonging to the Electrum devs.Since you already have Kleopatra installed, the next step is to import the PGP keys of the three Electrum devs which sign the releases. As above, go to \"Notepad\", paste in the first key, and then click on \"Import Notepad\". Do this for each of three keys you will find here:https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/pubkeys/ThomasV.aschttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/pubkeys/Emzy.aschttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/pubkeys/sombernight_releasekey.ascOnce you've done that, you should repeat what you did above to open the .asc file with Kleopatra. It should now show you that the three signatures are verified and you are safe to install.",

      "body": "Thanks a lot for the new guide ^   but my 1st question now (among many others) is does it matter what name and email address I use at step 1? I don't know where my \"key\" is located where I can back it up... is that step really necessary? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M READING trying to follow that tutorial!?Also it seems i forgot my passphrase for my key do I just start over even though it says not to delete it?OR I NEED a step-by-walthrough an up-to-date one if possible.... I'm using version 4.2.2 do I really need to update I know its old af but?OFF-TOPIC: Is it possible to get Electrum on an iphone?",
