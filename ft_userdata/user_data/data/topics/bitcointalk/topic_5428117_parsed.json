Sam Bankman-Fried even acknowledge in one of his interviews that he was expecting his arrest and persecution. The former FTX boss have many questions to answer and I am glad the government of The Bahamas is giving the United States all the corporation and assistance they need. They are considering extraditing him to the US to face criminal charges.It is a welcome development to see that SBF would be held responsible for his financial recklessness, but investors might never get their money back. Sam claimed that FTX has enough funds to pay all its US customers but investors or clients from other country might never get their money back because their funds are not under his control.",

He will probably try to cut a deal somehow with the government at this point. I can't wait to get more news about it!",

It was even a puzzle at first why this man is allowed to roam around and even fly to the US without authorities putting handcuffs on him. So this is it. Samuel Bankman-Fried deserves this. However sorry he may be, he will have to face the legal repercussions of his actions, his irresponsibility in handling large amounts of money entrusted to him by his clients. I hope Do Kwon, who is just found in Serbia, will also be arrested soon.",

Kudos to Coffeezilla still for that final interview that he made with SBF because that might be the missing piece that the authorities have been waiting for. SBF admitting that he committed fraud. The CEO got arrested but the funds are still gone. I don't know how the investors will feel about this one especially for those who lost a huge amount of money. Now let's wait for the Part 3 of this FTX drama .",

There were also reports that CZ is also in trouble and he is the next to be extradited since he seems to be accused to have done the same as what SBF did.So the US after all can extend its hands to arrest someone from that place. I guess they can also do it in Panama where there are more financial criminals.",
