Bitcoins will always remain scarce because only 21 million will ever exist.It would take a gargantuan effort to change this number. In fact, nobody knows if it can be done. So once 21 million Bitcoin have been mined, that’s it. The game is over.There is no way to discover, like what recently happened in Uganda, a bunch of gold in the ground.2. Bitcoin is decentralizedOne of the reasons Bitcoin holds value, and should always hold value, is because there is no single government that can get involved and print more BTC or mess with it’s price.Decentralization also means that anybody in any nation, except for China at this time, can purchase Bitcoin, utilize BTC, and store Bitcoin with specific, anonymous, keys.3. Bitcoin has become accepted as a store of valueMost individuals believe gold is a store of value. When Warren Buffet says gold has intrinsic value, he means the asset itself is valuable.Buffet doesn’t believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value. But it does because BTC investors, and the nation of El Salvador, has decided it does.El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender. Nations back up their native currency with gold, silver, or other precious metals. El Salvador backs up their currency with Bitcoin.4. Bitcoin is anonymousNobody wants anyone looking into their finances. Your finances are your business. Bitcoin is anonymous, meaning although Coinbase might know who you are, they don’t know why you made the transaction.Anonymity makes it valuable because at no time can a credit card company cut the amount of money they’re willing to lend you. Your bank account can’t decide to deny a transaction because they don’t like what you are purchasing.BTC transactions are in digital code. This fact makes it valuable to anybody who loves the idea of remaining anonymous when they make transactions.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/a002890",

When all 21M BTC mined by miners, if minters continue to turn their ASICs or future more advanced mining equipments on and confirm transactions, the game will not be over. Never be over if there are miners to confirm transactions and keep the network lively operating.QuoteDecentralization also means that anybody in any nation, except for China at this time, can purchase Bitcoin, utilize BTC, and store Bitcoin with specific, anonymous, keys.Anyone, any entity can buy it for their own interests. You can not restrict anyone, any entity to buy it.QuoteBuffet doesn’t believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value. But it does because BTC investors, and the nation of El Salvador, has decided it does.The intrinsic value comes from inputs to mine BTC. If you need to spend money for technical inputs to confirm transactions, mine blocks in order to get BTC, it would have its intrinsic value. The intrinsic value is hard to calculate because mining costs are different at different locations.Quote4. Bitcoin is anonymousNobody wants anyone looking into their finances.

Bitcoin is anonymousGreat compilation OP, but still it needs some touches, like you said BTC has been accepted as a store of value, and still you used the example of El-Salvador, As far as i know, both are two different things, because making BTC a legal tender in that country, does not mean they are using it to store there assets value in it, instead, they have no other choice to make it happen, Like you should read the story behind itQuotePresident Nayib Bukele hopes bitcoin will alleviate El Salvador’s prickliest economic problems: citizens sending money home from abroad account for up to a fifth of the country’s GDP, but they have to pay high transaction costs, and 70 per cent of people have no bank account. Bitcoin enables quick, cheap payments across borders, and doesn’t require banks. SourceBitcoin is definitely anonymous but still it is a developing technology, once a wallet is attached to your public profile, it will become impossible for you to remain anonymous or do anonymous transactions from that wallet address. And still, you take the meaning of anonymity wrong, because if Coinbase do know you then the base of remaining anonymous is vanished from there, You know what anonymous means?And in your second point, Chinese are still making transactions in crypto industry via there two nation system, in which they have allowed there second nation Hong Kong to allow trading and all types of activities in Crypto Sphere. Even, banks are forcing other platforms to legalize it completely.",

When it comes to bitcoin's finite supply and ability to rise in price over time, it can also be thought of as a store of value. Because when your asset is bitcoin, your asset value will not be lost or eroded by inflation like fiat.But bitcoin is highly volatile, and its future is uncertain, meaning there is still a risk to investing in bitcoin.

Imagine if Satoshi wasn't anonymous and he appeared in a public place then Bitcoin wouldn't be as valuable as it is now. The reason is obvious of course, that with Satoshi's anonymity, the world government cannot know who and where Satoshi is because if Satoshi had appeared from the beginning, he would have been controlled, he would have been arrested and prosecuted because he has given financial freedom to everyone in the world. This is what we hoped from the start, if you know how dilapidated the fiat financial system is then Bitcoin is the solution.Believe it or not, this uniqueness has encouraged everyone in the world to dare to take up Bitcoin as an alternative store of value controlled under a single right to themselves.",

It is essentially a store of value because if you'll look at its lifetime chart you'd find that it increases in value steadily and exponentially too. Which is a common trope amongst these types of investments. Furthermore, essentially stores of value don't have to be \"stable\" as back in the days there's no definitive value for gold and silver anyway, we just supposed them for being valuable even if there were no technical applications for these precious metals other than the fact that they look pretty. And with bitcoin having a lot of applications this early in the game it's safe to say that it fits the bill quite perfectly regardless if it fluctuates in value or not. I'd argue that the very reason why it is a great asset to invest in short-term or long-term is its volatile nature even, as it gives way for large pumps to happen which you wouldn't see in any other type of asset in the market.",
