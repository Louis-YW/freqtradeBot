If in case Canelo will lose this fight, what do you think will be next for him?Will GGG retire for good or arrange for another big fight? But who?My prediction here is that GGG may be slightly favored by sportsbooks when it comes to odds.",

I honestly thought this would never happen but here we are...It will be Canelo by KO or Unanimous Decision. GGG couldn't knock out Canelo in the previous fights and I doubt he has the power to do it now or the speed to win by decision.",

I don't understand with you mate, Canelo do lost from Bivol... but he lost because he is moving his weight and straightly fight with a champion. He need to familiarize in his new weight first and fight with weak boxer, perhaps Canelo don't want it since it looks like like he's cherry pick his opponent. The first fight against GGG are pretty close, but the second isn't, that's why Canelo win it. Seems many people only focus about Canelo lost and forgot how much his win streaks so far.",

They arranged the fight right away since they need to market it heavily because the previous loss that happened in Canelo plays a big role here. GGG however, won the requirements of this fight. I thought no GGG fight if Canelo will lose but still, organizers don't want to waste the opportunity as this fight is expected to be a million money worth, and PPV sales are expected to be sold out as early as months to go before the official fight.I'm looking forward to GGG winning the fight because Canelo still has many chances to redeem himself if ever he will lose here. Lots of time to still get his achievements compared to GGG which I think win or loss on this trilogy, he will now hang his gloves for good.GGG for me is the winner of their rematch but can't say the same thing about their first match. In this trilogy, we will now find out who's the best. If only this happens during the good years, we won't include GGG's age as the factor why he will not win against Canelo.",

At his age, he should have been retired already. This match is given the thumbs up because Canelo just lost against Bivol which he has to win more to fight against the top contender. Yes he could be hyped over and over but he is one of the best. For this fight though I will be rooting for the younger Canelo than GGG. This is more like a set up for Canelo to get back on track.",

I just hope GGG at 40 could still pull off some great shots. He's a great boxer but age matters, at least in boxing. As a matter of fact, while he had a TKO win over the inactive Murata in his last fight, I observed he has indeed slowed down a bit. On the other hand, it is a bit unfair that he's only being given the chance after Canelo lost to Bivol. It takes a loss for Canelo to accommodate this trilogy when this should have been done much much earlier. I'd be praying and cheering for GGG but I won't be making a bet.",

It was because if he will fight Bivol again, he might finally end up losing again. Haven't you noticed how silent Canelo is after he loses? If he really thinks he can go a win against Bivol in a rematch, he will surely be vocal about it. There's hesitation because he knows to himself he can't handle the underdog Bivol for the 2nd time. Instead, he chooses to fight against the older GGG and stick with the supposed original plan if he wins against Bivol. He thinks he can handle easily that old guy plus awaiting big money that will be generated by this match instead of fighting Bivol in a rematch.",
