(check the replay please!)Here's another one for you:https://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2022/game/1109/Finland-Croatia#tab=play_by_playWhy another foul is called, 21 seconds to go surprisingly this time no one is fouling.This one as well with Italy:https://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2022/game/1109/Serbia-Italy#|tab=play_by_playAgain a foul called 5 seconds to go.Not that this number (94-86) has any meaning (it's not even part of the odds - maybe the spread/total in live betting) - but you gotta ask yourself these questions about the integrity of these events.",

The team managers are surely rich enough to not care about monetary profits. There are no viewership shares for FIBA teams, just plain competition of skills between countries. Also, a lot of analysts would surely be pointing their fingers if there is something amiss on the games that are being held on the said competition.",

When people want to fake something they disguise and mask it most as possible to lead the public to believe that was a normal, common and legit result. However, in the way is has happened on the situation above they would be bringing a lot of suspicion and concerns over them. Definitely not interesting for cheaters fixing matches.",

I mean, FIBA's EuroBasket is heavily regulated and secured given that it is done internationally. With that level of competition, I also doubt that the teams and the players would subject themselves to the potential risk of investigation in the event that they indeed rigged the match. This will not only destroy their reputation but also ruin their respective careers as well.These things happen; even the things that may seem rigged happens coincidentally with all the odds and possibilities wanting to happen. In addition, if I were to rig a game, I would not ever do it three (3) games in a row with the same score- at least give it some gap per game to make it less obvious.",

The best thing to do here is to find real proof, not a fact that you have seen three games ending in the same result, by logic if you win a game where you win 0.1% of the time, you could still win it 100 times in a row, is it improbable?Of course, but it is not \"impossible\" so if you do it then you can't say it is rigged, same here, yeah 3 games in a row is unlikely, but it is still not impossible and proof of nothing. The game play by play doesn't mean anything at all neither.",

This is very true and also let's assume it was rigged, what would Fiba or anyone else gain from making these results? Just making fun of people, organization and game of basketball? As it was mentioned above, rigging a game like this is extremely hard, and having three games this way is also extremely hard. Fiba have had huge problems in this tournament. Complaints are through the roof. Almost every team had an incident that and they complained. The referees are another issue. There were some horrible calls and horrible mistakes that caused result of the games were altered. But I don't think this rigging the game scores thing is an issue and it must be just a coincidence. There are bigger problems that are needed to be focused on.",

You have provided proof of nothing but a statistical anomaly which is bound to crop up over time. Just the same way you might find 5 premier league matches turn up zero goals scored in a row - these players supposedly worth tens of millions cannot score goals, their only job? In reality if you care to type \"Average points in a eurobasket game\" and just browse the results, you'll see it is pretty much the average for a basketball game to end up within the 200 points scored range - which almost perfectly fits with the numbers you have presented. People have a great habit of seeing patterns where there are none, and three examples out of hundreds of basketball games played each year is a shockingly bad example and nowhere near evidence of anything.",
