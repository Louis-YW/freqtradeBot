  "content": "loginsam45 has stated in  a different unrelated thread that he has several alt-accounts and as a result some that thread is now being taken off-topic. In order to keep the conversation specific to the subject I have opted for this thread. What can be stated is loginsam45 has not provided any evidence he was duped out of the accounts he claimed he operated. Before consideration is given to tagging all four mentioned accounts there should be a period to allow them all to reply confirming or refuting what loginsam45 has claimed.I ask ltcrstrbrt, GigaBit and bluedeep to add their views as soon as possible. I also ask loginsam45 to explain in as much detail as possible:1) Why he claims he operated the three accounts that were stolen from him2) How were these accounts stolen by his friend3) What is the forum member name of this friend4) Why was he operating the three accounts in the first place5) Does he have any other accounts he is still controlling/operating6) Are speeder and Averim connected within the account farming7) What he means when he stated he wants justice. Clarify what he means by justice =========================================================Quote from: loginsam45 on July 21, 2023, 04:04:03 AMSharing the link of my accounts1. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2143232. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1981123. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=236814Quote from: loginsam45 on July 20, 2023, 05:03:50 AMQuote from: Rikafip on July 08, 2023, 06:15:02 AMSo, why don't you share us names those accounts that were allegedly stolen from you, but this time provide a proper evidence for your claims. Can you help me get my accounts back if I share the names of my accounts?Quote from: loginsam45 on July 08, 2023, 05:17:03 AMQuote from: YOSHIE on July 07, 2023, 03:51:16 PMQuote from: loginsam45 on July 07, 2023, 03:54:58 AM@JollyGood You have taken a good initiative I think there are some other DT members including you for whom this forum no longer has trading accounts like it used to.  Such warnings will stop corruption from the forum.  I think you took strict action against those who bought and sold accounts in 2022, for which now the forum is much stronger.In my opinion, you are no stranger or new to this forum, because you already know about trading, JollyGood and DT.New newbies don't know anything about it, only those who have been here for a long time know all that, in future if you find alt cheats in the campaign, try to post with your main account and mark them as cheaters.Yes you are right I am not new in this forum. I had many accounts in this forum but they are no longer under my control. My close friend cheated me and took the accounts for which I don't have high rank account now. For which I am posting with this newbie account. I have been back to the forum for three days.Quote from: loginsam45 on July 21, 2023, 04:10:58 AMQuote from: JeromeTash on May 28, 2023, 09:52:02 PMQuote from: Learn Bitcoin on May 28, 2023, 04:27:42 PMThis account was up for sale on the exact date it woke up. The seller sold this account without removing or updating the selling thread. Clicking on Merit and Trust from the sell thread will redirect you to this account. Can someone verify before the seller remove the thread?He does seem to have any posted Bitcoin address in the different boards, but I do see an Ethereum address posted back in 2017 for a bounty campaignQuote from: bluedeep on May 08, 2017, 04:07:44 AMIrfan please update my ETH address on Blog form ( position 158)ETH address: 0x4320379558e74800b37114848e7905695c33624AThank you!Maybe the person could try using a message from the address to prove that it didn't change hands.This account has changed hands. My 3 accounts have been taken by my friend by cheating me. I want justice for this.Ask those who are using my accounts to sign the address message. If they can sign the address message, then I will never come to this forum again.",

You've made a mistake somewhere. So you're gonna have to re-sign the message. And be more careful when you sign the message. And also, I am interested in why you added these accounts -  ltcrstrbrt and GigaBit - to your message? After all, they did not use this address on the forum. In any case, I did not find any mention of this address in the posts of these two accounts. This address is mentioned only in your posts and bluedeep's posts.So you are trying to deceive the community that these two accounts belong to you. Sign your posts with the addresses that mention these two accounts in their posts on the forumltcrstrbrt  - https://ninjastic.space/addresses?author=ltcrstrbrtGigaBit - https://ninjastic.space/addresses?author=GigaBit",

Can you sign any of your three known addresses from 2014/2015?If you are unable to sign any of them please explain why. Quote from: _BlackStar on July 23, 2023, 09:18:32 PMQuote from: GigaBit on July 23, 2023, 08:06:09 PMAnyone is welcome to file their complaint but I am truly astonished by how openly he discusses his alternate accounts, a behavior that I have never witnessed before. If he can provide valid evidence, then undoubtedly, he will be able to recover his accounts accordingly.I can truly say that newbie are making false claims if you make a disclaimer by signing your old bitcoin address before you change the account password. That's one of the best ways to make a disclaimer - but I don't have to force you to.There are some old wallets you used in 2015 - if something never happened to you and the file store you should be able to sign messages from those addresses.Why I am being asked to sign in messages. Since he (loginsam45) raised the complaint, he has to prove whether he is the owner of the account or not. Ask him and ask him to prove it. Why he is not come back to online. I am the owner of this account. When this complaint came up I tried to find my old wallets but couldn't find (2015). My previous devices have changed. If I had known that I would need my wallets later, I would have tried to keep them more carefully. If loginsam45 can sign the message then I will have nothing to say. But that is impossible, I challenged him.",

BPIP, LoyceV's tools, modlog, the Staff section don't give me more info. Maybe a temp ban.Quote from: JollyGood link=topic=5460544.msg62581728#msg62581728 2) How were these accounts stolen by his friendI will add \"How and when these accounts stolen by his friend\". It could be important.I don't know how much internal information a staff can have like IP, device info and anything else which is enough to at least give a benefit of doubt but nonetheless I don't think it will be good to comment anything that may give out information of such private things even when you are making a neutral stand. You are one of forum staff not like independent members like us who are free to do anything, tell anything, make anything. A very little mistake from you will not only look you bad but the entire forum will suffer for it where if I make a mistake then no one else is going to question the forum a single question but all to me.",

Instead, I will ask the accuser to give enough strong evidences so that I will be sure that he is not trolling us all. Do you have any such strong back up story? I guess I don't see any yet.Then my request is to leave these three guys alone.[...]Hmm... actually there is a good back up story against bluedeep, the post made by loginsam45 on post #2 signed a message from an address that's used by bluedeep in the past. I think it'll be probably in bluedeep's interest to give his side of explanation on this situation, especially regarding the address. That said, I can agree that GigaBit and ltcrstrbrt probably doesn't have to answer by signing an address or anything yet, because loginsam45 has yet to provide ownership of them, and that there were not anything that ties both account to loginsam45 or bluedeep [of course, that's said with a fact that I am not an expert on that matter as I am not that privy] other than an accusation of merits of ltcrstrbrt, that I don't think reached a verdict, so that thread itself --IMO-- is not substantial enough. That's part of the reason why I said to loginsam45 that it works both ways, that he can, and invites him to, proves the ownerships from his side.To answer your question about if it's me, if it's baseless and/or have nothing to back up the claim, I'll quite likely to ignore it [ermm... I think I'll be more likely to answer them sarcastically, if I have to be honest, LOL], but if they have a claim that have one or two basis, like on bluedeep's, then I think I'd like to be given a chance to defend myself. Or, if I stand on the other side of the table, that I got hacked --or what other reason loginsam45 claimed-- and I've give a proof of ownership by a signed message, I think I will appreciate if my words and statement [that I've been hacked] to be at least given a benefit of doubts, which were given to loginsam45 right now. I thank you for your trust in me that --for you-- I don't have to counter the accusation if similar scenario happened to me, though.Edit: tidying grammar error and a bit incoherence as I took some time [and lots of break because I was out while typing this] to compose this post. And thanks, FatFork to also pointing the signed message out.",
