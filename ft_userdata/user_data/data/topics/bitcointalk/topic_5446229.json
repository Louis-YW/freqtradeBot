Sometimes, altcoins might react differently due to various factors like market sentiment and hypes that are created due to project updates. If you look at the charts, you will notice that most of the times, when the price of bitcoin when up fast, other altcoin had the same change, but also when the price of bitcoin started to drop, the altcoins started to drop even worse. Bitcoin can give a general direction to the market, there's no guarantee that alts will always follow the same pattern since the market is very volatile and unpredictable.",

So only a few altcoins can be kept for the long term the rest are only for taking short-term profits because in the end BTC still provides more certain profits except for a few altcoins such as ETH, BNB and Dogecoin and others whose development is quite clear and directed.",

Sometimes they are and sometimes they're not. As we can see, there have been times that it was inversely proportional and sometimes it was the explanation that you've mentioned. This is how the market works and there's no exact and accurate calculations for the gains and losses that bitcoin and altcoins are getting.",

And I also find that all the positive things are happening, the BTC/altcoin relationship will always be observed regardless of the time of the market, so don't push yourself too hard.",

The percentage increase is sometimes associated with the hype around that particular coin. The likes of Solana and ETH moves in almost same percentage as bitcoin while there meme coins move much higher. But in all they all follow bitcoin trend just that the percentage increase or decrease arenâ€™t predictable",

Also you need to see the dominance of bitcoin since sometimes this could make the price of alts go stable or dump in short instances so follow the market and do proper calculations since there are times that market doesn't came up with our expected scenarios to come.",

This is because altcoins are often traded against bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges. When the price of bitcoin increases, it can create more demand for altcoins as well, which can cause their prices to rise. However, it's important to remember that the prices of altcoins can also be influenced by a variety of other factors, such as their own unique features, adoption rates, and market trends.",

Yes we can conclude that altcoins are less trusted than our major coin bitcoin. You could say that its the most effective coin. So the other coins are depending on the price of the it. We can surely see how bitcoin affect the altcoin market if ever there is a crash happened or anything that market makes it move.",

Even, not all altcoins will follow the movement of Bitcoin (BTC) price, usually only the top altcoins get a real impact from the rising or falling price of Bitcoin itself. And about the phenomenon you said, people aren't distrusting altcoins anymore, but it's true that the hype is going around Bitcoin (BTC) right now, and as we know that next year Q1 we're going to see the halving of Bitcoin.",

A simple explanation to that is because Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency of all and because of that most of the altcoins in the market is valued in Bitcoin. Most people dont just buy altcoins directly with their fiat, instead they buy Bitcoin first and then trade it with another altcoin and vice versa. So in that manner, every transactions with the altcoins in the market, Bitcoin is always involved in the trading, thus Bitcoin price moves as well as the altcoins. But be careful since not all altcoin follows Bitcoin's price, you should still have your own due diligence.",

That is one of many things that affect the prices. Now, when the range doesn't follow your past prediction, it does not mean people start to leave the altcoin market.
