I don't believe an unlimited supply coin would be a good investment for long run. They can be a good utility coin but not an investment.3. For any mining coin, they should be ASIC resistant as it increases decentralization.4. I don't mind if they have an ICO or not. But I generally don't go with ICO and wait and see how the token performs.5. If they have transparent allocations of funds, a pre-mined are generally better than a fully volunteer coin.6. Paid developers are generally more interested. The tokens should be released with the progress in roadmap.7. Depends on whether I'm trading or investing.",

Or so far I can always find a good reason to buy more and use for better things on the network, then I'm in.For example. People keep buying ETH and SOL and not looking at the unlimited supply cos they see how they are gonna keep getting more useful with time. Even if ETH fees goes too high, people still buy. Although I buy all my coins on Bitget and withdraw cos they have lesser withdrawal fees.So, you may need to put more focus on coins with good use cases and low marketcap cos those are the coins that are gonna give you bigger profits when the bull market comes",

I agree with using an exchange platform because this method has additional benefits such as we can assess where they choose which exchange to choose so that we can predict whether the coin will be good or not if it is marketed on that exchange and we can of course assess whether the exchange is good or not. have a good reputation or not. because to choose the ideal altcoin requires various kinds of research",

But I prefer to stay with the new technology as it gives us more adoption with time and the world that it gives more users. BTC is something unique so I want to keep it off this list of being old technology-wise. The time of ICO has gone and there are other types of token offerings on the market so it will be better to use those instead of ICO. You will earn money in crypto if you follow the trend. Going against the trend can slow you down or cause financial loss.",

Altcoin is best on the pos network since Ethereum which is the primary source of other coins network have fully migrated to the proof of stake network and for now they are operated on Ethereum 2:0 which is most likely the primary network for most coins that are ready to drive in the market for this season,  this is what most of the projects are currently looking and working on so for sure,  it is better to choose coins that run on those network than having those off the network most especially now that the is network congestion and high fees. This is most likely the main motive that can drive investors' perceptions and motivate them into investing in such projects which are run on the POS network since they take off all those factors.",
