This was a pretty great way to introduce people easily to the site and of course this board in particular. It seems the website is still under registration until next year, so any ideas what’s up with it right now or what might have happened?   www.physicalbitcoin.comFrom what I can tell, the DNS has has multiple A records for it, so it resolves to one of the 4 different IP's below instead - Which don't seem to do anything (anymore)? but give ssl errors...  Whoever controls the domain's dns records just needs to fix all that I guess...

It did use to resolve here tho.. Chib, is that your domain? I can help with dns fixing if you need it, I recall us talking about this a long time ago I think but I cannot recall who owned it... All of those IP addresses have reverse dns pointing to various \"cloudfront.net\" servers, so I'm assuming that's who is hosting it.

I kind of figured who’s ever domain it is, is likely someone who’s a member/regular here or at least was at some point. Would be nice if it ended up being fixed. Really was a nice gesture by whomever initially set it up and a great and easy way to share this exact board with people.",
