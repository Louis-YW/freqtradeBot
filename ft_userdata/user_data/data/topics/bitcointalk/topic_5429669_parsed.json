      "body": "Coinbase seems to be launch a new marketing strategy in order to convince people to use their exchange or wallet, actually they don't need to charge any fee since they already own those address, they just need to send it back. But they just cover the process like it's hard and Coinbase is really generous for doing this. However I wonder why they only want to retrieve ERC20 assets while they can actually retrieve any centralized network like BNB and TRC20. Take note they charge $5 if you recover asset that worth over $100.Quote from: https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-announces-new-asset-recovery-tool-for-erc-20-tokensUnlike other asset recovery solutions that may charge up to 15% for asset recovery and require a customer service agent to send you the funds manually, we do not charge a recovery fee for recoveries estimated to be worth under $100. For recoveries estimated to be worth over $100, we charge a small recovery fee (5%) to cover development and maintenance costs for the service. (A separate network fee applies to all recoveries. For more information, see our pricing and fees disclosures.)",

      "body": "Unfortunately, the news does not give any technical details about what this tool is and how it differs from the traditional methods.it seems that the process is not done manually as it was in the past, but it is still central in the sense that the tool verifies that the assets are with Coinbase and different assets are sent to your wallet (not the same assets that you deposited.)QuoteOur recovery tool is able to move unsupported assets directly from your inbound address to your self-custodial wallet without exposing private keys at any point. We did this by using patent pending technology to send the funds directly from your inbound address without processing the funds through our centralized exchange infrastructure.  Is it the one that confused me? They mention that your private key is not disclosed, and yet the money can be sent from your address. without the need for a central structure. HOW",

HOW   I think that means the PrivateKey of your exchange address which is needed to send back unsupported (unsweptable) assets. As far as anyone's experience goes, it seems that even the technical team can't read or extract those PKs manually without dismantling auto-sweeper script that manages all those PKs.",

They mention that your private key is not disclosed, and yet the money can be sent from your address. without the need for a central structure. HOW   There is Coinbase EXCHANGE and there is Coinbase WALLET. The former is centralized and they own the private-keys (obviously), the latter isn't centralized and you own the private keys. With their tool, some unsupported coin you send to the exchange will be forwarded to your custodial wallet, where there is no such thing as unsupported.I think the point is that the private key of the exchange part isn't disclosed to an employee, so there is no need for manual intervention (which is always a bit risky). They probably have an isolated service running those txs.",
