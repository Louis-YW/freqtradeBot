With only 2 miles (or about 3.2 KM) distance, no wonder people are concerned. It's a shame they decide not to do it on facility far from residential area and now they might have to spend money for legal and PR.those poor people are going to have to put up with thick black smoke 24/7 if the government doesn't step in.   newsflash:bitcoin mining companies don't care if they release toxins into the air.",

Sounds like the key issue is the terrible regulation related to environmental concerns. Whether they want to use it to mine or not, a similar debate will arise if the law is not changed. Looks like this is not the first time either. Another company already did a similar thing in the past, which begs the question if the lobbying is not strong enough or if the company went bankrupt before any harm was done. CMIIW.",

It is a controversial approach because although the removal of coal waste can help remediate contaminated land, the process emits greenhouse gases and other harmful chemicals. It can take twice as much waste coal to produce the same amount of electricity that regular coal would produce.The company also says it sometimes needs to burn tire-derived fuel – made of shredded vehicle tires – to make the combustion of waste-coal more efficient.From what I understand, it is a plan to improve the efficiency of burning coal waste by burning tire-derived fuel - made from shredded car tires - and perhaps the reason for this is that the quality of coal waste is low.In general, this company receives government subsidies, and I do not think that it will present a stupid plan that will lead to public discontent, especially since its field is burning coal waste and it has a temporary permit.",
