It's okay having bitcoin as a digital asset, wether it's possible or not making it a physical money it doesn't matter as I believe it's isn't part of the dreams of Satoshi to have bitcoin in physical form. So let the fiat money be there playing its own role.",

If Bitcoin has a physical existence, then there is nothing like decentralization for Bitcoin because the government will want to be in control like they have always wanted to be.",

I don't think any of those were ever achieved. I can also remember reading through a thread where the OP proposed a physical Bitcoin with a chip inside, and those chips would be used to check if there was still value in it or something of that nature.To me, I don't think there is actually any need for us to have a physical Bitcoin or whatever; everything is just perfect the way it is. What's the need for the physical Bitcoin when we can do everything we need to do by transacting our Bitcoin just the way we are doing it now, which is less stressful, and not some form of physical stuff like fiat, where you will make some purchases and ask for change when you go to shop with a higher amount than what you purchased?",

However, I will understand that majority of us are not keen on this idea, to see Bitcoin being treated as like a paper or coin money.",

This tells all the reasons why bitcoin just has to remain digital. Its always been digital either ways as, to gain full value of it, you still have to use it in transacting over the blockchain and get some confirmations on it, leaving no room for double spending or any form of counterfeiting which isn't possible in bitcoin.Bitcoin obviously has got its about over the Web with fiat to operate the realms of the physical and so, we might just have to leave it in its best fit, digital.Quotebut all in all it has been done and people have successfully traded in the physical world within a small group of trusted face to face exchangesThis spells how determined some bodies and users are determined yo attain certain fantasies.",

If physical bitcoins are created, they will look like fiat or traditional assets and will be controlled by someone, possibly a government, so this is a bad idea. Moreover, we are moving towards the digital world, we are gradually getting rid of things that are too cumbersome, polluting, and costly to print like fiat. So creating bitcoin in physical form is not groundbreaking, if that happens, the government is just trying to control us with that idea.",

Otherwise it would be disappointing to call it a BitCOIN. Furthermore, I think it should look very technologically (designed) awesome and of course, it needs the BTC symbol for Bitcoin. So, obviously, it would look more or less exactly the same as the Bitcoin logo that everyone knows and loves. We even use that coin logo for Bitcointalk- Just take a look at your tab, lol.But I will always see a physical Bitcoin as infinitely inferior to the real Bitcoin. Just because a physical Bitcoin is a centralized version of Bitcoin. Which is quite ugly to me and is not what Bitcoin stands for (decentralization).",

Nobody can actually take that Bitcoin out of the blockchain and turn it into a physical coin or bill or penny. Bitcoin is digital, so physical and Bitcoin are actually antonyms. Anyway, there are already a number of bills and coins that are loaded with Bitcoin. Actually, not really loaded, but they contain the private keys that give you access to the Bitcoin. There are even cards, chips, and other physical items and artworks that are also loaded with Bitcoin. If you head to the Collectibles section, you will see a number of them. You have the revered Casascius coins. You have the Lealana, BTCC, CryptoImperator, Alpencoin, and many others. You also have Bitcoin bills like Polymerbit.But these are largely collectibles. In the future, though, it is possible that there will be bills and coins backed by Bitcoin. Just like the old days when fiat was backed by gold, there might come a time in the future when bills and coins can be redeemed for Bitcoin. As to how they would look like, I don't know.",
