  "content": "Hong Kong is a city and special administrative region in China which enjoy some autonomy on its own. It is a city with a population of 7.4 million residents of various nationalities.Just recently, Hong Kong’s central bank reportedly reiterates on its call for major banks, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of China to accept crypto firms as clients. Despite the call for this, the banks are hesitant in doing so. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) encouraged the banks not to be afraid during a meeting after which a circular was released to banking institutions last month.Below is the HKMA circular to banking institutions in Hong KongThe circular recommended and encouraged banking institutions to keep track on new market developments and to take a more daring approach to emerging markets like the cryptocurrency market. The institutions were particularly obliged by Hong Kong's central bank to assist cryptocurrency companies, which it refers to as \"virtual asset service providers,\" in acquiring access to banking services.This new approval by the Hong Kong central bank will make trading crypto a more friendly traded asset in that region that house many populations and also in the adoption of it because of the various nationalities present in that region of China. Despite the circular and assurance to the traditional banks there, they are still hesitant in accepting crypto firms. What could be their reason for being reluctant in accepting crypto firms as clients?Source:https://twitter.com/watcherguru/status/1669373334776078336?s=46&t=AFO-ngiNXBXd6CFRPg8kKghttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-government-pressures-bank-giants-accept-crypto-clientshttps://watcher.guru/news/hong-kong-urges-hsbc-standard-chartered-to-support-crypto-exchanges",

Knowing what kind of government China have towards businesses, i dont know.Singapore is a small nation but it does not relate to any territory conflict like Hongkong. Hongkong is like Taiwan which are facing with bigger pressure from China mainland even with army interventions. It puts future of Hongkong into uncertainty and the same for Taiwan.The news is great as it opens more chances for cryptocurrency and blockchain companies in that island and it is another big support from their governments and banks for the industry. It is a good start but we will need a few months to see real impacts from Hongkong banks for companies in this field.",

Make it similar to what you would pay for gains on stocks? That will be fine.Indeed, this is one piece of good news at a time when the market is very volatile and it signifies the increasing trust and acceptance of cryptocurrencies by countries, which is essential for their long-term survival. It seems like Hong Kong was inspired by its neighbor Singapore, which is known for its crypto-friendly regulations as you say.As for the tax treatment, In my view These are Different Asset Classes meaning Comparing the tax treatment between cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks may not be appropriate as there are inherent differences. Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class with unique characteristics, and some argue that they should be subject to different tax regulations that reflect their particular features. Implementing a standardized tax framework for crypto profits similar to stocks may require international cooperation and consensus, which may difficult to achieve because tax rates must reflect the potential risks and benefits associated with cryptocurrencies and their impact on the wider economy.",

What could be their reason for being reluctant in accepting crypto firms as clients?Bitcoin have gained a lot of popularity in recent times and many people have heard about it. Many negative news have also being attached to bitcoin from those that don’t like the existence of it. We all know bad news spreads like wildfire, the negative notion attached to the use of bitcoin might be the reason these banks are sceptical in accepting crypto firms. They’ll accept it overtime, but it’s going to be a gradual process before many traditional banks there will accept crypto firms fully.Quote from: crypticj on June 16, 2023, 02:22:59 AMThis sounds great!But I don't really trust this news, considering that officials hate bitcoin and crypto. they can block this decision pretty fast.I think, as long as the government can't tax bitcoin, they won't allow people and companies to freely use it. And I think right now we don't need it because adoption is moving very slowly, people are afraid of bitcoin because of the price and fluctuations.About the tax, it’s a must for the government to adopt it. Every nation needs to collect tax for a sustainable economic work flow in the country. This is not just about the tax, if tax are employed here, the citizens who still know the positive potential part of bitcoin will still venture into it. This is a very good news and hoping for the adoption to continue to increase daily around the world.",

Not all country, like Indonesia where the government takes the Tax for Bitcoin, The company and People still has limited to use of Bitcoin, People can invest in Bitcoin as Digital Asset only, Not for currency and transaction. So If they find it (people use as currency), that tourist will be fined like in Bali a long time ago.Quote from: crypticj on June 16, 2023, 02:22:59 AMpeople are afraid of bitcoin because of the price and fluctuations.Bitcoin price will not be stable until all people countries use it like Dollar. of course that won't happen soon, If they can patient in certain time, they will get profit if follow the halving time.",

Or the government could completely intervene in this policy at a later date.",

      "body": "The decision made by Hong Kong authorities to support Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies is appreciable, however there can be some issues in the initial stages of it. The banks will slowly adopt to the crypto-currency payments and that will really have good impact on the crypto-market in the long run. I think this news is quite sufficient in such times to fix the current problems that the market is facing. If Hong Kong is favoring crypto-currency payments then many neighboring countries will do the same.I also believe that Hong Kong has been inspired by Singapore to accept crypto-currencies as valuable assets that could be tradable with fiat. I think this is one of the best decisions ever taken by Hong Kong authorities. Although, they have suggested the banks to adopt crypto-currencies, but I still think that banks won't start accepting the crypto-payments anytime soon. However, after sometime most of the banks will have to accept the crypto-currencies.",

However, after sometime most of the banks will have to accept the crypto-currencies.Banks are expected to embrace companies in the cryptocurrency realm, rather than accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This distinction is crucial because cryptocurrency companies operate within the cryptocurrency space, whereas accepting cryptocurrency as a banking transaction method is an even more radical shift.In practice, banks accepting cryptocurrency would result in certain circulating cryptocurrency assets being held in custodian wallets. The original owners would not have full control over their funds. This raises concerns related to the concept of \"Not Your Key, Not Your Bitcoin,\" as centralized entities may appear to exploit their clients' wealth for internal banking purposes.",

Not to mention there are two other reasons why this statement is not true. First is that this is more about regulation than adoption, which means more restrictions and monitoring, specially considering the attitude of China towards bitcoin. It is not like they adopted bitcoin as legal tender.Secondly in the current economy, with recession and everything, high risk investments (which the crypto industry falls under) are very rare and if they happen they are going to be small. Also one of the reasons why bitcoin price hasn't gone to the moon yet.",
