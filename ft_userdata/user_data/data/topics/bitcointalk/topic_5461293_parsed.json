Care to share your secret sauce?I'm not hunting on meme coins like Pepe, but I do agree that Twitter is one social media that you might find new meme coins on the horizon as obviously they need to get the word out and Twitter is one of the best social media that we have today.Not sure, maybe reddit could also be a good source of meme coin hunting, or 4chan perhaps. Because I remember that there are a lot of developers who uses 4chan before. Or at least uses that as medium to spread the word.",

Shameful, because it caused huge capital to be directed to the pockets of scammers, rugpull specialists, instead of directing it to innovative projects and new technologies. This ridicules crypto investors and diminishes the new technologies that are being created here.And when it comes to potential gains, you always have to look at the risk/reward. Maybe finding a new PEPE gives you a potential profit of x1000 (if you wont take profit earlier), but the chance are 1:10,000 or less.",

There’s a bigger underlaying issue though - you’ll need to spend a ton of time to find out about new coins and separate the good from the bad ones. Memecoins are like gambling, only very few succeed and even that’s mostly temporary. For now, the only truly successful memecoin is Doge. The others need to pass the test of time which, frankly, is pretty harsh and hard to pass. I expect most memecoins to be gone in a matter of months or years. New ones will come up, the previous gones will go.",

Meme coins are shitcoins - a sad reality. If you are too lucky these days OP but I will tell you that it was hard to believe for another meme coin to soar high like Pepe and Shiba Inu. I would say that stop focusing on finding them because you will only find it regretful instead, have your time spent wisely looking for potential coins, not on hyped and scam projects.",

I'm following those twitter accounts that probably sharing alpha of these meme coins and the strategy to check wallets that are aping on meme or other tokens that may get trending. Regarding this one (checking wallets), I guess it's still twitter to look out for, there are lot of threadoors out there that share this strategy.",

Care to share your secret sauce?Not really interested in that meme coins. Meme coins is just about the chance of making you rich and only driven the hope of being a protagonist on a success story. Meme coin hype is slowly degrading and I don't think people (masses) has still guts to invest on meme coin given t hat a lot of  newbies are always on a loss on these meme coins. Meme coin really attracts newbies because on how high the possible return that can go back to you but the risk is the same and newbies don't really realize it. I'm not bashing you OP. It's just my thoughts about meme coins.",

Care to share your secret sauce?As you said already, Twitter activity is what I too look first. Other metrics I consider are the overall presentation. The plans and roadmaps. Projects with low effort are highly unlikely to success. A well thought out project stands out when you visit it's site and look at the roadmap. Other thing to consider is the overall community and organic participation of the members.Coinmarketcaps community tab too is now a good place to watch what people are talking about.",

Care to share your secret sauce?You are right that twitter is very good source of information regarding what’s hot since it’s the most popular social media channel to promote shitcoin but since it’s the most popular makes it dangerous place too since scammer use this platform to spread their scam project. It’s a pros and cons.I usually use dextools on checking newly created meme tokens then watch for the liquidity to build up. This is a safe sign that there’s a demand building on a token instead of relying on social media that is full of fraud and scammer promoting their scam tokens. On Dextools, you can guarantee that all data is legit.",

It was bringing the hype for pepe token. Milady has also the same case as pepe. It was not growting due to the fundamental, but it's flying high due to the elon's tweet. Elon's tweet was driving so many people to speculate the future of this meme token. It's the same story as doge coin in the past. I don't even need to find that, but elon gonna find it for me. It's really stupid if you were buying meme token without being hyped by elon first. The key is you shall buy token that will be mentioned by elon. That's it.

Who certifies? Also not to offend you but I do view memecoins as good tokens only at its start 'coz most of its market prices are falling eventually. Also, not all meme tokens are having good outcome in this industry simply because of its laack of utility which we all know, is needed to sustain its market value. But yes, if you could determine which one qoyld be best to buy early and has the potential to be bigger after its release in the market, then that would be a huge advantage. However, problem is determining one. Everythings dependent with hype and demand for meme tokens and that means even if a certain one has a good team behind, if majority of investors does not think it would be the best one, then demand would still be low.",
