  "content": "Hi guys, I wonder when we are going to be able to set the fees of our transactions under 1 sat/vB.Actually we can set some random amount of fees above that amount like 1.01, ... 2.17 etc.. or something like that example:We only drag the bar or we typed manually the amount of fess etc...I know that this actually is not fair for miners but lets to said that bitcoin hits 1 Million USD some day ( Hypothetically speaking ) that means that 100 satoshis will worth 1$ USDSo now imagine a regular Transaction with some high fee of ~30 Sats/vB with one input and two outputs.Currently that is 1.6$ USD, but in our Hypothetic example that is going to be like 46$ USD per transactionSo the question here: Is there some mechanics in the consensus of bitcoin to start accepting fees under 1 sat/vB ? example... 0.58 sat/vBWhen bitcoin started a lot of miners used to acept transactions with NO fee.Now if you manually craft a transacction with lower fee that will be rejected by the network.",

According to consensus rules, the total value of outputs must be equal or smaller than the total value of inputs. This means that even if the fee for a transaction is zero, that's not against consensus rules.

The price of the fees goes up, when there are heavy transactions in the blockchain. When the blockchain in congested, the price goes up to maintain it.

It's possible that nodes decide to change the minimum relay fee in the future. It seems this is technical side of fees explaining how the fees are decided, how nodes have minimum relay fee of 1 sat. However this doesn't explain how we can lower the fees in the future. If 1 sat becomes around 1-2 bucks then does it mean we will have to end up paying fees like 60-100 bucks on average transactions. Plus we can also set speed of transaction, if this becomes high priority transaction then imagine the fees that we will have to pay.Or shall we just talk in terms of sats since converting it into Usd makes it look very expensive. There is another problem, when we set the fees very less it also takes lot of time for the transactions to provide. Thus no matter what miners preference is always on the transaction with high fees. I think this would definitely cause issues in the future.",

For now you just have to postpone any transaction for some hours or max of few days but in the bull market it's going to take a long time, maybe weeks because Ordinals will gain a lot of attention at the time because it's something new, everything new on the block chain always gain attention and pumps in a bull market first before they face whatever will happen later. My Bitcoin wallet don't need some type of adjustment on the transaction fee as I have studied that it's default is the minimum amount equivalent to what memepool.

Bitcoin protocol can be upgraded and fee rate is not like a very big change so when Bitcoin price is too high and 1 satoshi has high value, I believe there will be new Bitcoin units, smaller than satoshi. The new smaller unit will be used for fee rate in future.Bitcoin users will be able to pay affordable transaction fee and I believe Bitcoin developers can do better than Ethereum developers. Since 2009, after appearance of Ethereum, smart contracts, Bitcoin blockchain is still the best to move fund with best secured network against 51% attack, no censorship and transaction fee is cheap, competitive than Ethereum and other blockchains.",
