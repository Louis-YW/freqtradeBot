Lend me the available balance or invest for a comfortable 50%.2. Invest in your personal account and make me work it, I will raise it enough in just 1 day, we will both obtain good profits and the person who will deposit me will be you.Now which option is best for you? Contact me and we'll talk.The 3rd method. Stop \"trading\" (gambling in your case) with other's money and find a job.",

Very interesting.These clowns should all be millionaires within a couple of days normally, something must be wrong.",

They recommended that I ask for a loan or offer my experience as a service and I think I have done it wrong because I have negative comments. We all know that a smaller account takes time to rise, however, a larger account generates the desired journal faster, that's all. On my part, if my publication looks bad, some admin can delete it, but even if I was wrong, it is a matter of saying it, thank you.If you are so skilled, why are you also selling amazon gift cards here?Really curious.Anyway, trust me when I tell you, nobody will EVER fall for this, so you can give up already and close this thread. Any reply is just a waste of your time and the time of others reading it. So do us the favour ....",
