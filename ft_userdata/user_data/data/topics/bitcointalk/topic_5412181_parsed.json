(Idk if this is even what you are talking about.)Although signing a message with a bitcoin key (from your address) shares some similarity with PGP but they are not the same thing. You don't need an additional software to sign or verify bitcoin messages, most popular wallets like Electrum already have that option and there is not much to learn since the process is pretty straight forward. This is how it looks like in Electrum, you just fill the boxes and click the appropriate button:",

Most non-custodial wallets have it.",

It's probably too technical for most people to find useful, but it's good to know what the authoritative reference is.The most popular implementation of the OpenPGP standard is known as GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard, sometimes abbreviated GPG) and is available here. It's already included in most Linux distributions.The documentation for GnuPG is comprehensive and will cover just about any question you could possibly have. If you're not sure where to start, then I recommend going through the \"GNU Privacy Handbook\" (HTML or PDF). GnuPG is used from the command line. Modern users may find it easier to use one of the different frontends available (like GpgFrontend or Kleopatra).Hopefully that gets you started!",
