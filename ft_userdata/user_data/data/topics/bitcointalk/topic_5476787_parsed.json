There have been so many broken promises and empty threats made from the top, but it always boils down to things being allowed under the guise of freedom of speech. Now with the mixers situation it is clear that the motivation isn’t freedom of speech, the motivation is the least amount of effort and management possible. Mixers present an issue because law enforcement wants to make inquiries about them, so it’s easier to ban them. The motivation has clearly changed to eliminating responsibility, not enabling freedom and it’s a trend that has been building for several years.",

Well, for starters they should stop creating alt accounts by the dozen. Instead, they should focus on writing quality posts from their main account. Focus on actually learning something so they can actually contribute something of substance. And maybe even improve their financial situation in ways outside of sig campaign earnings. But they won't do it, because they can get away with writing shitposts from 2-4 different accounts and get paid for them. What they don't realize is that the earning potential from one high rank account is worth more than 4-20 low rank accounts, but they don't care; they came here for the easy money, not to work hard or smart. Quote from: Shenanigan on December 06, 2023, 04:14:40 PMThere are too many old high-ranking users with enormous powers on the forum who do not fulfill their duties and do not give a growth to newbiesWhat \"duties\" are you talking about per se? Last I recall none of us are getting paid for \"forum duties\" outside of staff. Perhaps we aren't as inclined to \"give a growth\" to newbies because most of them are not actually newbies and we know that. Have you ever considered that?",

If you want to be useful and not just receive something useful from the forum, start reading posts from those who are trying to teach and gain more experience. But creating topics that are full of errors, as well as topics on any question for which there are thousands of answers on the forum, also creates unnecessary spam since people begin to repeat the same thing as parrots day after day.Also note that reports are made for AI posts, plagiarism, unnecessary advertising, and anything that spoils the forum.

You have to start from the beginning and continue to contribute your quota bit by bit, it's after this that people will start discovering you even without you making announcements like this. It's as easy as that. To me, it's even fair because we should not judge people by what they say, we should rather judge them by what they do. So you can start proving yourself to the forum users and management right away.There are also so many people active in the forum, I mean those who are not qualified and that are well-qualified for what you described and it has been fun and progressive for the forum. And about the activities of the people here, there's no compulsion to which time anybody should use on the forum, just do your bit as you like and that's it. The most active people here are those who are in campaigns, except a few, and it's practical that some will be very active and others will be less active just like in any other fora.",

A new member can easily rank up on this forum if he/she is willing to contribute good stuff to the forum and help the forum and its members in one way or other. I would say that if you want to rank up then you will have to contribute good stuff to the forum and you will see yourself that you account will grow in rank over time. The more good stuff you can contribute the easier it will be for you to get attention from the other users who always help those users which put a lot of effort to help the forum by contributing good stuff to the forum.The old members on those high ranks have put a lot of effort in contributing good stuff on this forum. Some of them might get busy sometimes and that's why they might not get enough time to spend on this forum but you can't ignore their contribution they have given to the forum.
