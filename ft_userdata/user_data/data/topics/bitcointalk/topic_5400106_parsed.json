I'm looking to buy as much Rinkenby ETH as possible Pls DM offers - happy to do escrow for large amounts. Isn’t this free? I’ll sell you some. PM me if you’re serious. Last time I checked you could still get this ETH for free so unless something has changed that I’m unaware of, that’s probably still the best way to get your hands on some. If you’re buying though, I’m selling.",
