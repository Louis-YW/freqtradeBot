  "content": "I had the idea of making a easy to use Bitcoin multisig wallet with timelocked recovery key for a long time, and thanks to the recent development of miniscript in Bitcoin community, I'm able to produce a solution and product that allows the general public to use these advanced features in a very convenient way.TechnologyThe underline miniscript of the solution is discussed in another topic https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441806.0Code:wsh(thresh(2,pk(OWNER),s:pk(MEMBERS),sj:and_v(v:pk(RECOVERY),n:older(12960))))The miniscript above produces a 2-of-3 multisig, with a 90 days timelock for the RECOVERY key.For any UTXO created within 90 days, both the OWNER and MEMBERS key must sign the transaction to spend the coins. But after 90 days, the RECOVERY key can step in to work together with either the OWNER or MEMBERS key to spend the coins.ProductBased on the miniscript technology above, we created a product, Mixin Safe, to make all those steps convenient for Bitcoin holders.Whenever a new Mixin Safe is created, the Bitcoin holder needs to provide the OWNER public key. To do this, a miniscript compatible wallet is required, we have tested Bitcoin Core and Ledger, and noticed upcoming miniscript support announcements from other hardware vendors, e.g.Coldcard https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/pull/227BitBox02 https://twitter.com/_benma_/status/1670022585461907456SeedSigner https://twitter.com/pythcoiner/status/1670458117983805442Then the Bitcoin holder needs to use our another product Mixin Messenger to produce a MPC public key as the MEMBERS key. Although it's possible to generate this MEMBERS key only by yourself, we recommend to choose at least two Mixin Messenger devices, better with your partner, so the MPC key is generated as a 1-of-2 threshold ECDSA key.Mixin Messenger is an open source MPC wallet for 6 years https://github.com/MixinNetwork/android-app, and the MPC code we used is from https://github.com/taurusgroup/multi-party-sigFinally, we the Mixin Safe service maintainer holds the RECOVERY key for emergency recovery usage once the OWNER key is lost.SecurityThe solution is based on Bitcoin multisig script with timelock, and the recovery key timelock can be adjusted when the wallet is created. The OWNER key is managed by third party and popular bitcoin wallets,  can have a normal backup solution, and no need to worry about it's stolen or lost. Because nobody will be able to spend the coins with this only OWNER key, and the coins can be recovered even if the OWNER key is completely lost.The MEMBERS key is managed by open source MPC solution. If MEMBERS key is managed by a few people in 1-of-2 or 3-of-5 or even 5-of-10, it's almost impossible to lose the MEMBERS key.Try It!Now the product is generally available, it's a website which is designed to have intuitive interface to use.https://safe.mixin.one/Thank you, and welcome suggestions.",

I know the Mixin name makes it sound like a mixer, but It's just a wallet. To start using the product, you need Mixin Messenger, which is an MPC wallet,  to make the Mixin Safe account.

The wallet is provided as a website to make it easy to access from anywhere, but the website doesn't hold the private keys, it's just an interface to make it easy to do multisig.It's some kind of custodian services those companies will use, but it's built with general public in mind, the website interface is pretty easy to use, and pricing is transparent and cheap.For security, it's better to read the post instead of the website, the website is under development and missing some points. So Mixin Safe is a multisig wallet with three keys, OWNER, MEMBERS and RECOVERY. The OWNER key is managed by user's own hardware wallet, Ledger, BitBox02, etc.The MEMBERS key is also managed by user's wallets, the Mixin Messenger MPC wallet. The MEMBERS key can be managed by the user own or friends, make it difficult to lose.And the recovery key is timelocked, and can only be used when timelock expired and must be used together with OWNER or MEMBERS key.When I say this is more secure than a single hardware wallet, I mean hardware wallet is secure, but a single hardware wallet is easy to lose or broke, Mixin Safe uses hardware wallet, and try to eliminate single point of failure.",

Mixin Safe is designed mainly for those people prefer convenience than understanding the tech stuff behind the scenes, but in a decentralized and secure way.And for the phone number thing, it's the same, phone number is just a phone number, we share nothing, we never do ads or analyze data.

Clear me if i am wrong  Hi, it's not like that we have your key.The wallet is 2-of-3 multisig, which means the wallet is controlled by 3 keys, owner, members and recovery. You have owner and members key. We have the recovery key, and the recovery key is timelocked by Bitcoin script, so that our key can only be used after your Bitcoin address is inactive for over 1 year.So if you possess your owner and members key, our recovery key will be useless. And just in case you lost your owner key or members key, our recovery key can be used, and it can only be used together with owner or members key.  That means, if you lost both owner and members key, then our recovery key is useless as well. Because the 2-of-3 wallet  can only be accessed by 2 keys together.Quote from: UmerIdrees on July 15, 2023, 06:41:17 AMMy other question is this wallet an open source or a closed source?All our code are open source here https://github.com/MixinNetwork",

I'm not saying the product is perfect for anyone. Mixin Safe can be a much better solution for people who want a easy to use and decentralized solution to manage their coins, instead of using CEX.And Mixin Safe is designed to be used by family or team members together, it's important to make it convenient and obvious to understand. The goal is to make BTC accessible to everyone in the world, so everyone is confident about their BTC holdings without worrying about losing their coins.People are already using centralized banks, with all their personal information shared with the banks. Now Mixin Safe can be a decentralized bank, in a very similar approach but with BTC as the money. Mixin Safe can be a better bank for those who are already banked, and Mixin Safe is also a better alternative to CEX for those who choose CEX over walletsQuote from: dkbit98 on July 16, 2023, 11:20:36 PMI tried using anonymous number and it didn't work with Mixin.Anonymous number needs to be bought and connected to a private key at first, and are only for some invited testers for now.

Choosing bitcointalk + Royse services is a great decision to determine how much the service is efecient.",
