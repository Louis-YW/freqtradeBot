The most important matches are, of course, the matches of Beşiktaş and Galatasaray. Both teams drew easy as they were in first seed.Beşiktaş's opponent will be Serik Belediyespor, and Galatasaray's Ofspor. We watch matches where both big teams will score a lot of goals against their opponents.Teams will take the match seriously as this round is played on a single-match elimination system. They should not allow a surprise.I'll leave the 4th round draw below. You can look from here:",

I don't think there will be too many surprises from the pairings. Galatasaray had scored 7 goals in the last match. In fact, cup matches are good for Galatasaray because Okan has still not been able to create an effective formation. There are loss of points in league matches, and the expectation was high when this squad was formed. Galatasaray may be my favorite for the cup because I think the team will find itself somehow, Okan Buruk is working hard too. Since the matches in the 4th round will have too many goals, we will be full of football.",

However Galatasaray attackers had a very unproductive game for sure. Especially Gomis wasted so many goal opportunities. I even watched him wasting 100% goal chances. If they played this game against a more capable team with this lineup choice then I think they would have been eliminated by their opponent most probably. I know that Gomis didn't have match fitness as Icardi is in the starting eleven from now on. But he shouldn't be this bad still.",

It could be a fun match.You are right Basaksehir vs. Goztepe is scheduled to play today, I'm pretty sure today's Turkish football tournament will be won by Goztepe, I have watched several times in Goztepe's meeting with Basaksehir, I have no doubts for Goztepe club.",

Stefano Okaka finally started scoring again. Başakşehir is slowly returning to its old form. They also give good signals for the league.",

Kasımpaşa didn't play badly but I can say that they were the unlucky ones. The most barren match of the day was the match between antalyaspor and Manisa. I expected more goals.

They couldn't achieve the performance they wanted. It is not difficult to guess that they went through a mental preparation period during the break due to the World Cup. Today we will see how they evaluate the preparation period. So it will be an important match. By looking at this match, we will form an idea about the Fenerbahçe derby they will play next week.Samsunspor are in second place in TFF 1st League. This is a sub league of the Turkish Super League. Samsunspor played successful matches in this league and they are in the second place in the league. But their opponents tonight are a tough one for their level. They won't have a lot of chances in this match. And if they concede an early goal, they may lose the match by a different score.The odds on Trabzonspor's win are remarkable. I'm going to take a little risk for this game. Trabzonspor under the management of Abdullah Avci will win this match. And I think they will bring a positive atmosphere to the league by gaining morale from this match.",

I hear his name for the first time in my life. I wonder if Beşiktaş will be able to change the result in the second half. Şenol Güneş has already made two substitutions very early. If Şanlıurfa can maintain this score, it is a great success. But I think Beşiktaş will attack as a whole in the second half, they will equalize the score or they will take the lead.",

It is ridiculous for a team like Giresunspor to say goodbye to the cup by conceding 5 goals to a 2nd league team. I don't see many unexpected results in the other matches. In the Black Sea derby, of course trabzonspor was the winning side. On the other hand, after being 2-0 down in the first half, Beşiktaş turned the game around in the second half and won 4-2.",

      "body": "First half was disaster for Beşiktaş but second half was very different. It looks like backup players don't have any intention to show themselves. I don't think Emrecan Uzunhan will get any playing time this season. Putting Necip Uysal to stopper position was a big mistake but managers don't hesitate to repeat same mistakes over and over again. Dele Alli don't have football in his mind at all. Kevin N'Koudou changed the game with his extra performance. Great assist and a goal, he and Gedson showed that they are starting players without any questions. Cenk Tosun still has his finishing, that was nice to see. Wout Weghorst also scored after World Cup, he's ambitious. It will be a great addition to attack. There is no problem in offense for starting players. Bench still looks weak though. Overall I like Beşiktaş in second half and it gave some light to league but bench players are big problem and they will affect Beşiktaş in the long run because of rotations. Şenol Güneş don't say anyhing about transfers but I'm sure after today's game he has some plans in his mind. This squad is not enough for the league, Beşiktaş shouldn't give up on this cup either.",
