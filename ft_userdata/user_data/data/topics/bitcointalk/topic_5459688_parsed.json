You are using the perceived rarity of the satoshis to value them, so what do images associated with them have to do with it?The way I see it, first bitmaps are a NFT limited to around 800k supply as of now. Compare that with the supply of bitcoin + the cap of all the metaverse projects out there and you see the potential. It is possible that the floor price for bitmaps will reach a high value. Also a bitmap with the number 999999 will have a higher value then a common number like 718291, so yes I think they can be valued by the rarity of their numbers. The points I listed in the main post are the ones I found that people are using, if you analyze the market data you see there is a tendency for rare numbers to be traded at a higher price.",

Ethereum was ICO too, there is plenty of value there. You have your mind stuck in 2009/2010? Open your mind, even tho ordinals seems to be a stupid concept, finally the market decides what has value or not, you shouldn’t be that arrogant to call everything except bitcoin a zero value thing.Even tho bitmaps aren’t unique (you can mint the same text over and over again), but the market organized itself to count only the first mints as the valid ones, floor price of bitmaps went up more than 500% in the past weeks. Obviously there is value here even tho it looks technically stupid.You look like those old men that don’t tolerate young kids with smartphones, just because in their time they used playing with rocks or something. Actually smartphones are the greatest invention of all time, you have access to all the knowledge in the world whenever you want and immediately.Perhaps in the future when the metaverse becomes a real thing, those who were getting bitmaps at this time will the super rich of the future, same as those who bought bitcoin/ethereum years ago, who knows",
