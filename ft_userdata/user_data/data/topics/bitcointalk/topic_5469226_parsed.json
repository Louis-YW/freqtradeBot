If many lawmakers grilled GEnsler the other day on the hearing, this time there is support from this new speaker. I guess they may be able to grill Gensler on the Senate, if they also do a hearing on the Senate. Can they fire Gensler thru senate? I think this is what they need for Spot ETF to go through.",

The Speaker of the House is not a dictator. Policies must pass through the legislative process and in most cases go through a vote. So a crypto-friendly interim speaker will make little or no impact in his quest to push favourable polices.  If he tries to be too powerful he would face the same thing that Kevin McCarthy faced. This interim position will not last long so I am expecting nothing from this post occupied by Patrick McHenry. There are also indications that the interim speaker might be removed from the House Financial Services Committee which might not be good to the crypto sector. Being the chairman of this powerful committee gave McHenry the best platform to introduce and pursue pro-crypto bills.

I think this is what they need for Spot ETF to go through.The head of the SEC is an appointee of the President and confirmed by the Senate. The President is the person who has the right to sack the SEC chairman under some circumstances. The Senate can only recommend a sack to the president because they lack the power to do so. But the sack process can be very complicated.",

Besides he's a house speaker, so I don't think there is going to be a huge changes with laws on crypto. Another factor is that 1 vs 99 is a hard discussion, given just as an example. It is politics, there is a lot of influence around, money works well on this ground. But I like the optimism, well this is a good news to have a voice in an old house however I might not take is a big win.",

But then, let's give him time for how he's going to serve while being in that position because maybe from there he'll fix somethings that's getting wrapped up with the SEC.With or without politicians like him, the halving will still occur and Bitcoin's effect through that will still be seen.",

And with the next election just around the corner, for sure this will be a hotly contested topic on crypto and who will be pro or anti and whoever wins can stick to their initial agenda.",
