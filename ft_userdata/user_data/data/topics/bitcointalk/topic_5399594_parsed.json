A form of participation was also provided on the tweet in order to increase worldwide engagement.For the love of Bitcoin, I believed this event would be useful in persuading more people to use Bitcoin and understand its value and significance.Proper information about this amazing event is provided in the tweet link below: https://twitter.com/bootcamp_crypto/status/1521821563934449664",

      "body": "I like bitcoin a lot. It looks like Bitcoin will return to its original position. But in the current market situation, the situation of Bitcoin is much worse. Since the demand for Bitcoin is increasing day by day and good news is coming about Bitcoin, I would say that the price of Bitcoin will increase a lot this year as compared to last year. But Bitcoin may take time to recover. I hope Bitcoin will reach its peak this year. More to come After Bitcoin Pizza Day, we will be able to see Bitcoin in a new way.",
