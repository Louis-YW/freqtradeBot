But only SBF go to jail while Elon wouldn’t stop making more noise to distract attention. Why is the double standard? The laws are made to protect the born rich billionaires? What’s the dark magic that Elon pulling to fool the entire legal system? Is it the money that’s empowering him and even to above the laws?For quick brief, Elon sell Tesla share to fund his twitter acquisition. There is buyer who bought all his share, that buyer is the taxpayer, taxpayer pay the price of the Twitter acquisition. So you wonder how would taxpayer pay the price when nobody is paying taxes? Look at the grocery items you buy on the market, toilet paper food meat vegetable pizza..., the price increased more than twice in two years that’s exactly how you pay the price as a taxpayer to fund the filthy rich and to even break the laws.",

      "body": "I don't understand why you are comparing SBF and Elon together, in my opinion, both are completely different.SBF has been prosecuted and will soon go to jail for what he did, he took money from users, and investors, used it for his work. And more than that, this was planned in advance and is a conspiracy to take money from customers.Elon, it's true that he manipulated stocks for his own gain, others would call it dirty, but for the law, he didn't break the law. I'm not his fan, but what he does can be said to be dishonest in business, but he has never crossed the line of the law, and that is the difference between him and SBF.",

But when we did what Elon did we are not going to jail? Because Elon didn’t take money from someone else. Interesting!",

Secondly, correct me if i am wrong but i don't think it's against the law to sell your shares. Lying about that how your company is solvent however is.And elon has been charged for securities fraud and stock price manipulation. He is just so fucking rich that until they will give him serious record breaking fees as a consequence for his actions, he will keep doing what ever he pleases.",

Elon Musk is simply selling his own shares that is known to the public. Elon doesn’t violate the law because he sell his own asset while SBF sell there customers money on exchange.SBF has a lot of mismanagement on users fund that result to loses. SBF deserves jail time while Elon deserves the fruit of his labor by founding his companies from scratch.",

If you have them, the public prosecution will fear you to the point of accepting any ridiculous deal to avoid spending tons of public money that may go to waste. If the case is clear and your funds are blocked, the system will roll over your ass without any problem.Sarcasm apart, the case is very clear and there has to be an exemplary public punishment to it.",

      "body": "Elon Musk's case is quite different from Sam Bankman-Fried issue. One cannot certainly prove that Musk's had the intention of defrauding his shareholders. But SBF intentionally withdrew customers funds and used it for his personal business. Stock manipulation is criminal but until a competent court rules that Elon Musk is guilty of such crime, he remains innocent. But SBF case is a clear fraud because even former top management of FTX are revealing how the firm engaged in diverse financial recklessness and from all indications there are many evidence to indict SBF of fraud. It is also important to note that SBF was also a billionaire and has many powerful political connections. Hence, jailing him is a win for the commoner that have lost thier funds due to his imprudence.",

SBF probably couldn’t return the money that’s taken, since the jury has demand reimbursement but SBF refuse to refund. Btw Elon might have all the money to repay if the jury has demanded it, that’s the difference, after commit crime but have no money to return= goes to jail, after commit crime but have the money to return= legal. That can be related to grocery robbery, the robber took the item from grocery, and the robber consume the goods and have no means to return it once got caught and charge with fraud.",

Interesting!It is true that in the financial market we are taking money from each other, the market does not create money but money from the hands of the weak to the hands of the strong. If SBF doesn't take our money, we will take his money sooner or later. You are right. But if he is smart enough like CZ or Elon to make money by manipulating, then no law can put him in jail, if he is smart enough to circumvent the law. But what he is doing is ridiculous, he openly disregards the law, and they will never forgive anyone who looks down on them. With the government, we couldn't resist but found a way around to live. Elon is succeeding with that formula.",

And the strong is the rich one, the weak is the poor one.You have a point to a degree but my quote to you is \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink\". I'll say this as others have to you Elon plays both sides of the political aisle. His ass was kissed royally when he had his Tesla plants in California and made promises he couldn't hold to them. Now he is playing the right side of the aisle as kissing the ring of the left hasn't gotten him anywhere so now he \"appears\" to appeal to the political right. He has always been outspoken to a degree but I'd say he is setting himself to be the next Donald Trump and the best that can be hoped for if he ever became president is 3 good year then a good backstabbing at the end that pushes the USA towards what the Leftist NWO/Neo-con war thirsty right to be in pleasureful agreement.As for how you compare him to SBF I see your argument but because people can sell their stock or sell their doge coin at anytime it is on them and their bad trades in terms of how Musk has played the markets. Whereas with the case of SBF your funds as held indefinitely by lawyers. Given the choice between what position to be stuck in I'd rather be in a loss position with a bad Musk bet (DOGE/Tesla stock ATH buy) than have my funds on SBF's FTX because I still might have the time to recoup funds from said losses due to inflation (although still would be in loss due to it). To give you perspective, I had a small amount of funds on Cryptopia and have still yet to be recouped from them and they've been closed for ages in litigations further sucking more funds away from investors (I'd say the lawyers won with SBF more than anyone). I will end with this don't put your faith in actors given power by the media (social, mainstream tv, etc) because they will burn you no matter what. Use caution with anyone and you'll end up ok or on top. That is what I hate in this world. So many bad actors and that is what hold crypto back from what it is meant to be and that is an escape from the fiat dollars, etc. that continually become worth less by the day.

What does Bill Gates have to do with this? To my knowledge Bill Gates hasn't been charged with anything jail worthy and divorce with Melinda happened because their marriage wasn't healthy. Which is a common cause for divorces. And since it's Bill Gates is a dream target for conspiracies i feel i need specifically to ask links for reliable sources.

However, he is under trial and reportedly pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. Q",
