For altcoin yes. To many good coins to trade since market is going into good position so best to have altcoins and trade it since by this time we may got huge potential to gain. After the effect of bull run for sure all of it will be dump knowing many want to secure their profits. Only bitcoin is the best coin to hold since bitcoin has a big potential to reach a new ATH especially when halving takes effect and hype is starting to build up.",

If you already own altcoins, at the next altcoin bull run you should sell and not hold them for too long. Depending on how \"recent\" the altcoin is, because very old altcoins that have been here for years like Litecoin/Ethereum/DOGE you can sell a part and try to buy back at next bear run - while shitcoin recently launched should be dumped as early as possible on the next rise.But I dont get why you are saying that next year would be a bull run, we cannot predict those and we can only hope.",

Go and take a vacation somewhere else using those profits. You can comeback when the market becomes bearish then slowly start accumulating again.

But you can also try to trade altcoins but be careful because many altcoins are still trying to survive before the bull season comes. That can get you in trouble, especially if you lack the skills to analyze the coin.We also don't know which altcoins will get the pump and can only guess. And most of us are wrong in guessing the coins because each coin has the same opportunity to increase high. So if you can't analyze well, you shouldn't trade but just buy and hold, especially holding Bitcoin.",

Trade if you have knowledge about it but if none, better to do DCA with the best altcoins.There's no assurance for the Bull market this year but we are slowly getting there, so preparing right now might be a good idea.The market are still cheap, there's a lot of time for you to accumulate, have a good holdings first before you do trading because the risk are high in trading and it requires a lot of analysis and research.",

Balance is key during a bull run. While holding can be a safer long-term strategy, trading altcoins can offer opportunities for increased gains. However, it's important to be cautious and informed when trading, as it carries higher risks. Consider your risk tolerance and invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversifying your approach could be a wise choice.",

Your call but if I'm happy, I don't mind taking the shortcut route of taking instant profits. Because I'll never know when the better days are going to be back again. If you've been in this market, you're aware of what I'm saying and have been familiar with the volatility. Choose what you think is effective for you. Because what's effective on me might not be good for you.",

First mistake you made was basically saying next year there is a guaranteed bull run.  Second is trying to hit a moving target with trading.  If you are new to trading, it's almost more difficult trading in a bull market market because of the opportunity loss by trading at the wrong times.",

Honestly, the bull season is a great time for trading because this time, the market is so active, heavy buy and sell seems to be one reason why we earn a profit in trading. But for me as a long-term holder, I still choose to hold until the ATH comes and sells them. It really depends on us because if you are a full-time trader, your mindset is to keep on trading but if you are just a holder, what you think also is to hold and sell in the perfect time. Decision come out base of what is your desires and wants in life.",

I always reap my rewards but I also always retain a portion of my portfolio its not always selling everything in the bull run because you really can't tell high it would go just as we never know the floor price in the bear period, the worse thing that you happen is missing your profit like when it hit an all-time high and you prefer not to sell, then you wake up and you found out that you lose up to 10% of your potential profit because you are holding up that the price will go further, but we really have no idea on how high it would get.I have experienced this and its one of my biggest regret so, just reap the profit when you realize it and sell more on the next pump, just keep monitoring the price in the bull trend.",

You sound very certain that there will be a bullrun next year. I am not so sure about that. Not because i have a different opinion, simply because i think the crypto market is basically impossible to predict. Yes the BTC halving is coming and this usually always had pumping prices as a consequence but this does not necessarily mean that this will happen again next time also.I think daytrading during a full on bull run does not make a lot of sense because if every project is pumping like crazy you can not really make a lot of profit by buying and selling them. Of course there will be corrections and falling prices too during a bull run but those are hard to hit i think. I just hodl and when my portfolio has a value that is lifechanging to me i sell. If that ever happens.",

I wouldn't assume just yet that the bullrun is for the next year. And even if we were basing it off the halving, it's usually after half a year to a year of the event itself no?Anyway assuming you'd participate in the next bullrun, whenever that is, I'd actively trade altcoins yea. The market is really active so you're going to see a lot of buys and sells. If you can manage, then you should be able to make some profit.",
