  "content": "Hi,I have installed CLN on my (RPI) node as it seemed to have a better performance and to have some neat features vs LND, but I seem to be constantly hitting road blocks with it, starting with being only limited to Zeus and the defunct Zap as  mobile wallets. RTL works well with it, but there is no support for ThunderHub, which seems to be better, and no access to Loop. My understanding of the issue is that CLN and LND are only compatible on the Lightning side and do not share a common RPC API for the client side, and many projects and services are developed by the LND team. So without Loop, how do users of CLN rebalance channels? I will be mostly receiving sats with my LN node... I am trying to see if I should keep trying to stick with CLN or give up and switch to LND before I start putting this into \"production\".Thanks!",

It uses passive cooling through a case that is basically a big aluminum heat sink in thermal contact with all the heat-generating chips. I have never seen CPU temp above 45C I think. I looked many times today and the highest I saw was 42C. I can give a try with vcgencmd.",

You should not be using that much CPU for either of them.Stupid as it may be, can you reboot and see if it clears up. Could be something else hung, but that is a guess.If you look at 1ml.com do you see the channel open?I'm exhausted, but I'm sure someone else can chime in with other ideas.-DaveCode:top - 00:31:48 up 11 min,  6 users,  load average: 1.04, 0.68, 0.48Tasks: 175 total,   1 running, 174 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie%Cpu(s): 29.0 us, 12.4 sy,  0.0 ni, 57.1 id,  0.9 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.7 si,  0.0 stMiB Mem :   7862.9 total,     87.0 free,   1717.7 used,   6058.2 buff/cacheMiB Swap:   7872.0 total,   7872.0 free,      0.0 used.   6020.7 avail Mem     PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND                                                                                                                                        1633 cln       20   0   71608  69236   5460 S  49.0   0.9   0:22.59 lightningd                                                                                                                                     1671 cln       20   0   20196  18856   3232 S  34.4   0.2   0:13.67 lightning_gossi                                                                                                                                 747 bitcoin   20   0 3342684 633720 230944 S  13.2   7.9   1:36.80 bitcoind                                                                                                                                        712 debian-+  20   0   53320  49208  18376 S  10.6   0.6   0:41.84 torThanks. This is strange, CPU usage was normal for about 5 minutes after the reboot, then it started again. Initially lightning_gossipd uses some CPU as well, then it goes away and lightningd becomes the main consumer.Yes I see my channel as active on 1ml.com                    So when I look at the debugging information, I see thousands of lines like theseCode:Updated pending announce with update 759871x572x1/0Received channel_announcement for channel 759871x1337x0and lots of lines like these as wellCode:Bad gossip order: WIRE_CHANNEL_UPDATE before announcement 766980x708x1/1Bad gossip order: WIRE_CHANNEL_UPDATE before announcement 765702x318x0/0",

It is supposed to calm down...At least for the CLN part, I'm not sure why core is using anything. Mine only has activity when blocks are found and even then not much.How are you powering the RPi? I have seen some 5V adapters cause issues. This is one of my favorites.... 5% over voltage with no load, add a load and I can get it to 5.5V / 10% over voltage, then bad thingstm happen.-Dave",
