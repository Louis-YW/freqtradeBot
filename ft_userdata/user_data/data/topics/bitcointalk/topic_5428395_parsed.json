  "content": "Hi,I have installed CLN on my (RPI) node as it seemed to have a better performance and to have some neat features vs LND, but I seem to be constantly hitting road blocks with it, starting with being only limited to Zeus and the defunct Zap asÂ  mobile wallets. RTL works well with it, but there is no support for ThunderHub, which seems to be better, and no access to Loop. My understanding of the issue is that CLN and LND are only compatible on the Lightning side and do not share a common RPC API for the client side, and many projects and services are developed by the LND team. So without Loop, how do users of CLN rebalance channels? I will be mostly receiving sats with my LN node... I am trying to see if I should keep trying to stick with CLN or give up and switch to LND before I start putting this into \"production\".Thanks!",

I opened a single (public) channel on CLN using RTL. It has been using 40%+ of the RPI's CPU and bugging down the SSD for over 1 hour. I am not sure what it could be doing given that there can't be anything going on in this channel since my node is not connected to any other channel and I am not doing any transaction?

It uses passive cooling through a case that is basically a big aluminum heat sink in thermal contact with all the heat-generating chips. I have never seen CPU temp above 45C I think. I looked many times today and the highest I saw was 42C. I can give a try with vcgencmd.",

My understanding though is that for what I describe, I need a swap and not a rebalancing between LN channels?Right, the method I describe is only for balancing between LN channels. To balance channels by moving coins on- and off-chain, similar to Loop's service, you'll need a swap.",

I have seen some 5V adapters cause issues. This is one of my favorites.... 5% over voltage with no load, add a load and I can get it to 5.5V / 10% over voltage, then bad thingstm happen.-Dave",
