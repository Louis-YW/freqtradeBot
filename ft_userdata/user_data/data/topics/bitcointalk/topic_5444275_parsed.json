Did you have multiple account or do you create account after you disconnected and can’t access your original account. Providing chat logs screenshot as proof will helpful to easily overview your case. You can use imgur to upload screenshot.",

As I can see the wintomoto official account has already Negative tagged by one of the reputed members. After that, they still did not come to solve the issue and they are now inactive since February 27, 2023, 04:19:10 PM, So the chance is very lower to get resolved the issue. Some text for you, It's sure that you have searched about first deposit bonus sites, next time make sure you have also searched about the reputation of the site before creating or making a deposit.",

I provide it. They canceled the withdrawal and asked you for a selfie so they could review your account and match the selfie with your KYC, and discover multiple accounts; then, they decided to cancel your bonuses and disable the account. If you have already created a multi-account to obtain deposit bonuses, then you have already violated the bonus policy of their platform, so why do you want them to give you back the bonus that you got illegally? What I have seen of the topics issues accusing scams against the WINTOMATO platform here is that they have been resolved; in addition to that, WINTOMATO has good ratings on many review sites with a lot of positive feedback, but the terms and rules of their platform, whoever violates them should not blame them, I hope they come here to explain more about your issue, Hoping that they will return your deposit to you, but the bonus I don't think you deserve, because you didn't provide any evidence that you didn't actually violate their policy.",

Someone won and should be paid the full amount and of course a \"deal\" was reached in private. Why does a \"deal\" need to be made?

Quite unfortunate for wintomato that I happened to watch that case closely, so I was aware of one certain missing post. Well... we know there are several platforms that works alongside this forum to archive everything, so... anyone curious can see what's the post was, we know which site(s) to visit.I am inviting and notifying them about this accusation through telegram as their last onli date was back in the late of February.",
