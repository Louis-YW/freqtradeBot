However bitcoin has not yet received much support from governments around the world instead it has been met with resistance from governments.",

There are certain regions in different countries where banking services don't cover due to several reasons. Regions like these are areas that look abandoned or undeveloped, also limiting access to the broader internet connectivity.I solely agree that Bitcoin can be of great importance in such regions, but the entire Bitcoin community has always advised that proper knowledge and research should be carried out before anyone can make any use of it. In other words, those without ideas can't just wake up and start making transactions from a wallet without having proper knowledge.What I think is that the inability to read and understand how Bitcoin works might be a limiting factor in such regions, especially regions where access to education is quite difficult.Your idea is quite okay and might work for some regions, but due to digital illiteracy and the inability to read, we might also be experiencing some problems in these areas.",

Miners select transactions with highest fees so if you want your transaction to be confirmed faster you have to pay a higher fee. It’s what I am most concerned about to be honest.Many people do not want to use banks because of their killer fees. Banks are too expensive to hold your money in and your money will just lose value anyway. So people tend to lean towards crypto but now its fees aren’t that far off from banking fees. It’s such a headache to make transactions nowadays and we really need to solve this concern.",

However, in the case of Bitcoin, if it were globally alerted and used by everyone, the network would become either slow and with very high fees, or concentrated such that most transactions would be carried out outside the country. The network, and even with solutions like the Lightning Network, the use of Bitcoin by 10% of the world's population still represents a large number of transactions for a decentralized network.Bitcoin can help in many aspects but global awareness is still in the early stages.",

But I'm pretty sure that country's economy will soon collapse if they use bitcoin as the sole currency in their country. Simply because of the volatility of bitcoin, have you ever thought of a scenario where bitcoin price drops more than 70% against USD like during the 2022 bear season, and how will that country's government face that? Don't be so naive as to believe that just because bitcoin has a limited supply and simply adopting it will easily solve a country's inflation. If applied to individuals and organizations, it will be very effective, but with the macro economy, I don't think it will be effective.",

So that number here will definitely continue to rise for the foreseeable future lol. Seeing that the FDIC is posting this and documenting it online shows that they definitely will have an eye out for future regulations as this becomes even more prevalent over the years, which it of course will.  I think a lot of these main pointers are still only just begging to evolve, like the businesses who accept BTC as payment- I fully believe that there will be like complete bitcoin mastercards and visas soon that complete transactions using existing framework, but that is just a hypothesis.

Weighing the level of unbanked citizens in the US, it can be said that 10 million house holds (7.7 percent) are affected. It can be inferred that the neither have a checking or saving account. This is the first time I have read about the unbanked population in a developed nation like the US. Before now I assumed that this set of people can be found only in third world countries. Current research in 2021 by the US Federal Reserve indicated that 13% of adults are underbanked as of 2021, meaning they have a bank account but regularly use alternative financial services, and 5% which is about 13 million people are unbanked meaning they have no bank account at all. According to the research, the major reasons for this is because of financial problems, disability, and illiteracy.If the main reason why these people in the US are unbanked is a lack of financial support and illiteracy, I don't see Bitcoin helping them much. The periodic hike in transaction fees is a big impediment to adopting it for daily transactions. Anyone who cannot read and understand might not benefit much from Bitcoin. However, adopting Bitcoin will help people living with disabilities since they are not expected to visit any physical bank for them to use their wallets. However, people who are visually impaired are excluded from using Bitcoin since there are no provisions for them in wallet development.[/list]",

Bitcoin has potential, can become a valuable asset like gold, but if I say it becomes a tool to replace the role of banks , I really doubt it .
