  "content": "Hi DereI have invested in a company and when I tried to make 600$ withdrawal my address saved at company profile was incomplete. Incomplete means the last digit is missing on the address and the withdrawal was pending for a long time but when I contacted to the company suport teamThey said they have paid the withdrawal and change the status from pending to complete.When I checked my account it dont show upon investigation I found that the last digit of address was missing at profile of my company withdrawals account.Now they say that for recovery of transaction I need to pay 120$ more as charge fee. And when I ask to provide transaction ID even it is a incomplete address they don't allow me that and said its a company policy.Now any one guide me what to do in this scenario?",

Your money should still be on your account. I dont get the 120$ fee just to recover something isnt loss. Its kinda sound like an extorsion.Whats the company name? Its probably an exchange.",

Yes it's first time2. I double check when pasted while setting up my account at company's profile3. Yes that is why i posted here as if transaction went to wrong address that's another issue but it went to incomplete address so it is possible that the transaction can be successful even its incomplete address.Yes may be i have been scammed",

The question is either the incomplete address transaction went successfull or not?Second thing which creates me doubt why they don't send me transaction ID and details so I can check on explorerAnd I don't have any guarantee as I don't have any withdrawal from the company.",
