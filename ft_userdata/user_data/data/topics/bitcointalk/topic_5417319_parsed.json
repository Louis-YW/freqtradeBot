The only possible scenario is if a government pressured a centralized service (like a shop accepting bitcoin payments in that government's jurisdiction) to refuse receiving payment from a certain address. But that still can't prevent the owner from spending their coins or moving them to a different address then making the payment.",

Don't be like those chain surveillance companies that think they have a right to dictate what is a \"dirty\" or \"clean\" transaction, don't be an arbiter of truth like they are striving to be, and don't force your moral principles on others, just be an honest bitcoiner who respects yourself and others' rights to privacy and freedom.",

Which address that you judge as a scammer btw? Even if you managed to do that I think it will only show as malicious on explorer (just like how Etherscan works for example). Some exchanges might block transactions coming from those \"malicious\" addresses if they use the same blacklist database but you can't do anything if they refuse to do it.",

Suspending their access to bitcoin, because, according to your jurisdiction, they shouldn't have it, doesn't mean the rest of us agree with such anti-freedom and anti-fungible mindset. Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible, and money ownership is censorship-resistant. Those are the rules; you either accept them, or leave the place.If you believe they're a criminal, you should report them to the police. It's highly unlikely to find them if they know what they're doing, but that's your best course. You can't suspend criminally-linked Bitcoin activity at the expense of innocent users.",

Why punish an innocent person?Do note that there is no way to tell whether the criminal just bounced coins between their own handful of wallets, or whether actual money transfers happened like in the scenario I described.But to prevent innocent users' coins to be frozen or confiscated, we need to accept each and every coin, even if we suspect it could originate from a crime and still be in possession of that person.
