  "content": "I have replied in this thread:Casino System 1100+ Slot games + 50 + Pragmatic gamesBut then I noticed that the thread is a duplicate of another one in the Digital Goods section.He's changed it a bit, I guess so it's not obvious that it's a duplicate, but it's the same thing. So, I thought I'd report it as a duplicate, and since I assume the thread will be trashed, I wanted to ask him the same question in the original thread. The thing is, I thought that if I do it before the thread is trashed, if it is finally trashed, I would also be breaking rule 12.I don't think it has much importance, but it's a curiosity that came to me. For the moment I will report the duplicate thread.",

Means, that you did not make duplicate posts in multiple boards instead you are making a post on a single thread which is also very old (means, if something is wrong then it should be deleted till now). Well, I checked your reply there and it was a basic question and I am really amazed to see that you are that much rule-obedient. I mean you even remember the rule number and know the rule too. It's not that I don't follow rules but I think you are being too careful here. The most that will happen is, that the board in which you posted, might get deleted along with your post, nothing more. If I am not wrong.",

As I understand it Poker Player wants to ask the same question they asked in the duplicate thread, in the main thread, and they think that making a replica of their reply in another thread (which has a duplicate) breaks rule 12.I understand that it looks odd to someone (like a campaign manager) reading their post history from their profile and seeing identical replies but to everyone else it is not an issue at all and will likely go unnoticed.They can delete the first reply or quote it as LoyceV suggested.- Jay -",

But, if you still want to report it then I'm sure that your report will be somewhat valid because even if the thread isn't exactly like the original one it still has the same information in it. I don't know why someone tries to have same thread in multiple boards, I think that could be for marketing purpose but that sounds really unprofessional.",

      "body": "Well, first of all, as expected the duplicate thread with my question in it has been deleted, so I am not facing the problem any more. Quote from: LoyceMobile on September 12, 2023, 03:30:06 PMWhen in doubt, just quote yourself and it's no longer a duplicate post. At least that's what I do.Interesting but I don't think it would be useful for this particular case. Quote from: Faisal2202 on September 12, 2023, 04:43:46 PMWell, I checked your reply there and it was a basic question and I am really amazed to see that you are that much rule-obedient. I mean you even remember the rule number and know the rule too. It's not that I don't follow rules but I think you are being too careful here. The most that will happen is, that the board in which you posted, might get deleted along with your post, nothing more. If I am not wrong. I think you have made a too exaggerated interpretation. I looked at the number of the rule, and I try to follow the rules, which I know are unofficial and there is some margin of interpretation, in what I am rule-obedient are those in which we all have clear that they are serious, that is, I do not plagiarize, for example.But let's see what I wanted to say. In the other thread I asked something like this:Quote from: Poker Player on September 13, 2023, 02:50:01 PMLet me see if I understand the system you are trying to sell. Is it a system to set up a casino or is it a system to make money in the casino?If in my next post I would have posted a reply in the original thread, just like that. Isn't that a duplicate post? I reported the other thread and hoped they would delete it, but maybe they wouldn't have, and here I think LoyceV's advice doesn't fit because the second post would look something like this.QuoteQuote from: Poker Player on September 13, 2023, 02:50:01 PMLet me see if I understand the system you are trying to sell. Is it a system to set up a casino or is it a system to make money in the casino?Let me see if I understand the system you are trying to sell. Is it a system to set up a casino or is it a system to make money in the casino?I guess to avoid duplication I could add at the beginning, \"As I said in the other thread, which I have reported and I hope it will be deleted...\"The thing is, as I say, I don't think it has much importance. It is not a situation in which people usually find themselves, and I think that the most that can happen to you is that they delete the duplicate post.I will leave the thread open a little more before locking it.",
