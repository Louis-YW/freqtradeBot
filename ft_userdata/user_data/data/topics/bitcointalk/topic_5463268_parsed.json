If we look at the information of the domain registrant through the Domainiq website, we will find his name is Elon Musk, and the information is all false. [1] It is worth noting that he has dozens of phishing domains, unlike the one you OP posted about. Source: https://www.domainiq.com/domain?usdpy.us#/domains[2] This means that this scammer has a lot of domains that enable him, after one of them breaks down, to continue deceiving people through the other domains, so everyone should be careful and that there is no airdrop for the PYUSD currency. Do not open any links on social media or in Google ads.",

I hope it gets the attention it needs and saves people from falling for the scam.Quote from: BABY SHOES on August 14, 2023, 04:15:42 PMPaypal launched PYUSD but never by giving any claim! or any kind of prize and giveaway.This is just the new way these scammers have been using to scam people who lack some form of cryptographic knowledge. As with any New trend on social media or trend regarding any big and popular company launching something new or any good news relating to crypto that creates a headline, they immediately create something similar to that in order to use the trend to get some victims to fall for their scam.This is the reason why users should be very careful with anything that seems to appear as free money, claim this and that, as they are always likely to be scams irrespective of who ever shared the information. Some form of background check should be done for security purposes.",

      "body": "Social media is even like an open field for those scammers and hackers with their phishing links. The reason is because there are millions of people from different parts of the world on these social media sites, and almost every day, most of these hackers get new victims, so that's why it will not stop. One thing that needs to be done to avoid becoming a victim is not to click those random links on social media and even some ads on some websites. Like PayPal, which you talked about, only some careless users would be victims of this. For people who have been using PayPal for a long time, they don't need to get the link from social media, it's better to download the application instead.",

Paypal has never had anything to do with Metamask or other wallets they only require an email and number to create an account, but scammers seem to have various ways to scam people including by connecting other crypto wallets.We must be careful on any social media and never be tempted by unreasonable giveaways.",

Whenever any big project launched crypto token then most of time they give airdrop to the user and for Recieving airdrop we have to connect wallet and this is the time when scammers used fake phising sites to target crypto users.I will add this fake site in my list too and in these two months more than twenty big scam/phising sites has been launched and more than 100 others small sites. The main source of promotion is twitter or telegram. I appreciate OP catching on time. We should never connect our main wallet with any new site, we have not bookmarked.",

It does not matter if you've bookmarked it or not, you should never connect your wallet to malicious websites. The best way to go about this is to look for their official social media/websites and verify them before visiting them. There is virtually no end to phishing websites. The best way to protect yourself from stuff like this is to be vigilant at all times. Don't rely on bookmarks too much since some attackers use DNS hijacking to scam visitors.",
