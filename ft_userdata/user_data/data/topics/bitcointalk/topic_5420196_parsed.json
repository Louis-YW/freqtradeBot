And they don't know until when an issue about them is going to pop just like what happened for FTX. While there's no issue yet, they're just leaving it there as if there's really no problem at all. But it's true that, you never hold your keys there if you allow them to keep it for you.",

I have a friend who is new into Crypto-currency and still lacking some knowledge, he knows about bitcoin and how he can buy coin on exchanges like binance but still don't understand the dangers of leaving his coin on the exchange. He has lots of coins on his Binance account not only I told him about the dangers.I think we can tell people about the dangers of leaving their coins on exchanges and by this we can help reduce such illiteracy.",

You don't own crypto if you have \"coins\" on an exchange, you have an IOU from a business that may or may not even be solvent.Honestly I am starting to believe this as well now. I fact I would say buying coins is not safe at all. First LUNA and now FTT, it really looks as if Cryptos are made of nothing but a bubble, a fictitious demand created on a dramatic idea which exists only in theory when it faces a slightest of practical challenge it just bursts. I feel one should only hold decentralised Cryptos only and not even touch the Cryptos where exposure of a single entity is more than 20-30%. I feel this is the only way to be safe in this market otherwise be ready to lose your hard earned money.",

And such people pay the price when the exchange collapses or go bankrupt.The right to one's own opinion is a universal one. No matter how a warning is spread, not everyone would heed it because nowadays people act very irrationally. Lack of understanding and occasionally placing too much trust in such exchanges, particularly those that have never experienced bankruptcy, are further factors contributing to people's strong attachment to retaining their money in an exchange.

Why, with so many examples of failures, do people continue to keep their money on these? You don't own crypto if you have \"coins\" on an exchange, you have an IOU from a business that may or may not even be solvent.It’s not so cut and dry. Keeping it at home or in some secret bank vault has its own risks, people can steal it(which they only need to copy the key you won’t even know until the coins are gone), it can burn down, your phone/private wallet can get hacked, cold storage access is severely limited which creates more risk if you need to keep getting the paper key every time etc… you can make backup and put it somewhere else, but that just opens up another point of exposure.It all depends on your situation, if you live alone in a concrete house where no one has access, then yes keep it yourself, but most of us aren’t in this situation.  Life is all about risk management, this is no different. Any exchanges outside of us regulation or foreign owned is a definite no, coinbase despite all the hate I think is pretty safe as they are us listed company and well regulated. Their risk management is also well defined. Can it still go down? Of course, is it likely to happen? Probably not.   Is it safer to keep your crypto there vs at your home safe? Only you can answer.",

After Binance announced it would buy back FTX, the market reacted positively but then they changed their mind and the market started to fall, everything happened within 24 hours. Everything happened so fast that investors did not have time to react. Once we have joined the market, the risk is always lurking for us, if we don't lose when investing, if we don't get hacked, our account will be locked by the exchange.
