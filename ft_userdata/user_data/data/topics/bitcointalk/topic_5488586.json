  "content": "History has shown us that Bitcoin's market price goes up after each halving. But this time's different. Especially when institutional investment companies are buying up most of the circulating supply. BTC reached a new ATH right before the anticipated halving event of April 2024. Prices are going up, and everybody's happy. But what if there's a big market correction once the hype ends? According to JP Morgan, Bitcoin could go down to the $40k range after the halving craze is over. So we'll be seeing the inverse effect of what used to happened before spot ETFs became a thing in the crypto industry. You can read all about it here: https://www.theblock.co/post/279833/jpmorgan-bitcoin-price-april-halvingWhat do you think of Bitcoin's current situation? Will it retain ATHs after the halving? Or will there be a massive bloodbath in market prices? Do you think the halving is already priced in? What would you do? Sell or keep \"hodling\"? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

It will surprise him and see how he failed in his analysis when bitcoin get to $100000. What I can say is that people should not listen to him because he is analyzing the market in a wrong way or for his personal reasons.",

In fact this time the market is moving much faster even before the halving event. JP Morgan will see that his sayings will all be wrong when Bitcoin reaches or crosses $80k value during the halving event. Everyone who wants Bitcoin will be lucky if Bitcoin drops back to $40k, they will accumulate a lot of it.",

The hype is real but you're right it's an understatement. Seeing the downturn as a buying opportunity aligns with a strategic approach since Bitcoin's resilience often means it bounces back even after a bear run. It's like a cycle and ride the highs, weather the lows and use the dips to accumulate more. It's not just hype because it's a chance to play the long game in a volatile market",

I think that what is certain is that we're going to experience a massive bull run, because the Bitcoin ETF has created more awareness for it, the adoption has increased significantly, so more investors are flooding in to invest and have an experience of the bull season's ROI. I feel that after halving we can experience some price fluctuations, pretty much what is happening now, but it won't dip to $45k, as estimated by JP Morgan, it won't affect price to reach the estimated $150k or above in the peak of bull run. So far I'm focusing on the peak of bull run, I'll keep hodling.",

So, from my perspective, if Bitcoin keeps increasing in price towards Halving, there's a chance we will get a correction post Halving Because, then the RSI must have gone way overbought because we already touched the 70% overbought area on daily timeframe, but if we eventually get a correction pre-Halving, then I kind of think we will head higher after Halving without the supposed pullback.",

As for me a price of bitcoin hitting anything close to $100k we will see a correction, because this is the price target I assumed many people have set out to take profits, either it is after halving (which is the most realistic thing now) or even before it",

Thank you. no one is certain on what the price would be after the halving and whatever you've seen out their is mere sentimental opinion that's just based on what they want out of the market. After seeing how bullish the current market is, it's not strange that you will find a lot of people waiting for another bearish season just so they can come into the market. Some might have sold and made some profit out of their previous investment and might be looking out for a perfect opportunity to buy at the best DIP. I guess that's the angle JP Morgan is coming from.",

It could either happen this year, or the following one. JP Morgan could've said those comments to buy more BTC at a discounted price. Who knows? No matter what happens in the future, you can rest assured it will never go to $0. If demand stays high after each halving, BTC will become much more valuable in the long run. It's the best-performing asset on Earth. Maybe it will go as far as \"toppling\" Gold's market cap?",
