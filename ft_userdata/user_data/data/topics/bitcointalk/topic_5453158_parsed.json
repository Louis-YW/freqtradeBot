  "content": "So, there is a guy in my current signature campaign who has been caught plagiarizing a couple of times.Quote from: icopress on May 15, 2023, 08:15:47 PMUnfortunately, I have to announce that ItsCrafty is leaving the campaign - without pay.The reason is a double case of plagiarism within one week (this was also reported to the moderator).You can see in the thread that the user has not been banned and is asking for forgiveness to see if icopress will accept him back.Quote from: ItsCrafty on May 15, 2023, 11:49:49 PMI think you are talking about posts i posted in my local board. Mostly i shared their local news and technology information. i change news to my own sample word. Although i deleted all my posts as i was not aware that it is also against the rule. I wish I am not fired from this compaign and wishing for one chance. I should be punished for cancelling one week salary because of not fulfilling compaign rules. ThanksSeeing this, I thought that it is likely that the couple of cases of plagiarism is just the tip of the iceberg and I took a look at his post history. What I see is that the account was created in 2017 by someone who is an English native speaker or with a very high level of English, who used to write in some specific boards, and, after a posting gap between 2018 and August 2021, there is a change in the boards where he posts and a change in the style of writing, being the first post this one:Quote from: ItsCrafty on August 26, 2021, 04:55:16 PM#PROOF OF REGISTRATIONForum Username: ItsCraftyForum Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1120903Telegram Username: @mhwensh321Participated Campaigns: SignatureMatic Wallet Address: 0x683B6cc7f9705c8c89aF027647DF0c97C9de46b3For me it is clear that one does not become a worse English speaker in a few years, if anything the opposite, you can see people on the forum whose posts years ago were written with poor English, but over time they have improved because they have learned more English or use tools like automatic translators, which today are very reliable.The account does not belong at the present to the person who created it. I ask for your opinion on the subject, especially those of you who have more experience in catching alts and with address analysis, before taking an aggressive approach or opting for a neutral tag.",

If the account was bought, it is a much smaller mistake compared to the plagiarism he was accused of. Proven plagiarism (which is not that difficult to prove) leads directly to a ban, the way in which the person who currently manages the account came to control it, is completely negligible.The absence of a complaint by the original owner does not mean that it did not happen. A large number of accounts are neglected or inactive and their owners probably don't even think about them. The only investigation that makes sense here is whether there are alt accounts connected to the person behind ItsCrafty, mostly for the reasons of mistrust you mentioned.",
