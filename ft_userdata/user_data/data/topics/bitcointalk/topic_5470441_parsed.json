  "content": "YouTube is very famous when people want to find out more information about crypto and it's always generating many clicks for YouTubers. But unfortunately, information quality is not very high for most videos because of hype and clickbait videos. It is very important for us to know YouTuber's hype video is not good advice. YouTubers want to create hype, not quality informationAn important point for each YouTuber is to generate clicks and views and followers. And to get clicks and views and followers, it is a strategy from many YouTubers to launch hype videos, where outrageous claims are made, such like: - Bitcoin will crash (soon)- Bitcoin will die (soon)- Bitcoin will make new all-time-high (soon)- Altcoin will overtake Bitcoin (soon)- Altcoin will die (soon)- …It is always similar strategy for YouTubers to create hype instead of presenting normal information. It is very dangerous because accurate information is not presented. Instead, reality is hyped and exaggerated. = information quality is suffering and sometimes very misleadingYouTubers spreading HATE and FEAR (FUD)It is also very efficient for YouTubers to spread hate and fear because it's also generating clicks and views. Many people will get worried and click such videos to find it out but all information is just unjustified FUD, resulting in damages. One reason is YouTuber’s greed to generate clicks and views and also a reason is for example, Russian propaganda. It is also possible, YouTubers are getting paid from Russia to spread hate and fear, as Russia has many loyal serfs on YouTube. For us, such YouTubers are very dangerous because it’s facilitating- Hate- FUD- weak hands and more sell pressure because people don’t trust to HODLIt is scientifically proven for hate and fear (FUD) to generate more clicks, so it is a common strategy for YouTubers to get more clicks and views. Be careful when you see hate and fear (FUD) on YouTube. YouTubers getting paid to advertise a project Very often, big YouTubers are getting paid from a project directly to present it in a positive way. Some projects pay YouTubers directly and hope to get more investors due to positive YouTube videos because many followers trust, what YouTubers are publishing even it makes not much sense at all. For a high payment by projects, many YouTubers will only mention positive facts and forget often to inform about risks and flaws of a project to get many followers to invest. Or it's about a shady exchange, where YouTubers will also get a profit if you sign up from a referral link. YouTubers are trying to distribute referral linksA significant amount of YouTube videos is made in hindsight to collect money by referral-links. For such YouTube videos we'll find a referral link mentioned somewhere which will lead us to to an official project site, where we can register to invest. Of course, a YouTuber who will mention such projects and mention his referral link, will get a reward if we click his link to join, register and invest, often a percentage of our amount invested. Of course, any YouTuber will be interested to make you join and invest a huge sum because of his profit. A famous hype channel was (or still is) Trevon James, who advertised heavily for a known scam, Bitconnect. ConclusionYouTuber's content is often of very low quality and only based on hype: It is very easy to detect, when we view some YouTube presentations, where it’s often clickbait: It is very clearly clickbait. For us, we should always know: YouTuber's hype video is not good advice. It is not well researched and low quality content.",

My personal experience is their primary motive is to attract people to buy their premium membership, which is full of shity signals etc etc. OP I would just say that most of them are comedians, Bitcoiners believe in \"Silence can be your loudest statement.\"",

Viewers are not stupid in choosing channels to search for information about crypto even if the title and thumbnail posted make them open the video.For example, I will skip 10 seconds by tapping twice quickly and doing it repeatedly to get what is being said. Rarely 10 seconds, often I skip 20 seconds.If what is being discussed is just nonsense, then without thinking, I immediately exit the channel.Instead of watching them yawn without content, I'd better watch other content that invites laughter.",

YouTube is only famous to naive or newbie cryptocurrency investors because most of the information shared on there is promo bases or just for monthly earning purposes of the YouTube channel owner. Besides, I don't know why anyone will totally trust the information shared by crypto influencers on YouTube when most of the advertised shows are literally scams.Quote from: bananaunana on October 15, 2023, 04:30:06 PMIt is very important for us to know YouTuber's hype video is not good advice. Every hype in the market is not a piece of good advice and that's why the US authority penalized some influencers this year because their hype has done alot of damage to alot of new investors investment.",

      "body": "Anybody who relies on YouTube for information should be ready to always receive fake news. Most of the people who claim to be crypto analysts are a hungry set of people seeking where to feed from. They are willing to promote any news or shitcoin for monetary gains. Most of their predictions are based on unverified speculation. There might be a few crypto YouTubers who give genuine lectures or predictions but we should always do our research before making any decision. Don't also believe the predictions of influencers and celebrities in social media because many of them have been paid to promote projects that they know nothing about. Some of these shitcoin or crypto projects will end up becoming scam businesses making customers lose their funds. Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather were recently sued for promoting a shitcoin called EthereumMax which lost almost 97% of its value in a few months after the pump.",

But you see these guys who say, \"Oh common, check this altcoin, which is going to do 100 X in the next few weeks.\" I avoid those channels, as they will only end up wasting my time and data. If their information is as true as they claim it is, they will not even come out in the open and give it out for free; it could have been sold to some VIP members of theirs. Those channels are being controlled by those who are paid to promote a particular project and hype the coin to the top, which is what they are known for, and we should always disregard information from such people. That's why people come to places like this forum to acquire real information, as no one is paid to talk in favour of a particular project, but opinions are given based on known facts.",

Influencers fail to conduct their due diligence before going on air to do or say anything about a project. Since they have a large massive fan base, they just promote whatever ever comes their way giving it out to their followers without asking questions but they fail to do all these.
