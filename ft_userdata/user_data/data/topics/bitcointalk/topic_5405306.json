I don't know if such a bounty manager account is paid or not. I instead assume the account is operated by part of their team.I don't think that this account is controlled by Partyland team because this is not the first bounty campaign done by JerZei. Month ago he started Multi Finance bounty campaign which ended up being scam. I guess this is his specialization, scams.  Quote from: Pandu Geddon on July 06, 2022, 02:26:30 AMIt's a shame, that so many bounty hunters don't have the habit of reading first. even when they don't get paid, they claim to be the ones who suffer the most.They do read, but they simply don't care because majority of bounty hunters are using Newbie accounts so even if  they get tagged for promoting scam, its not a big loss for them.",

I even dm'ed the most active hunters who are shitposting messages in Partyland telegram group to have more stakes in the campaign, and I sent them the scam accusation topic link, but still, they ignored after reading it and keep posting useless messages. Some still hope they can get something from this scam. And then come and cry when the project doesn't pay. It's not only the BM fault, hunters are also part of the problem.BM needs to do researches and check the projects they are promoting, and hunter have to avoid participating in a scam campaign.Also some BM creates new account to hide the negative trusts on their previous account (like this one https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403197.msg60493379#msg60493379, should be reported also). So they already have their community in their telegram group to share the link of the campaign.",

That's the problem lol. Only a few bounty hunters care about project and campaign manager. Almost all of them can't evenb read or bother to read a little about the project. How do you expect them have background study of campaign manager?Quote from: nliban on July 06, 2022, 03:10:28 PMBM needs to do researches and check the projects they are promotingVery few BM does that. Maybe yahoo62278 and Hhampuz do that if I'm correct. I used to have my own criteria but sadly I would never be able to a single bounty to manage if I were determined on that standard. Also, if I'm not managing a campaign, there are hundred more managers to do that job without thinkiong twice.",

Also, if I'm not managing a campaign, there are hundred more managers to do that job without thinkiong twice.I've alerted 7 BM about Partyland scam. 4 reviewed the proofs and didn't start the campaign, 1 cancelled the ongoing campaign and 2 banned me to keep running the campaign.Sometimes even all the proofs given is not enough (they didn't even have to do the researches).For those 2 BM, having been paid was enough for them to continue the campaign, and they clearly mentioned that they are not in charge or responsible of the distribution for the hunters.They are either desperate to find a project to promote or are using hunters to make money.In both case, hunters should stop participating in their campaigns. But they still are even when they are aware of the problem..",

Participation in a bounty for hunters is easy prey, and it is not true that they call it hard work.But looking at the accounts of those who have connected, we can conclude that they are the same cheaters and scammers. That is, if they do not deceive, there will be someone who will deceive them.It is useless to warn anyone; people must grow on their own, drawing their own conclusions. Otherwise, you are creating an even bigger army of lazy people who, after promoting fraud, come here and start complaining that everyone around them is to blame, and that they did not receive their payments.",
