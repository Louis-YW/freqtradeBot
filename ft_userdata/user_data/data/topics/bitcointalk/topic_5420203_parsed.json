And thanks he didn't ask this question a year ago, because who knows he might have been among the many others who never got there money till today due to Celsius's collapse and bankruptcy due to lack of fund. Because Celsius, no doubt was  was the highest paying crypto Investment bank that paying weekly, with an interest rate of 18% per annual just for holding your Bitcoin and many other crypto assets. But on the maintime, entrusting your crypto asset to interest paying platforms are always very risky. But just that Binance offers an investment option like this, only that it's interest rate is not that high (8%)",

At social medias like facebook they used to be pretty common too, but you should stay away from any investment of this kind, because they are using investments made by new investors to pay the early ones until the ecosystem becomes unsustainable, so the people behind those sites close them and disappear with the rest of the money or create a new HYIP´with a new brand and name, so they keep the scammy cycle going on...Since you are a newbie, I think you need to be very careful before depositing your crypto in any website around. Verify the legitimacy of the services you are going to use, for how long they are operating, who are the people behind them and how they make their business work on long term. If you don't find enough informations or if informations don't make sense, avoid it.You can also ask for advice on this forum regards specific services you are willing to become an user/customer.",

There may be one or two such programs but that only applies to those who joined in the early days of their launch. At the same time, those who join in the following month will likely never get a profit and will have to lose their initial deposit money. We do not advise you to seek or join such programs because of the risk factors. It's better for you to use the money to invest in bitcoin and hold it because bitcoin will get big profits in the future.",

I'm also just wondering you, OP, you're going to invest in HYIP anyway, aren't you researching that matter.Don't you know that most big scam victims are in the HYIP category? Instead of putting your investment there, turn it to buying the top cryptocurrencies in this industry, and this is a good opportunity to shop because many of the top altcoins in the market have dropped in price.",

And inflow of new money stops, then they run away with the money of all their investors. So don't even think about joining a \"High Return Invest\" Please read this-->> Ponzi schemes are investment scams that pay existing investors with funds collected from new investors.

I think they are not far from pyramiding schemes. If you get lucky you can earn money on them but still, it isn't that high enough but you should learn to quit on early once you do because programs like these can collapse after some time.OP seems serious and won't mind losing so feel free guys to gave him some HYIPs that you know. I know he will stop soon once he get tired of losing money from those scams and he will return here soon but this time he will be asking for ways to earn money in a less riskier way.",

While Terra did have an ecosystem with some use cases, the speed of growth of the ecosystem did not match the speed of the incentives used to attract new users. The growth was “hollow”. Eventually, the bubble burst, and here we are. Key lesson: don’t just chase high APY. Look at fundamentals.",
