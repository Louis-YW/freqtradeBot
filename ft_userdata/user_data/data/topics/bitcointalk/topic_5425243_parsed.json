  "content": "I have been pondering over this for some time now. This platform have come a long way to this height and as members of this platform,  most members that have been here long before now have highly benefited from this platform. The bitcointalk platform has made many men which most of you can attest to that fact. For many years, this platform have been in existence and to the best of my knowledge for the time I have been onboard this platform and carefulIy research I am yet to see any post about end of year or Christmas Charity program organized by members, please correct me if I am wrong.  I think giving back to the society can also make impart in the society and also promoting the Bitcoin movement which would likely call for more adoption. This is just a suggestion, your opinions and ideas are all welcomed. Let us discuss.What is your take on this topic and subject matter?",

      "body": "Well, you have a good thought for humanity, since its related to charity. However, I've seen popular threads where members voluntarily used money made from the forum to buy food, items, laptops for the poor or less privileged; in form of teaching them about bitcoin and the forum too. During the Covid 19 period they was a strong bitcointalk charity program across countries and citizens that needed help, also when the hodlonaut case came up and he needed funds, members here sent money to help him win his Case. So, looking at the decentralized nature of the forum only a few members can be trusted with money made from crowd funding as you suggested. Keeping it an individual obligation is nice, if you have money for charity then move to the streets and help the less privileged and get rewarded by nature and members with sMerit.",

Maybe some renowned and trusted forum members might become interested and spearhead this noble course. Please I am not countering your proposal CryptSafe because it is worth supporting. I just want to use the opportunity express to my observation and suggestions. I have observed that people like giving to charity during festive periods. During celebration periods my country normally experience the highest level of food waste because many people are receiving more than they can consume. But we must understand that charity works should be part of our daily lives and not necessarily be motivated by celebrations. We shouldn't wait until Christmas before we organize a charity program. I am saying this because we neglect or fail to help some persons in need because that day is not Christmas or Salah. People need to survive before Christmas or Salah periods, so we need to support them before and after these celebrations.",

What OP is proposing is a kind of Bitcointalk Christmas charity program where interested members can donate freely and the funds would be used to support the less privileged in our society. Christmas is generally seen as a time of giving and OP wants the community to use this period and reach out to people that needs help. He is not seeking the funds for himself or asking for an Xmas merit giveaway. His intention is encouraging and I think he deserves some credit for conceiving this uncommon idea.",

      "body": "Various charities have been active on the forum in the past, but I'm not sure if there are any that are still active - especially after one such program was linked to misuse of donated funds. The question always arises as to who needs the funds the most, who will control these same funds and who will decide who will receive them. I am more in favor of an individual approach, because if you are an active member of the forum, you can certainly at least guess who needs help, that is, who is having a hard time in life. Perhaps such things would be best organized within local boards where local members would join together and then donate to someone they know needs help or to a local charity.",

I have seen so many threads by individuals about charity and at a particular time some persons will need to sponsor such charity programs.I was not here during the convict 19 time but I have seen some threads that discussed about charity of covid-19.

Here is an example of it that maybe you did not know about:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5376475.0I believe that any act or campaign of charity is welcomed while it is carried out by reputable members of this forum and if the funds are kept in a multi-signature wallet then even better.

Apart from occasional extraordinary donations, I donate to a charity I trust (using fiat) every month. It is an expense that I have set for myself as a fixed one, like paying the electricity bill. As I'm normally a bit skeptical, I will say that I doubt whether the OP's thread starts from a sincere opinion or from the merit requirements of the campaing he is participating in. The merit requirement for this week already has it but there is a possible bonus.Anyway, let's give him the benefit of the doubt. What he wants is to open a debate. So let's debate. Quote from: meser# on December 03, 2022, 05:44:43 PMWouldn't it be better to teach how to fish than to give fish? In an ideal world it would be better, what happens is that if you have someone hungry in front of you, he will not pay attention to you if you try to teach him something because he only thinks about food. So it is better to give food to the hungry and establish teaching them how to fish as a medium term plan.

Come on! Giving him a paper wallet is completely useless, because as soon as he learns what it is, what he will do is change it to fiat to be able to pay for food, or if we think of a worse case scenario, alcohol or drugs.",
