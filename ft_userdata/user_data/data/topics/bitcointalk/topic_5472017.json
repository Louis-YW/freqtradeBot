  "content": "after another discussion with someone when a topic came up about the super fiat richhow do they get away with paying no taxes, but then suggest they will eventually give all their wealth awaythe simple answer is thiswhen their business gets revenue, they invest it. and because they are not spending the money personally outside of business purposes, and because they are not selling the investment there is no tax. (investing is a pre-tax event)then if they need some spending money, they do not sell the investment. instead they ask for a loan using the investment as collateral. and because funds from a loan are not taxable they get to use the money without paying taxso here is a tip for us bitcoiners who ask how can governments try to tax bitcoin but yet, fiat billlionaires dont get taxedthere needs to be a bitcoin service where people who want to buy bitcoin join(lets call it a credit union or loan company). but instead of \"buying\" they become investors/funders of loans. so the service offers loans to bitcoiners that want to cash out. but the bitcoiner doesnt sell the coin. but instead hands the coin over to the service as collateral.the bitcoiner is then a non-coiner and receives cash. but has not sold the coin but instead received a 'loan' of cash for his collateral. thus no tax. yep loans are not taxable.obviously never making any repayments the coins become the service investors property. and the deal is done. buyers have the coin. the ex-bitcoiner gets the cash. .. sidenotethe only time the rich sell assets is if the asset is performing below its purchase price. so they sell it. and instantly buy it back. (no loss due to sell-buy being equal price/time) but it triggers a \"realised value loss\" they can put on their financial statement, which they can then use the loss against any tax their main fiat business could not avoid within the business.. to not have to pay tax because the asset loss writes off any fiat business tax",

I think you forget to mention interest since taking out a loan has always an interest rate you'd need to pay. But interest rate is still lower than tax, much much lower for someone who make big amount of money.a. you dont declare tax each day you receive income from customers. you file your taxes at the end of year of what is left after to separate out your deductibles.. its the same as the common man, before tax they can invest part/all of their salary into a pension or a tax free investment and such. so the amount of money going into an investment is not post-tax, nor taxed at source.b.you forgot all about the loan service i mentioned.. the point of a service is not for the loan receiver to make repayments that include interest. the point is for the loan receiver to give collateral to get the cash and then ..hint hint. default the loan so the service takes the collateral. that way instead of selling coin to then be taxed on normal CEX. you have instead been given cash equivalent in loan form, thus no tax. and surrendered your coin... (hint hint its a tactic to sell coin get fiat without selling and being taxed)and thats how the rich never pay tax, but get to handle alot of money",

But interest rate is still lower than tax, much much lower for someone who make big amount of money.That is actually an awesome idea, but I would have been more amazed if I had read this post yesterday because my professor of HRM taught us about this tip of tax yesterday, he used the example of factories (production units) where the tax experts have to come up with ways, where they have to reduce the tax and this method of taking a huge loan to reduce or eliminate the tax partially or fully. I thought at that moment that, why pay interest (because in our religion it's haram) so I thought if I had to choose between them I would choose to pay tax rather then take a loan on which I have to pay interest.Overall, maybe the government increase taxes and do not ban this policy of no tax on loan money at the same time, because they know in both ways money is coming to them but there must be some trick in it (some point) that we are missing because governments and banks do not make deal where they are making loss (lesser profit is also a loss to them). Thanks for the video I will share it with my class group.",

It is not rocket science but why only rich people can use this method? Because they have assets to use as a collateral and lenders trust that they can repay the loan with high interest whereas average Joe cannot.

      "body": "Thanks for bringing this information in front of us. The main reason behind not giving any shit to tax for the poor might be that they are dealing in a lesser amount, and the tax is also lesser. And why give the rich so much thought to tax? Because they will be charged more in tax if they are dealing more. This only happens if the tax is progressive in that country or region.Otherwise, the poor would also give more importance to taxes, but they pay less, so they care less. In countries where there is no progressive tax system, the poor are becoming poorer and the rich are becoming richer. Because the poor make choices that are risk-free, they do not take risks to do something out of their league, and they always end up in poverty.Many poor people tried their luck or their skills to take themselves out of poverty, and many have been successful, but the main reason is not some tax, it's the efforts that one person is making. If a poor person is making efforts, he will be successful, and the second thing that makes the poor poorer and the rich richer is the opportunity on the basis of background.If, in the first example, a poor person is making efforts in the compete with some rich people, then the chances of losing are higher for the poor.",

The law is for average people when wealthy people always find a way to evade them.The level of risk offered by either banks or other lending services is usually commensurate with the entire loan amount and is still below the level of tax liability, so for the average Joe the interest rate is not much different.If they want to take this step to avoid taxes like the rich, they can do that too although having to set up their \"collateral\" is a bit time consuming at first.",

I don't think they should be condemned for doing so, I do believe they are using the system against the one who made the system. We know for a fact that being rich is paying a huge amount of taxes, therefore they are trying to avoid it by using some legal ways just like what the OP indicated from his post. Taking a loan to invest is not taxable, that's true, this is why most of rich or wealthy people spend like crazy using credits giving collaterals from their assets, and it is because the interest rate is much smaller than the tax they need to pay when they spend money from their gains.Quote from: kryptqnick on October 28, 2023, 04:46:48 PMSo, because of that, I have mixed feelings about an idea of doing the same thing to avoid paying taxes with Bitcoin, although I'm sure some people will appreciate the idea, and, in general, it's a pretty good idea for the US (because taxes work differently in different countries).

And start to wonder how can this be even allowed, btw, you can't beat born rich, and born provider hunter no matter how you gonna do, you would likely bend over to begin to see what they do next and do exactly what they do just like the cult, when they move into the next hype you too have to quickly adopt, find a fat and big paypig and cling on it firmly and lock up the target only to you the whole damn life, such is a life of being passive and totally living a life of no self-worth, no hobby no passion no goal not even contribute no consistency like the empty shell, crave other people opinions and reviews on you madly, but mindlessly chasing the next shinny trend because you eagerly find passive gain from it such as view count and emotionally supporting your cause. Easily get trigger by a little rejection and quickly accuse and sue them for defamation. What is it, does it sound exactly like a person would behave to a certain expectation/pattern but they can't help themselve but wandering in the same circle over and over again, like a rat race.Quote from: kryptqnick on October 28, 2023, 04:46:48 PM... it's a practice that should be condemned if not somehow made illegal...What they did is nothing less than looking for provider in life to be their paypig, just like what a certain gender did, you said to make it illegal? That is gonna be very challenging to impose such restrictions, first you would have to tell those provider hunters to stop leeching money and get to work... haha!",

That's why we see most billionaires holding on to their vast mountains of wealth until they die aged 80+. They could really be putting it to much better use throughout their lifetimes, but choose to accumulate until the end. It's a fault of all the governments around the world letting them get away with it really, as they should be taxed a lot more but they effectively become financial nomads because they can.",
