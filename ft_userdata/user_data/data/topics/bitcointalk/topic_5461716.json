There are introduction of different features that can enhance user’s profitability such as copy trading, flexible savings, staking, Launchpad and the likes. Now AI bot has been introduced into some CEX where users have opportunity to trade with bot. In some cases bot are very smart regardless of the volatility of the market. Trading with both is just like trading smarter because you’ve got no reason to stress yourself. Also there are exchanges that offers loss protection on their bot, users get loss protection fund in any situation of loss. This might be an opportunity to explore. Let me know your view regarding the trading bot and if you know any exchange with such feature yet also with loss protection fund on users loss.",

If you aren't controlling it either, then what is the actual action for the user - just investing in the AI bot pool?

Those new features help to bring in more traders and trap them with the hope that they can now be more profitable in trading, while they (those brokers) can still earn more profit as more traders keep trading.",

We need to understand what the word loss protection really means because it is not that the company is going to pay the victim everything they have lose but they will be compensated which might not be uoto 30% of there loses. In case where the user had made a lot of profits using the bot and suddenly started making loses, no loss protection will be offer to him because he is still in the winning team since the overall profits are more than the overall loses. A little bit complicated for me and for someone that had made us of bot before, I am still searching for bot that does not incur loses for longer time.",

If you are using AI for trading and everyone is using AI and we say that this AI helps in trading. This means that nobody will run at loss and who will pay for the profit of the other,because I know that in trading, when I loss,the other person profits and vice versa. Meaning is everyone is using AI,then trading will be done by everyone because it will sure that you will be profitable in trading. It will be a cheat and I don't think that exchanges will key into that. It is better that you learn all the important aspect of trading and come up with your own trading strategy so that you can teach someone else. Using AI will not add anything to your knowledge and experience.",

If you operate with AI is not a result of not losing money.You’re quite on point with your assertion, actually some CEXs have trading bot that uses AI, just like the Bitget AI trading bot. Also one thing we should know is AI is more efficient in Technical Analysis (TA) than human being. The only part where AI might be weak is that of financial analysis due to occurrence such as news, rumor and all which may cause the market to change direction of which does not happen often. Most time trading is based on Technical analysis of which AI is very perfect with it. Have traded with AI for complete one week with no single loss. Some exchange equally offers loss protection fund incase of any loss. Also do not be greedy once your AI hit your determine profit make sure you do the needful by being contented.",
