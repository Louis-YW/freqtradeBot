Although the amount of bitcoin allocated to the market this time will be nearly 3 times larger than the German government, I do not believe bitcoin can drop to $40k. I believe that if everyone is mentally prepared in advance, it will help reduce market panic and be less prone to dumping. There won't be too much of a correction to bitcoin with the Mt.gox BTC refund, IMO.",

But in any case, we've seen the effect of the German government selling their stash and the lowest that we go is $54k.But I guess smart investors are going to take this as another opportunity to fatten their wallet if the Mt. Gox coins started to move and affect the market. Nevertheless, could be just temporary setback. I mean we are already resilient of ever there are dumps and I don't see the market going to plunge and do a downward spiral to $40k.",

Those who don not will always be called as diamond hands. Yeah they will understand Bitcoin and its potential if they stick to it. Because when they will calculate their profits if they do not exit the market at that time, they will be motivated to not leave the market the next time they enter. And this is just the first lesson for all newbies which they learn at dumps and realize at pumps. I think every one of us learned this the hard way. But if a newbie or a person regardless of any rank, sees the history of BTC and reads as many historic events as he could with full details, like what happens after every halving, what happen when a exchange start selling or distributing funds etc. They will realize there is nothing to worry about, by worrying I mean, not to worry that it is going to zero or $15k again. Because BTC market has achieved a lot in recent times and it is not going to be zero. So by worry I mean, you can see some lose and to prevent it, stay active, once the news comes out that some authority is selling BTC, book some profit and then take re-entry. Although its not that easy as well.",

The comeback of the Bitcoin price was due to the Trump saga that happened 2 days ago else we will just be flat in the market and the announcement of his vice used to be a Bitcoin pro, not sure about now but the two candidates are pro Bitcoin and that's why the market is looking green. This might not be a problem for holders but Bitcoin traders will be worried because they have leverage opened, if Mt.gox decide to distribute all that number of Bitcoin, it's going to affect the price.If I remember correctly, in the last bull run Tera Luna dump about 32k worth billions of dollars in the market to defend their useless coin and that tank Bitcoin price by more than $10k, now imagine Mt.gox that has more than 100k to be given back to their affected customers. Let's even say the receivers will self the 50k Bitcoin, it will have a big down fall on the Bitcoin market no matter how you view it.",

If you think that everything that Gox gives back to people will be dumped, think again. Most of these people had years to sell their claims and did nothing, patiently waited for the money to be returned to them, so many of these people are bitcoin believers. They thought that it would go up, so they wanted the real thing and were willing to wait a few years for it. If 50% of them sell I'm going to be surprised. I'm 100% sure some of the wealthy investors have reached out to Gox victims with deals years ago, offering to buy out their claims. This was a gold mine if you believed in bitcoin because these people would easily take 6 cents on the dollar when there was no deadline set by the trustee. In other words, most coins from MtGox are either already in the hands of long term holders or soon will be.",

With those people, they will not sell immediately after receiving payments from Mt.Gox.With 'victims' of Mt.Gox who left the market many years ago, and did not care about it recent years, they are possible sellers after receiving payments.It's not easy to guess that selling pressure is big or small because we don't know how 'victims' will do?Like me, if I lost 1 BTC to Mt.Gox accident about 10 years ago and now I receive 1 BTC from them, I would say, thanks God, Mt.Gox saved me and gave me a fortune. It's an example, I don't know how much Mt.Gox pay to 'victims' from what they lost years ago.",
