I sent them my coins to mix and then they told me the coins I sent were not enough and that there is a certain minimum amount required to use their service. But they didn't say that anywhere BEFORE sending my coins. They happily accepted them AND THEN tell me about this requirement. So OK, give me back my coins then, but nope! They kept it!

It was $7.Did you read ToS of the mixer? And besides most mixers always make sure to write the minimum amount that a user can mix at the top of the page during the process of mixing so there’s a high chance that you didn’t pay much attention to it. As long as we don’t have the link of the site to verify if everything you have written here is correct or if you are the one that made an error and now you’re just trying to blame it on the mixer for now clearly stating the minimum amount.",

So you use a coin mixer advertised here and from the looks of things, you probably did not read their TOS and it seems quite obvious you didn't check anything about them, you just doled your coins.

He even contacted them regarding his issue and he was told his deposit was not up to the minimum required amount. He obviously didn’t read about the platform before making use of their services which is a very bad habit. It is like a rule and there is no excuse for not knowing about it, they believe you should read about their services and how they operate before making use of their platform. I don’t think you were scammed OP, you lost your coins because of your carelessness and i am sure you must have learned your lesson now so next time before making use of any platform you should carry out proper research about them. But if you were to be scammed as you claimed you should make the name of the company known to everyone and also a clear proof so they can confirm the authenticity of your claims.",

Advertising a mixer campaign here does not guarantee that it will be completely effective. The fault could be yours or theirs, but without providing sufficient information and proof of the transaction between the two parties, your accusation is worthless. You are accusing a service of stealing by failing to refund your coin. You must ensure that your claim is true before proceeding so that other members can investigate the accusation you've just made about being duped by the mixer.",

Someone mentioned it here on the forum but it's not for BTC it's for Banano.Source here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5165788.msg51947827#msg51947827Quote from: Xiwick on December 11, 2023, 06:23:52 PMQuestion to you... Let's assume that is true and that it was indeed in the FAQ. My question, to you, is... such vital piece of info, why put it there and not clearly on the page of purchase?Most of mixer tells you first on the home page how much the required amount before you deposit so if the mixer you use never tells you how much even on their faqs it's their fault and they should send your BTC back to your wallet minus the transaction fees.I suggest check your browser history and maybe the mixer you talking about is still there and post the exact domain name here so that we can check if they never told you about the required amount.",
