So far all the names you have mentioned have really committed in the blockchain courtesy of their own  enterprises as regards their own orchestrated acts, only God knows. Anyways, since you have said so, I think it would be nice aym evidence follows such as you had earlier mentioned  the tweet links would be very much appreciated as an evidence to back up your claims. As it stands now, we need clues to ascertain the level at which the claims will cause damage or must have caused damages.",

Several days ago, I was able to read a topic (before it was deleted) I think he created it also, in which he talks about yahoo62278 very badly and that he is a liar who collected donations and deceived members of the forum.It is a good idea to ban those accounts that are created just to defame the trusted members of the forum without providing any evidence.",

Someone who has probably been inflicted in some way somehow by yahoo62278 in some ways that we cannot understand since he will never reveal it. It’s probably something to do with the forum that he got banned or something. Someone who has been in this forum for a long time would know how respected he is and how helpful he is in the community. So probably he doesn’t know that or just has a lot of time.",
