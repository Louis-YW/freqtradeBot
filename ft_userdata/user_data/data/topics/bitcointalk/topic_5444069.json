A most classic lesson from 2020 bull run is Axie Infinity.Indeed, bear market is for builder. Our team didn't expect anything much during such period but we did put alot of efforts on building our project. Thanks for your kind word as I also foreseen that alot of solid project that did well during bull market took years to build before they go success. But what I'm curious the most is during bear market like now, most investors will just do nothing and wait till the next bull??Quote from: Silberman on March 09, 2023, 02:19:20 AMQuote from: FireDAO CY on March 09, 2023, 01:02:58 AMFireDAO is a social DAO project based on PID and FID soul-bound accounts, and it's initiated and established by the RainbowCity Foundation.

We do believe our project has our own uniqueness. But we will only find out if the project will skyrocketed or not when the bull is back. I believe you're very experienced in the market and perhaps you can suggest what can we do during bear market? What usually investors are seeking during bear market?

If we only prep and launch the project during the bull, don't you think it will be a bit slow as thousands of projects will be launched at that time as well? I do agree the community shrinked alot compare to during the bull market, but in bear market when there are not much projects going on, the chance of standing out will be higher. Or in another way, when the bull is back, people will have more confident on the project that already built for a period. Don't you think so?",

Maybe we should focus on building community first before launching the project. My team has start to post on Twitter https://twitter.com/FireDAOlab, hopefully we can create more awareness about the project.Quote from: crwth on March 09, 2023, 05:21:41 AMIn general, if we are talking about just launching it, many projects have since risen in price since the bear market, and they have started during the bear market since 2017.

It's just that it can't be sustained, and I had a hard time having an entry with the new players to play it. It needed to be more sustainable. When you have done your project, you will find a sustainable way. That's what you need to be successful.Long term sustainability is definitely very important for the market. But I think the market now changes super fast and it's so unpredictable especially in blockchain. Well my team and I will do our best to survive over the bear market. We believe a good project will shine anyway, just the matter of time.Quote from: Godday on March 09, 2023, 05:43:18 AMLaunching a new project when the market is in a bear market I don't think is a good idea. Maybe I would say as a crazy idea. If indeed the developers really believe in their project and it is the latest breakthrough in the world of cryptocurrency then it doesn't matter because you can take advantage of your bear market to build a solid foundation for your project so that when the market will experience an increase in trading transaction volume,  your project is no longer a \"new project\" which of course it will be something positive to get a lot of investors. This means for new projects not to burn too much money and be too ambitious if they want to launch the project in the current cryptocurrency environment. Start by strengthening the fundamentals of your project and I believe it is the best choice you can make.This is exactly how my team think about it. Building a strong fundamental during the bear so that when the timing is correct, our project will be seen. We have started our moves by sharing the idea and info of the project on Twitter. https://twitter.com/FireDAOlab Looking forward for more people can reach our project and give more opinions to us.Quote from: Strongkored on March 09, 2023, 05:47:36 AMDon't really follow the development of new projects that appear but a few years ago when the ICO was in a high trend many projects that had completed their ICO stages preferred to wait to enter the exchange until the Bitcoin price entered a bullish period, this was done to avoid massive selling but whatever the conditions are bullish or bearish a project that has potential will always be able to survive and continue to exist in the crypto world for quite a long time because it has clear development as well as clear use cases.Thanks for the advice. Afterall Bitcoin still plays a massive role to lead the market. We will work hard to be one of the project that will exist for a long time.

Quite agree with what you've mentioned, there's always project that failed during the bull market and also project that success during the bear market.

And if you can maintain and grow it until the bull season arrives, you will have an advantage over projects that just started during the bull season.

The market is very uncertain, many people run away from crypto or keep their capital mainly in stablecoins and leading projects that are likely to bring profit in the long term. In addition, we have recently seen a lot of regulatory activity in relation to the cryptocurrency market, which also raises uncertainty among potential investors.

What you have to do is ensure that you are ready and in good shape to launch your project. The following questions would help if you have an answer1. Does your project have a product to sell? is it achievable?2. Is your marketing top notch? good enough to proceed to launch?3. Is your product unique enough to bring investors closer to your project?4. What is your marketing strategy? Do you have a viable roadmap and you tick the milestones appropriately? Do you have social media presence?5. Do you have investors in your group? or you have shillers and bots added to your community?6. Do you engage in vcs or ama events to share your ideas and hear from your investors?Having an answers to these questions will help you make the right decision; also remember that Everytime is the right time to launch.

This bearish market condition allows you to convince investors of your project but depends on your readiness to face a bearish market. And when the market has started to change direction and your project can still run well, investors will see it as an opportunity, which can convince them that your project can survive for the long term and not be affected by a bearish market. Projects that cannot survive a bear market will soon disappear and be replaced by new ones that do. So as long as you can prove to investors that you and all your team are still working hard to develop the project for the better in the future, investors will certainly believe and will invest in your project.",

I'm one of the project team member and would like to gather more ideas from everyone in Bitcointalk forum.I've seen alot of projects did so well during the bull market, but now I'm wondering is bear market will affect the progress of a new project...The fact that you have doubts about launching it in a bear market, may just be a hunch inside you. Investors are moving out of crypto to wait for the right time again to come back. This time however it seem like the market had bottomed. If this is what you also believed maybe it's not so much of a bad idea anymore since investors are also looking for GEMS.",
