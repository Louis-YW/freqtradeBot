  "content": "My country people. I hail una and I also believe say we dey gidiba. I say make I bring this topic here sake of say e go dey beneficial to our newbies wey just join us here. I know say we don dey hear about scam and how e dey take dey happen wey be say you go just click link wey dem send you for phone as text message before you go know another thing don pop up and you click again another one don come before you know scammers don scam you or to steal your details from your phone or gadgets then come use am steal from your wallet or otherwise. Make una see;Â Na so I receive this message directly to my phone today. I come dey wonder why the scammer no use him number send me the link.Â  I come begin dey reason am say make I try see wetin dem send. I copy the link to another Separate browser wey no dey signed into my account come use incognito mode open am Na telegram community pop up wey dem say make I join in but something fishy happen as I clicked the link and another one open. Dem send a promptÂ  for me to allow external access to my applications wey no dey normal. Na there I just delete everything from my phone immediately so that I no go mistakenly go click the link unknown to me.I drop this one here so that our newbies dem go see am as examples of wetin dem dey always hear here say make dem no dey click links wey dem send as text message to their phone. Not only text message to phone also email and chats sent to your social media accounts too. Avoid clicking them to be on the safe side.The funny thing be say them go just write one better caption for the content of the message wey go entice you to click the link immediately and if you no get intro on their gimmicks, you go just fall mugu for them and dem go use the person shine.To our newbies here, try avoid such text message if you receive any and you are very much sure you don't know the sender and you are not expecting any message of such nature. Delete it immediately.",
