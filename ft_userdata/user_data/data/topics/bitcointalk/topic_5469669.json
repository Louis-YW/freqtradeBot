Just a future guess.I see a huge shift in the military industrial complex's ability to earn profits. Due to modern tech ie Drones and the like.I watched on film about 5000 usd worth of gear take out a 1 million dollar Russian tank .  At no risk to the operator of that 5000 worth of gear.  So I am wondering when do these wasteful conflicts alter. Ships don't have the value they used to have. you can sink a 500 million dollar  ship with a 20,000 dollar drone.This mean a huge shift in making money with military gear is going to occur over the next 5-10 years.Is this new conflict going to be yet one more shift in weaponry.And does the ability to easily attack almost anywhere anyplace mean having crypto is more important than physical assets.I.E 10,000 cash in a home could be burnt. But my digital wealth is safe.So forget the war as political and think of the economic angles here.To all in Ukraine vs Russia I hope for peace.To all in Israel vs Palestine I hope for peace.To all in China vs Taiwan please keep the peace.To this forum will the new methods of attack alter the value of physical assets thus increasing crypto assets.",

When we're at war, not only is manpower allocated and redirected to produce as much destructive force and firepower to put your enemies down, that also includes the R&D, as well as the technological prowess that your country boasts of. New researches being funded for better weapons instead of cancer research. People looking for more ways to efficiently and cheaply kill each other while the economy is going to the shitbox, that's all good examples. Another would be the fact that this could easily mean that crypto would stop being used and updated since everyone's just so busy killing themselves over something trivial.",

You can't escape a war zone with bars of gold or land or a house, but you can instantly transfer all that wealth if it's in the form of crypto assets. On the other hand wars and continued large scale conflicts can delay new capital entering into crypto space as crypto assets continue to be seen as a high risk asset class, so in times of strife and turmoil investors tend to shy away from risk until some kind of order is restored...",

Following this, about a thousand militants invaded Israeli territory through gaps in the fence, with the help of boats and even by parachute, and carried out senseless terror on civilians.  In response, the Israeli IDF has already carried out about 800 strikes on Hamas headquarters and centers, and has also received permission to conduct a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, from where the attack was carried out.Israel can use Hamas' attack, unprecedented in the last 50 years, to completely destroy this terrorist group, which is generally not supported by the Palestinian people. I don't think this war will be very long. However, the world received another military hotbed in Europe. The UN was unable to pass a resolution this time either. The reform of this international organization has already taken too long.",

We wont be able to pay for things using our crypto because of lack of electricity and so wont have access to the internet. (This can be observed mostly in countries that accept crypto as a means of exchange).2. We have been expecting mass adoption of crypto which is happening gradually. So the presence of war would reduce mass adoption of crypto, even as of now most society are still struggling to accept crypto because of their government policy so this might discourage the government to discard cryptocurrency entirely in their country.3. Also for those countries that might be affected during the wars there might be government sanction or ban on crypto so many investors within those courtly because of the ban might lose their investment due to the fall of price. Most times some exchanges will refused withdrawal for person from those countries. This is why its advisable to keep your crypto portfolio in wallets and not exchange, because no one prays for things like this to happen but life is not fair, unpredictable things do happen unknowingly.",

Of course, no one wants war because it will result in huge losses for those fighting and those around them. However, if escalation continues to increase and all parties are unwilling to reduce tension, we will not be able to avoid war.We can already imagine that if countries and axes in the world went to war, it would not only disrupt the global economy but also affect the crypto market. Most likely because of this, the crypto market will crash which will cause quite massive losses and quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts will fall into poverty because of this.

The increase in natural disasters like earthquakes and flooding has also brought to the limelight the dangers of investing in physical assets. I am sure that people will consider the benefit of investing in crypto assets due to the uncertainties associated with physical.  But this will only be possible with an increase in Bitcoin awareness. People need to know about Bitcoin and some of the benefits it offers. Holding crypto assets during these trying times also has some level of risk as discussed in this thread Keeping or recovering seed phrases during or after a natural disaster, but it is a good option.",

Sometime ago I made a thread on War who benefits and how, just trying to understand what has been the benefits of these war in Ukraine and Russia both for the inside and the outside world; and now on the intense is Isreal and Palestine. And now @philipma1957 your op has given me a clear insight to that. With the constant development of technological weaponry a market has been established and the cost of keeping this market booming is by the planting and underground  sponsorship of war in different places because without wars countries would have no need for these weapons and the market won't make money. This is why certain conflicts that ordinarily have supposed to have ended keeps flaming up just when we think it's about to see peace.QuoteAnd does the ability to easily attack almost anywhere anyplace mean having crypto is more important than physical assets. Having crypto right now is safer and important to having physical assets, however with the wars and all the bombardments it therefore increases the burden of search for a safer place to keep your seeds phrase so it doesn't get destroyed leading to loss of our crypto assets as a result of having the position we hid out seeds phrase hit by a drone attack.QuoteTo all in Ukraine vs Russia I hope for peace.To all in Israel vs Palestine I hope for peace.To all in China vs Taiwan please keep the peace. I also stand for peace... For only peace can save us.QuoteTo this forum will the new methods of attack alter the value of physical assets thus increasing crypto assets.You have asked a very salient question but let me think outside the box in providing a response. Yeah this new method of attack will ultimately alter the value of physical assets but may not  have an increasing effect on crypto asset. For in times of war what's important is survival and apart from not being hit by a bullet or an airstrike you will definitely be hit by hunger. Hence people with crypto assets will be force to sell to enable them have cash to access food for survival of not just their self but family's.
