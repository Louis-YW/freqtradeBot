And it's usually very difficult to explain it and to prove it to the casino customer support. The easiest way would be to send a video of the round showing and proving the issue.

This might be a little inconvenient but that’s ok, because problems or bugs can happen anytime and its not about having a trust issue with the site, I think its more about your prioritizing your own safety and having that video as your evidence can be a good one, I’m just doing this for a live bets.",

      "body": "OBS is the best one there is, although the file size can somewhat be huge after all the recording is done. You just have to get the right mix of quality and file size in order to get a somewhat acceptable end result in the end. There is also this one web-based screen capture application that they used on job interviews although I kinda forget what the app is. That, too, is acceptable although most of the time when I was using it, the file tends to be corrupted leading to a lot of frustrations and you not capturing what you really need to capture to file for disputes against the casino.",

You can also run OBS on startup but you have to go through extra steps to make it work and the replay feature requires more memory if you're planning to increase the time limit.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSI_KA4Q8gA",

Which tool is convenient for doing that?  That's smart thinking, I never thought of such idea LOLQuote from: serjent05 on March 12, 2023, 07:26:35 PMScreencast-O-MaticI used to have Screencast-O-Matic when I have some businesses where video editing was essential. Their paid service is good. With the free service I guess you have limits of recording sessions. Maximum length you can go with is 15 minutes or something. When you are doing something to keep records to use later as evidences, you needs a tool that is constantly recording your screen. It's lightweight too, does not consume much resources of your device. Quote from: michellee on March 13, 2023, 01:28:48 AMMaybe you can use your cell phone to record your gambling activities to send evidence of the tape to the casino or other places to prove that cheating occurred during the gambling game. Android phones have built-in screen-cast options. It's even easier on phone. No idea about iPhones though.",

      "body": "In all seriousness, it's definitely frustrating when something goes wrong and you can't prove it. Because of this, recording your screen is a must. There are many excellent options for recording your gaming. OBS Studio is one choice I find appealing. You don't have to worry about covert costs or dubious practices because it's open source and available at no cost to you. As an added bonus, it doesn't require a high level of technical expertise to operate. One option is to use a dashcam, such as a GoPro, and wear it on one's head while gameplay. That'll attract people's attention in the casino for sure. (Haha, I kid, don't actually do that.)But let's get back to this business of recording the screen. The app Bandicam is another great alternative. It doesn't come for nothing, but it's cheap and packed with useful functions. It has also been there for a while, so you know it is a solid resource. There are absolutely no errors or flaws in this! Hopefully not.",

(You can use the two button combination on the phone, but this gives you a faster access to the screen capture)It has some nice features and it is not too hard on the phones resources... so it does not slow down your game play like many of the other recorders I tried.",

If we are using a phone, we might have an in-built recorder but some phones might not get a good quality on using this recorder and sometimes they can't include a sound.For this we can use the one that you recommend which was the AZ recorder. When it comes to pc or laptop, I only tried one recorder so far and that would be the OBS studio. This wasn't user/newbie friendly but I managed to record my game live on Facebook the first time I use it. There are lots of tutorials on Youtube that can help you configure this thing.",

Regular screen recorders are fine, I used to use OBS back in the days unintentionally cause I used to stream videogames and just leave the video recording software on while I'm betting off-cam. You have to have a pretty mid-line PC for it to work though, and a good storage space with at least 128 GB to save videos of. Nowadays some providers, as what Ryzaadit said provide their own replay feature. Which I believe is much better because well it's their own records against them so there's bound to be some recompense. So there you have it. Gamble away and gamble responsibly.",
