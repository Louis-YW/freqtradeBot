Should bitcoin encounter any bearish period they also follow through. The funny part is most of them stay up for like 3 to 5 years before finally becoming dead projects. Investing in Altcoins should be treated as a form of gambling and nothing more. There could be big profits off it and also the losses is still same if not much higher.Reputable exchanges should be only decentralized ones, on no account should one trust the centralized exchanges no matter how widely they might be used. Trade on them with caution and get your funds off them",

If you've done thorough research on the cryptocurrency market, you should only enter the market when you're ready to face the consequences of bitcoin investment. If you have a prepared mindset in the market, you will not succumb to any shortfall or be afraid of exiting the market when it is not in your favor.",

I believe most of these traders are not completely interested in learning the process of crypto trading, because their interest is on making profits that’s why they want to trade immediately without even learning the basics in trading. And as a result, they end up having wrong decisions and lose all their funds in trading. The reason why research and learning before engaging into trading is very important. If you aim to make big profits in trading, then maximize your learning and develop your skills and working strategies in trading.",

Do your research: Before investing in any cryptocurrency, it's important to understand its technology, use case, and potential risks. Read whitepapers, follow news and social media feeds, and understand market trends.Definitely agree, aA few years back when every project was out there flaunting their whitepapers, investing in crypto was so much easy, you simply bought the crypto asset and forgot about it because we had a few coins on the market and the success of the investment was high, but today because we have scammers that have got into the market the game has changed...These scammers are so creative such that they use a fancy website, a fake team(probably use stolen identities to make the project look authentic) and many of us get fooled by this, and if you are one that doesn't take the time to research and proofread you could be investing in a knockoff asset.Quote from: roksana.hee on February 28, 2023, 05:08:27 PM2. Diversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider investing in different cryptocurrencies and other asset classes to spread out your risk.Spreading your risk is a good idea but if the asset you have invested in has a big community and is authentic then one asset is also okay, this is something I have learnt from forex trading!Quote from: roksana.hee on February 28, 2023, 05:08:27 PM3.

An update or at least news but being updated about it doesnt affect much your asset value at all. Its simplify the market as fud or shill but not necessary knew what should happened isnt it. Cause there are different regulations per country and only those where we reside we should be familiarize with it.",

I mean, all of these are essential basics that every investor/trader should be aware of before investing real money for the first time.And I suspect that there are already countless threads on Bitcointalk on these general tips. At least, hardly anyone here is likely to have learned anything new. Too bad.Quote from: tranthidung on March 01, 2023, 01:15:50 PMLearning first, trading later.This sentence pretty much sums it up.

This is why most people are fall on scam projects because they're easily get tricked. Well there's no risk management if you diversify your portfolio to various cryptocurrency because when the market is bullish, the other coins price will increase too. When the market is bearish, the other coins price will decrease too. You need to diversify to other assets e.g. stock, gold, real estate etc.",

The list you also provided is a part of the trading guide, but it serves more as a preference list for someone looking to buy a coin to keep. To survive as a trader, you need to have things like a trading guide, the basic indicators, you need to understand the trend, support and resistance, the candle, how to overcome media manipulation and the games of whale and market maker, and many more if you want to go dip in trading.",

Second: They can ask you KYC at any time. Third: They can freeze your account for any reason.Therefore, it is better to stay away from central exchanges and use decentralized exchanges, or to deposit only a small part of your capital for trading in the central exchanges.",
