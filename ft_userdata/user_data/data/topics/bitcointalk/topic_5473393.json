He picks his own opponent either an old retired UFC fighter or an inactive boxer. He made a mistake fighting Tommy though so he wouldn't make such mistake from now on. The fact that it's his promotion and he pays for these guys to fight him, he should be winning.Paul is making boxing a joke, no one ever heard of Andre August til he announced this fight. For all we know he just paid this guy in advance $50.000 to sleep whenever he do his signature move.",

He’s putting in the work and matching up against better and better opponents. I won’t be surprised in another couple years when he gets a legitimate shot at a title. I looked up his opponent as well. Dude seems like a legit boxer. While I’d prefer to see Jake beat up celebrities, you can’t hate on him for doing his best to have a legitimate professional boxing career.",

He's not paying his dues and working his way up in the rankings. I'm not saying his fights aren't semi entertaining, I'm saying he is not going about it the right way.

So he still continue to look for boxers that he thinks he can beat, in this case a relatively unknown but has a lot of experience with the name of August. And so with his hype still very high, he needs to take advantage of his name and milk his \"boxing fans\" to buy his fights and then make millions.And he is not a bad promoter as well, a savvy business man. So who knows after his career in exhibitions fights, maybe he can go professional someday. But for now, he is slowly getting into it, looking for a fight against a not so bad boxer.",

To get a higher ranking, the Paul-Fury winner will need to do the following: 1. Be active 2. Fight WBC-ranked contenders 3. Records 4. Location of fights 5. Experts’ view(https://www.boxingnews24.com/2023/02/wbc-president-discusses-ranking-jake-paul-gives-reasons/)However, when I check the rankings, either name is not on the top 15 lists.",

That's Andre August. But he's probably an improvement in Jake Paul's opponents.",
