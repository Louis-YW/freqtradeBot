A reputed member said, \"When someone chooses the gas transaction fee automatically, there are many unnecessary fees included, which could have been reduced or deducted.\"As an example, suppose the current fee is set at $1.

It is better to use a reputed wallet that are recommended on this forum. There are two cases recently on the news and that were also discussed on this forum that very higher amount was payed as fee. It is good to know the fee that you used before broadcasting any transaction. Before reputed wallet will broadcast a transaction, the fee paid will first be displayed before you will click on broadcast.OP, if you want to know more about fee rate, or sat/vbyte calculation, you can read this: Minimizing bitcoin transaction feeFee equals to feerate multiply by vbyteFee = feerate*vbyteVbyte is the virtual byte of the transaction.",

If you don't have urgent transaction to make, go with lowest option from whatever site you use to check fees (I personally use https://bitcoinfees.net/ but mempool space is more popular here, as suggested above).I made transaction recently with 43 sats fee, and waited about 8 hours (not really, slept and woke up  ), paid few dollars fee.

I see P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH 2-of-3 multisig, P2WSH 2-of-3 multisig and lastly P2TR (taproot).They are Bitcoin transaction types here are the meanings; Quote from: wwzsocki on September 12, 2019, 11:22:27 AM Simplified explanation of transaction types for beginners.P2PKH: \"Pay To Public Key Hash\" - This is how a big percentage of transactions are made. You are requiring the sender to supply a valid signature (from the private key) and public key. The transaction output script will use the signature and public key after checking the hash of the provided public key with previous output, and through some cryptographic functions will check if the signature is valid, if it was, then the funds will be spendable. This method conceals your public key in the form of a hash for extra security. If the spending condition is set to present a public key hash, then it is a P2PKH TX, and you have the std Op_Dup, Op_Hash160,... structure.P2PK: \"Pay To Public Key\" - Unlike P2PKH that contained the hash of public key; this script contains the public key itself. Anyone using this method to send funds over the P2P network is showing people their public key in the transaction details. The spending condition only requires you to present your public key and signature. The public key would be recognized by your wallet (following the above mentioned coding scheme) as „type 1“ address.P2SH: \"Pay To Script Hash\" - became a standard script in April 2012. The outputs of a transaction are just hash of scripts known as redeemscript that, if are executed with specific parameters, will result in a boolean of true or false. If a miner runs the output script with the supplied parameters and results in true, the money will be sent to your desired output. P2SH is used for multi-signature wallets making the output scripts logic that checks for multiple signatures before accepting the transaction. P2SH can also be used to allow anyone, or no one, to spend the funds. If the output script of a P2SH transaction is just 1 for true, then attempting to spend the output without supplying parameters will just result in 1 making the money spendable by anyone who tries. This also applies to scripts that return 0, making the output spendable by no one.P2WPKH: \"Pay To Witness Public Key Hash\" - This was a feature of segwit which stands for Segregated Witness. Instead of using scriptSig parameters to check the transaction validity, there is a new part of the transaction called witness where the validity occurs. In 2015, Pieter Wuille introduced a new feature to bitcoin called Segregated Witness, also known by its abbreviated name, Segwit. Basically, Segregated Witness moves the proof of ownership from the scriptSig part of the transaction to a new part called the witness of the input.P2MS: \"MultiSignature\" - (multisig) refers to requiring more than one key to authorize a Bitcoin transaction and was first applied to Bitcoin addresses in 2013. Generally used to divide up responsibility for possession of bitcoins. Standard transactions on the Bitcoin network could be called “single-signature transactions,” because transfers require only one signature — from the owner of the private key associated with the Bitcoin address. However, the Bitcoin network supports much more complicated transactions that require the signatures of multiple people before the funds can be transferred. These are often referred to as M-of-N transactions. The idea is that Bitcoins become “encumbered” by providing addresses of multiple parties, thus requiring cooperation of those parties in order to do anything with them. These parties can be people, institutions or programmed scripts. Became a standard script in January 2012.NULL DATA: (OP_RETURN) - transaction type relayed and mined by default in Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 and later that adds arbitrary data to a provably unspendable pubkey script that full nodes don’t have to store in their UTXO database. Anyone can use a NULL DATA script to add some arbitrary data to a transaction, so you can find them scattered around the blockchain. We have to remember that not all miners accept transactions with null-data and not all nodes relay them. (OP_RETURN) outputsLook for empty outputs when browsing the blockchain, as NULL DATA scripts are almost always placed on empty outputs (because the outputs are made unspendable by the lock). Here is a web page with a list of metadata recently embedded in the bitcoin blockchain using OP_RETURN outputs: http://coinsecrets.org/Non-Standart - to include this type of transaction to the Bitcoin Blockchain, an agreement has to be reached with a miner: the non-standard transaction will be then included in the blockchain when the miner resolves the block. Depends on the hash rate from the miner it can be quite a while taking into consideration very high actual difficulty which is rising constantly from the start of Bitcoin. Of course, miner will take a proper fee for the non-standard transaction. If you take your time to read through the source of the quote you will understand better on Bitcoin transactions types",

Quote from: pakhitheboss on December 15, 2023, 01:44:11 PMI do feel they got some random guy to spam without understanding how a signature campaign works.DS is not enrolled in any signature campaign. PureMixerio does not have any signature campaign running.Quote from: pakhitheboss on December 15, 2023, 02:18:20 PMLeft you neutral feedback only because you don't have a simple understanding between the Bitcoin transaction fee and the Ethereum gas fee.Then this part of the feedback you left to DS is irrelevant: \"Promoting a Signature Campaign which is for Bitcoin mixer.\". Right? The problem is that DS does not know how fees work, which is correctly reflected in the second part of your feedback (\"Does not understand how Bitcoin transaction fee works.\"). Therefore I don't understand the usefulness of first part of the feedback.Quote from: DYING_S0UL on December 15, 2023, 02:00:18 PMI am only promoting them because of GazetaBitcoinJust to make sure there is not any misunderstanding here: DS wears his current signature based on his own decision, not because I coerced him somehow to do that. If the fact that I am wearing this signature influenced him to do the same thing, it was a decision taken by him, not by anyone else.",

In addition, this is part of the reason why using a good self custodial wallet is so important, one in which you can customize fees yourself. in a custodial wallet, the service handles withdrawals after collecting a withdrawal fee, sometimes they might end up broadcasting the tx with a very low fee rate and it would be stucked. There have been a few newbies complaining about this issue when they used cash app for their tx.",
