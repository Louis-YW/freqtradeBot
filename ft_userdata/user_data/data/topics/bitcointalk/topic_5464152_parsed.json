  "content": "The only thing you must do to avoid scams when gambling onlineYou must only do one thing to avoid scams when gambling online. So what’s the one thing sports bettors and online gaming players must do to prevent scams? Check it out!The only thing you must do is sign up with a bitcoin or other crypto only online sportsbook and online casinoThe best way to stay safe and avoid scams is to open an online gambling account with a bitcoin only, or other crypto only, online sportsbook or online casino.Sounds simple, but it’s correct. That’s all you must do to ensure you can stay safe and avoid online scams. Check out why it’s true.1. Bitcoin only or crypto only sportsbooks require an email address and that’s itMost online sportsbooks ask for very detailed information. They require your phone number, your physical address, email address, and in some cases, your social security number.Although there are plenty of legit online sportsbooks out there, you’re more exposed the more information you provide.Bitcoin only online gambling organizations like Nitrobetting require an email address and that’s it. All you need is an email address to open a Nitrobetting account.You mustn’t hand over every piece of personal information. That alone makes it safer to play with a bitcoin only or other crypto only online gambling company.2. Some online gambling orgs sell your informationThe best way to avoid scammers is to prevent your information from falling into scammers’ hands. How do you do that?You do that by not giving up your information. Again, there are plenty of solid, legit, honest online sportsbook companies.Some, though, make money by selling your information. Selling someone else’s information is a horrible practice.There’s no way for us to know which companies are selling our information and which don’t. So stop scammers from ever getting your info by not opening an online betting account with any organization that asks for more than just an email address.Read more→ https://n2g.io/fd156fd",

So there will be good casinos as well as scam casino sites but we have to be careful and protect ourselves from scams. Yes I agree with you that most gambling sites are centralized so they can force any gambler to kyc at any time. And that's why before going to gamble on any site, you have to think whether you will stay at that site for a long time.  If you are planning to stay for a long time then it is better to keep kyc complete in advance so that you don't have to face any kind of problem. and to protect yourself always choose trusted and well-reviewed sites",

      "body": "Back then, you'd have no problem picking any crypto sportsbooks since most of them don't require KYC but now it's a bit different. Not all crypto sportsbooks only require an email when creating an account because they can always change their terms and conditions. If you check the table in this thread, there are only a few crypto sportsbooks that don't require KYC, while half of the sportsbooks listed can potentially ask for KYC.Casinos could potentially leak or sell our information, but as Oshosondy mentioned, it's best to pick the top casinos to reduce the chances of it from happening. Picking crypto sportsbooks also works but unfortunately, most gamblers still prefer to gamble with fiat.",

      "body": "Crypto-betting sites are also plagued with a lot of scams. Fiat bookies are not the only one on this endeavor, unfortunately. I don't like KYC but I'd rather play on a gambling platform that enforces this and is already established in the scene rather than a new casino with lots of promotions but doesn't have anything to back itself up when it comes to legitimacy. Of course, platforms with KYC can come clean and still do an exit scam if they'd like. But I guess even without these signs or tips that you have posted, people can do a bit of research about the platform and avoid getting scammed if they wanted to.",

It is an easy choice to segregate the trusted platforms whereas it is really hard to stay away from scams. This is our responsibility, because recently saw a thread in which a platform resembling the same as the original site is being developed and circulated. Someone without looking the URL making his details to login could end up losing his/her funds. Same as that someone making wrong deposit also make him/her loss. Gambling platforms were completely centralized as the KYC is mandatory beyond certain amount of withdrawal. So, we need to be careful while handling our account.",

Signing up \"with a bitcoin or other crypto only online sportsbook and online casino\" doesn't guarantee you that you won't be scammed anymore. That casino itself could be a scam. They could pull an scam exit anytime. It could also happen that you're signing up on a fake site. It's either you're clicking on a phishing link sent through your email, an ad, private message on a social media account, and so on. Or by downloading something you're opening your computer up to a malware which then gives access to a scammer to your casino account.",

Unfortunatelly you have to comply with these requirements. Nowadays there isn't much you can do to avoid KYC procedure.

But if you still want to gamble, you should make sure that the casino you want to use is a casino that has a good reputation and has become a casino recommended by people, especially friends, on this forum. I trust friends recommendations in this forum more than the review sites out there. But from the review sites out there, I trust our friends @efialtis and gamblingbro, who provide reviews of new casinos.And if we want to do KYC, we have to ensure the casino can keep the documents we give them. And we can get that from a trusted and reputable casino because they can really keep the documents from their customers. We can get all of that on this forum where there are lots of popular and trusted casinos so that it can give us a sense of security so we can play gambling in peace.",

A large amount of people who fall victim to these scams (people getting locked out of their accounts with funds, winnings never withdrawn, etc.) is because of the fact that they dealt with shady casinos out there that have not proven themselves among the public. Heck sometimes even \"reputable\" casinos turn out to be like this years after, so it's really hard to pinpoint which one you should trust and which one you shouldn't. But a rule of thumb I employ whenever I gamble is to only play with casinos that I'm already acquainted with. Taking the chance on casinos you haven't tried and tested yet just cause they offer \"bonuses and deposit rewards\" is one of the biggest ways you could lose money in this industry.",

The most important thing in this case is to pay attention to every step when registering. Because not a few people are not careful when they find themselves on online gambling platforms. In the registration steps there are terms and conditions and most people ignore them for reasons of time efficiency, but actually what happens is they are lazy to read them because when they see the terms and conditions they are so long that they span several slides. laziness makes some people to immediately agree without reading it first.So in this context we cannot fully blame the gambling platform, but fraud can also be caused due to our own negligence.",

But then the idea is actually there, casinos ask for KYC stuff but they never ask for your, say, card details and stuff like that. Like really, if it strays outside of say, source of funds, then that's a red flag already.Well in the end if you really wanted to bet at a safe place, you'd go for reputable ones.

The reputation they had built over the years would be destroyed in an instant if they committed fraud.Those who commit fraud are the owners of small gambling platforms. because they don't care about their reputation, they only think about profit and they will do everything they can to make the most profit, including by defrauding people who register on the gambling platform.",
