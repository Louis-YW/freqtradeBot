  "content": "Stumbled over a website called comfyco.us they sell unique furniture, bean bags, sofas, bedding, and pillows. They accept bitcoin & Ethereum which is huge because furniture is a necessity to most people living in homes. But the thing I like about Comfyco.us is how its a unique selection, it's not the standard furniture store they mix in some really neat designs and it's a mix of expensive and affordable. The biggest part is the bitcoin, this is a step closer of what we all want. Bitcoin has the power to be king of all currencies it's just a matter of time. Companies like comfyco.us are bringing us a step closer to that horizon of where all of us want to be. I bought the ball sofa, couple bean bags, pillow, and my most favorite the enigma sofa.",

Things are still cheap here, the last time I visited a furniture fair the prices were close to last year and $3,000 was enough to buy luxury furniture but as I told you things differ from place to place.Quote from: SFR10 on June 23, 2022, 06:07:56 PMDon't bother to cover your tracks [I've already archived everything (including this thread)]!You made me laugh  .
