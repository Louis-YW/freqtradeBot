By buying the buy-in, you will trigger the bonus game feature of that certain casino game that might give you a good chance of getting good profits.

Yes, the bonus can be triggered 3 times.Obviously, luck still plays a role here but just want to know what are your favorite casino games with a buy-in feature. Either you want those games because of the number of free spins given, good multipliers, cheap cost, and many more. I will definitely check those.",

It really triggers a player adrenaline because it started slow and getting fast as it progress.  Though it isn't advisable for players that has epileptic tendency due to the fast flashing of game images.You can try to play it here.[1]A bit description of the game.QuoteDeveloper Push Gaming famously takes their time to fine-tune slots before release to ensure each element is just how they like it. That being the case, it has been some time since we last crossed paths in the Mesopotamian deserts of Wheel of Wonders. From old world ancient history, we turn to a brand new one in a slot that has been titled Land of Zenith. Built around a retro-futuristic  theme, it's been expertly integrated with several smart extras, out of which the Hypermode mechanic is the stand-out feature.QuoteIt is a 6 reel 30 payline ontraption surrounded by brass decorations, including the all-important Disc Mechanism. On the screen’s periphery, floating cities hover amongst clouds as flying machines traverse between them. Aurally, Land of Zenith's music is quite subdued. It’s dreamy, yet a little too dreamy perhaps at moments where it would’ve benefited from a tad bit more energy.Here is the example gameplay of the game: https://youtu.be/DWJklQk1qBMQuote from: swogerino on November 27, 2022, 09:01:15 PMLuck plays a role yes but in games where you can use the buy in feature you can for example play all your predetermined bankroll to play by trying your luck in spending all your balance in these buy ins for the bonus round/feature of the game.I like extreme volatility games when it comes to buy ins so I think for me Money Train 3  from Relax Gaming is well known for its huge volatility so if for example you try 500 dollars all in buying the feature several times it can happen that one time you to hit for example over x30000-40000 of multiplier and this money buying the feature to be well spent,of course the majority of the times you will lose money.If you try to play normally then don't bother with such games as you will get the feature extremely on rare occasions.True luck has a huge play in Buy-in features those who have just enough bankroll of a single buy-in can be considered to have an all-in wager.  The good thing about this buy-in is that our money isn't lost in an instant but instead we can see it slowly growing or slowly depreciating as the bonus round progress.  I agree with you that it is best to buy extreme volatility games bonus because if you got lucky, you can get gigantic profit since extreme volatility games either give you huge amount or nothing.[1] https://www.bigwinboard.com/land-of-zenith-push-gaming-slot-review/",

They will say that \" tsk, if only I use real money\" and I think there are gamblers who will try to play for real after that but we know what can usually happen next. That is they will lose this time and they will regret it again.Aside from the slot game that the op have shared, I think the slot game that you have shared there is also worth trying. I like its mechanics and it doesn't seem boring because every time we get a bonus, there is something new that we will witness but good luck by the way on the challenge that you're going to try.",

      "body": "Bonus buying is interesting when playing Money Train 2 from Relax Gaming, but the interest diminishes along with the losing outcome. If I stake 100× my bet about $150 to unlock the money cart bonus, and end up wining $30 I'll lose interest because I just lost $120 in a bit. However, the wining can be encouraging, which depends on discipline and bank roll. Out of curiosity a player can waste more money with feature buying than playing gradually. Some games offer bonuses after spinning more than 10× it all requires patience. Though, if your bank roll can withstand the loses then its not a problem.",

Everyone I try to 'take advantage' of this feature it seems to be giving me a good win. Next on the list is Book of Shadows already in regular games I've been extremely lucky with in.Money Train 2 as well, good to have buy-in feature and it's worth to used it as per my experience.Glad that you mentioned Pragmatic, but I haven't played with them for a long time like the Fruit party because I'm not a fan of that UI,",

This provider offers a very good graphics and not too high volatility games with high multiplier compared to other provider like Hacksaw and Push that always very hard to hit any huge. Pragmatic Play always have a tournaments and events like cash hunt on all of there games like what they launch last Halloween when they partner on Duelbits for there huge contest. Pragmatic is slowly dominating the slot market that makes them expand to live casino games due to there popularity. I think they are the closest company that rival evolution gaming on slots and live games toe to toe. Or maybe they are already the number/number 1 all the time.",

On these slots, I have many bonus buys. Bonus buy is a fun option, it's the question is it better to buy a bonus or to play normal spins and try to get one? It's pure gambling either way. I busted my balance many times with normal spins without winning a bonus round, in those moments I feel like it would be better to simply buy it, but you can't imagine how many times I got under x5 after buying a bonus! Simple math, $20 bonus buy, under x5 is less than a $1. Never forget about the responsible gambling quote, never spend more than you can afford to lose! Slots are crazy, they can be very generous but they can wipe out your balance in minutes. So don't play them if you are not ready for some loses, normal spins or bonus buying is almost the same.",

But here I played it freely, which is great for sure, I just wonder is there some catch? Thanks a lot for the link, next time we will use it for sure!And we’re happy to hear that you enjoy playing Pragmatic without extra steps at our casino! There’s no catch, we just make it as straightforward as possible for our players to enjoy the games they love, and we’re working on even more as we speak! Stay tuned  Maybe you will be able to play some providers without a VPN as well. Some additional info:-Chipstars Casino Review-Metaspins Casino Review",

But to some, perhaps those who are just into profit, they'd choose convenience or getting it in an instant to generate profit from bonuses. Eitherway, nothing's wrong; it is just a matter of gambler's preference. On my case, I'm siding with people who would prefer getting it through unlocking the feature such as complying with some in game requirements or such. I don't know, maybe I am just satisfied with making it literally as a \"bonis\" from playing. But with games having buy-in features,  unfortunately they are already mentioned by users in this topic and they are Money train and that zenith thing. Well, I enjoyed it but I just enjoy other gambling games more; oreferrably traditionals.",
