If you have not heard about it, you can read about it. A Non-Custodial wallet, Atomic Wallet, being compromisedAtomic Wallet hack losses top $35M, on-chain sleuth reportsAfter MT. Gox, Crytopia and many other exchanges that have been hacked, many people still do not listen. See huge amount of money lost by FTX users. Followed by exchange outflow, thinking people are becoming wise with their coins. Then followed by FTX exchange inflow. People do not want to learn from what they have seen. Let me go to the main point. Who knows what caused the Atomic wallet vulnerability that made many users to lose huge amount of money? We can not know becuase it is a close source wallet. Do not use the wallet that you do not know what it is made up of. Nobody knows if the vulnerability is done by Atomic wallet developers or not because you can not verify its code. If you want open source bitcoin wallet, these are some of them: Open source bitcoin hardware walletsBitcoin open source wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF)If it is bitcoin, you do not need to trust developers or anyone, do not use a close source wallet. Just use the open source wallets that the community will advice you to use. If you see any wallet and you do not know how to verify if it is open source or close source, you can post a topic about the wallet so that people on this forum can tell you if it is open source or not because many wallets are claiming to be open source, like Atomic wallet but which is not open source. Just like how Android will claim they are open source but they are truly not open source.Yogee, can you edit your topic: Do beginners know what closed & open source wallets are?Trustwallet iOS is no more open source.",

You can see it here https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/184-why-is-atomic-wallet-not-open-source where they gave their reasons for not going full open sourced. Open source means the source code is publicly accessible. so a wallet can't really claim open source if the public can't even access its code just like trustwallet whose public code hasn't been updated since binance purchased it.A good wallet should be both open sourced( this doesn't mean all open sourced wallet are safe) and non custodial in nature.

I have searched and go to know that Mycelium is a good open source wallet.But few people argue that it's not completely open source. So how do we verify if it's completely open source or not.If not, then what part of the Mycelium wallet is not open and if it is risky.",

People do not want to learn from what they have seen. I just remember a few weeks ago when Atomic was also in my option in wallets where I will store my ATOM tokens, so that it will earn money passively thru staking. I guess this is a lesson for me who always love staking that always use the wallet that the own developers created, and if they don't have one, don't buy it.As for the people who lost their money in Atomic, I don't know the main reason, but I guess one reason is the fact that they are giving staking rewards when you store your coins there. I guess this is the reason why there are still people who prefer storing their coins in some wallets, or exchanges where they can earn money passively like what Atomic is offering. I just hope that these people who lost their money are still ok, learned their lesson, move on, and move forward.Quote from: _act_ on June 05, 2023, 01:06:36 PMLet me go to the main point.

Atomic wallet isn't an exchange wallet, it is in fact a non-custodial wallet because its users have the keys, but where the problem stems from is that it is a closed source wallet, and so being closed source we cannot verify if truly it is a non-custodial wallet and that the Atomic team do not have a copy of their users keys in their servers or that they are not doing anything dangerous with the keys generated for users.Quote from: LogitechMouse on June 06, 2023, 03:58:18 AMOpen source?

Close source isn't secure, and at the same time open source isn't as well, so what's the difference.You don't have to be a coder to use what is most secure. Bitcoin itself is an open source project and quite a lot of people know nothing about its technical part or how to verify its protocol, but they use Bitcoin because they trust the large community of developers and nodes as well as the technical individuals who constantly check for bugs and other whatnots. Open source wallets are most secure because their codes can be verified, and even if you can't do it yourself, then use what the community has vetted and pointed out as being recommended. If there is a malicious update in an open source wallet, the community will be aware, but in closed source wallets you can prolly just update your wallet and your wallet will be emptied.",

We have to relay on the developers (project owners) to explain to use why we can't have access to our coins been stored using their wallet. We all know they're unlikely to put the blame on them and will always look for an excuse to why they were hack.
