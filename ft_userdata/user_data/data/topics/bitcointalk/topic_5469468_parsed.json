Bitcoin as a whole get only 21 million to mine and that na the reason wey e go always get value unlike the so called fiat currency wey dem dey print anyhow and this printing nai be the major cause wey so many fiat currency dey alway lose their value and worth overtime as for bitcoin no more can be created until that 21 million is mined. So anyone who has a plan to bitcoin na really good plan because bitcoin na currency wey  dey profitable .",

First of all you will have a plan,wether you are buying for trading or for long time investment. If it's a short time, you can talk about investing the amount you can afford to loose. But when you talk about long time that's when you can apply the DCA method. That is investing maybe $5 per week or $10 considering you income source for now.Quote from: Su-asa on October 06, 2023, 09:32:48 PMBitcoin no go fit finish for market even if say the while world buy am today e go still plenty for pipo way done buy am and pipo way never buy am to buy them, Bitcoin no go fit finish for crypto market, no matter the demand way investors go demand for Bitcoin, Bitcoin go still dey plenty.

The only problem that can happen to Bitcoin is sending Bitcoin to a wrong address or forgetting your wallet pass phrase which can trap BTC there. In one inportant thing is that the more Bitcoin lost the more valuable it becomes because the lower the amount of Bitcoin in circulation the higher the value in crypto market.

That is investing maybe $5 per week or $10 considering you income source for now.Samlucy O, you are getting it wrong on how to invest in bitcoin whether short term or long term investment, you should only use the amount that you can afford to lose as a newbie who just started your bitcoin journey because, there is no guarantee that bitcoin price will keep on pumping and will not dump below the your entry point. Why is it advisable to use the amount that you can afford to lose, is because should in case bitcoin price dip below your entry point, you wouldn't be scared that your money will be gone but you wouldn't care about the dip in price because the money that you use to buy bitcoin doesn't matter to you even though you throw it away. With this mindset, it will enable you to keep hodling your bitcoin without selling it and as time goes on the price of bitcoin will pump above the amount that you use to invest. Why is it that DCA is the best method to use in your bitcoin approach because as a beginner, DCA helps you to buy at regular with a specific amount, so that the amount of your bitcoin can keep on increasing gradually with time. Why are you asked to invest in long term because from history, it has shown that bitcoin circle is four years, where there will be a bull run and an ATH price, long term helps you to make profit by benefiting from the bull run and the more the years passes by, the higher bitcoin value increases. But if you invest in short term, it is similar to trading and there is high possibility of running at loss, because you can sell due to panic. Long term is the best way to invest in bitcoin and get good profit.Quote from: Su-asa on October 06, 2023, 09:32:48 PMbelieve say Bitcoin no go fit finish, so anytime way I done ready I go buy am and I go buy the amount way I go fit afford to lose on a daily, Bitcoin no go fit finish for market even if say the while world buy am today e go still plenty for pipo way done buy am and pipo way never buy am to buy them, Bitcoin no go fit finish for crypto market, no matter the demand way investors go demand for Bitcoin, Bitcoin go still dey plenty. (Itz plenty), so I no dey fear at all but I go buy am one-day. OP, if you have the money to invest, the earlier the better for you because make you no forget say everything dey cost everyday by day, come be bitcoin wey dey limited in supply, and na the dynamic of demand and supply na e dey control the price, this means say the longer you dey wait to buy, the higher the price go dey increase because more people wey no get go start to buy as na our future digital gold. Imagine the price of bitcoin at 2015 and now big difference dey and at the same time inflation dey depreciate our Naira.",

Na so my brother bitcoin no dey finish but no dey West time to buy am, because the money go dey increase is better make you buy am now and invest it for long term, know too dey west time for this can opportunity since you get the money now, no con dey regret when the price of bitcoin raises and you don't have enough money to invest again, investors are not afraid of losing if you want to be and investor you need to be risking because any investment you put your money you are already risking, my advice for you now is just invest because is good opportunity for you, and invest waiting you fit lose, but is your choice they no dey force person make him look for money, you never get any much knowledge on bitcoin investment yet that is why you are still dorling.",

BTC will not finish OP, but it can disappear like the way some coins disappeared from the crypto market till today that made many people to learn their lesson not to invest what they can't afford to lose. I'm not trying to discourage you not to invest in BTC, but don't let it be when you have big money before you can invest in BTC because,there is a proverbs that say opportunity come but once, so use this opportunity to buy BTC with the little money you have and hold for the price to flow to your direction before you can sell to have good news to share with your relatives.",

Who dey deceive you like this, we can only have 21 million Bitcoin and make we say everybody buy 1 that mean na only 21 million people wey go fit get Bitcoin but this one no be the reality as no be everybody wey go fit afford one Bitcoin and some people go wan buy more than one. Also no forget say some Bitcoin will be lost forever as people go die leave am or sent to wrong address that are in unaccessible wallets. For market no be everybody go put their Bitcoin for market for trading, some Bitcoin will be held in wallets. Make those volume dem wey dey exchange no deceive you because most of dem na wash trading. When you trade Bitcoin on centralized exchanges no be the real Bitcoin wey you dey trade but just numbers, na until you withdraw na when dem go send you real Bitcoin that's why we're encourage to always withdraw our Bitcoin from exchanges.Bitcoin no dey unlimited instead e dey limited which means e go fit finish so no dey play with the one wey you get. No rush go invest in Bitcoin until you understand am well and no go use money wey you go need urgently go invest inside Bitcoin but no dey wait to invest as that's not how smart investors dem dey think. Smart investors buy and wait and make profits. That's why you accumulate Bitcoin in the bear market and wait to take profits when your target price dun reach. No think say Bitcoin go wait for you oh as any minute you procrastinate to invest inside na yourself wey you dey do. You no need to buy one Bitcoin one time, you fit dey DCA wey be Dollar cost average and how you go do this one na to dey buy small small Bitcoin of the same amount anything you get money until you dun hit the traget of Bitcoin wey you wan HODL.",
