Bad suggestion, when the country are ban Bitcoin, centralized exchanges will do same because they need to follow regulation. Even they didn't state it, you will get a problem after you submit your KYC.2. Worst suggestion, you linked your debit/credit card with Bitcoin? your banks and your government will know if you're buy and sell Bitcoin.3. Be careful not all P2P is real P2P, Binance P2P is fake P2P. The real P2P will not ask KYC e.g. agoradesk.My suggestion: use DEX e.g. Bisq.",

But for now though, he just decided to close it for now. Or maybe you can PM him.But as far as P2P though, yes, as per my experience, just be very careful when you used platforms such as Binance.  There are many scammers plowing on that exchange too. So you need to be very vigilant and not just released your bitcoin even in the other side says that he/she has sent the money already. You have to check your banks if that is where you agree or online wallets, before you released everything.",

      "body": "About the thread, it appears you're trying to make a FAQ but it's too short, my dude... Further, always try to look into yourself if you're fit to make such informative threads otherwise, it could backfire.For question #2, it's better to add webites such as coingecko so people can see the updated price. Honestly, I'd be afraid to use custodial/centralized exchanges-- where'd I have to give out any of my identifying personal information-- if this was the stance of my country. I would rather use P2P exhanges with E2E encryption so there'll be no midman in the conversation.If memory serves right, I did hear btc doing well in Bangladesh so my guess is laws aren't enforceable or the authorities simply don't do any effort in enforcing it so it has been pretty much nothing to a lot of citizens, I would still err on the side of caution though.",

I am not from the country but I have seen reports of arrest of some cryptocurrency traders in the country. QuoteQuestion 2 : How much is 1 Bitcoin in Bangla Taka?Answer : According to the latest exchange rates, 1 Bitcoin is equal to 2,964,069.99 BDT. This means that you can buy 0.00000034 BTC with 1 BDT.You don't really need to post this information here. It can be easily derived by a simple search. QuoteQuestion 3 : How to buy Bitcoin in Bangladesh?Answer : Buying Bitcoin in Bangladesh is not a simple or legal process, as the Bangladeshi government has declared cryptocurrencies illegal and prohibited.

This is because the cyber and special crime unit can easily track the transaction and unveil the identity of those behind the transaction. It is better to use a CEX and promote P2P transactions. Privacy is important while dealing with crypto in a country where it is banned.",

Is it typographical error or what? $6k? If it's typo error then you should edit your post and change it to $26.7k. If it's not typo, you should offer some more explanation.

I don't know about Bangladesh but here in my country, if you mistakenly linked your bank card with anything associated with bitcoin, you have cause problem for yourself because your account will be freez and you'll be invited for questioning before you have the account back to operation. During this questioning, if care is not taken, you might be prosecuted for violating the rules.",

Since all of these are gonna require you to head over an exchange whether they're P2P or stop or through direct credit/debit card of your choice. You'll be required to input where you are from and if typing Bangladesh there, these services and platforms are aware that it's illegal in there so why they allow so? Also, these exchanges will record your IP addresses that they might be asked on them if it turns out that the government of yours finds out that you're doing an illegal thing which is just simply buying bitcoin.",

Centralized exchanges isn’t an option because most CEXs require customers to submit kyc and when you do provide your personal documents, it is likely that your account will be flagged and frozen.  I think you should post this topic in the Bangladesh local board.
