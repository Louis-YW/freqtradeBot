That's why I changed my email address from Gmail to my personal webmail. I'm receiving every other mail, but no mail from bitcointalk. The first few days were great, I was receiving notifications of new thread creation on my subscribed board but now, I haven't received notifications of new thread creation on my subscribed board. Anything I should adjust or tips from anyone?",

Have you tried to unsubscribe notifs from the setting page on profile and subscribing back? Have you tried logout and login again? Maybe browser settings is somehow involved but if you use tor they won't.Who needs email notifs from new topics/ replies anyways. Lol. Just wait for a train of well informed members coming in order to help you out. Lol again.",

The previous thread for which I have received notification has been created after the creation of the 2nd thread for which I didn't receive any notification. The only possible scene here I can think of is, \"The thread has been moved from another board to which I didn't subscribe for notification.\" But nothing is confirmed, just my guess.",

Take note that the forum doesn't send you notification for any new topic made on a broad you have subscribed to. I guess you haven't ever noticed the message written on the new topic notification emails the forum sends you. \"More topics may be posted, but you won't receive more email notifications until you return to the board and read some of them.\"",

Anything I should adjust or tips from anyone?What i noticed about their notification concerning the email is that once they sent you a few couples of notifications in which you find no time to check them by clicking on the link to redirect you to the forum, they may stop sending you further more not until you also start reading and clicking on them on the forum, i think it's a best idea they have adopted in other to avoid accumulating notifications set by users even while they were no more active on the forum, so it's an indication that you're active and follow up with the updates they always notify you, the alternative to this is the telegram bot which is only available for tracking threads and not boards, the more reasons some preferred the notify me function through their mail, but you must be clicking on the links on updates sent.",

Sometimes, there occurs bounced emails resulting to undelivered messages.Check out my reply againIf you subscribe for new posts for Meta. So long as you keep posting in the board topics every few days, then you will keep receiving notifications. Once you stop replying like for say over 1 week, the notifications for newly created topics stop coming. Once you post again in the board after the break, the notifications will start coming againI checked your post history, and you seem to reply topics in Meta after every few days, which is the normal threshold for you to be able to receive more notifications.That is what I personally observed.",
