If I have spouce already, I will never hide it from her too. I gamble responsibly and no issue. The only people I can hide it for are my children and I will like to educate them appropriately about gambling too. To hide it or not for children is still what I always think about, because you can hide it and that does not mean any of your child can not fall victim of being addicted, but I am still contemplating on that if it is worthy or not.",

My wife will gonna blame it to all my mistakes that I will made in case he knows that I’m still gambling. We are always fighting before because of gambling because sometimes I’m easily being irritated whenever I lose so I decided to play in moderate and make it in secret from my wife because she knew that I already quit to avoid so much fighting.My decision to make it secret is the best decision that I made because we never since he is not blaming me anymore and I can control now my emotion too when playing because I need to be quiet to keep it a secret to my wife.",

Why should I do that? They know that I am a responsible man with no addiction whatsoever. I always tell people that you should not do what you are ashamed of, I am not ashamed of gambling because I play responsibly with a little amount of money, and I don't overstretch my limit too. You might see me betting for a whole week and not bet for the rest of the month, so I am in control which is the right psychology for the game. And for the record, I mostly gamble when I am bored and I have a higher winning rate, so it is all good and open for me.",

Also, I can consider myself a responsible gambler since I never get over my allocated limit for my gambling expenses. Maybe, I could consider hiding my gambling activities before I was an irresponsible gambler who always gets emotional when playing and I often deposit more once my allocated bankroll has been lost.",

It is seen as a waste of time and resources, hence it is important you keep your gambling activity secret to avoid backlash and sometimes insults. Sometimes you don't blame them because most gamblers in my area are taking gambling as a full-time job, thereby becoming less productive. But my wife understands my financial status and she understands how I handle my money so she knows about my gambling life. She understands that I only use my extra funds for games and it has never affected the provision of our basic needs. But my extended family knows nothing about my gambling life because they would misunderstand my gambling life.",

I wouldn't actively bring up a conversation on this topic, as to avoid accidentally encouraging someone who might not have a good grasp of the statistics or odds involved, and because it can lead to terrible addictions for certain people. However if the topic does come up in a social circle that understands the risks, then it can make for interesting conversations. If you're hiding this sort of chat, then it's possibly because you know you're losing and should perhaps quit it altogether.",
