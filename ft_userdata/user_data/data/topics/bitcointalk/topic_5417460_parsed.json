Aside from that I am really looking into their product.Emphasizing that use case must be the top notch answered here since that will be the basis of the demand for the project. Typical example is bitcoin, which use as stored of value and primarily a convenience like fiat money in most areas. There are plenty of other projects that has realistically useful on our modern lives.These criteria might not be solid during early inception but the key there is the risk you are willing to take on such investment.",

I personally only invest into projects that have a real use-case that i can understand, so i would never invest into meme-coins. If i find the use-case interesting then i take a look at the whitepaper and check if it is written well or just copied together from other projects. I also take a look at the team, if the team just consists of two anonymous Devs for example then you should be wary already in my opinion.Finally i check what VC's have already invested into that project. Yesterday i was reading about magicsquare for example and they already have BinanceLabs, Huobi, Kucoin and Gate.io as their investors for example. So i will try to buy a few of those tokens once they go live.",

Very correct, checking to ensure that all your criteria's for selecting a new project to invest in check out, it still does not eliminate the risk involved in investing in a new project, which is something you must understand. A group of highly educated scammers can come across the criteria's mentioned and know exactly where to work on to ensure that they increase believability in their project, they would not mind recruiting skilled individuals who can assist them in getting their aim. We all should be careful and not be too much in a hurry to invest in new projects even if they meet our criteria. Check with other persons to know their criteria and to know if the project checks out well, their criteria's may be more investigative.",

I look at:1. The maximum supply and then I equate it with its trading price â€“ If price is high, the supply has to be small and vice versa.2. Utility/usecase â€“ I won't throw my cash on a phantom project whose dev has little or zero knowledge of how crypto works.3. Social media presence â€“ This is very important because community is key in publicity and information spread.4. Industry the project is centered on â€“ I avoid projects on saturated area. For instance, I run away from any project going into games. The hype there has died down.5. Auditor â€“ I use this if I'm still skeptical and trying to look for an excuse not to go in ðŸ˜†",

Utility - I see this as important because the project who usually have the usage can attract more investors.2. Network - Cheaper network are more attractive, I also consider this one as my criteria.3. Hype - Hype might not be good to some but for me, some project becomes more successful if they are a good hype which of course came from their project itself and not just a hype.4. Promotions - Active campaigns are very effective, they should have this even if the project goes live.5. Future Plans - For a continuous growth, their future plan is very important some project become stagnant and sees no progress after many years, this is not a good strategy for them if they want to stay in cryptomarket, future plans should be there.",

This is crucial especially to newly introduced projects; some would be popular at first but in the long run, there's a tendency for its demand to fall if some factors would be missing or negatively affected.On choosing a project it could either be subjective or not. An investor may depend to other investors on which is which, and he/she may also create his/her own judgement. Ofcourse it won't always be a winning investment, there'll be loss sometimes or often, and this is where luck may take place.",

These tokens are good for speculation, but not for long-term investment. While the examples of SHIB and DOGE refute my assertion, they are more of an exception, confirming the rule that this type of investment is garbage. I support the idea about venture capitalists, because this is one of the main features of project development, if there are no large funds, it means there is no big money in the project.",

After the project most have sold their ideology to me, I move to understand their token economy to get how that could affect the price of a token. What a project is currently value doesn't usually matter when the token economy isn't friendly. Some project doesn't start with the full supply when listing and have a vetting schedule to introduce new coins into the circulating supply which would definitely drive down the price of the project. Next I research on the team of the project, making sure this users have past experiences and not some young scammers wanting to defraud investors mostly the novices that are yet to understand how things actually work in the industry.",
