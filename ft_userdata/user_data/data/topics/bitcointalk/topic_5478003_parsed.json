Probably you avail 3rd party services on listing to coinmarketcap and not the official one although CMC employee sometimes deliberately delaying the listing application through the official way just to make people use this kind of shady 3rd party listing.Official listing can take weeks or months due to heavy volume of applications but I’m really sure you avail 3rd party service of listing which is not CMC scope anymore.",

We will only issue an invoice if we are confident of meeting the deadline after performing an internal feasibility analysis.Quote from: https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP-While our automated system does much of the heavy-lifting, we still receive thousands of requests for listings and page updates, resulting in a sizable backlog. For these reasons, we now offer a tiered fee model for those who want us to quickly process non-automated updates. This safeguards our ability to provide industry-leading crypto asset data, allowing us to:and looks like those that could avail a free of charge service are exchanges that have a good traction already Quote from: https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP-We will continue to closely monitor market trends and prioritize listings/requests that have strong industry interest/traction for free to ensure that our data is as (verifiably) accurate and comprehensive as possible.",

So you will get pieces of advice from people who haven't gone through the same process. Anyway, with a delay of almost 1 month and hearing nothing from them, I can only hope that your friend directly applied with CMC and not through an unauthorized intermediary, or even a scammer. Did your friend receive an official invoice from CMC itself? I don't know how trustworthy CMC is in terms of exchange listing but there must be something wrong going on when a response is long overdue when CMC itself guarantees that \"we will only issue an invoice if we are confident of meeting the deadline after performing an internal feasibility analysis.\"",

This is common in most of the reputable services and websites that we have. Why did you paid upfront without even dealing or checking the entire thing if they're from the actual website. Tell us more about your friend paying for the listing because it won't take that much long whenever it's from the verified coinmarketcap staff. Much better to ask your friend before going here, pay a visit to the official website of coinmarketcap.com and check all the transactions, domains, emails or letters that he has interacted with that probable fake representative.",

Yes, I could see the need to confirm whether op has used a 3rd party listing service or not but given the information presented currently, we can't be \"sure\" of either possibilities \"yet\" which was my point.

Once you pay, your project should be listed within 24 hours. I have listed many projects myself. Just make sure you haven't been deceived by a scammer.",

Because here there are more than 2M+ Cryptos and the number continues to increase insanely, so I would not be surprised if they asked for a million dollars for listing, because it is difficult to remember the name of 100 cryptocurrencies, let alone the investment, so they give free listing for distinguished projects because people will search for their price on coinmarketcap.com and will visit The site means more money from ads or you need to have a paid profits.",
