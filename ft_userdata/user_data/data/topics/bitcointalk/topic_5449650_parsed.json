Without Bitcoin halving, those contributors are non sense. In bull run, you will see many technologies sound like are making revolution for blockchain technology and the world but after the bull run goes away, they won't make any revolution at all. So at beginning and the end, Bitcoin halving is a reason.You can count down days till the halving which is about 372 days.https://bitcoinblockhalf.com/",

That's the numba one thing that will fuel up the Bitcoin price to break the $100k price zone in the next year or by 2025.The second thing is a tech giant like Apple announcing direct support for Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, and Apple Pay to integrate Crypto payments. That will be a game-changer.Third will be a new country introducing Bitcoin as its official currency just like El Salvador. Maybe a country like Brazil might introduce it or Mexico? It will be a country from America.These 3 things I believe will be having the biggest impact in pulling up Bitcoin's price in terms of USD. Otherwise, 1 BTC = 1 BTC.One should focus on collecting bits instead of collecting papers. Believe me, it will be fruitful. For all of us.One more thing is to focus on Global Crypto Adoption, it's really important for the growth of the Crypto economy.Source: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/",

Really.I really don't get why the halving so often gets ignored when someone reasons about one of Bitcoin's -- and with it, crypto's -- current or future bull runs. And that despite it being one of Bitcoin's most prominent features and having shown strong correlation with price increases like clockwork for more than a decade at this point.Granted, the supply shocks get less and less pronounced with each subsequent halving, so the jury is still out on how much or little impact future halvings will have. But completely ignoring it is still strange to me.That being said, once the FED and other central banks decrease interest rates again, it will likely have an impact on crypto alongside stocks. I just don't think it's going to be the trigger.",

Really.Pretty much this.Everything follows the price & trend of bitcoin so cutting the supply of newly mined coins every 4 years creates a supply shock & after a little while this sends the price up, hopefully violently. There really is nothing else tyat sends all coins up. You might get the odd scam coin with low liquidity randomly pumping every now & again ($PEPE) but itâ€™s only the halving that creates a crypto wide pump.Letâ€™s look forward to the halving, not long to go now, less than a year.",

Lowering interest rates by the fed could also encourage investment into the crypto market. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable.While the three factors you mentioned can certainly play a role in triggering the next crypto bull run there are many other variables that can also have an impact such as government regulation factors, geopolitical events and technological advances can all impact the price and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Well, this is where it is important for investors or anyone else to stay informed and careful when investing in the volatile crypto market.",

We cannot predict what will happen in the future, everything can change but believe in history until there is new history. The OP forgot that the halving event is the most important for creating a bull run. But interest rates also play an important role in bitcoin's recovery, if we pay attention because every time the Fed announces an increase or decrease in interest rates affects the market. This is the first time bitcoin has faced crisis and inflation, so it is difficult to say if it will affect its bull run?",

This event is called halving because it cuts the rate at which new bitcoins are released into circulation in half.You may get more explanation from the source link here and wish this serves you more better if think the feedback here isn't enough for you.",

I mean, looking at these three factors you've mentioned, I can definitely see how they could play a role in driving the market.For my opinion, scaling is super important because it addresses some of the major pain points users currently face, like high fees and slow transactions. If we can achieve higher throughput and lower fees, I believe it would make cryptocurrencies more attractive for everyday use, which could lead to more adoption. But remember, always exciting to see how the market evolves, and I'm sure there will be plenty of surprises along the way.",
