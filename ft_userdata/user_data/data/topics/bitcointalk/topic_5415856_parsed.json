Not to mention that ethereum had a much lower difficulty so people mined it using GPUs whereas you can't mind bitcoin with a GPUs, you'll need ASICs which need to be bought and delivered.There is an ETH ASIC available too but again that ASIC is designed to mine Keccak not SHA256 so it can't be used to mine bitcoin (so ether miners using those ASICs can't just switch to bitcoin).Most likely all those ETH miners would simply switch to another shitcoin with similar algorithm (like ETC) or a shitcoin that can be mined using GPUs.",

The culprit behind the spike is probably another batch being delivered, October was a schedule for the first batch of S19 hydros, and usually, the buyers for those are doing it at the 190 MQO batches.Also what DaveF said, prices and electricity availability are slowly going down in a few states and suspended operations are plugging again.",

I was under the impression they were still mining using really geared up GPUs....You are behind for almost a decade. The First Bitcoin ASIC Miner was introduced back in 2012. Since then, ASICs take over Bitcoin mining. I don't know when the last time GPU was able to mine SHA-256 was. The full form of ASIC is Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asic.asp#:~:text=An%20ASIC%20miner%20is%20a,miner%20can%20mine%20only%20bitcoin.An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is an integrated circuit chip designed for a specific purpose. An ASIC miner is a computerized device that uses ASICs for the sole purpose of \"mining\" digital currency. Generally, each ASIC miner is constructed to mine a specific digital currency. So, a Bitcoin ASIC miner can mine only bitcoin. One way to think about bitcoin ASICs is as specialized bitcoin mining computers optimized to solve the mining algorithm",
