      "body": "Everything that has advantages also has disadvantages. Institutional investors attract more money and attention to the Bitcoin space. Many people who never knew anything about the currency will begin to be aware of what Bitcoin stands for. Some persons would never have invested in Bitcoin if not for the ETF because they can't keep their keys or passwords safe. But all this attention and increased Investment comes with a price which is centralisation and loss of privacy. The only reason why the SEC approved the ETF is because they have devised various mechanisms to control the sector. We cannot stop these investors from acquiring Bitcoin because it is a free market but we can still maintain our privacy and enjoy decentralization. Nobody will force you to sell your coin to anybody, it's still a matter of choice. It will also be difficult for these institutions to control the market because Bitcoin is still decentralized. I sense that the government will target decentralized platforms shortly but for now, we still have a choice. Quote from: Kakmakr on January 19, 2024, 05:51:13 AMI hope people are not too blinded by greed to see the dangers of Bitcoin ETFs and the centralization of the tokens in Fiat controlled trading platforms. People will always invest in profitable areas. The only problem is that they are investing in the right commodity through the wrong channel. Sadly many of them don't know the implications of what they are doing because they don't have enough information about Bitcoin. Maybe a hack or bankruptcy of these centralized platforms will force them to learn more.",

IMOWhy are people afraid of manipulation from those funds because even without ETFs, the market is being manipulated by bigger players? Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been a market rife with manipulation since its inception and it remains so until now, I think no one is unaware of that. I'm not saying ETFs are good but everything has its pros and cons. Perhaps now funds like blackrock and greyscale are using their power and wealth to manipulate the market. But why don't we think further when in the future there will be many funds and investors participating in the market and helping the market become even stronger? And once the market gets bigger, price manipulation gradually disappears. ETFs will indeed reduce bitcoin's decentralization, but that's the price we have to pay if we want bitcoin to become more popular.",

Let's discuss.. Do you still think Bitcoin ETFs are the Knight on the white horse? I've had thoughts like yours for a long time, but because of the hype, I finally didn't continue with those thoughts because Bitcoin investor friends always thought that ETF approval could create bullishness. When we talk about bullish that means for me it's a positive thing but on the other hand there is a point that we forget institutions want to control the market as they please. This idea continues to be opposed by everyone I know and they ignore the negatives. I admit that the existence of this ETF is a time bomb for Bitcoin because the control of large owners is no longer in the community but in a large entity which already has experience in the global market. Therefore, people now have to become aware and pay attention to the Bitcoin market. Is a bullish increase occurring? or vice versa? Maybe with this incident there are many of us who admit and say: it turns out Bitcoin is better off not being infiltrated by big institutions because this will create more differentiation between us retailers and those institutional whales.",

I believe it was totally out of context as scams do not relate to Bitcoin ETF. What I felt after going through his posting history is that he is into gambling and with the recent decision by Hhampuz to remove fossils from his signature campaign he is trying to act as a realistic and active participant of a signature campaign. I have zero clue what he is trying to gain from this thread after ETFs have been approved. Practically ETFs are nothing but a piece of paper given to anyone investing in Bitcoin. Whereas we as a community have the real satoshis in our wallets and we are proud of it. ETFs for me is a way to gain control over those who want to invest in Bitcoin but are clueless. It is evident with the current price of bitcoin, & that ETFs are not the ones we thought that the price of Bitcoin would pump.

Let's discuss.. Do you still think Bitcoin ETFs are the Knight on the white horse? 1. Nothing wrong with this. People can choose to use Bitcoin in whatever way they want. It's hard money, if they want to use it purely as an investment or store of value through an investment broker that is perfectly fine.2. Commodity, currency...these are just labels. Bitcoin is what it is. ETFs existing don't change what it is. ETF doesn't change one line of code of the bitcoin protocol. Nothing is destroyed by ETFs existing.3. This is basically a repeat of #1, and again, nothing wrong with this. PEOPLE decide if they want to buy an ETF or buy actual Bitcoin. They are free to decide what they want to do.4. If this is talking about the issuers of the ETFs, they literally just have to buy and sell however much bitcoin according to how much of the ETF the investors are buying and selling. The issuers don't decide how much bitcoin they buy and sell. This is not manipulation, it's just an investment vehicle. Also I have no idea why some people equate ownership of bitcoins to ownership over Bitcoin. The two are not remotely the same thing. Bitcoin is decentralized and \"ownership\", if anything, would be the many thousands of bitcoin nodes and miners, not who owns how many Sats.5. Don't even know why this point is being made. People investing in bitcoin through an ETF don't have access to the actual bitcoin so pseudo-anonymity isn't even an issue because they don't own bitcoin.6. At a time when seemingly every other day someone makes a thread on here complaining about the tx fees (even when the fees are back down to like $2 lol) you are claiming that we are going to see an issue with fees not being high enough in the future even as Bitcoin adoption grows massively. I have no idea why anyone would ever worry about this because it is the opposite of a problem for Bitcoin. At not point will not-filled blocks ever be an issue, the issue is getting L2 solutions ready so that everyone isn't trying to cram into tiny blocks and paying ridiculous fees in the future. So this is a total non-worry.Bitcoin ETFs are not a Knight on a white horse, not sure anyone would ever describe it as that. But it is also not some evil thing lol. Nothing whatsoever wrong with ETFs. Nobody is forced to buy the ETF instead of buying Sats. People are excited about ETF because it means more buying of Bitcoin and therefore a higher price, and a higher price means more people adopting Bitcoin (cuz let's be honest almost everyone first gets into bitcoin for its ability to increase one's wealth), so it means Bitcoin growth in the world. It is silly to try to make ETFs to be some bad evil thing just because it is very different than owning actual bitcoin. It's an investment vehicle that will lead to a higher price of bitcoin and therefore more bitcoin adoption, that's it. Neither good nor evil, but good for bitcoin adoption.",

On the contrary, they made the Bitcoin price go down initially and it will remain the same till halving.It initially became hype and even fake news about ETFs made the price of Bitcoin rise.But when the ETF was actually approved, after that the price of Bitcoin began to fall and finally arrived at the current price which touched $40k again and previously almost reached $50k. ETFs have always been a never-ending drama, which makes the price of Bitcoin even more volatile. Somehow it ended, and what will happen to the Bitcoin market after the halving occurs. Whether the ETF will support bitcoin to continue rising to reach ATH or will it just be a fortune.",

Remember the day before the official ETF approval, when SEC's twitter profile posted that bitcoin ETFs were official approved? The price shot up from around 44k to almost 48k, only to fall down further after they deleted the tweet and claimed it was a hack. The day after, when it was finally official, the market didn't react in a similar fashion. And now, it's moving downwards, contrary to everyone's expectations. But it's not surprising because many people were saying that a big correction is around the corner. Maybe the last one before the halving hype.",

      "body": "Bitcoin Spot ETFs will bring more capital to Bitcoin market and it can help Bitcoin to get higher price. It is good but there are other things like with Bitcoin Spot ETFs and companies from Wall Street, it will force SEC or CFTC and even the USA. Congress to make new laws and stricter regulations on this market.With more and stricter regulations, in future this market will get less volatility and it means we will see something similar to gold market. It will happen when Bitcoin marketcap becomes much bigger and maybe we will have two or three more cycles to get to that big marketcap.https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/",

Whether we like it or not, there's no way to stop whatever fuels this adoption of Bitcoin and the advantages and disadvantages that this Bitcoin Spot ETF brings to it. Whatever happens, happens and that's what we have to embrace. One thing is that for sure is, Bitcoin's move isn't stagnant as an investment based on these events.",
