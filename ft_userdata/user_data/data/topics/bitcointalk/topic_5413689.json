Which made me question other blockchains. In the technical definition of a payment processor (PP), Bitcoin was not meant or designed to act that way. A payment processor, although described a bit differently by different website, has some similar terms across all definitions, in how it mediates between buyers and sellers, or in a more basic term credit and debit (cards).PP acts as a middle man or intermediary, enabling user A, to send funds to user B, more easily and efficiently, despite barriers like banks, currency or border. It's effectively a third party.Bitcoin is not a third party, infact it eliminates the need for one and allows users transact P2P, so it's not meant to be on that list.",

Which made me also question other blockchains that are known for instant payment and less fee. Nope, bitcoin was not meant to be a payment processor, bitcoin is a currency like the $ or £ that can be used to make payment, you can't find any currency on that list can you, so surely you can't find bitcoin. Bitcoin like other currencies can be used by merchants to collect payment through payment processors sometimes, that is if the merchant doesn't want to hold bitcoin, so the payment processor converts the bitcoin to fiat for them immediately, that alone lets you know that it isn't a payment processor in itself, but a payment option.",

Bitcoin alone cannot offer payment protection unlike those you mentioned which surely is being maintained and regulated by a third-party.If we're going to talk about payment processors that are crypto-related, we can mention Coinbase, Coinpayments, and Bitpay. I had not used those payment processors yet, but those were what I can recall \"payment processors\" that we're talking about in this thread.Bitcoin has been part of many payment processors, but Bitcoin alone cannot be a payment processor since it is decentralized.",

Since bitcoin is solely based on miners energy and every computer that registered the nodes it’s highly impossible it will become completely free of cost and be instant Like UPI. There are many applications though which claim instant payment transfer but as we know bitcoins transfer can only be confirmed if it has at least one network confirmation. That contributes to its “confidence”. So nothings instant here. However, its being valued for its border less transfers which is for sure instant and cheap as compared to SWIFT and other services.",

We do understand that there are indeed people whose really that too optimistic when it comes to Bitcoin adoption which it isnt really that bad to have those hopes or expectation for it to be included as one of themain global payment method or options we do have but just as mentioned that we arent still on that situation yet which we could see it everywhere.Of course we do really have that regulations and recognition and it would really vary out on very corners of the world and if ever if the vast or majority of countries wouldnt really be having any problems on accepting bitcoin then we might possibly able to seeits name in together with those common or universal payment processors.",

Dude, Bitcoin is a DIGITAL currency --though it has spent a decade trying to gain a space,it is not a legal tender and that where the confusion begins. Don't you understand when something is acceptable by everyone as a medium of exchange?? that no matter how conspicuous and digitally encrafted the process might look-- in as much as it is processed and the bucks are confirmed-- it is tolerable to the government?Paypal,visa, MasterCard etc are all serving protocols for THE SAME transaction in different entrepreneurships. The whole process only makes FIAT credible at the tail-end.Your aspirations are gonna be possible if it's adopted.CheersSandra👩‍🦱",

Obviously, only the process is digitized and revolutionary and the underlying currency is still fiat. But trust me when you use it you feel this can be the easiest mode of the payment absolutely hazzle free and absolutely safe as no one can make payment unless they have access to your phone and UPI Pin. It more or less feels like a mycelium wallet with immediate payment and zero fees and I doubt any other country has such a spectacular system. But obviously bitcoin and blockchain are something absolutely different and can't be intermingled with UPI.",

I originally viewed quickteller to be the processors but, I now know better after a little research to the topic.If we were to view bitcoin for a processor and the blockchains as its gateway, where do we place the miners. Maybe the miners would fit better but that's not it anyway.Processors are meant to send and receive transactions and where we see that happen is between sent and change address.Isn't that the job of miners?Technically, can we classify them to fit in as the processors in bitcoin payment as verifiers of transactions.",

We can't compare Bitcoin to any centralized payment processors, they are centralized which means under control and monitored by the government, they are also can be linked to the bank or to your bank account and while Bitcoin can't.  They're helping e-commerce companies more easily accept online transactions, though Bitcoin did that, but since it's not regulated it can't compete with any payment processor.I didn't doubt Visa and Mastercard were the leading Payment Processor.",
