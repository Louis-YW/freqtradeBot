No one wants to play a boring game or use a dull website, and if you want them to keep coming back for more chances of winning money, you need to make your site engaging and fun. If you can't do this, you won't be able to compete with other games and sites in the industry, and people will start looking elsewhere for their entertainment, and you'll lose out on lucrative opportunities. Gambling is, at its core, entertainment. And like all entertainment industries, the one that's most likely to succeed is the one who can produce the fun and exciting content viewers want. It's no different in online gambling. If you want to achieve your long-term goals of success, then create the best overall product you can, a product people will come back time and time again to play.",

If this is a big and trusted sportsbetting in Indonesia, it wouldn't be introduced this way in the forum or at least they will layout an ANN thread with infographics on it.

I think at this time gambling sites are not very safe because there are many cases of gambling sites being closed and owners being arrested by the police in Indonesia, so it's vulnerable to transact between banks there. I will avoid this because I'm more interested in using crypto to play on gambling sites. , I just visited and read information about your gambling site",

On the desktop version, they also don't make a choice of language. I know we can auto-translate to English with right-click, but sometimes I find several languages is not translated to English. And, I think this site is not for the outside countries from Indonesia, because we need an Indonesia Bank Account to deposit. This site hasn't been licensed.",
