Second best should be Ethereum for speculation purposes, that's because Ethereum is an advanced blockchain that supports DApps on it.",

But you still could pay as long as your wallet gives you the option to prioritize your transaction. BTC is the most traded coin, people may say they like it the most because it's the most decentralized coin. To me, its because I am certain the price will be higher the longer you hold BTC.XMR is delisted in many exchanges that's why there was even a wrapped XMR these days I think its ticker is XMRT. A lot are using Monero but you have to be careful in offering it as your payment.",

When talking about bitcoin, people will definitely talk about the advantages and why bitcoin is considered the best investment because bitcoin is able to maintain its value. Every time we place money in bitcoin it is much safer because its value continues to increase, even though during a correction the value can decrease, but there is always a moment of recovery which allows the value to continue to increase.Quote from: ContentWriter on July 09, 2024, 03:47:13 PMWhich has been your favorite and second-best? ETH is the closest competitor, but the concept is different and if asked about the best, there may be no similarities to Bitcoin. ETH also has a large market capitalization and makes itself second. But talking about exploiting profits in the short term, there are still many other coins that could possibly be utilized.",

      "body": "I personally put Monero and Bitcoin on just about the same level.  They can both be Payment Systems that work very well, but while Bitcoin is a Public Ledger that is only semi hated by the Governments, Monero is a Private Ledger that is completely hated by them.  On the plus side, you have a level of Privacy with Monero that you can not obtain from Bitcoin and Transaction Fees are so much lower.Besides these two, the rest of Altcoins are in my opinion only volatile experiments, Scams or speculative Assets.  None of them ever got to shine as well as Monero did to me so far.Quote from: Patikno on July 09, 2024, 06:13:54 PMNot afraid of losing value? Monero has been delisted on many large exchanges, which means that Monero will no longer get much attention in the market.I truly believe Monero may be used more as a Currency than Bitcoin is right now.  Monero is used mostly underground, which is to be very expected considering it is a Privacy Coin.  Whether Centralized Exchanges list it or not is in my opinion not a variable of how much attention it gets for the same reason.  I suppose most of us who use Monero are also using Bisq or testing Haveno and are avoiding Centralized Exchanges as much as we can.  More over, the hatred is to be expected and in my opinion nothing new.  We saw this hatred for years and it will likely never end any time soon.  For the reasons above, all the 'unfortunate happenings' related to Monero are I would say nothing to be afraid of as a user.In fact.  While I absolutely love Bitcoin and I always try as much as I can to use it as a Payment System, I found I Spend and Receive so much more often Peer to Peer using Monero.  I just think the Peer to Peer community of Monero is so much larger.",

For all we know, many of them are also using centralized Bitcoin services, a big betrayal of the very raison d'être of Bitcoin. There are still some bitcoin maximalists who only use bitcoin and don't use any altcoins, but they are not the majority as we see. Many people still silently use altcoins and even invest more in altcoins but they still hypocritically say that they hate altcoins. According to my estimates, up to 99% of people participate in this market with the purpose of making profits instead of looking to protect their assets from third parties. So it would be surprising if they ignore the temptation of altcoins because they can generate x10, x100 profits, which they won't find in bitcoin today.Quote from: Darker45 on July 10, 2024, 12:56:11 AMAnyway, I can't say what's Bitcoin's second best because it might be a case-to-case basis.

In terms of safety, use cases and utility, I still rate bitcoin as the number 1 choice and will choose bitcoin, but when it comes to which option brings better profits, bitcoin is not the choice top pick.",

Even if you don’t use it, just it so the government will go mad.Doge is a bit like LTC in many ways but it also has a wider more volatile price action which attracts gamblers so I call it a gambler’s crypto.Eth has a stable price like btc but I don’t like it very much anymore because its fees can become expensive like btc.Among these 4 alts, I would choose LTC over the others if I was forced to make a choice.

Which has been your favorite and second-best?Let me start by answering the second question, Ethereum is my second best and it's for the obvious reason. There is nothing Bitcoin does that Ethereum doesn't do or try to do, and in some cases, it does more due to its scalability, so it's worth it. Even the market cap and its retainment for these long years should speak a lot in this regard.Regarding what I like best about Bitcoin, that will be the cross-border payment. The decentralization of Bitcoin has taken off the centrality and the partiality where the top-world countries will always have the best services and find ways to disenfranchise the developing/developed ones. It was hurtful when I wasn't able to fund my Forex accounts with my preferred brokers easily before Bitcoin was introduced, but had to painstakingly use the bank wire option in those days. This option will force my account to be credited in an average of 3 days and still have to part ways with an average of $38 as the processing fee. Thanks to Bitcoin, that's no more.",

To me high transaction fee isn't a problem, the reason why Bitcoin is better for storing funds is the ability to be in custody of the owner, no banks, and this solved every issues I have with this centralised world. Monero may not survive on the long run, till date I am still thankful that Nakamoto doesn't insert any privacy feature into Bitcoin, if not, this could be a good reason to bring Bitcoin down, think yourself, Bitcoin has the higher chance of surviving and getting accepted than Monero.",

For my portfolio, bitcoin makes up the majority because it is safer and the rest are some altcoins including memes. I don't differentiate between altcoins because I don't intend to hold them long term and for me they are for short to medium term speculative purposes only.

This is proven after years of bitcoin remaining in first place, until now there is no altcoin that can compete with bitcoin. In fact, all altcoin prices will be based on bitcoin, it could be said that bitcoin is the mother of all altcoins so there is no reason not to make bitcoin a priority in investing.If we talk about the second investment, apart from Bitcoin, I still choose the safest altcoin, namely ETH. ETH is also an altcoin with great potential in the future. These two coins have been my choice to invest in in recent years as future assets.
