Eventough, as it stands right now, it might be possible they (the miners) are sacrificing short term profit for long term loss since this situation might in the end hinder bitcoin adoption, bitcoin price increase, and eventually their income aswell...It might be a good first step if somebody wrote a patch for the default node implementation so the pool owners that still run the default client at least have the option of rejecting or at least discouraging those spam transactions??? I don't believe many node operators would chose to run a patched node tough.",

Insufficient fees may result in rejection or lower priority for inclusion in the blockchainThis is precisely how the bitcoin fee structure works already. Fees are calculated in sat/vbytes, that is you pay based on the size of your transaction, one with a weight of 1000 vbytes would pay more than one with a size of 100 vbytes.Size is the important factor in fee estimation.Nodes can also adjust their mempools to reject incoming transactions which submit a low feerate relative to the network congestion at the time.- Jay -",

I can imagine many things that could go wrong. Currently, we have satoshis per virtual kilobyte system, and everyone can see how it works. Before, there was a coinage-based system: the older your coins were, the higher priority your transaction had. Also I saw some people mentioning UTXO-based fees: the more UTXO you create, the higher your fees are. And if you consume many UTXOs, you make it easier for pruned nodes, so maybe that should be even rewarded with some discount (or some buffer for free transactions to do that kind of UTXO cleanup, but of course it should be designed carefully to avoid misuse).That way or another, it is possible to change that without any fork. The hardest thing is presenting a better system, and convincing mining pool operators, that your way of handling it is better than the status quo. And of course, you can start with your own full node, then you will see if your local mempool is really handled better, because the first step is to check your system in practice.QuoteIf smaller transactions ( smaller in size, and not in value), were charged a low efficiency fee, and larger ones had to pay quadruple ( say ) fees, then there would be a disincentive to submit so much rubbish on the blockchain.No matter what model you will take, it is hard to design a system, where you won't punish transaction batching (and UTXO-based fee model mentioned above also has the same problem). Because if you have a transaction that has one input, and creates hundreds of outputs, it does not mean it is automatically bad. It could be some batched withdrawal from some exchange, and if they for example collect all withdrawals, and produce one transaction per 24 hours, then you don't want to punish them (because replacing all of that with hundreds of small transactions would be worse).QuoteHow could this be implemented? Would it require two mempools, or just approval by the miners?One mempool is all you need. After all, finally you have a single block, and all transactions are placed in a given order. Either you include or exclude something, it is that simple. Of course you can locally make it more complicated, and have 20 layers to filter things, but finally, it will be a single binary decision: you include or exclude some transaction.",

That is a single tx with 20 inputs is smaller than 20 tx with 1 input each.That means if the fee of such transaction is to be higher according to your question, they would be forced to create multiple transactions with smaller number of inputs to pay a lower total fee which would increase the total size they waste.* If it is based on the \"garbage\" data they insert into the transaction using exploits in the protocol like what the Ordinals Attack is doing these days, then this method is not useful because we are talking about a vulnerability in the protocol that is being exploited, doing anything other than fixing the exploit itself is just wrong!",

Spam in Bitcoin context is simply Irrelevant & unwanted transactions that come in quick succession or in multiple amount in a given time. A transaction has to be relevant to the purpose of the Blockchain to be accepted otherwise it may be rejected alone or must be rejected if found to be spam. Blockchain is purposefully designed for financial transactions or light data. Heavy NFT or other heavy stuff could be allowed once in a while on a Blockchain but rejected when they became common/frequent.",

I would rather it isn't left to the miners, unless having two mempools is too much work for you.  It might get confusing at first to new users and some old users who has grown accustomed to the former, but once an update in software app automatically directs an account to the best suited fee charge per the volume to be transacted via the network tier fee structure, one would enjoy the ease per transaction speed and efficiency, I can assure.",

To begin with, that disincentivizes doing coinjoin, because it is purposefully large in size. But besides that: you can penalize someone from broadcasting a large transaction, but you can't penalize them for dividing it in separate small transactions, because there's pseudonymity. So, the result will be much more smaller transactions, with minimum-to-zero \"clogging\" prevented.",

There is no historical mempool, although there are some projects that store some historical information about the status of their nodes' mempools. If the maximum block size is nkb and there are nkp worth of valid transactions in a pool's mempool, it is reasonable to expect the pool to confirm all transactions in the mempool, even if there is a wide variety of transaction fee rates among transactions. So if there was a requirement for pools to include certain valid transactions prior to accepting other valid transactions, it would not be possible to validate if a particular block is valid after the fact.",
