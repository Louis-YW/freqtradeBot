I am watching firo, Aptos, dot closelyWe share on Aptos since I’m looking forward on blockchain project that has strong fundamentals and huge financial funds to maintain the project running on fast phase. I have Optimism, Osmosis and Arbitrum as my additional bag on my crypto must watch.I'm planning to add Sui once I have more budget and Venom.network once they already launch the mainnet. Aping on Blockchain project is my way on preparing the next bullrun.",

Same old school altcoin, specially XRP who just had a run after winning it's case.And then LTC will have it's own halving in August so we might see it pumping as well.As for what the OP posted, I'm mostly on the DOT or ADA. I'm not familiar with Aptos though, but thanks to this I might look at it and see if it is a good altcoin to invest on just a hype though.Also Illuvium might also be a long shot as far as going a massive bull run next year.",

I am watching firo, Aptos, dot closelyIf the scheme of the halving agenda meets everyone's expectations, then we don't need to do further research regarding what coins/tokens can generate profit this year. Prices of all major altcoins will go up along with the scarcity that will occur in Bitcoin. But, if I have to choose certain altcoins, then my choice will fall to Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI).Q: WhyA: The two altcoins that I mentioned above are native tokens from a growing network, they still have a lot of good news that we can look forward to, such as adding projects to the ecosystem and things around it.",

It seems these projects will have a bright future especially they have tech that are really evolve and keep developing. Maybe zksync and layerzero but these arent sure if will launch this year or so probably next year.Ive pick these among alts but obviously bitcoin and eth will be the leaders of these projects.",

I'm yet to look for newer projects a.k.a lottery tickets.I can imagine XRP booming in price pumps if they won their case fully. I wonder if other altcoins prices will be pulled along with XRP. I'm also doing my research on new projects which you need an actual luck to catch them on their bottom price if somehow they managed to survive this bear market and reach the bull market. The possiblity of multiplying your money for a hundred times is very possible on those low cap tokens though the risk is there as new altcoins tend to die quick if improperly managed even with a very good road map and project idea.",

I am going further with the FUN token as well but that’s just because of the freebitcoins stake offering and its freebies along the way. The utility is growing for the JMPT as they are launching the coin for various micro tasking sites. This way it’s getting earned and transacted everywhere. RVN is in the hot list because I mine it with my GPU and they have great burn plans ahead. The miners preference has also grown a lot recently since ETH went on PoS. I am pretty sure things will escalate to this portfolio.",

Of course btc is also an expected bull coin with its dominance in the market. Bnb if after the dust of regulation in US will show a speedy move for bull and Ethereum is another coin that is sort for this season.",

I am watching firo, Aptos, dot closelyThe coins you mentioned are indeed very good and dot is no doubt a good investment for the future and many traders are focused on it. Aptos also touched $18 once, and is now trading above the $7 again. This is also a good project. In my opinion apart from the coins you mentioned ocean protocol which is an AI project has potential to give good profit in future. Rather, during this bear season, Ocean Protocol has shown great improvement several times. From which it can be estimated that it can give a good profit in the bull season. Besides Gala being a game project I have high hopes that it can give huge profits in the future. Gala has also shown great performances during the bear season. I think Ocean and Gala can also make good profit this year.",

I am watching firo, Aptos, dot closelyI have a much passive look at the crypto. I'm holding already what I've been holding in expectation of a bull run and when it bulls, the established coins are a sure profit yielding machine. Even if there's no bull, I'm particularly invested in Litecoin, It's having a halving within next 3 weeks and historically, the prices has increased significantly after a halving.I'm also in small amount invested in newer and highly advertised meme coins, though they might not be a good thing in long run, they are ought to have a few large price jump which can bring large profits.",

This year, hmm, if BNB will also win this case then it might be a good chance to buy in now because of the cheaper price. IMO, I have no doubt they can win their case too just like XRP but it's a matter of when it will happen. It could be in a year or two, we don't know. XRP also took a lot of time before they can win their case. But when it happens, I am sure hype will be next to it and it's better at taking the early position where you can save more money or purchase than be in a position where you are doing a FOMO.",
