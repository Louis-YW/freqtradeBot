  "content": "Over the years, Bitcoin (and crypto) has caused some massive headlines, mostly about huge scams (Bitconneeeeeect, Onecoin, some NFT-shit) and failing exchanges (Mt Gox, FTX...). (ofc that's because of the nature of news outlets where sensationalism helps to generate clicks/views).I was wondering what topics have already occured in movies or series?Would like to compile a list of movies featuring crypto and more specific Bitcoin as part of their plot.Most prominent that comes to mind for me is the series Mr. Robot.I feel there must be (much) more and also think some of these topics/themes have the potential to be the foundation for massive blockbuster movies.So please go ahead and post any kind of movie or series that uses crypto or Bitcoin as an important part for their storyline. Also curious about upcoming movies if you have any insights on these.",

Here you go, let us know how much of these you've seen.https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword/?keywords=bitcoinMr.Robot is so gloomy and hopeless, I always felt down after watching it, which is why I couldn't make it past the first two seasons.",

You can see that scene in the first episode. Steven Yeun & Ali Wong almost realistic acting made this series memorable. The trailer can be found on Youtube. I am going ahead and sharing the link -> BEEF",

Movies that have a strong story where bitcoin and Cryptocurrency is mentioned are not very common, but they will be as Cryptocurrency become more popular and the government's position on it become a bit more relaxed. These movies will have a great influence in making bitcoin more of a household name that people will get to become used to.",

One of the most prominent examples is the TV series Mr. The robot as you mentioned tells the story of a group of hackers who use crypto currency to fund their activities. Other movies and TV shows featuring Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies include Startup, The Good Wife, Billions, and Deep Web. Yes, these works frequently explore themes relating to the potential benefits and risks of cryptocurrencies, as well as their potential impact on traditional financial systems and we will see more films and TV shows featuring these topics in the future.",

As much as I like Bitcoin, I think just using it in a movie fits better than making the entire movie revolve around it. I remember watching The Blacklist, where the bad guys were demanding ransom in Bitcoin, but the goodies turned the tables and made their own demand in Bitcoin. It's just a short gimmick, but enough to remind a large audience that Bitcoin exists.",

There are movies where Bitcoin was mentioned or simply just part of the scene but not entirely part of the storyline. I have not seen that Mr. Robot series but seems a good suggestion to watch it.Uncut Gems movie was one that I saw a year or two where BTC was featured on his phone. One series that I happened to watch was the Atypical series where the teenager with Autism earns while working in a tech store and then his best friend suggests storing his money in BTC.",

      "body": "Mr Robot is one of my favorite shows ever, and yeah Bitcoin was talked about but of course in that show the plot was that a corporate cryptocurrency ended up taking over from fiat and Bitcoin was just kinda a side thing but still that show showed or mentioned Bitcoin probably far more than any other show/movie that isn't specifically about Bitcoin.In Ted Lasso the father of one of the soccer player's said on a phone call I think in the final episode of season 2 if I remember correctly that he bought Bitcoin in 2009 (even though that was before you could actually 'buy' bitcoin haha).There is a scifi movie called Parallel from 2020 where the main characters are pitching an app idea to VCs and at one point when talking about payments in the app they say something like \"you can even set it up to use Bitcoin, but you probably don't want to\".There's a TV show called Future Man and I believe it was in one of the later episodes when they are in the future Haley Joel Osment's character comments on his daughter spending like 80,000 ETH on something. So ETH not Bitcoin, but when I saw it I thought to myself it was weird they used Ethereum for that line instead of Bitcoin, I guess the writers who put that in there didn't have a good understanding of the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum lol. So that was like an almost Bitcoin reference in a show haha, they just strangely mentioned ETH instead of Bitcoin being used for payments.",

Bitcoin has by a far margin been in more massive headlines than scams. The entire Bitcoin journey has been headline worthy, from the price increase to the fact that it's challenging the fiat system.The highlight of your topic title is Bitcoin and it has no direct link with exchange scams or NFTs or whatever else you mentioned. Bitcoin has literally never had a scam headline.",
