So you still have a chance to mine a block with low hashrate but not on GPU because it can eat much power compared to ASIC-based miners.

The same applies to solo mining bitcoin, There is a super slim chance that you will never mine a block as a solo miner, worse still if you are using GPUs.You may just burn all the money in power, maintenance and hardware with no result.",

This happens very rarely with other miners, but you should not hope for this.How can you compare a miner who has thousands of asics and a miner who has one or two old asics?On coins for mining on video cards with a small hashrate, you can catch a block in solo if there are few miners, but this will not bring profit either, because mining on a pool can give no less profit.",

Don't embark on this journey because it could waste your time, get a proper EH hashing power and try your luck, the higher your hashrate the higher your chances of mining a block for yourself.",

If you want to test lucky that is totally fine but I do recommend if you have money to buy new machine that more efficient and at least give you money back in return if you dont have the money right now just do DCA bitcoin price right now and the price is really tempting too at this point",
