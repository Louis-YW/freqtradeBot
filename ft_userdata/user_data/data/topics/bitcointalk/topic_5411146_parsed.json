Recently a news is published by CG - Title : Craig Wright is Satoshi Counter Argument. In the article it is said that  Satoshi's Private has been stolen. Unless, Craig is making a fake story the writer cannot write this statement. Where was the private key ? Who stolen it ? When did he lost the private key ? There are many questions arises. can you read the article published by CG and make your comment about it. I think, Craig himself has written the article and published it in some one else' name. What is the truth ?",

Whether he tell it to the world nonstoply, we knew it that he's just trying to pretend that he's Satoshi. See, no private keys to prove that he owns those million of bitcoins?

For there to be any other truth, there has to be evidence to support it. If I began claiming to be Satoshi with no evidence, that is just me being delusional.The Difference between me making such a claim, and CSW, is he has enough financial support to try and force his delusion on people.- Jay -",

CSW has been harassing bitcoin developers with lawsuits and demanded the whitepaper be removed from different websites. That doesn't help in the awareness one bit. Why would the real Satoshi even allow another version of his creation?",

He crave for the popularity and respect, he is so ambitious and ready to go any length to show it to the world. He claimed to have signed message using one of satoshi private key \"only for key witness and partners\" , i thought his aim was to prove to the whole world he is satoshi! why secretly signing message multiple times when you can easily do it so the whole btc community will realize it and finally accept it.",

The verdict given by Court was also a part of the entire conspiracy. It's quite obvious that CSW is fake and that's why he can't simply access the main wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto. We will readily accept him as Satoshi if he is able to access the wallet and transfer funds out of it. That's simple for the original Satoshi!",

That is, if Wright is Satoshi, he could easily prove that by publicly signing a message using the private key of one of the bitcoin addresses known to be Satoshi’s.I took the signature matter seriously, and investigated into it deeply, not only from a factual viewpoint, but also from a legal and a strategy viewpoint. I had previously written on this issue: Why doesn’t he just sign?, emphasizing the fact that he did sign it, multiple times, but only privately for key witnesses and partners, but not publicly.I was like... WTH.. when I read that bolded line.  These guys are making fool of the people.  As if there is harm when they sign the message in public.  Definitely, I would also stop reading the article if ever I stumbled that kind of reasoning.  That is pure mind setting and manipulation making CW a legit Satoshi which we know that it is impossible.  I wonder when will they stop embarrassing themselves.",
