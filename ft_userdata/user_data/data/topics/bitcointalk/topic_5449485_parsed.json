Android device running Windows OS. What device is that? Android is an OS while Windows is an OS too. For bitcoin Core, you need a space up to 500 gigabytes. Buying 1 terabyte HDD is not costly, but likely you need to buy a better laptop.",

Is there any laptop that can't able to install Android OS?My laptop has a dual boot with Remix OS which is an Android OS so maybe his laptop has dual boot Windows 8 and Android or maybe he just recently switches from Android OS to Windows 8. There are lots of Android OS that support laptops like LineageOS, chromeOS, primeOS, etc.@OP can you provide the model and details about your laptop or take a picture of your laptop? Maybe we can check the specs online if we know the exact model of your laptop maybe we can help you how to install the Bitcoin node.",

Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driverCheck out your processor. Some devices tend to start over heating when you install and run more apps on them",

But for installing core, nah, that 380GB space is not enough since blockchain size is already +400GB in size.EDIT: Ah, so there is an Android OS for pc, i just heard that lol. Then for the other software you want to install i guess its fine as long there the minimum requirement of the app is good for your specs",

What do you think could be the problem? Because is a new system window 8.I'm not sure what kind of limits are in place for the OS that you're currently using, as opposed to a native Windows 8, but if it allows you to monitor how your resources are being used in the task manager, then you can easily find the culprit.With that kind of config, your best bet is to run a node in pruned mode [having said that, I prefer not to recommend it... It's not a full node and it has its own disadvantages (e.g. redownloading in a certain situation)!",

Quote from: BitMaxz on April 19, 2023, 07:41:50 PM@OP can you provide the model and details about your laptop or take a picture of your laptop? Maybe we can check the specs online if we know the exact model of your laptop maybe we can help you how to install the Bitcoin node.For the details of the model and specifications, OP doesn't seem to give any more answers. But maybe it is some kind of Tablet or Chromebook laptop as the RAM embedded is only 3GB and internal 380. If it's a laptop that dual-boots Windows and Android OS, then the laptop specs are still very minimal. It may be an old laptop or tablet device that is available with Android OS with a physical keyboard button that is integrated and detachable.",

Could it be that is not compatible or the interface is not enough to carryout softwares?To install or run Bitcoin Core or Electrum activities, a laptop with a Core i5 processor type is very capable to use because Bitcoin Core requires up to 500 gigabytes of space.The average laptop with a Core i5 processor type has an HDD capacity of up to +500GB.Of course if you intend to use the laptop only for Bitcoin Core or Electrum without other activities.To make it even smoother, you need to use a laptop with better capabilities, even more powerful specifications that already have a processor and RAM with a larger capacity.",
