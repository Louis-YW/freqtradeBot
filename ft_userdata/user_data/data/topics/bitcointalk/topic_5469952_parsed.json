I also purchased small fractions and even tried mining but unfortunately did not work due to the increasing difficulty and lack of profit in mining. For me earning Bitcoin through signature campaigns was more convenient and simple. You just need to qualify to the campaign requirements and dedicate your time and effort creating constructive posts to get paid on a weekly basis.¬† For now, since I have not met the minimum required merits earned for the last 120 days, I am still able to earn through altcoin bounties. But as soon as I got that required merit I will surely apply to Bitcoin paying campaigns. I encountered and got fractions of Bitcoin before diving myself into Altcoins. This forum really helps me and my family a lot. I learn and earn at the same time which is a perfect combination for me. How about you guys, did you earn your first Bitcoin through services here on this forum? Are you mining or you bought it as well? Which crypto came to you first, is it Bitcoin or Altcoins? What are your Bitcoin source at the moment if you don't mind me asking?",

I mean, to have as little as possible saved somewhere in your wallet, provided that the purchase is going to be larger than the fee, one should take the bold step of buying and saving it for themselves, so that when something positive happens and the person's price goes up, they won't be left behind.",

The forum is a place that don't just assist you to improve your knowledge on bitcoin, but it also provides a means for you to earn bitcoin, so that you can have the real experience of using bitcoin and storing it or hodli it. This is because, it is not everyone that can afford to buy bitcoin due to low income and people from the third world country that finds it difficult to have jobs in their countries.

I manage to purchase many things including significant things when Bitcoin first hit the 20K price during 2017 bullrun.

We were paid for that month and the amount I received was $37 in BTC, I couldn't believe there was really a service that required your time on the forum that would pay you in BTC but it's worth it for those who are staying here all night and day to talk things about bitcoin and the rest.I know some developers that do remote jobs and since they receive their first payment in BTC, they prefer to be paid in BTC all the time because of taxes. The taxes take almost if not more than 40% of what you earn before payment reach your destination bank but using BTC, the tax is small compare to using fiat through wire transfers and other payment methods. I know few who also do gigs of graphics designed and receive BTC payment and they prefer it than the usual fiat. BTC payment rocks.",

One day, you created a topic that blew up your account with a lot of merits, and that's where all the talent ended.By creating this topic, you seem to promise everyone that after receiving merit, you will continue to participate in subscription companies for Bitcoin. But forgive me, do you think that this is interesting to people, and they certainly need to quickly fulfill your desire by giving you these unfortunate five merits?",

I was already invested in Bitcoin when I first knew about it, from a friend with a very low investment just to know how is it going to profit, then my friend told me about this forum, and its where I learned most of my knowledge and start earning as well here since as I remember even newbies back in the day are able to join signature campaigns, I dont remember if I'm able to join campaign when I was just a newbie but it helps me as well since most of my payout from campaigns are invested in Bitcoin so its a good investment or side hustle.",
