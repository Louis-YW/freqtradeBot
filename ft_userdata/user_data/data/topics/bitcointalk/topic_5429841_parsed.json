People like to invest on high yield investment program and other ways they can be scammed easily especially if they have no idea or knowledge about the scam before. Later they will begin to think that they are stupid to trust who they can give money that has nothing to lose and that they did not know in real life, there money would have gone before knowing that it is just like someone they do not know stole their money. But for new coins, there are some that are legit, but most are still a way many people are scammed. I will never advise anyone to go for those new projects, they should hold bitcoin instead.",

Although bitcoin is a store of value but there is also profit attached when you buy low and hold for a long time, this was how the early adopters got some profit off it, the new investors now are still looking into earn this profits for themselves but at a short time. This has lead sinr to either invest in shit coins or take drastic decisions when there are into future trading. I personally dont warn these set of greedy people off it because I feel they deserve to learn the hard way sometimes. But my only concern is the tagging of bitcoin by the losers as a ponzi schemes to potential investors.",

Elderly people, trusting scammers who are very skilled at persuading them to invest their money in Ponzi projects, become frequent victims. And, of course, greedy and lazy people who decide that one day they can get rich doing absolutely nothing. Such people are not sorry. Everyone should have their own head to assess all the risks, and if people are too lazy to conduct their own investigations, then the scammers become their teachers.",

On the other hand, it's very easy to get into crypto because you don't need the help or mediation of banks or brokers and that's why a lot of people try to make money from crypto.However, as with everything in life, if you don't know what you're doing, haven't properly informed yourself and analyzed the market, and rely on luck, most likely your crypto investment will end badly and you'll lose the money you invested.",

Immediate gratification has gotten many people loss even the little they have into the hands of those who decided to wait long learning before thinking of earn. If you don't study to show yourself approved you will always be taken advantage of and thereby continuously fall victim into the hands of those who did. And this doesn't apply only in bitcoin but in other areas of life.It's only those with a mindset of getting rich quick through bitcoin that always fall victim of scam as any offer they come across which promises to expand thair asset twice as tall excite them into getting involved without a second thought, believing that they might lose the opportunity if they don't jump in quickly.If only we can give time to study we will gain lots of experience and save ourselves from being scam victim in the crypto space.",

Yes its hard to cope with such unusual activity and we might as well fear of losing our funds but never so tough when its time to cash out those profits cause of greediness that we always feel. But when the time comes, we sold on the time its not to be sold. Well thats how it is I guess. Being in a sinkhole is a choice.",

If 90% of those entering the space now were there when Bitcoin started in 2009 they would had sold by now because they're impatient and can't hold unto their coins believing things will be as profitable as it's today. This scammers know the noobs wants the quick gains not realizing it wasn't as quick as they think with Bitcoin, it took Bitcoin more than 13years to reach its previous all time high even with the low circulating supply it has but the noobs getting into this altcoins with billions of supply wants the same output in less time. This is the major reason behind the rise of shit meme coins with trillions of supply but the community wants huge returns to turn just $100 investment into millions. This scam artist will always get them as they just use trends like tokens burning to deceive them into investing. Why should the developers create such supply in the first place if they know they won't need it. Investors needs to develop the habit of having patience with their investment and invest wisely.",

It's also the cheapest way for them to earn \"dirty money\" without risking any of their stuffs and this is why there would always be scammers, not just in crypto but also those who are just using fiat. Back in May this year, I recall even being scammed for a GPU in FB Marketplace amounting to $200 and now my trust in that marketplace is broken beyond repair. Good thing I am in a good place now. These scums/scams, whether using crypto or not or even both, will continue to do their own thing and it is sad that there are some authorities that are easily bribed by these especially if they are group of people. I recall that being mentioned by Jim Browning, which is a scambaiter, in one of his videos. smh",

Instead of buying bitcoin as a genuine investment for them, they are passing on it because they see some more \"profitable\" coin to invest with their money and they sees it as a short term investment.",

At my tender age over here or when i get to know about bitcoin this was how i does as well, i only looks for what would give me just quick profits without me investing time to study or learn more about what i ' m going for until a friend of mine told me things i should have known earlier, and what he said was \"guy came down and buy bitcoin hold it for some years after which you may decide to sell or still hold, all those people are just looking for a way to deceive you and take away the little you have worked for\" that was when my eyes opened and immediately i stop looking for quick money.

While it is possible that a newer cryptocurrency could surpass it in the future, it is unlikely to happen overnight, and significant adoption and technological advancement are required for that to happen. Some people may be looking for better cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin because they are motivated by the fear of missing out (FOMO) on potential gains in newer, more innovative coins; they believe newer coins are technologically superior and will eventually replace Bitcoin; they have skepticism or mistrust of Bitcoin due to its volatility or perceived lack of privacy; or they don't understand how powerful and unique Bitcoin actually is.",

People want overnight success, as in to just attain a huge amount of wealth overnight and just solve all or majority of their problems. In recent cases, the opposite has been the case.
