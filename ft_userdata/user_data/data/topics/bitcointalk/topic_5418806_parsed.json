Some days you will earn a lot of money and you could cash out during that day, some weeks will be amazing during bull period and you could cash out, weeks even months and years could be good that you could cash out. But this is not the rule, it's the exception.What you have to realize is that we get just one huge bull run type of year per 4 years, that means anything in between is either going down, or going back up to where it was, and not more. That is why even though there are \"some\" periods like that, it's usually not like that and would not be possible to cash out.",

I do understand what you are saying and I believe there are some people that think cryptocurrency investment or trading is a place for quick money however and they end up taking a lot of loss, I do however know of traders that make between $30-$100 daily from trading depending, and you know what that means in a month.",

Daily cash out in crypto is possible. Â One just needs extra knowledge about trading, extra luck, and of course a gadget to use in trading. Â A good day trader can have daily cash out. Â Aside from trading, staking coins also yield daily profit which can be withdrawn anytime.Quote from: Nwada001 on October 30, 2022, 08:04:07 AMOne of friends Â will always say \"your papa no be the developer\".

But after they have come to realize or after they've been scammed. They're now having a different perspective on how the actual market works. It's possible that they can have a daily cash out through trading but it's not an easy thing to do.Experience matters for most newbies and I'm sure that majority of them that those \"experts\" now that are earning their living from crypto, they're making them as their inspiration and someday they'll be like them.",

I think it is still the case that the crypto market is attracting a lot of people that are either desperately in need of money and that see the crypto market with all it's stories of people that have invested 100$ a few weeks ago and are now millionaires as their last hope. Of course sadly this only works out for a very small amount of people like 0,01% or even less. I also think that the overall age of investors in the crypto space is very very low in comparison to investors into \"normal\" financial assets and young people often have way to high expectations obviously.In the end it is just as likely that you lose money in the crypto space than that you make profit.",
