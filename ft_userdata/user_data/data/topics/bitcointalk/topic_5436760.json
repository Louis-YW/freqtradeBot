BTC is considered currency.  if you keep 0.5BTC today, for the next 5 years, it will still be 0.5BTC. It is the value of BTC that is volatile which in 5 years it could be more valuable. I have not seen this massive awareness though.Is that massive awareness that you are saying was the likes calling people to withdraw BTC from exchanges?",

Do you agree with this that people who are very good at saving money become very good at keeping bitcoins when they finally start doing cryptocurrency? Or do you feel that there is no similarity between keeping bitcoins and keeping money? In terms of saving, at first glance it might look the same for everyone. But in terms of saving Bitcoin and saving money, there is a slight difference that may be very basic for someone to feel, because someone who is good at saving money may not be very good at saving Bitcoin.Why is that, because one needs to choose a very special and truly secure wallet to store the Bitcoins he/she has. Meanwhile, to save money, one only needs to prepare a safe or the safest bank to place the money. So in terms of saving, of course there is a slight difference, even though at first glance these things look almost the same.",

What you are suggesting here is idea to save but in different formats of \"money\" or \"asset\" which carries a proper value to exchange with something equal in value. I don't think we should be confusing this with the bitcoin and fiat. They are both different in terms of utility, values, and may be supply too! Saving in bitcoin can be far more beneficial than money because of obvious reasons. Despite of that the points, its savings, it could be in any form of valuable asset.",

      "body": "Keeping money and keeping Bitcoin are not not entirely similar in a way. But I believe it's more easier for some people to keep money than to keep Bitcoin mostly especially those that are not patient and those that get excited easily. What I'm saying is that when you're keeping money there's no probability that your money is going to increase or decrease so if you keep $10 in the next 10 months you're still going to meet the same value of money i.e $10 but for Bitcoin there is a probability that the value of your Bitcoin might increase or decrease so some might get excited when they see their Bitcoin increasing in value and then immediately swap to usdt or any other stablecoins ( which in this case mean same thing as money). so for money you don't have to worry about its value while for Bitcoin you  have to.",

Whether it's fiat money or cryptocurrency.  True, it really doesn't matter the kind of currency one is in possession of. If one doesn't have money discipline, as in, cannot keep fiat money, how will keeping or saving Bitcoin suffice? Although, while fiat money is easier to save because it more safe from hackers, and ease of which it can be spent, Bitcoin requires strict monitoring of visited sites and security updated regularly.",

Saving is a habit which must be practised for it to be part of you. If you are an extravagant spender, you might not be able to save fiat money due to your life style, also if that person has bitcoin he may also not be able to keep it.I know of a lady that loves saving all her income and wouldn't touch it because she depends on her husband's income to run the house. It is easier for this kind of person to save in bitcoin because they will hold for long,as long has they know the value of their investment.",

Or do you feel that there is no similarity between keeping bitcoins and keeping money? Holding bitcoin is how i learned saving. I got suddenly more interesting in saving my money as it was so volatile and exciting. My fiat money wouldn't have done anything but maybe losing value slowly. It was so boring. Buying BTC lead me understanding how charts work. How trading works and how things are valuated. I learned to buy stocks too and lots of markets in general.It's basically same but saving money is more boring and not rewarding or exciting at all. Yet it's good to have some of your saved money as fiat money.",

It is a skill or behavioural attitude which I firmly believe is transferrable. They simply see it as their fiat changing form. That is from tangible to intangible. In fact, they will even become super prudent when they see that they are actually in control and that they do not have to spend any money on maintenance fee.",

There are some people who are easy spenders, regardless of how much they have or earn, they will always spend all. These set of persons would always identity both relevant and irrelevant means or avenues of spending thier funds. I think people that have develop the habit of saving fiat might have the ability of keeping bitcoin for a long time. This might be the case because both cryptocurrency and fiat are all medium of exchange, therefore what an individual would do with one might be similar to what he might also do with the other. It is also important to state that saving fiat might not be the best option because it is prone to devaluation and might never appreciate in price (this is the case of my local currency). But there is every possibilty that the price of bitcoin might appreciate in future, which makes is a good hedge against inflation and a viable investment platforms.",

I could say that there might be some difference and that would be pertaining about \"CONFIDENCE\"when you do save up money then you wont really be bothered about volatility which is something a main issue when you do hold up Bitcoin but due to the earning opportunities that it do gives then you might just ignore it out in the end.The similarities on here is that when it comes to self discipline and control because if you are really that good on saving up in fiat money then same goes when you are saving up bitcoin specially for long term.Just make it sure that you wont really be that too active when it comes to watch the market every now and then which would really be affecting you because of the movingprices.",

Whereas in saving bitcoins, you are getting some profits off of what you're keeping that it will somewhat tempt you to take it out when it received some form of appreciation. That's the main difference, and that's what makes saving bitcoins harder than saving money - there is always the possibility of realizing profits in a short span of time.",
