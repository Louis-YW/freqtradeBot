  "content": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-devs-can-undo-21-million-cap-but-cannot-force-changesBitcoin developers can theoretically remove the 21-million-Bitcoin supply limit from the source code, but miners are unlikely to accept such a change, according to one analyst.I'm sure this comes as a huge relief for all of you guys. Then they go on to say this:Like most other codes, Bitcoin’s source code can be modified, meaning the 21-million limit is theoretically changeable. However, such a change will have to be accepted by miners to be effective, according to Josef Tětek, a Bitcoin analyst at the hardware wallet firm Trezor.The more people write about how the 21 million limit can be changed, the more its going to get into peoples' heads that maybe it should be changed. That way they could own more bitcoin and get richer. That's how they would think about it.",

Bitcoin's supply cap is one of Bitcoin's main selling points, so it's very unlikely for the community in general(not just the miners) to support such a huge fundamental change.",

Even if the miners were to adopt it, if the community doesn't support it or people don't use it, then Bitcoin becomes useless. It is to their best interests to support the sentiments of the majority given their billions of dollars in investment. Most people understand basic economics regardless, so the supply cap probably won't gain any traction.",

      "body": "Changing that limit would be a hard fork... Especially if you'd also change the rules for the block reward (which you would HAVE to do to increase or remove the supply limit).Nodes running the \"old\" fork (with a ~21.000.000 supply limit) will start to reject all blocks whose block reward does not conform to the \"old\" rules (block reward halving every 210.000 blocks, starting with 50 BTC), and since the \"new\" fork will need to adjust this logic to replace (or remove) the supply limit, they'll actually HAVE to change this rule.The fork could probably do something like: wait untill the next halving when the \"old\" chain's block reward becomes 3,125 BTC, then change the client's sourcecode to keep this block reward forever (disable halving in the future), that way your new chain will be \"compatible\" with the old chain for another ~4 years, but as soon as the next halving happens, the old chain will start to reject blocks with a 3,125 BTC block reward.In, the end, you'd have 2 bitcoins: Bitcoin_super_unlimited and Bitcoin. Everybody who controlled unspent outputs on Bitcoin by the time of the fork will have the same value on both chains, and one of them *might* die off (even tough some forks actually exist for a long time, albeit not as popular as bitcoin).Personally, i don't think you'd have to worry about this as a \"normal\" user. I think the chances are very slim anybody would tamper with the supply limit and risk a hard fork for something that will probably do the community no good... There are more pressing matters TBH. I worry a lot more wether a solid, mature L2 network will exist by the time the block reward becomes so small we'd have to pay $80 per transaction in order to keep the miners interested in mining bitcoin... I also worry about people spamming the mempool with crap transactions pushing the fee waaaaay up... People that want to start meddeling with the controlled supply aren't even in the top 10 when it comes to worries about our network and our community.",

The reason for this is that there are not 21 million Bitcoins, but ~ 2.1 quadrillion sats which is more than any fiat money.",

However, a large part of the community knows that the Maximum supply of Bitcoin is 21 Million and it cannot be changed. Since scarcity increases the demand, Bitcoin's price should be more valuable day by day. Now, If devs make any changes to its supply, I don't see any reason why people still should trust Bitcoin. A lot of us invested in it knowing the max supply cannot be changed. If they could change it to some bigger numbers, and there are more coins in circulation, my Bitcoin will lose value due to oversupply. Bitcoin will become like other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.",

If the bitcoin limit is changed, for example, to 100 million, I am sure the price of bitcoin will fall and perhaps people's trust in bitcoin will drop drastically because bitcoin is no different from fiat which can be controlled for the interests of certain groupsApart from that, more bitcoin does not make someone richer because the price of bitcoin will definitely fall and will not be like the current price. Moreover, if people's trust in Bitcoin is lost, Bitcoin's glory will collapse and it will no longer have high value.",

Bitcoin community have no need to increase it because it will cause inflation and price will decrease. With increasing total supply from 21 millions to 42 millions, price will decrease like 50%. People will no longer believe in Bitcoin when it happens, as if it can be doubled from 21M to 42M, in future it will be able to double more to 84M.

I hope developers, miners will never agree to this stupid idea.

You're not the only one in question about the sudden interest in topics everywhere in the crypto space about Bitcoin surpassing it's 21 million supply, especially after the ETF approval. This theory might be to test the waters to see people's reaction about the possibilities of Bitcoin surpassing the 21 million. I don't think that it'll be a good development for Bitcoin investment if this were to happen, because this is one of the researched reason why many people invested in it, knowing that the limit will always create scarcity in the future which will make it to continue to retain it's value and relevance. I hope that the propaganda remains in theoretical level and it'll not be practical now or in the future.",
