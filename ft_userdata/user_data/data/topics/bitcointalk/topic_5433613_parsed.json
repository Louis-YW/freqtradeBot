  "content": "Have you imagine scam during early days?Scams came from deceiving people to buy a fake gold, or a merchandise in the market, I saw people buy fake gold painted only by gold colorHow they do that they attract people to invest, money by showing a real gold, and the rest were fake, since as we know as they saw the profit for the gold they became greedy and give their savings.The Next one is the pyramid Scheme, where its like also as pyramid scheme, or networking, where the early one will get profit and the bottom one will sometimes the one who will not get anything in return.Now scams are now digital, from email sending fake Sales invoice or bank notice that your are being ask to pay for an amount.For hacking sending email links that redirects to a fake websites, leading the victim to a site that will collect your information, infect your pc with a malware to encrypt your files, and ask for ransoms, which is they called ransomware that victimized sometimes company to pay.No matter what we do, this people also evolve on how they can scam/hack people, so be very careful because, they are everywhere waiting for us to make mistake.",

This is why in our today world of crypto currency we hear DYOR every now and then. Just like the case of gold if  one knows what a real gold looks like he/she will never be scammed by fake dealers. Before buying a product the first step is to do market survey the essence is to have a background knowledge of what you are going in for because scam and hacking will never seize to exist but it can be reduced with good knowledge about what ever interest an individual.",

Many online scam is because of greediness and stupidity, some humans are foolish but the foolishness may be avoided by experience of what the scamnner what to do, only some people that may not have the experience and still understand that someone is a scammer. But is it not stupid for someone to send money to a person he has not met before, a person that has nothing to lose if you send him money and a person that is not trackable. Another is to pay for the money you are expecting. Many like that are stupidity.",

      "body": "Obviously as time has passed hackers have got more sophisticated & refined their attacks. I remember when I was a teenager downloading files on AOL, visiting porn websites when my parents were out (don’t judge me). I got in so much trouble downloading shitty short videos. One time I got my parents PC so badly infected with malware that they had to call in a repair/software guy. He wiped the computer clean but told my parents it was due to visiting adult sites. I should have denied it & blamed it on my Dad.",

      "body": "We will always have scammers laying around. There will always be cults, gurus, sex workers etc.. I am convinced that some of these things are inherent to the human race as a whole.People will always be lured by quick and large profits, I have personally seen educated people on the subject lose amounts regularly thinking \"I'll try, if I get scammed I'll lose 100 usd, if it's honest it will be a jackpot\" (most of the time on some shitty crypto staking websites). So imagine the uneducated people on top of that, as well as the young inexperienced people. That's a lot of potential victims.To educate people is part of the solution, but I think the survival of the scammers depends on their ability to stay ahead of the  30% least educated of us.",
