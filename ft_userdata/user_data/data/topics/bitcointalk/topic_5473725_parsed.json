      "body": "Looking at casinos, whether physical casino or online casino, it would be bad for the casino owner or his employees to bet in that same casino, because it could be questioned to what extent his casino games would be considered provably fair games, people would think that he would be manipulating the games and he would also be manipulating people. but when you have a person who has already proven that he is honest and that when he plays in his own casino he puts money from his pocket and plays games that are proven to be fair, then I don't see a problem with that.I say this because I have never seen any casino TOS in which they prohibit the casino owner from playing in their casino. but I think that in the case of casino employees the story is different, they could know of a bug in a game and could exploit this to their benefit, but until they ask for KYC it would be difficult for the casino to discover that its employees are playing at the casino. . people who are professional athletes are prohibited from getting involved in sports betting, so from what I see casino owners are the only ones who are directly linked to the casino and gambling who have the benefit of playing at their own casino",

      "body": "We won't know whether the betting company owners are placing bets or whether they are just collecting the money. Even if they place a bet, they won't tell anyone, even their employees. They will probably use another account so that no one knows they placed a bet. They can also place bets at other betting companies if they wish. And again, we won't know what the reason is, and they certainly won't want to say it. But I think it might be better to take the profits rather than have them place bets. After all, it's a bet. They definitely have a chance of winning and losing unless they know the final result",

      "body": "I don't think there is a rule limiting casino owners or gambling companies to gamble or bet whether in theirs or elsewhere but what happens is that they are very limited in number who bet, or speaking from the offline game house owners I have known, they don't gamble or they don't do that much. They can forecast for people or contribute to the discussion on the likely winner especially in soccer. They don't usually bet because they see it as their business that they are running for profit and no need to gamble on it. The funny thing again is that they are more enlightened on gambling and they consider the luck factor and not really about how good you are in forecasting or predicting even though there are games that is likely to be winning games. So they would prefer to stay out and benefit from gamblers.So incase they are to gamble, sure they will gamble in there casino because of gaining the commission to his casino. They won't want to patronize other casino.",

These are the questions that I am seeking an answer to.I am not sure what the conflict of interest would be. It's not like they can affect the outcome of the match. Maybe with large enough bets they could affect to multipliers, but that would be affecting against them. But if there would be a way it would be unethical or conflict of interest, that i don't see, it would be against regulations and these casinos are constantly audited, so it really wouldn't make sense.And when you take a look how much money they are making i a year, then you quickly notice that making even insane large bets (that would instantly be flagged by auditors) wouldn't even affect the income in any meaningful way. So i am guessing they don't need to gamble.",

      "body": "I remember in bustabit, which has some of the larger wager limits, every account's history is public. So the owner also has an account and you can see his wagers. And it's possible to see that although he has wagered some very small amounts, it was very insignificant and wouldn't affect the profitability of the platform. For sites like bustabit that take public investment in the bankroll, things get more complicated because what happens if the owner let's say wins big amounts? These come from the pockets of investors. How then are we to ensure that he hadn't gotten these coins he handled with from the player balance? It's not exactly possible to do that. Now for sites where the bankroll is purely finance by the owners, I think they have more freedom. Still though, it would be best practice to not gamble on your own platform. Owners get a steady income of players and cash from their bets. Why would they need to gamble with that money on their own platform? It doesn't make sense.",

Some sort of money loop? It is their money which they would be getting from the prize pool. But if it is with other platforms, then probably most of them don’t bet ‘coz they simply know how things are working perhaps that the house will always win. Some might be doing so but for entertainment purposes or to learn new things from other platforms which they could use on their own as means of improvement. The only chance that they are is if they really enjoy betting personally. Quite of a cliché plot wherein business owners are starting a business from an activity or thing which they love.",

I think there is no problem when you want to gamble while you are the owner of your site. You can do whatever you want if you are the owner, you can control the winnings you want.I sometimes often see streamers who own casinos gambling on their own sites, there is no problem with that, they even share giveaways of their winnings too, in essence, whatever a casino owner does, for example gambling in their own casino and broadcasting it to the public, is definitely aimed at marketing their casino. in order to be busy, nothing more than that, in fact on streaming sites many casino owners gamble",

These are the questions that I am seeking an answer to.Of course, as an owner of an establishment or anything that is yours, you have the freedom to do whatever you like, if it's an establishment, account, platform, etc. The thing is whatever action you take will always have consequences, if you do something like rig the game just for you to win in your own game, then of course, gamblers or customers would lose interest in your platform as they figured out that you can manipulate your own game. If I remember it right, there's actually an advertisement about gambling where streamers are in the video showing how the game works, then instantly won like $100,000 by simply clicking a start button. It might look easy to earn money as you watch but once you download it, of course, it would be different, I think that's an example of how can you use your authority on your own platform. Also, you could try out your own platform to eliminate its flaws and improve.",

If the reason someone builds this gambling business is to increase their income, maybe they will never think about betting, maybe they will only think about how they can increase their income and can reap the maximum profit from the business they build.But it will be a different story, if the purpose of someone building a gambling business is to create a fair and responsible gambling, as well as gambling that can provide security and comfort for its visitors. with the reason that as long as he gambled he did not find a gambling platform like that, so he decided to build his own gambling platform that could provide it all. And maybe occasionally he will bet on the gambling platform he has to be able to always make sure that the gambling platform he has, can indeed provide safety and comfort, also ensure that the gambling site provides fair and responsible games for its visitors.",
