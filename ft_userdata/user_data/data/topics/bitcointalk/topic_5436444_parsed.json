There have been a number of vulnerabilities discovered against various hardware wallets which could result in loss of coins. There is also the privacy aspect of them making it completely obvious that you are holding bitcoin, having to hand over personal details to the manufacturer, and often having to use the manufacturer's software. The significant benefit to hardware wallets are they are in general very easy to use, whereas correctly setting up and using an airgapped device without making a critical mistake is much more difficult.Quote from: un_rank on January 23, 2023, 09:33:29 PMAlso, how do you store seedphrases and passphrases on a computer?

Simply as a file or do you have the wallet set up fully on the device.You should avoid storing your sensitive information such as seeds and passphrases (by which, I assume, you mean so-called 25th-word addition for your primary seed) on electronic devices: computers, laptops, USB sticks, HDDs, or SSDs. Consider using more durable physical media such as metal plates, washers, and even regular paper notebooks because they are more robust than any electronic device. Keep separately the backups of your seed and passphrase because you don't want hackers to find out that the latter even exists: it allows for plausible deniability that you even have what you have. For seed phrases that you use regularly, employ reliable protection hardware such as Trezor or any other open-source hardware wallet that has proven its reliability. Hardware wallets are designed to be used within hostile environments, and they offer the optimal balance of security and convenience.",

It is essentially functioning simply as a signing device, and as long as you double check everything you are signing and have signed, then the risk of a vulnerability being exploited is almost zero. I don't care about any new features, Lightning support, etc., on my airgapped wallet. I keep an eye on the change log of each new version, and only if there is some critical bug fix will I upgrade my airgapped software. It's as simple as downloading and verifying the software on your online computer, and then securely transferring it to your airgapped computer.Quote from: un_rank on January 24, 2023, 12:05:40 PMUnderstood. I am aware not to store sensitive data like seedphrases electronically, but your first reply seemed to suggest you do that sometimes.I should have been more clear - I was referring to non-bitcoin related sensitive electronic data, such as PGP keys, or copies of important documents, that kind of thing.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 24, 2023, 10:05:11 PMOne more question: whether to modify 3-2-1 backup rule (for bitcoin private keys)?I think it is a reasonable minimum to use. For any wallet you create, write down the seed phrase twice, and store one of those copies off site. 3 copies of your data (the wallet itself plus the two paper back ups), 2 different mediums (electronic wallet and paper), 1 offsite. If you are worried about storing your raw seed phrase offsite, then use a system where compromise of the seed phrase on its own does not lead to compromise of your coins, such as multi-sig or passphrases (again all backed up separately).",

I was overthinking the situation and considering the risk of some malicious app or file being on my online device, as I use it more often and it is considered less secure than the airgapped one.It is a legitimate concern, that some malware could copy itself to your USB drive along with the new version of your software (or indeed an unsigned transaction), and then from their copy itself to your airgapped computer. Of course you can use QR codes to move transactions to avoid this, but you can't use QR codes to move an entire piece of software, such as a new wallet version. So for this I tend to download the new wallet software on a live OS before transferring it to a USB drive, so I know there is no malware lurking in my daily OS waiting to activate itself. Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 25, 2023, 01:23:04 PM... and up-to-day/in-synchronization with one another.This is the benefit of using seed phrases and HD wallets. Once you have backed up your seed phrase, then your back ups are permanently up to date and in sync with your main wallet. As soon as you recover that seed phrase, you can regenerate all the private keys and addresses you have ever used.",

Although doing it periodically is needed when you want to backup note of your address/transaction or avoid perform blockchain rescan which takes some time.With descriptors available in recent Core versions you can create a Core wallet that is based on BIP39 or even Electrum mnemonic recovery words. You can even choose arbitrary derivation paths if you want. But frankly, it's not that easy and you need some trusted tools and a secured airgapped environment because you have to deal with extended private keys (xprv...) to accomplish it. You don't want to get those any near an online device.HD wallets were an important improvement in Core, descriptors are a logical and welcome step forward for sure, especially with interoperability with other wallets in mind. Maybe, one day we get a simple to use mnemonic words setup for Core, too.",
