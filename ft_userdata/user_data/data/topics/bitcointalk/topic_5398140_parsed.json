  "content": "We had news this weekend , Monday and Tuesday that the stable coins UST depegs from  dollar USD and  has collapsed and continue to plunge in price even Luna price is currently trading around ($9 - $11)  this morning as at the time of writing.The UST stable coin is not really back by anything, so people do need to get out right away.                     HOW MUCH WOULD THESE NEGATIVELY AFFECT BTC AND THE ENTIRE CRYPTO ?.IN MY VIEWDoing this may cause the crypto death spiral and it means that there will be a panic selling and could just collapse Bitcoin ,Ethereum, and the entire Crypto market and trillions of dollars life savings could be wiped out just in a moment and currently people are loosing money on crypto Twitter right now, companies have started selling millions of dollars of UST existing , exchanging their UST back into other pegged dollar USD coin and have lost thousands of dollars just in a single transaction conversation process and the spread wasn't just very good looking at exchange rate between UST to Dollar, they just exited that position for the fear of UST finally collapsing or having a free fall , So in a worst case scenario these companies   like.Jump capital, Luna foundation guard (LFG), Do kwon the founder of Terraform labs and others are going to be selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum to try to prop up this struggling Terra ecosystem and then they may also go into their Bitcoin reserves which some of have started doing already and may also be sold to prop up Terra.Summary....Therefore going further, If the UST peg cannot hold, then I think LFG will have to dump its bag of Bitcoin it loaded and this will cause more panic selling and cause Bitcoin to spiral down and further crashing down the price of Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency as well.Please throw your own opinion on this as we have great panic right now.Link for more detailshttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/09/ust-stablecoin-falls-below-dollar-peg-for-second-time-in-48-hours/https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1524268467448389634?s=19",

LUNA holders took a risk on a project that's highly highly likely to implode (it just did), and now they face the consequences. TerraForm Labs would have to raise a HUGE amount of money to be able to bring back the peg, and I don't think VCs would risk their capital on a project that's highly likely to be dead.Quote from: buwaytress on May 11, 2022, 09:39:42 AMIs it a sign of just how completely out of touch I am in this field that I never once heard about Terra, or UST, or any of the supposed implications on Bitcoin until yesterday?

Hence it's pretty much almost backed by thin air; hence why Luna Foundation Guard had to purchase a good amount of bitcoin to protect the peg if it's the case that there's a bank run.And yea, it happened:Peg broke due to UST having a huge bank run, with people selling the UST for other stablecoins (hence pushing down the price of UST). Now for the peg to be restored to $1, Luna Foundation Guard had to liquidate a crap ton of bitcoin on their reserves just to push UST back to $1, further pushing down the downward pressure on BTC.",

One thing for sure is that when a stablecoin turns out to be otherwise then it would be good to fully scrutinize the things backing the stablecoin, in the first place. This shows that a stablecoin pegged on top fiat money can be the way to go for the time being. Sadly, this development is affecting Bitcoin and is the major reason for its price spiral...all because BTC is utilized as a back-up value for UST.",

They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA , was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christsake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.Blackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out. This was pure market manipulation.Anyway, do you think its a good buy for Luna as it now dips below $3? Unbelievable dip really so I'm doubtful whether they could recover.",

It certainly wouldn't be the first time we see something like that. Speaking of Do Kwon, just saw an interesting article about his (alleged) previous involvement in another failed algorithmic stablecoin, Basis Cash.Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/Do Kwon, the CEO of Terra creator Terraform Labs, was one of the pseudonymous co-founders behind the failed algorithmic stablecoin Basis Cash, CoinDesk has learned.Basis Cash (BAC) was a closely watched revival in decentralized finance (DeFi) circles when it launched on Ethereum in late 2020, just before the launch of terraUSD (UST), Terra’s flagship stablecoin. Like UST, BAC sought to maintain a $1 peg through code, not collateral.But it failed: The token of this long-abandoned project never achieved its target of dollar parity, sank below $1 in early 2021 and was trading well below 1 cent on Wednesday. Now history appears to be repeating: Over the last three days, UST sank precipitously below its peg, going as low as 27 cents in early morning U.S. hours Wednesday.",

The 100k you have paid has been already spent by the previous owner on hookers and drugs in the Bahamas so you will need a fairy to give you 100k, otherwise, it's 50k. Same for Luna, they need now somebody to pay 60 or 100$ per coin, fresh money from outside to recoup it, where is this money going to come from and why would anyone do it?",
