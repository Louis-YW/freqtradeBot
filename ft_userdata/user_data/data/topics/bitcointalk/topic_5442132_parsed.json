  "content": "Hi, I am looking for bitcoin and crypto currencies popular groups which provide good services in terms of knowledge and signals too.I understand that we should not follow the signals from groups and try to create our own signals with our knowledge but sometimes the signals from the groups can give confluence that our own signals match the ones being shared in public groups.So if anyone has a list of discord Servers, do mention them here.",

You might get a couple of suggestions.I don't know any good signal group in my telegram or discord because I never believe in them and probably most people around don't either. But Good luck in your quest.",
