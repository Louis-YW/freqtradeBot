  "content": "MNC: Multinational corporations. Multinational corporations can be said to be a business organization that deals and operate in two or more countries; having its headquarters mainly in its home country. Simply put, it’s a business that operates and has offices in more than one country. What makes a corporation multinational? It must have operations and should maintain offices and assets in countries other than it’s home country. These are some features of a multinational corporations;1. They operate and conduct business internationally and keeps branches in other countries2. They have and keep huge and large assets; both physical and financial 3. It must have a coordinated network of branches 4. The parent company should have indirect control on the activities of the branches5. Being a large corporation, they’ve got access to new and top notch technology 6. They employ the best trained managers with the right skill best suited for the jobIt’s impact on developing countries. Multinational corporation would argue that with their presence in developing countries, they’re actively enabling investment opportunities and economic development in these countries hereby greatly creating employment opportunities. There are merits and demerits of MNCs opening shop in a developing country. Here are some;Merits1. Employment opportunities: This is an undeniable fact that MNCs bring with them job employment for the host country, employing about 70% of its workforce from the local populace 2. New tech, ideas and innovation: Being a large and already established corporation, thy would have the best of technology and new innovations that they would bring and ultimately pass down to smaller local businesses 3. Growth: With its massive investments that would include infrastructure development among others, the host country would grow economically. Demerits1. Exploitation of cheap labor: MNCs, being attracted by the cheap labor they could get at the developing country make sure to exploit the Human Resources and pay little wages. 2. Pollution to the environment: MNCs discard their waste materials improperly, polluting the environment. Without the regulations and/enforcement on proper waste management, MNCs mostly get a pass or the government turns a blind eye to the pollution and improper waste management practices employed by the MNCs. 3. Threat to local small businesses: MNCs, being large and already established is a viable threat to small businesses as they’ve got the capital and assets. And if unchecked, they could monopolize the economy and ruin other small and upcoming businesses. 4. Exploitation of natural resources: These large corporations massively exploit both human and natural resources as most of the profit generated from doing business in the host country goes directly back to the parent country 5. It can get difficult for a healthy competition as small business obviously can’t compete and overtime, dependency on the goods produced and services rendered by the  MNCs would grow leaving no room for small local businesses. Whatever perks multinational corporations bring to its host country, we shouldn’t forget in a hurry that these corporations aren’t a charitable organization, with its primary aim is profit making and returns to its shareholders. With grants and/low tax rates given by the host government to attract these corporations, coupled with the idea of low wages and a higher profit motive, these corporations wouldn’t be there if they thought they couldn’t make profit.",

A company generally moves into somewhere because it intends to make a profit (some just do it for exposure and market share too but mostly it's about profit). These companies then find ways to avoid paying taxes on these profits by exporting them to another country with 0% or low tax rates. If the government of a country then tries to recoup this loss by adding licensing fees or other fees (such as import tax) they'll risk losing further investments from larger companies (and this is problematic if there aren't many companies wanting to invest to begin with).",

Exploitation of natural resources: These large corporations massively exploit both human and natural resources as most of the profit generated from doing business in the host country goes directly back to the parent country It is good that you mentioned this and it is important to note it that corporations or multinationals exploit the host countries resources for the advantage of parent company in their home and as you mentioned again in your last paragraph that they are not charity organizations, this means that no matter how it is painted that they recruit locals (which sometimes are underpaid), their sole aim is profit taking because they are not charitable but profit oriented.However, there is something that is suppose to be the responsibility of these multinationals that I have not seen in your list and that is that they are suppose to perform some social responsibilities to the host countries which is apart from employment of locals. So I don't know if this should fall under advantages.Multinationals corporations are suppose to perform social responsibilities to host countries that they exploit their resources and degrade there environment. The first reference is Nigeria where her Naija Delta have been badly degraded by the oil companies, excavating, rig and drilling activities that have changed the suppose natural blessing to gnashing of teeth because of the neglect through the Nigerian government. The region that is laying the \"golden egg\" for country have been neglected and this has caused droughts and food insecurity because their soil have all been bastardised because of oil drilling activities . The soil degradation that has caused them their agricultural products losses is not only the challenge there, their waters also have been polluted because of the oil drilling activities and acquatic lives is suffering as the people are predominantly farmers and fisher men, they also suffer regular floods. Consequently, the oil companies or multinationals should do well to be perform their MOU with the communities of their hosts and perform social responsibilities to communities where they are like build good road networks, award scholarship to the youths, clear up oil mess in the region, support them in aspect of need since they have taken away their environment with them, employment is not enough.",

It think I briefly mentioned it in the original post when I talked about growth.These corporations help with infrastructural development amongst others as part of its social responsibilities. In my opinion, these social responsibilities aren’t mandatory but are done to win the goodwill of the local populace and enable them conduct business smoothly.",

One thing that is often abused by multinational companies is the perks and benefits offered by host countries. The very largest of these companies can often have huge departments that are somewhat dedicated to strategic planning and extracting value for the sake of the company - not out of some benevolent. Governments in some desperate countries can sometimes be too generous in what they offer to attract them, even paying too much and negating any economic value they might actually bring. Sure they can offer jobs, but if the government pays far more upfront to secure those jobs then it might have been better to foster local companies who might return more success and taxes in future.",

Heck, it's even becoming a status symbol to a lot of them and I'm not sure as to why this is the case. This is happening evidently here in the Philippines wherein products from a multinational company will always be preferred more than local brands even if it's more expensive and offers less compared to its local counterpart. Lots of local businesses are affected by this economic infestation, and may even be the reason why there aren't a lot of successful local brands here that can topple the market share of its foreign counterpart.",

Here are some;The economies of most developing countries would collapse without the activities of multinational cooperations. From experience, the governments of most emerging nations are not good businessmen, which has resulted in the failure of most public corporations. Most public corporations are mismanaged and killed by corruption and embezzlement of funds. That's why most government businesses in my country have been privatized and sold to MNCs. Multinationals are the only hope for the citizens to get basic goods and services and also enjoy certain privileges like social responsibilities and employment opportunities.All the demerits of MNCs OP outlined prevail in most countries because of a lack of government policies or failure to implement these policies. Politicians prefer to collect bribes from these companies instead of ensuring they do the right thing. The developed world also has these multinationals but they are closely policed by different regulatory bodies to ensure that they don't cause more harm than good. In order to achieve their evil plans of exploiting and colonizing these developing nations, MNCs dabble in the local politics of their host nations. They also ensure that only politicians or the military that would promote their interests grab political power. They sometimes sponsor elections, coups, and even conflicts because of their desperate aim of reaping the people.",

I am not sure with that. What about the traveling cost, the rent, and others? But they are not worried with it because they are hoping that they will recover it all and earn more if their plans became a success. They can't just create more products but they need to estimate its demand first if it's strong or not so that there will be a less waste.In the competition part, this would depend on what is the type of business they are creating but I think each business now are all given. I mean there will always be competitors wherever country they are going. What can they only do is to create a unique product which design, features, etc are not seen yet in the other.",

A cabin boy might receive 1/250 of net profit. While the captain might take home 1/10 of profit.Profit based pay scaling motivates everyone to want to succeed. The more successful their venture is, the more they get paid. This motivates workers to work harder and do more to guarantee their mission does well. Also if their venture fails, they might not be paid much at all. It is a very meritocratic format. It contrasts from current day business where executives whose have enterprises fail might still receive significant bonuses and golden parachute deals.Profit based wage structuring is also a good historical reference for tracking trends in business and economics. If a street sweeper in 1820 was paid 1/500 of profits and a street sweeper in 2022 is paid 1/450 in profits. That makes pay scaling much easier to put into perspective.",
