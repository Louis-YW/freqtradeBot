This is very careless of there manager because he assume that they can get the visa easily without any research. This is very sad to see miss this big opportunity to get DPC points. I think they will get substitute from PH players that didnâ€™t have a chance to go on this major like players of T1.",

LGD won the Riyadh tournament with relative ease. They looked like a complete team that could beat anyone in their best of forms. Just beautiful dota to watch and they werent trying to go through some broken strats as some teams like to use to win games. They should be the favs again. They did lose 2-0 to Team Secret and they did drop a game vs OG and Nigma Galaxy but still I never had a doubt that they'd end up losing in the decider. They are a level above everyone else at the moment. you could say that they probably don't need DPC points but money/Prizepool is enough of a motivation to do well in the tournament. It is a tier 1 Tournament.",

This is enough motivation to win this major compared to OG, LGD and other top teams that already secured TI spot and also the prize pool here is not much huge.",

Gpk showed us that he still got it, although there are times that his mid lane's lack of rotations around the map can hinder him from being enabled. He's not a typical lane dominator, nor is he an aggressive carry that can work hand in hand with his support to farm for kills, but his ability to find farm even though the map is already closed in against his team is what's really impressive for me. Well, DM is great in creating space, there's that, but still.

Tundra's style of play does not match the aggression of PSG.LGD in mid game. As for Liquid, they do have a funky way of handling mid game to enable their cores before they make moves, while PSG.LGD is just constantly throwing them anything that they have to make them respond to those. The team who doesn't respond to the aggression of PSG.LGD wins the game, that's what I noticed.",

You could say that, but even with 33, Tundra is still, most of the times, hesitant to engage PSG.LGD's aggression even though they can get away of those engagements. They normally would be explosive when faced with chill opponents since they capitalize on the stagnant map to take the resources for themselves. But when faced with an even more aggressive team, they just play it slow and change their tempo. Also, you're spot on with LGD's observation. They normally have a 2-3 strat planned for BO5 games that they usually unleash on rounds leading to the final bracket. OG and Kuroky's Team Liquid back then noticed this and capitalized mostly on using extremely out of meta heroes against LGD's line up.",

Actually Torontotokyo is just stating the facts on that interview because LGD is really much tough opponent than OG that time but this will be different on Majors because OG has different game mode when they are competing to this tournament. Majors has best of 5 on finals that is very favorable to OG if they secure the finals spot. Ceb is known for being salty on chats but he never take seriously any TT on interview.
