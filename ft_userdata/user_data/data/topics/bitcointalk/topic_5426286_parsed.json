If it is a human being, then he will gonna be in trouble because he won't gonna escape such a crime and his wealth won't gonna save him unless they will suddenly announce his false death and let him hide forever.This is just another piece of news that will gonna be buried because of lack of evidence and TESLA is big to handle for such only kind of deeds.If they wanted to get him, they need to investigate well and gather concrete evidence that would gonna surely send him to jail, that if they will really gonna find something.",

What are your thoughts on this?  link I won't say I'm Elon Musk's biggest fan but if that were true that he used animals as lab rat then it's not a new thing. I mean, isn't it a common thing among scientists? I even read somewhere that NASA sends apes to space while carrying out research and experiment. People have been trying to get Elon for a while now so all these reports are not new. I can't say if he's clean or not but he's a billionaire. You can't get to that level without pissing off some people and stepping on some toes. There was a report that claimed Elon's company paid a flight attendant $250k after she accused him of sexual harassment. These reports will keep coming. I've also seen an article where it says he has six more sexual harassment lawsuit. My point is you never know what's true and what's not from the media. So don't pay much attention to them.",

What are your thoughts on this?  link Remember, if you are good at something, or you have achieved in any particular place and status, you might have a lot of people against you and fewer in your favor. But, on the other hand, I think there might be many positive and active shortly. Still, the point here is Elon musk is undoubtedly a significant influencer who can make a significant impact in any field as well as on the minds of millions of people.",

What are your thoughts on this?  link I don't know how he got those animals. But I am sure there are legal processes of acquiring animals for experiments. If he got them illegally, then he should be held responsible. But from the news, it is clear that Neuralink didn't violate these laws but their just claims by maybe aggrieved or concerned staff that animals are dying more than they should because Elon Musk is mounting pressure on his staff to make progress quickly. I think the firm should be cautioned and the experiment should be allowed to go on based on standard practices. This is because these experiments might give birth to a new discovery that can revolutoinalize the health sector.   Thank God he is using animals, what about firms that secretly uses humans for these experiment. And their usual specimen choice is usually one part of the world?",

It's about getting your results with minimal pain/death to animals.For example if you have the option of running a test on 10 monkeys that would take 10 days and likely kill some of them to get the results or you could get the same test results in 9 days if you put 5000 monkeys at risk, it would probably be unethical to go with the 5000 monkey option unless that one day could be the difference in saving the world or something.",
