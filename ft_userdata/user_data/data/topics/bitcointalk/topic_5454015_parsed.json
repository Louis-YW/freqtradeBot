I can see you have a good history so if you can supervise it, it will help me a lot. But if not, could you help me find another trusted member for it ? I've already asked minerjones but he doesn't do this kind of escrow.Estimated based on what? Don't tell me it's your zero volume \"NFT collection\"?",

Point remains, all you got on your wallet is a bunch of nfts you created that have literal zero volume or trading history. You minted a jpeg and are claiming it's \"estimated at 7200$\". The real estimation is 0$, thus you seem to lack the collateral for the loan.",
