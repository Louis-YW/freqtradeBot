I know about Bitcoin and this Forum in 2016 and back then it was quite easy to get 1 BTC just by entering a bounty or contest. Those who have been able to survive until now with thousands or even hundreds of Bitcoins that they have held, it is incredible.But most people have sold it at a high price in the past, but if you add it up now, then it is millions of dollars that you won't be able to get easily. They have 100++ in the pastQuote from: Garrett Burgwardt on June 07, 2011, 04:53:28 AMEnough I will say that I've got 100 saved away in a tough to access location for a rainy day.

In 2011, 1 bitcoin reached $1 for the first time. Granted, that year it rose up to almost $30 which is crazy growth but just compare it to today’s price. Almost at $70k, everyone is holding and not even everyone can easily buy 1 btc. QuoteMost of them earn from mining, giveaways, faucets and some contests that give away Bitcoin prizes. Bitcoin has proved itself to be a very valuable asset that no one is really willing to give some away anymore. Some people do not even want to reveal that they hold bitcoin for safety purposes.",

      "body": "That's an interesting question that nobody would honestly answer. Anyway, I also came here in 2016. Bitcoin was already showing that its potentials are within reach. Alas, I was still naïve, and suspicious too. I came here when a coin was only worth hundreds. And although it was already widely accepted that it could still rise, that it would reach as high as $10,000 or $20,000 was probably moonshot. Or perhaps I was sorely lacking in foresight. Had I known, I could have bought tens and kept it until today. But I failed that part. So, I might as well make up for that failure and gather as much as I can today. Nothing's too late. A million per coin is a long shot today. But it's just the same story all over again. Tomorrow, we'll look back to this day and be happy we were given a second chance. Others will not enjoy this passing opportunity.",

This conversations that are so casually talking about hundreds of bitcoin is such a nostalgia and regret to me, I've known about bitcoin and I would've invested in it but I wasn't that interested enough to really try it out and at the end of the day, I can't really blame myself though, I was still in the last leg of elementary education so the money isn't really there anyway.",

Bitcoin was still just a speculation, one they must have been ridiculed for sticking to and they used threads like that as motivation to each otherNone of them if asked today will talk transparently about their finance now and no one now would either.

Really cool to see conversations like that where they're so casual about the price of bitcoin and that 100 is such a normal amount that it's so awesome that you'd wish you were there at that time but then I remember that probably 10 years or more from now, 0.001 would be a crazy number for other people too because bitcoin is expected to go up in the long-term so I'm happy that I'm not too late and that I can still get to the possibility that I'd make a lot of money out of profit from hodling my bitcoin even if the price of one is already in the tens of thousands of dollars.",

If we talks about 2016, it was an easy way to accumulate many satoshis. I remember those days as I tried to get Bitcoin from the faucet. That was memorable for me and I am sure that many people who were there that year will have the same experience. However, as the years go by, it will be difficult to accumulate more Bitcoin. Bitcoin price increase and we must allocates more money to buy Bitcoin. But for those people who already had a good experienced before, they will still buy Bitcoin and hold it. But I will not tells how many Bitcoin I have until now. That is my secret and only me that will knows for sure. I will still buy more Bitcoin because Bitcoin can helps me to make a big profit in the future.",

Collecting bitcoins from signature campaigns is a pretty good way to go, as long as you still have income other than signatures.I am aware that no one will answer to Bitcoin ownership, it is privacy and it becomes very vulnerable to being known by the public.It is also because the price of Bitcoin is expensive and has always reached ATH to date.",
