      "body": "Exactly, this is what i have in my mind from the start about these signals because at start i thought why we should give 20$ per month to a stranger to whom we only know via Youtube, and tryst our valuable money on behalf of there signals. But then i thought many people are doing it and they are sharing some of there VIP member's profits too in the group. So i thought i should calculate there signals's accuracy manually.Well, by doing that, i have narrowed down some good signal provider, who not only provide the signals but also provide the back story of it, which is really good. Making money and earning both at the same time is what i meed and they are providing. But still i do not know why i hesitate to join them, maybe because they have asked us to come with a capital of 500$ if we want to start trading in spot.Because till now, i have not manged to save that much money which i could risk. So from now i am just ignoring this and trying to learn on my own and tbh when you have a person (experienced one) near you, you grow faster. So i prefer there is nothing bad in following signals which tells the backstory of that signal too, but there is no benefit in following the signals with no background knowledge like why we are doing it and why we should set these target what premises are we calculating it on.",

How ironical!Yeah close to that, like you pulling the trigger at the instructions of a commander behind you. I think signal patronizers are not really interested in the act of trading, to them the act is boring and they want to quickly go in for the profit. They go through this risk and not concerned with the losses if it comes. Maybe there is a set of class of traders like that, that only do copy trading while they invest their time in other businesses.",

They CAN be useful if used together with strategy as a sort of alert to follow your strategy anyway.Same thing for gambling, people sell all kinds of arbitrage tips and signals (like trading but with odds) and you won't make money if you blindly follow them.",

Joining signal groups, receiving signals and depending on signals and groups are not good. If those signal deliverers are right with their analysis, you get profit but oppositely you will lose capital.In addition, many people will buy coin before you receive those signals. They can be those signal group owners or members of internal groups and you will be like liquidity provider for those people to take profit more easily.",

Learning to analyze independently will provide better knowledge than relying on others. See how many people have lost because of wrong signals.

Some people are always looking for trading signals due to laziness, they are not ready to do analysis on their own, they want someone that will do it for them and they are going to pay them.",

The funny thing is that the majority of those purchasing signals had no knowledge of cryptocurrency trading; they simply heard that people were making a lot of money through cryptocurrency trading, and instead of learning enough about Bitcoin, they ended up fully relying on their trading signals, which mostly led them astray.These signal providers are also losing money in bitcoin trading, but they never publish their trading history; they only show the once they have profited.
