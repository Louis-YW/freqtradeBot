TERMS AND CONDITIONS: www.lealana.com/tac.phpTURNAROUND TIMECOINS WILL BE SHIPPED 2 to 3 WEEKS AFTER PAYMENT HAS BEEN MADE AND ASSUMING FUNDING OF THE COIN ADDRESSES ARE DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN SOME CASES IT MAY SHIP SOONER. ALL COINS ARE REQUIRED TO BE FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER BEFORE SHIPMENT. All Shipments are shipped via USPS Registered Mail with restricted delivery (meaning you have to show your ID and sign for the package).If you wish to purchase Lealana BTC brass/nickel coins and do not wish to fund the coins, you may do so but each coin’s hologram will be marked as “BUYER FUNDED” denoting this coin was never funded before it shipped.FUNDING YOUR COIN(S) <—— Important1. All coins intended on being funded are required to be funded BEFORE they are shipped out. Any digital value that is stored on the coins while in transit are at your sole risk and responsibility. Lealana is not responsible for any digital cryptocurrency value while in transit by mail courier.2. Your coin addresses will be PGP signed and sent to you for you to fund with the EXACT face value of (0.01 BTC).3. You will have up until the 2nd week from the time of your order to fund the addresses. 4. Should you miss this deadline your coin shipment will be delayed. Rainbow ART ALIGNMENT The rainbow artwork on the coin will be aligned on a best-effort basis. No coin alignment is perfect, no coin is perfect either.ERROR COINSSeptember 5th 2022 Update: For the collectors out there, here is an interesting find I came across.It appears the first 'L' in LEALANA is in the wrong place leaving a gap between the rest of the characters in the name spelling \"L   EALANA\".After going through the inventory these are the current counts I've found for each type.3 for Nickel Rainbow Design D6 for Brass Rainbow Design DThese are being included in the production sales and shipping out with customer orders. Be on the look out to see if you can find one or more of these in your rolls.If I find anymore (which I doubt) I will discard them/destroy them.Not sure how this happened. But it definitely to me is categorized as an error. You be the judge.",

Are you considering acquiring funded (0.01 BTC) OR buyer-funded coins (sets/rolls) ? If I understood correctly from the OP, you will need to provide an additional 0.8 BTC for funding the 80 coins.Furthermore, for the \"RAINBOW Nickel-plated Brass\" & \"BTC RAINBOW Brass coins\", there are 4 designs each (A, B, C, and D), hence a truly full set/collection should consist of 10 coins?",
