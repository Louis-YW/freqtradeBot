  "content": "Hi,I created an account on the scammer company localbitcoins.com and deposited a few bitcoins. - After that it got locked. I asked the costumer support why my account is locked asked them to unlock it.The costumer support answered they can not give any information.After trying to verify my account what worked 2-3 times, the account got locked again without using it at all, I asked to get a proof of balance of my account. But the costumer support just say they can not give any proof of it. After asking 3 times I just found out all support tickets got deleted, and I am afraid they will delete my balance.Is there anything I can do?",

      "body": "Your support tickets may have been marked as solved on their end, that's why. It's also worth mentioning that not all support agents know what they're doing e.g. they could close your ticket abruptly, give false answers, make the conversation longer than it should be, etc...Don't trouble yourself with the proof of balance thing. Focus on requesting to lift the restriction they put in your account. Exchanges don't delete your balance, what they do is come up with a reason to prohibit their users from withdrawing and stay in the gray area of law. This balance you speak of are just numbers and your coins are already in their wallet which they can spend however they want.",

I am afraid they just delete my account and I dont have any proof and nobody beleave me.Localbitcoins is not a scam site, what you're describing sounds like you got phished.  There are plenty of scams out there that have very similar looking URLs.You should have a transaction listed in your wallet, you can use that transaction to prove you sent the money.  Regardless, as I said before you probably got scammed by an impostor, so it's very unlikely that you'll get your money back even if you could prove that you sent the funds to their address.",

Then also prepare a signature message that proves your ownership address. I guess that's enough as evidence.I don't know what kind of wallet they use as escrow, I just hope it's a centralized wallet swept to their 1 main wallet.",

It's only Bisq that is a truly decentralized Bitcoin p2p exchange if you are trying to exchange Bitcoin for fiat.Localcryptos is noncustodialHodlHodl is custodial, but they are not yet so strict on KYC. But they can ask for KYC anytime.

I was thinking Localcryptos is a decentralized exchange, but out of all decentralized exchanges, only Bisq is most decentralized, that is true. I will look into localcryptos ToS and check if KYC can be requested for, if so, it means it is not decentralized but working like instant exchanges, I find this new and I will look into it.",
