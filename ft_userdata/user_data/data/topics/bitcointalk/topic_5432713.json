The fake one that OP is talking about, /r/giftcaredxchange, is a private community. You can't view it publicly, and you need approval from their moderators to access it. It could be a scam, hence the resemblance with the legit reddit channel.Quote from: accounts.sellerz on January 03, 2023, 03:02:16 PMthen why i was banned?i just mentioned this chat and i got banned Where did you get banned? Was it from the giftcaredxchange channel? If they are scammers, it's pretty obvious, right? They scammed you and banned you so you can't speak out against them. How did you find that community? Did someone suggest you should go there or did you make a mistake thinking you were dealing with giftcardexchange? I didn't read the chat you posted because if the person that scammed you isn't part of this forum, there is nothing anyone here can do, unfortunately, except warn others to be careful of that group.",
