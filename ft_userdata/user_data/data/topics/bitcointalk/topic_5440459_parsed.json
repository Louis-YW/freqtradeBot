Taking the current rules, and adding more, but without invaliding the previous.Correct. Soft fork is all about adding more rules/restrictions to the consensus rules. We could view it as limiting the number of things that are valid. For example previously dummpy item for OP_CHECKMULTISIG could be anything including OP_0 but now it is limited to only OP_0.QuoteDoes that encourage old clients to switch to new version, since they might hear on blocks that are likely to reorg?It should because they can no longer be considered Full [Verification] Nodes since they no longer \"verify everything\".QuoteWhat could be the excuse of a non-Segwit node to stay in non-Segwit?I can think of two reasons:1. Laziness2. Trying to avoid bugs in new releases eg. (usually done by running multiple versions)",

What could be the excuse of a non-Segwit node to stay in non-Segwit?It is more accurate to say that the new rules in a soft fork are more restrictive. That is, things that were once valid are no longer necessarily valid after the fork.The interesting twist is that features have been added in a soft fork by taking an instruction that is always valid and always succeeds -- NOP, and changing its meaning so that it may now fail.It is important to note that a majority of miners must adopt the soft fork in order for it to work. If a majority of miners do not adopt the soft fork, then a transaction that is not valid according to the rules of the soft fork will still be valid because the longest chain would still treat the new instructions according to the old rules.",

Think of this: you're a miner who wants to trick some client who runs a non-Segwit node. You can take any UTXO you don't own and spend it to their address with an invalid signature. They can't verify the signature, so including it in a block is considered valid to them. Of course, it's soon going to be reorged, because no miner will build on top of a non-Segwit chain.",
