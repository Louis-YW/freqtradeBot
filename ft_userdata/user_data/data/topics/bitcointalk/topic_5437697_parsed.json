  "content": "Evening, looking for some help after days of trying to recover my wallet.dat file.Heres the story, litecoin acquired 2017ish, backed up on HDD, i accessed this again in 2021 using Litecoine Core.HDD failed recently and a local company has recovered as much as they could to a new drive. Some photos and videos wont open (presumably corrupt) but majority saved.The location i saved my Wallet.dat file is accessible and ive got 1 file that is 1400kb (Im pretty sure this is the LTC) and a few other copies and maybe one stratis wallet that all show 88kb.I downloaded LTC core and after fully synchronising tried to load each wallet.dat file, all of them deliver the same message.... 'error:Â  Failed to load database path 'c:\\users....' Data is not in recognized format'Ive tried my best over the days to use pywallet and IF i did it all correct pretty much came away with no keys found. I did put a password on the .dat file which i know.... however when using pywallet no matter what password i put in it said, file is encrypted, password is correct..... so presumably i did something wrong there.Thanks in advance for your help, happy to negotiate a bounty if you wish but theres not an awful lot on these, enough to bring me here though!",
