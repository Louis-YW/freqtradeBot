      "body": "Inflation is the cause of that problem and I think that the government of your country hasn't set up a strategy to combat the high rate of inflation in your country. This is happening to so many third world countries that their minimum wage is below $45. From the title of your topic,I think if you want to depend on the government to bring you out of poverty,you are getting it wrong, because it is only you that can set your goals for yourself and work towards achieving it. Some governments are after themselves and their families, they don't care about what the citizens are passing through. My country is a typical example, government don't created job employment or create empowerment programmes to assit those that what to learn one skill or the other. So many Africa countries governments have failed in their part to provide for their citizens,instead when they are on power,they loot public funds and treasures for their selfish interest. Protests are all most everywhere in Africa countries by their citizens about the unfair treatment by their leaders.Learn a skill and it will help your overcome poverty because if the economy is getting worst, you will always have a job to balance the economy state.",

All national governments are always facing inflation problems, and when a country ignores it, it is not unlikely that the country will face hyperinflation. Something that most countries do not allow to happen.Therefore, as much as possible, other countries are making ways to lower the values of prime commodities in our lives. That's why other governments are increasing the interest rate maybe. But if it is individual poverty, of course, we are the only ones who can change the poverty we are facing.",

Poverty exists in every country, but the proportion varies depending on the rich-poor ratio; only the government has the powerful tool to determine this ratio, which demonstrates how a country's government is performing. There is no way for every citizen of a country to have the same financial status in either a capitalist or a social system of government or even a traditional system of government, but the government can suppress the level of poverty so that life is comfortable for everyone and it does not appear as if the poor masses are abandoned while the rich people enjoy the economy alone.In reality, if the government fails to fight poverty, it will harm even the wealthy since no one will offer some essential necessities for the wealthy, such as agriculture and products, for example, provision of a good mechanized agricultural system for the less privileged farmers would assist grow the economy and the availability of food in the country, that how the government should give and take to fight poverty, the farmers will have money and the government will have their tax and enough food for everyone.",

Even countries with honest and hardworking government officials are having a hard time dealing with the inflation crisis. O government is exempted but they could do alternatives to lighten up the burden of their people. However, in some countries, government officials are also taking advantage of the situation. Instead of making solutions, they are doing corruption in different branches of the government. That's why people who rely on the government are really experiencing hardships. That's why it is better to work hard in our own ways so we can deal with the crisis because we have no one to rely on.",

I have an example but I won't mention the country but it seems one of the ministers in that country said that \"if corruption can be eradicated in that country, then the proceeds from mining projects in that country can pay every person in that country around 20 million rupiah per month\". Well, from the minister's words, I myself just understood that the income of a state that has a natural gas mine or something like that actually has such a high state income from this mining. but unfortunately there is still a lot of corruption going on so often the benefits for the state even flow in the wrong direction (corrupt hands). But we also don't blame the government as a whole because the people also have to work together in this matter to eradicate corruption. because corruption does not only occur in government but also in companies and in other matters outside government institutions.",

The government could potentially achieve this, countries like Norway with it's sovereign wealth fund - where oil money was directed into a big public purse instead of being sold of for pennies to private shareholders, are rather successful. However politicians are often short term, very egotistical and usually looking out for their own interests in the long run. Whether that means they have subtle bribery teased in front of them, like cushy consulting jobs after retirement or generous hospitality packages for smaller favors. The world of business is constantly trying to manipulate laws to increase their advantage, maybe by stifling competitors or deregulating at the public expense.",
