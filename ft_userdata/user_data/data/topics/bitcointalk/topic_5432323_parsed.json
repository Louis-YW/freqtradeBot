Observing the market during the bear season, is always tactical and one need to be extremely careful with dealing with projects in the market. Short term trading is beneficial to those who practice it consistently and with good planning, profits is achievable. Scalping is risky but with a lengthy experience, it's advisable to always check the price actions before applying your execution on the market. Altcoins proved beyond doubt that they're both profitable in the long and short term.",

Long term investment starts from 6 month and above. It can be up to 1 year, 2, 3 or 4 years. Long term investment can even be more than 4 years.If you invest when the price is low like this, long term investment is more profitable.

It involves making a large number of trades in a short period of time, usually with the goal of making small profits on each trade. In a bear market, such as the one you described, scalping can be more challenging because the overall trend is downward, making it harder to find opportunities for profitable trades. However, if you have a large pool of capital and good leverage, it may be possible to make money through scalping, as long as you are careful not to get greedy and are able to cut your losses quickly when necessary. It's also important to keep an eye on the price of bitcoin, as it can have a significant impact on the value of other cryptocurrencies, or \"altcoins.\"",

For sure you will gain too much at that time but when the hype will be done, it will boil down to rapidly decreasing the price. But it is different with the bitcoin, when it has a bull run, bitcoin will continue the price growing up most commonly after the next halving which is proven for how many years it could be there is an ATH and that time would be your harvesting time. However, you need to wait for another 4-5 years before you will see your profit. Of course --the high risk would become a high return if you will choose altcoins for short-term either scalping.",

You cannot expect hundreds of percent profit in scalping unless you are involved in a group that is doing dump and pump, usually traders doing scalping do on coins that are more stable and aim for small profits but with lots of trades.I have stopped on scalping because the market is sometimes unexpected, and like having to start from zero when it happens.",

Moreover, short time is also used for hodling like short time hodling and long time hodling while swing trade is at no time considered or classified in hodling.",

Scalping can also be done when the chart is at certain moments such as the Double Bottom Pattern, for example opening up more profit opportunities.",
