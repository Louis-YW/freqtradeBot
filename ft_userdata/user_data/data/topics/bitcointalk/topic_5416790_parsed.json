  "content": "EvrmoreA Peer-to-Peer System for Decentralized Finance and Commerce ApplicationsThe Ravencoin community fork for DeFi            Overview:Evrmore is a blockchain project which is specifically targeted at Distributed Finance and Commerce Applications. It is a code fork of Ravencoin, which itself enhanced the Bitcoin codebase and protocol to support assets. Evrmore is being built by current and former Ravencoin developers, hodlers, and miners as a parallel effort using a different set of trade-offs with different goals and different strategies. Evrmore seeks to improve upon Ethereum's failed security promises by further enhancing Ravencoin's asset protocol to enable Distributed Finance functionality WITHOUT general-purpose smart contracts and WITH the security of bitcoin.Coin Specs:          Algorithm: EvrProgPow (Programmable POW with 3GB starting DAG)          Whitepaper: https://github.com/EvrmoreOrg/whitepaper/blob/master/Evrmore_Whitepaper_2022-09-12.pdf          Roadmap: https://hans-schmidt.github.io/mastering_evrmore/roadmap_tech_docs/roadmap_tech_docs.html           Block Time: 1 minute          Block Reward: 2778 EVR (2500.2 EVR to the miner & 277.8 to minerdevfund)          Block Reward halving schedule: ~3.2years          Total Coin Supply: <21 Billion          Block Size: 2MB (may increase in the future)          Pre-mine: No          Founders Reward: No          ICO: No          Masternodes: No          Airdrop: Only a one-time Forkdrop (chain fork implemented as an airdrop)            -a UTXO snapshot of RVN was taken and copied into the EVR genesis block as 1 EVR per 1 RVN)            -snapshot time: Ravencoin block 2,510,000 (2022-10-25 02:47:20-UTC)            -start of mining:  block #1 was mined 2022-10--31 15:03:40-UTC          RPC port: 8819          Network port: 8820New!!: Introducing EvrLight - The asset layer for Bitcoin-Lightning !!        Now application developers can use Evrmore as the hidden asset layer for Bitcoin-Lightning. Casual users can buy and sell event tickets,         subscriptions, coupons and NFTs trustlessly and atomically using only their Lightning-capable Bitcoin wallet !        Learn More: Click HereEvrLight is a perfect match for Bitcoin-Lightning because like Bitcoin, Evrmore is built on UTXOs; and like Lightning, EvrLight is built on HTLCs.When using EvrLight:   Bitcoin is the Layer-1 for Lightning money   Evrmore is the Layer-1 for Lightning assetsEvrLight is an enhanced protocol based on cross-chain BTC-Lightning submarine swap technology interacting with the Evrmore on-chain UTXO Assets to buy and sell those Assets using only BTC-Lightning payments.For More Information:          https://evrmorecoin.org          https://github.com/evrmoreorg          https://twitter.com/@EvrFoundation          https://discord.gg/4csauGuvw3",
