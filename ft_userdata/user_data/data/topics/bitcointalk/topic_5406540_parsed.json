That isn't true.  Over the last year the US Dollar Index has risen from 91 to 109.  While this does indicate the world has gone crazy, it certainly shows that people are fleeing to what they believe is the world's strongest currency, the US Dollar.  It is still the global reserve currency and as we enter a recessionary rate raising environment it is clear that is where the money is flowing.  How this is possible with all the printing we just did...  Well, that's why we're all here.  Bitcoin and alternative payment assets are ripe for their day in the sun.  https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy",

I've seen it's possible to trade that in the past and I imagine that is what's being done now to produce money for whoever's getting it.Commodities are also up, the money that was in Netflix could've moved to oil. Broadcasting stocks have once again taken a huge hit internationally (a lot of investors got nervous about online subscription services)...",

The last time that this happen to our local fiat, it's like in the 2008 market crash or 2000. So there is no strength in dollar right now, means mean that we are all *f**k* up as recession is 100% real and it's hard to recover from this one.",

But market always calculate a year ahead to profit from buing back stocks from people who will panic sell when a recession news will be on every newslater. After companies profits will go down. After few bankruptcy. Why market expect recession? Becase of yield curve inversion, broken supply chains, war, extreame high inflation, quantitative tightening, bullwhip effect, reverse wealth effect.",

I think it pretty much boils down to the fact that in economic situations like this, we shouldn't really be striving to outperform in markets but rather to just lose less.^Of course don't just stare at your cash/investments, do your best in outperforming through your income streams.",

The US has always been extremely aggressive in defending its currency and national interests, and I have no doubt that it will be so in the future.Quote from: adaseb on July 17, 2022, 03:01:26 AMThe US dollar is not down.

I think towards the end of 2022 we might start to see a recession. Maybe it's just rumours, but I've been reading and hearing for some time now that the biggest companies in the US will lay off people, and in rather large numbers - Coinbase announces that it will lay off as many as 1100 people, which amounts to about 18% of the total number of employees.Quote from: https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs-2022/After a banner year for tech, layoffs are here. In fact, as of mid-July, more than 28,000 workers in the U.S. tech sector have been laid off in mass job cuts so far in 2022, according to a Crunchbase News tally.",
