People throw the word 'ponzi' around, without understanding what it actually is.A pomzi scheme, functions similar to a pyramid scheme, where a central authority lures investors with the incentive of profits, which are gained from earlier investors.Bitcoin is an asset which is projected to appreciate in value over time with more adoption and popularity and based on price history, just like stocks of public companies and many other assets. Bitcoin also has utility besides buying and selling as it allows borderless P2P transactions between usersThere is no central authority or promise of profit.",

Its not actually Bitcoin itself.If you don't want to buy the dip because you are in an emotional state of fear from the price dropping lower than you thought or hoped, then thats fine. But there is absolutely no reason to spread FUD. You want others to panic sell too?The current price of BTC is going down, not because of a ponzi scheme but because of increasing FUD.If Binance disables Bitcoin withdrawal for whatever random reason, the price drops because of panic sellers. You know who buys that coin? Binance. Same goes for every other big player hoping to buy cheap coin from scared coiners...",

BIG DIFFERENCE:   No one is saying BLOCKCHAIN will not exist, just the BitCoin PONZI scheme that is using the blockchain will go to near zero.   Bitcoin is NOT blockchain.  BITCOIN is not all cryptos, I am sure the Federal Reserve Coin will exist on the blockchain well into the future.Just like PETS.COM was not the internet.  Pets.com gone, internet itself is still here.   Quote from: goldkingcoiner on June 18, 2022, 05:36:31 PMThe current price of BTC is going down, not because of a ponzi scheme but because of increasing FUD.BTC is going down because the PONZI is ending, there was no FUD near the highs of 68,000 dollars, but the price went down regardless.   More people wanted to sell near 60,000 than wanted to buy.   Smart money sold their BitCoin near the top, the fear and FUD now that the crash is in progress is the DUMB MONEY, the bag holders figure it out....[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

      "body": "Lots of fly-by-night scams on the scene but in the end it doesn't define bitcoin at all. Schiff has been stating all these negativities about bitcoin every time it hits the reds, but he's always quiet when the price rises and the overall market sentiment on bitcoin is positive. Also, 'Schiff is right?' How many times does it need for him to hit the correct predictions before bitcoin goes to zero? He's been right for a lot of times I can remember, but bitcoin is still here and still manages to get by and break records.  Quote from: HardFacts on June 18, 2022, 05:43:01 PMQuote from: goldkingcoiner on June 18, 2022, 05:36:31 PMThe current price of BTC is going down, not because of a ponzi scheme but because of increasing FUD.BTC is going down because the PONZI is ending, there was no FUD near the highs of 68,000 dollars, but the price went down regardless.   More people wanted to sell near 60,000 than wanted to buy.   Smart money sold their BitCoin near the top, the fear and FUD now that the crash is in progress is the DUMB MONEY, the bag holders figure it out....Yeah maybe 'the ponzi' affects the global stock markets too, because there is also a sell-off happening right now on that part of the investment market.
