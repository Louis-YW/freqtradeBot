CBN's decision to flag their is believed to be in relation to the near $6.3 million (2.9 billion naira) Flutterwave hack, as the bank account have yet-to-be proven affiliations with the hack.QuoteAccording to local news source on Feb. 19, Albert Onimole, legal counsel for Nigerian fintech company Flutterwave, reported to police in Yaba, Lagos, that almost $6.5 million (3 billion naira) had been illegal transferred from the accounts of his client.QuoteIn an official statement, Flutterwave denied the hack, saying it identified an unusual trend of transactions on some users profile and immediately launch a review in line with its standard operating procedures. The  review purportedly that some users who had not activated recommended security settings might be susceptible to hacking. This statement added that Flutterwave was able to address the issue before any harm was done to its users.https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-crypto-investors-question-central-bank-s-decision-to-flag-p2p-users/https://twitter.com/wealthyrichy10/status/1632504018399383554?t=_3HUVBmgt0_yiGdUBImB0w&s=19It is no longer news about the ban of cryptocurrency in the country but one thing that is not clear is the connection between the flutterwave hack and P2P trades. Are they correct with their findings that the money trail revealed how it was used to acquire crypto assets through P2P services? Or is it because the ban of cryptocurrency has little effect on crypto enthusiasts as digital assets are mostly been traded through P2P services, so in other to instill fear and discourage people from using it, CBN came up with this cock and bull story about the flutterwave hack?

We all know the situation in Nigeria as CBN dislike crypto transactions, people that are making use of crypto P2P are not even flagging the transaction to be about cryptocurrencies. But CBN is targeting those in connection with Flutterwave hack, they are not concerned if the person uses it for bitcoin or crypto transaction or not.",

The fact that some miscreants are using it to perpetrate evil doesn't make it all bad. History is knocking on our doorstep and Nigerians don't want to be left behind, and we are maximizing every opportunity as it comes.

Thanks for bringing up these, @Sokani. This tweet was done on March 23. Like I said before, Flurtter Wave denies the hacking claims. I hope Charles-Tim sees this.Though initially, it was still Fluerwave that made claims that they were hacked, and the hackers made away with $2.9 billion on 63 transaction to 28 different Nigeria bank aaccounts.Then on march 23, they came up with their tweet to say that they were not hacked.Quote According to Onimole’s complaint letter, the hack on Flutterwave’s accounts occurred from February 13, and the money was said to have initially been transferred to 28 bank accounts in 63 transactionsQuote from: Charles-Tim on March 31, 2023, 11:26:52 AMNot that Flutterwave denied the hacking precisely, but blaming it on people that do not follow security measures.Flutterwave was just unrealistic with the whole claims and I can say they made a false claim from the beginning.",

Nigeria no get the facility to use tracks this scams and our case no dey pass few months e dun die. If na  dem really track the case for years to get the scammers. I just dey pity those wey fall victim to this scammers and you no go blame them as e fit happen to anybody, personal I dey like trade in smaller value since this scammers dey normally target account wey dey very active in the trade with large amount.

I no go lie, this breaching scam is actually getting out of hand and something urgently gat needs to be done or we all face another general punishment by our Nigerian government (as we know say eh no dey take 2secs for them to drop am). Because I just read the article link provided above, and I must say that it's very bad in most cases seeing trader suffer punishment for the crime they know totally nothing about, just simply because the buyer paid them through the hacked account. QuoteBeneficiaries of the ₦2.9 billion ($6.3 million) Flutterwave breach reported in March have confirmed they were detained by the police.So here are few lessons I think we should all learn from all this thing happening.1. Never sell large amount of crypto coin at once, as you never can know if the money might be a stolen money, like in the case of Ajayi and Williams who got arrested for getting paid from a hacked flutterwave account.QuoteAjayi’s story (crypto trader) is similar to Williams’.  He sold USDT to a Chinese customer for naira, and like Williams, he has been in business with this customer for years.He told Techpoint Africa that the transaction started on March 21 and ended on March 22, 2023. He said the total amount of USDT sold was around ₦200 million.2. Bitcoin remains the best place to store our funds and have total control of it, because just in the case of Phillip whose fund got deducted #20,000 and yet to recover his fund till date. If only had he store his funds in Bitcoin, it would have been safeQuotesome Flutterwave users who had funds removed from their accounts without authorisation are yet to be reimbursed.Similarly, another Flutterwave user, Philip, is yet to get a refund of the ₦‎20,000 ($43) that left his account in September 2022.",
