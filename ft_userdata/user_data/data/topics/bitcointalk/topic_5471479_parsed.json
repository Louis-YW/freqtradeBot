  "content": "Bitcoin is an artwork of universal laws. It seems that once it started, no one was going to stop it. The more it persists, the less one can stop it. The laws that bitcoin represents so marvelously, thus the design that is the fundament of its existence, transcends the conditions of time, so that any events related to it now depend on bitcoin and not the other way around. There is, in other words, no event that has more influence on bitcoin, than bitcoin itself. One day this will all be cleared among the common human thinking. For now, we say:Bitcoin may be the human work closest to something divine, in other words, free from imperfections and relativity, after the work of Jesus Of Nazareth. This is the destiny of those who work by faith and for things higher than times and people: to work outside of others’ understanding, sometimes one’s own understanding. To work knowing that no one fully understands now, possibly at the right moment in the future, and sometimes never. Thus regarding the work Satoshi have done, being human, they probably do not comprehend it fully in nature, nor do we do now, possibly in the future, maybe never. Surely the work of Jesus Of Nazareth, in the guise of Christ, one will never fully understand. This is the great feat of human beings, to pursue something not by belief but by faith. And a great gift granted to us: that in doing the right thing we need not to know the full truth, but by virtue of knowledge and wisdom be close to it, and by virtue of faith have it in our heart.",

I don't know what to say, but BTC is not free from imperfections, it still has many scalability issues, which have already discussed so many times here, I will just mention some old threads here for your understanding of those issues.A different approach to Bitcoin's scalability issues? Biggest challenges of bitcoin...The second one is too legit, and it still needs to be solved, well, overall, BTC just faced the Ordinals problem which was used to inscribe some war logs and other criminal documents, photos, and videos, on the BTC blockchain. Many take it as an error in the Blockchain a fault they consider it. But many take ordinals as an improvement, Well, overall I will say don't compare BTC with religion because it is not, it is just mathematical and algorithmic technology providing p2p encryption, anonymity, and decentralization. Its destiny does not depend on itself only, it depends on the demand and supply, The current example is of SEC News about ETF, if that got accepted then BTC is up otherwise is down. Then tell me who is controlling the destiny of BTC now.",

And if you say that bitcoin is from nature, I will not also argue with you because the same Bible you quoted also said that nothing is new in this world and no human beings can do any new thing so everything invented in the world is a plan work of God. But even at that human being has to discover it and that is what happened to bitcoin. God perfect everything to Satoshi Nakamoto to create bitcoin so the future of bitcoin is bright.",

I'm indeed an admirer of both Bitcoin and Jesus for how close they are to perfection and freedom. The mentioning of Jesus should not be perceived as a way to make Bitcoin a religion, nor Jesus is mentioned in a religious way, but rather to compare Bitcoin to something we know as a work of stupendous faith. Furthermore, I'm speaking of Jesus and Bitcoin as examples of peak artistry and feat, where the protagonist has walked on the most efficient path of creation, or very close to it. The universe is the entity whose walking is constantly on the path of perfect creation, being it Creation itself. Here is why Bitcoin is very close to being universal. Indeed, bitcoin is very close to how the universe works.",

Am trying to understand the definition of bitcoin from your perspective, knowing the fact that bitcoin is not perfect because nothing is perfect but bitcoin is beneficiary to man kind and anyone who becomes part of this technology.

Same thought after reading the thread, Bitcoin was made for alternative currency and for people to be free financially, we all can observed that by just simply knowing it's a decentralized. But comparing it to Jesus is like too much, it's still a religion that people respect so no need to worship Bitcoin, if you are religious people you know that worshipping a money is considered as a sin. Bitcoin just exist that could help a lot of people \"financially\" but overall it doesn't apply to any problems we're facing, as a person, the society and a country. Cause if Bitcoin is like godsent it could already eliminate some poverty shts that a country experiencing for a long time.",

      "body": "Quote from: Lorence.xD on October 25, 2023, 01:31:18 AMCause if Bitcoin is like godsent it could already eliminate some poverty shts that a country experiencing for a long time. If we give for true the religious role of Jesus of Nazareth, then we could state He is godsent. But as we can observe, He didn't already solve any poverty, nor did He wipe out evil from humankind, nor did He provide infinite food and water to anyone, and other drastic solutions easy to come up with by a simple mind.For the same principle, we cannot state what is godsent and what is not. Bitcoin, however, promises to solve the greatest issue of human society, which is money. If one studies the principles of Bitcoin, and one is temerarious enough to imagine beyond common thinking, one quickly comes to important conclusions about humans.Everything that enters the realm of relativity, and therefore time, must come in respect of the laws that define the universal balance within this realm, regardless of its nature, and so adapt efficiently, in the best way possible to such conditions. If even God had decided to pursue this path with Jesus, complying with the equilibrium of time, do you think Bitcoin would come here and mess with this balance, or instead would it distribute its growth throughout time?The growth of things across time and space is the exploration of their forms in these observable dimensions. The closer these forms are to absolute compliance with the universal laws and designs, which men have used to call \"divine\", the closer to universal beauty. Universal beauty also means the absence of entropy. The growth of Bitcoin is very close to being a form of universal beauty, even though not perfect, but if zoomed out enough, one can see that entropy fades out soon, especially sooner than everything else. There is no other entity in the history of humankind with such pureness of growth.We do not know the complete form of things when they are under the conditions of time, this is what makes us human. Faith, however, comes from what makes us men, and having faith builds a bridge to our manly nature, which sees that absolute form. Faith is in fact not belief, but trust in that part of ourselves that sees absoluteness and knows regardless of conditions. The pursuit of knowledge, on the other hand, is what makes us beautifully human, and takes our human mind closer to an absolute mind, even though, as humans, we will never reach it.",
