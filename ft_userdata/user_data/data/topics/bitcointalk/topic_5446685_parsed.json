My name is I am JazzyJester, and I have been interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology for some time now. I have followed the growth and evolution of cryptocurrencies closely and am excited to be part of this community.I have been visiting BitcoinTalk for more than a year after a friend recommended it to me, and today I decided to register. Now I am here to learn and share my knowledge and experiences with all of you. I believe that cryptocurrency is more than just a financial investment; it represents a new way of thinking about money, technology, and society. I hope to engage in lively discussions and debates about the future of cryptocurrencies and their impact on our world.I look forward to getting to know you all better and contributing to the Bitcointalk community.Cheers,JazzyJester",

That's because it takes a little while before the activity of the user reflects and once it does the rank change from brand new to newbie. And if you check your image the activity of that user is still zero so that's why nothing has happened to its rank. p.s. please reduce the size of your image to perhaps 200 or 300.",

It's right. But after claiming that the OP has been here for a year, he can be called a power user, since a year of reading the forum should certainly affect his posts and behavior. Any mistake, even an accidental one, will look like a lie told today in the OP's first post.To be honest, I'm also surprised by this long exposure, and one can hope that we have a real beginner who will really care about information about Bitcoin and not merits and fast promotion in rank.Welcome OP.",
