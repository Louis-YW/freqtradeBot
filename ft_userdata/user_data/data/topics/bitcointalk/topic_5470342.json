If everyone realize this and start working towards achieving great goals through well organized strategy, they would have gone far beyond their current state. The problem with some person is that they are stereotype and are not ready to adjust to new idea. I have observed some business men/women and I have found they are not growing their business even when their shop look loaded. Can you imagine someone having one store for 10years? Though he maybe making profit but the business has failed to grow",

So in working hard, always try to apply wisdom to your hardwork by being smart, because it will ease your stress.

Even while I am aware that if you are smart, you can profit from the market if you take the time to study the charts—that is, if you are into bitcoin trading—keep in mind that no matter how intelligent you are, you will never be able to completely outwit the movement of the bitcoin market since it is unpredictable.",

      "body": "It is better to work smartly than to work yourself out. Most of the time, people who work smartly give the best results and also enjoy a long-lasting work relationship than those who work hard, \"under duress\" to impress the employer.On the other hand, do not allow yourself to be over used under any working environment. I am always careful and scared of working in a toxic environment where people are treated with little or no respect. I was gisting with a colleague at work earlier today about this topic. Despite that we work on the same place, some of us are treated with less respect than others. For instance, the same company paid for al my flights and other travel expenses but could not pay for the other persons. And the obvious reason was because the guys didn't work smartly and only decide to work hard. I work less and more comfortable with more pay than the other guys are paid less with less opportunity.",

I have observed some business men/women and I have found they are not growing their business even when their shop look loaded. Can you imagine someone having one store for 10years? Though he maybe making profit but the business has failed to grow There are people who engaged in business to earn a living, for survival and not having this basic knowledge to extend or grow. As long they're earning from it daily and utilizing the profits made to solved their problems and pay bills, they're okay. While the intellectual business individuals that are desperate for success, they dream beyond the normal level and grow their business from one level to another. Being smart and working hard appear similar but differ in meaning. An entrepreneur is smart enough to build a business to a high level, but he is not industrious enough to ensure his ultimate goals are accomplished. A trader, on the other hand, can be diligent enough to update his firm, but he lacks the smart capabilities to reach these top levels. The main point is absolutely possessing these two attributes, smart and hardwork, things will work out smoothly for you. Opening and growing a business store is not an easy undertaking; business owners are well aware of the difficulties encountered in the business world. We only focus on the positive aspects of business, completely neglecting the ups and downs.",

You forget say the smart work you dey talk like this depends on individual. Wetting you see as smart work wet dey pay you go be like a lazy work for somebody else. You ft dey work smart and somebody you see say him dey work hard, fit dey earn pass you and him don dey used to that parttern of life. Morover for the office matter, before you become a boss today you don pass through theory and practical before them go make you a superior over every other person's except you pay to aquire that position. Why Dem dey always ask about previous experiences before them dey employ you? No be results of hardworking? When we talk about hardwork, make we dey try to differentiate am like Physical hardwork: this one involve you to use your physical body parts to workMental hardwork: this one involce using your mental ability to do meaningful thing to make money. Over stressing of the brain can cause mental problem. If Mental hardwork is easy, every single person that was given opportunity to work online would have been rich. Na most of this thing dey make our brilliant student no dey succeed for some kind work because they always think say them sabi everything. Not knowing say theory without practical is as not leaning anything.Take for example who learn car online or with manual and who learn physical car wey don handle gear before, who go do more better? So the two works together. No matter how smart you are you no ft give woman belle without hardwork.😂",

Be like say na only me and you dey reason from the same angle. When we talk about hard work for naija, our mind dey always relate am to manual and physical force labors like block industry work or doing laborer job but that is a wrong perception of hard work. We no need drag this issue but you not fit smart without having hard work attitude. Despite the fact that hard work go mean different thing to different people, the general meaning of hard work na the efforts, energy and time wey you put for anything wey you dey do.So even if you smart and you no wan put effort, forget it because your smartness no go yield any fruitful result. As we dey this forum dey do task dey earn, wetin you go call am? Working smart or hard work? Make I answer myself, na both because anything online na smart way to make money but without hard work shi shi you no go see. You go need to put effort by working hard. Yes, e dey possible to be hard working make you no smart but e no dey possible to be smart make you no work hard.",

      "body": "Well said OP, the era of working hard has ended a long time ago. In this era and with the level and direction things are heading to, anybody working just hard will not make much dividends from his  hard work. Smart work is the act of working with information that boosts activity, helps you stay on the spotlight and driving very much patronage without working so hard. This might include the use of digital media to project your business so you'll reach out to diverse clients. Another is the use of competent machinery to boost production effectiveness and decrease fault rates. For example. I went to a computer engineer's office and was surprised to see that he now uses a microscope to view faults on the motherboard. Also he has now a machine that reads the motherboard and detects where the faults are located. He now  just use the  microscope to view that section, fix it at a much shorter time thereby attending to more jobs at the same time  frame others attend to not up to 1/3 of his job schedule. I was even more impressed to see that other engineers come to use his machines when he's off them at a significant charge. So he now makes money from two angles in the same business.In conclusion, working smart pays more than working hard cos you're well informed of the ways to maximize your potentials.",
