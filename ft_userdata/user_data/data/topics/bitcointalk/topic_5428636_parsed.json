Agreed. Right now, it updates risk every 2 hoursHaving it like a line chart where it shows risk score over a period could be a useful asset. Thanks for the suggestion",

      "body": "Nice creation! Questions:QuoteRisk of investmentWe calculate the risk of investments for each crypto asset based on its price fluctuation and volume traded for that day. Is there any more information about the formula being used with the volume and fluctuation data? Also, do you plan on elaborating on this metric with weekly, monthly, yearly risk indicators? More work on this indicator could be a great point of reference for people recommending cryptocurrency to others over x period of time. Right now with the daily metric, it is a bit useless in the sense that not many people are looking to know the risk on a 24 hour period. Usually people want to know the risk over a much longer time frame.Looking forward to following your development!",

      "body": "There seems to be some problems opening the site in Firefox. When I look at https://everycoinprice.com/btc, I don't see the current price under the coin name and logo. I don't have the same problem on Chrome where it loads just fine. Are you experiencing some issues with Mozilla Firefox?Two things that I noticed.1. On the right side you have that Track your Coins window. Ethereum and Bitcoin are in there by default. Why are the quantity numbers 0.2 ETH and 0.1 BTC set as default? The amounts can be changed clicking on the edit logos, but it would make more sense if the default values were 1, right?2. The historical price only goes back to August 2017 when you click on the \"All\" button under the Historical Prices table. We also see the info that bitcoin has registered gains of +251% in that time. This is a bit misleading because the returns are much higher than that. I understand that the table only shows data from August 2017, but maybe it's best to get rid of the All option if the table can't go back to bitcoin's beginnings and only shows data for the last 6 years.",
