Absolute totalitarianism, complete centralization, corruption and degradationThe forum has been active for more than a decade now and has tilted more to freedom of speech than any other platform I have been on during that time. One incident with mixers (which is the first time such a decision has been made) does not warrant all the talk about KYC and the rest.If it is possible at this point, I will vote for the forum to be completely decentralized and that th new forum software means we move away from compliance with government rules, but voting on a poll is not the starting point, first will be to know what steps need to be taken to get there.",

This double standard deserves a naked walk of shame IMO.Of course this is not completely a double standard, why? Because you just proved to everyone that you don't even believe in the idea that you are selling to people, you are also after freedom and privacy, so next time when you talk about how proud you are about not allowing drug and illegal trades happening on your garbage chain, we will have this topic to quote and have a laugh.",

Going offshore like PirateBay (offshore hosting).I strongly recommend that this be considered as it will keep the forum void of any influences from the gvernment and the restrictions that goes with it. If measures are not taken to liberate the forum from government interferences, we will get to the point where the government might want to halt operations that pertains to bitcointalk forum. Although, it will be a clear case of deprivation of freedom in so many areas but when tagged with a name that violates a particular law, it will have no option but to bow to \"the rule of law\".",

Because guess what? They already have all the data, besides why would they close down a forum where it's admin is compliant with the laws of US? It's not like they asked him to stop advertising mixers or else we shut you down. If they had asked that, I'm pretty sure, he'd say it. He just rushed into it since it was kind of like a raid what fiod did. Which I have already responded accordingly. They promised to be good boys from now on.ðŸ˜‰",

You are all can do whatever you want. Absolute freedom, almost decentralization, development and innovations, a successful platform for promising projectsI was also thinking something like this as theymos himself said he would happily give away the forum to a nonprofit organization for the sake of the forum if he had to, and he still can but why create all the fuss while he is the admin and he can restrict any thing on this forum. And current ban must be taken after a complete analysis. Well, what I was going to say, is nothing can remain decentralized even if you are on the darknet or darkweb.Because everything has loopholes and the feds can track you, no matter how much privacy measurement you took, the point is, that people can use this forum for illegal purposes if it becomes decentralized.

Fraud and theft is everywhere on the net, so we need somewhere to alert people to scams, and for the authorities to use the information to trace and punish the perpetrators. I thought the US gov had started a couple of mixers to attract scammers and money launderers - It seems to be an easy way to net the unwary. Just another thought, do any of the mega Bitcoin whales use this forum? I mean the guys that transfer thousands of Bitcoin at a time. It would be nice if we could get some opinions from them. I bet they read the forum, or at least get reports on significant posts.Like it or not, they are influencing the future of Bitcoin, and we need to learn how to cope in a changing world. Many projects of the grey initiative ( some people call it the green initiative ) are failing. EVs and medical injections are two examples. CBDCs are on the way, and we need to learn how Bitcoin will co-exist with them.Â  Maybe now is the time to have a CBDC board so that we can protect our interests, and possibly influence government policy. I believe that we need to preserve fiat, gold and Bitcoin, and introduce CBDCs as an alternative government controoled currency, and we need an efficient means of conversion between the four media. That's wishful thinking, as there is too much fiat debt for the banks to preserve it in its present form.",
