There are ways around it than clustering the network with their own 'economically incentivised' transactions for miners. Bitcoin has served and is still serving and still will even after now, if any vulneraility is spotted, it should be addresses asap and not exploited.Addressing a blockchian vulnerability should make you feel valuable to have contributed imensely to a great feat but they chose the other way round and I totally detest it.  Now they are the verge of lossing some value as Bitcoin developers are hoping to fix the vulnerability.",

Arguably the CVE is a little too broad. But there's certainly potential solutions. The point is to actually get the devs to do something. The only supporters of unlimited data in transactions that I see for now are the ones that keep exploiting this issue to upload images of cats on bitcoins Blockchain to make their \"NFTs\", the rest know that it was an unforseen consequence of recent updates. Getting it fixed makes sense for every normal Bitcoin user that needs to use block space to transact cash value.",

However, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where there has not yet been a way to arbitrarily describe blockchain storage space: What if there was an idea to \"rent out\" blockchain storage space for arbitrary, non-transactional data?In my opinion, Bitcoin does not need such a function. If it did, the usefulness of the Lightning Layer would be called into question. The Lightning Network was created to facilitate faster and more efficient Bitcoin transactions, which suggests that the main layer is not ideally equipped to handle a large volume of transactions. So if we suddenly have plenty of room for non-Bitcoin data on the blockchain, it would mean that we also have enough capacity to process all payments on the main layer, which does not seem to be the case currently or as the network's user base grows.This raises an interesting question about the future direction of Bitcoin and its blockchain. I would be surprised if the majority is in favor of making Bitcoin a decentralized storage location on the main layer.",

Certainly today's bandwidth capacity and hard disk prices would permit such. And I am saying that in all honesty. Bigger blocks could very well help with network congestion and still leave some space for stuff like ordinals. So if we want to allow JPEGs on the Bitcoin Blockchain, might as well make more space for them instead of just allowing them while space is so limited and they cause so many issues.",
