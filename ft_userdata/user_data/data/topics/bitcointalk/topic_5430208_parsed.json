Getting paid in your preferred currency (bitcoin) seems a great feeling to you so congrats. My question is are you paid in dollar equivalent of Btc or the payment is an greed Btc. My advice is since this is your only major source of income at the moment and you will need some to pay bills it will be better to set side the amount yoh wish to save every pay time and then convert the rest to either stable coins or Fiat for daily use. Although we will wish to have everything in Bitcoin but its volatility won't allow that now. Also when you have some spend able amounts in fiat it gives the freedom to hodl for long.",

Yes I am actually paid the Dollar equivalent of my salary in Bitcoin and I know about the volatility, I plan to split it into two ways then save some in Bitcoin the other half for miscellaneous stuff. I think time would tell and hopefully it works, I am mostly excited not only about the pay but that I have reached out to those in my work place about Bitcoin.",

But did you also educate your boss beforehand about how much risk of losing value this poses to your boss? because cryptocurrencies have high volatility so prices continue to fluctuate. for some people this will be very disturbing and make them panic. they really have to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using cryptocurrency before carrying out full adoption, as well as the ultimate goal of what cryptocurrency they can be used for.

Explain everything about the disadvantage and advantages of bitcoin to your boss, I am afraid that someday your boss will blame you once there is a misunderstanding in bitcoin. In your country bitcoin is allowed to use? Because the disadvantage could be your boss has difficulties with the documents regarding the taxation on which your boss run a business. However for now --congrats that your boss does what you have suggested. Now you can tell your boss how bitcoin transactions will flow.",

As a digital currency, Bitcoin can be a convenient and secure way to receive payment, especially for those who may not have access to traditional banking or financial services. However, it is important to remember that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can fluctuate significantly in value. This means that the value of your Bitcoin payment may go up or down over time. It is also important to be aware of the tax implications of receiving payment in Bitcoin. Depending on your location, you may be required to report cryptocurrency payments as income and pay taxes on them.",

If one decides to receive their salary in Bitcoin, they should be well and truly prepared to bear the risks involved, that's why a much better option would be to receive your salary in fiat and DCA a fraction of your earnings into Bitcoin every month.",

I know the story is not as simplistic as you have narrated it. You failed to mention if it was full payment he made. Does your boss and co-workers know about its volatility? Does your boss and co-workers know about \"Not your keys, Not your coins\". These are things you should explain to them. Also, remember to move your bitcoins from the centralized exchange which I know it currently is now to a cold wallet so you do not return to tell us a story of \"Had I known\".",
