  "content": "Hello,After so many years on this forum trying to understand sometimes complicated threads, but explained with so much kindness, I'm super happy to be able to propose a contest : I'm lucky to have a quality sponsor with the swiss company Shiftcrypto which offers two prizes : a bitbox02 (1st prize) and a Steelwallet (2nd prize). Since I'm shamelessly copying some of the rules of the pie contest (with the kind permission of RickDeckard), I'll add satoshis according to (almost) the same rules.There will be 3 spots for the winners. In addition to the great prizes reserved for the top two thanks to our sponsor, a prize pool of satoshis will reward the top 3. The way the prizes will be distributed is pretty simple - first place will win 50% of the available prize pool, second place will win 30% and third place will win 20%. If I am the only one contributing, the satoshis will go to 3rd place.Everyone is free to contribute to the pot, and if you choose to do so, I kindly ask you to post the amount here in the thread and I will update the table below. At the end of the contest, I'll do the math (with help because I suck at math) and indicate how much should be sent to whom and by which user.Once again, Jayce volunteered to help create the signatures and even refused to let me replace the 3rd prize with a contribution for his work... He had already done some great signatures for the pie contest, so of course I wanted to ask him... (or her ?)And the code for the beautiful signature made by Jayce :Code:[center][table][tr][td][/td][td][url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448396][color=#000][font=Arial black][size=8pt][i]GUESS [size=11pt][color=#f7931a]BITCOIN[/color] PRICE[/size]AND [size=13pt]WIN A BITBOX![/size][/size][/font][/td][td][/td][td][url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448396][size=2pt][color=transparent]░░[color=#191b1f][color=#333]▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#333]▄█[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#555]██[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#777]██[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#999]█[color=#000]█[/color][color=#929699]▄▄▄▄▄▄[/color]█[/color][glow=#000,1]█████████[/glow]░▄▄▀█▀██▀██░▄▄▀██▀██▀█▀[glow=#000,1]██████████[/glow][color=#aaa]█[color=#000]█[/color]▄▄▄▄▄▄█[/color][glow=#000,1]█████████[/glow]░▄▄▀█▀█▄░▄█░▄▄▀█░█░█▄▀▄[glow=#000,1]██████████[/glow][color=#bbb]█[color=#000]█[/color][color=#929699]██████[/color]█[/color][glow=#000,1]█████████[/glow]░▀▀▄█░██▄▀█░▀▀▄█▄▀▄█░█░[glow=#000,1]██████████[/glow][color=#aaa]█[color=#000]█[/color][color=#929699]██████[/color]█[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#999]█[color=#000]█[/color]▀▀▀▀▀▀█[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#777]██[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#555]█▀[/color][glow=#000,1]██████████████████████████████████████████[/glow][color=#333]▀[color=transparent]░░[/color]▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀[/color][/size][/td][td][size=22pt][color=#ccc]│[/size][/td][td][center][url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448396][font=Arial black][size=9pt][color=#5e94bf]MAKE YOUR GUESS BEFORE[/size][/font][font=impact][size=17pt][color=#5e94bf]►  [color=#000]7[sup][size=9pt]th[/size][/sup] May 2023[/color]  ◄[/size][/font][/td][td][size=22pt][color=#ccc]│[/size][/td][td][center][font=Verdana][size=7pt][b][i][color=#5e94bf][u]        [color=#000]Sponsored by        [/size][/font][table][tr][td][center][size=2pt]▄▄█░█▄▄███░██████░███▄▄███░███▄▄█████▀░▀██████▀▀░░░▄░░░▀▀█▄▄█████▄▄▀▀█▀▀[/td][td][url=https://shiftcrypto.ch/][font=Arial][size=16pt][b][color=#000]ShiftCrypto[color=#5e94bf].ch[/size][/font][/td][/tr][/table][/td][td][url=https://shiftcrypto.ch/][color=#f00][size=2pt]████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████[color=#fff]██████[/color]████████████████████[color=#fff]██████[/color]████████████████[color=#fff]██████████████[/color]████████████[color=#fff]██████████████[/color]████████████[color=#fff]██████████████[/color]████████████████[color=#fff]██████[/color]████████████████████[color=#fff]██████[/color]████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████[/td][td][url=https://shiftcrypto.ch/][size=2pt][color=#f7931a]██████▄▄██████████▄▄██▀▀█▀▀██████▄[color=#fff]░[/color]▀[color=#fff]░░[/color]▀[color=#fff]░░[/color]███████▄[color=#fff]░░░[/color]▄▄[color=#fff]░░░[/color]▀██████▄[color=#fff]░░[/color]▄██▀[color=#fff]░░░[/color]███████[color=#fff]░░░░░░░[/color]▄████████[color=#fff]░[/color]▄██▄[color=#fff]░░░[/color]████████[color=#fff]░░[/color]▀▀▀[color=#fff]░░░[/color]███████▀▄[color=#fff]░░[/color]▄▄▄████████▀█▄▄██████████▀██████████▀▀██████▀▀[/size][/td][td][/td][/tr][/table][/center]Our Sponsor and the prizes in details:1st prize: a bitbox of your choice (2 models available).

Feel free to share the contest in the locals.Rules:Shiftcrypto gave me carte blanche to come up with the rules for the contest, which are as follows: The goal of the game is to give the bitcoin rate in Swiss francs on Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22.The bitcoin rate on that day will be the one from Coinmarketcap: since there is a low and a high rate, the participant who gets closest to the high rate will be the winner and the highest decimal place will win. In the event of a tie, the first participant to post its estimate will win.You have until May 6 (Paris time) to vote, until then you can edit your posts, after that it will not be possible anymore.╔══════════╦══════════╦══════════╦══════════╗║Becassine║very généreux donateur PowerGlove║généreux donateur║généreux donateur║╠══════════╬══════════╬══════════╬══════════╣║0,0003║0.002║xxx║xxx║╚══════════╩══════════╩══════════╩══════════╝As I don't know how to code, I used the table from Stalker22.

I think the winners will receive a password from me (I haven't thought of it yet, a sentence in French?) and the contact information of Shiftcrypto. They will then give their delivery address directly to Shiftcrypto. (Or we will find another solution.)CurrencyThe price of bitcoin on Bitcoin Pizza day will be given in Swiss Francs. If all the Fiat currencies disappear by then, well, we'll see. Maybe we'll draw straws.Multi AccountsBe nice and fair play, play with only one account. ErrorsI count on the participants to help me to choose the winners because nobody is safe from making a mistake.

I noticed that it is a very nice organized topic and I understood from first sight that you made some effort for writing it. I, myself, spend also a lot of time when I am writing my topics (and my posts as well), paying a lot of attention to proofreading, punctuation, reading and re-reading (at least) 2 times prior submitting the post -- so yes, I really understand your efforts! And I congratulate you for the way you wrote the topic.Quote from: Becassine on April 11, 2023, 10:00:09 PMPS : You can change your estimate until May 7, maybe bitcoin will explode the forecast?Thank you, I noticed that rule! We all hope that we'll assist to a booming price of BTC, especially considering that we are getting closer and closer to another halving (and signs are already here). And, of course, I will take advantage of the rule on May 7th.I actually have a question here: what does the rule precisely mean?Quote from: Becassine on April 11, 2023, 01:47:36 PMYou have until May 7 (Paris time) to vote, until then you can edit your posts, after that it will not be possible anymore.Does it mean that voting and editing prediction is allowed until May 7th, Paris time, 23:59:59? Or does it actually mean \"until May 7\", as in the sense of before May 7, which would imply, in fact, May 6th, Paris time, 23:59:59?And one more question, this time about shipping of prizes: what method will you use? Will it be free worldwide? Will the winners have to pay for it? Will you use another forum member to do the shipping (for example, in Collectibles board, many contest organizers prefer to give their prizes to MJ for shipping them -- at least, those outside US). Maybe this information would be also considered useful by participants.P.S.: I may (or may not) come back with a nice surprise.P.S.2:I advertised your contest in Romanian local board.Your fierce gastronomic competitor,Gazeta.(P.S.3: obviously, if we'd ever have a battle, in real life, inside a kitchen (any kitchen), on anything, I would certainly lose in front of you  )",
