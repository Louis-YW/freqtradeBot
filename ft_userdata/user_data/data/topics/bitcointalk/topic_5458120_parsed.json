You can not win the house.",

Gambling is based on numbers and pure luck, and we all know that not all people have the lady luck on his side.And if you are winning, then perhaps it's better to stop and not chase big money, just saying. Because as I have said, the numbers can flip anytime and the next time you know it, you are already losing and can't control your self anymore.",

      "body": "The simplest answer is NO!It's impossible to master the pattern of a game let's take crash and plinko for example, those games occurs randomly so if someone should approach you, telling you that he or she has a course or trick on how you can master and get a 100% win rate just know that they are simply lying to you.After all there's a reason as to why it is called Gambling, if there was a means to wager and never lose then everyone would have adopted gambling as their means of earning since they would be risking anything (as compared to how gambling is supposed to work), I for one will spend 24/7 on my gambling account constantly bagging out money from it.Op, now that thoughts like this have started to pop into your head you better tbe careful and also reduce your gambling activities, when you start thinking of dubious means to increase your winnings it's a sign that you have been on a losing streaks and need sometime to sit back and relax.",

The highest rating that a gambler can attain is 20-30% success rate, either you know the game pattern, the winning or losing stats and all stats, you cannot have more than 20-30% success rate.This begs the question, how do gamblers win? Gamblers win because they bet with a high value, and they play minimum games, such that if they have one win out of 10 different tickets in a month; they recover losses + immense profits. Aspire to be an incredible and successful gambler; but 98-100% win rate is a myth",

You might be making good profit from the pattern which you adopted but there will always be lost sometimes, so there is nothing like 100% accuracy in gambling. That’s why I just see most people always providing fix matches as scammers, their is nothing like fix matches, if you are looking for fix matches, then you are just trying to waste your money, because you are going to pay people providing the signal, and you are still going to waste the money with you use to place your bet, and the person providing the signal has nothing to lose. When gambling your might be making good money, but your prediction can’t be 100%.",

But it all depends on what sports you are betting on or how many matches your are selecting and with their odd possibability. Total odd of 4.6 or 2.5 are still a better chance of winning but would likely need a higher amount to gamble so it's advisable you don't gamble with what you can't afford to lose, otherwise you can only play with the money you can lose.",

Yogee and Yahoo already gave you the best idea and that's to minimize your bets because having more bets means more chances of getting that first loss. On the other hand, there's no reason to chase the highest win rate aside from bragging rights since you'll barely make a profit from betting on the highest win probability.",

Secondly,  casinos won't remain in business if such technics exist,  but then, casinos are smart enough not to allow themselves to get used in such a manner. QuoteKnowing the game's pattern, what to bet on and what not to gamble on, the winning and losing numbers, and so on, would I still be able to achieve a 100% win rate?No matter how you try to build a pattern,  you can not develop a pattern that can give such consistency,  so you have to deliberately build pull-back mechanisms that will help you to pull whenever you are going too much trying to chase ur dream-winning.",

While it's certainly fun to imagine having all the right answers and predicting every outcome, the reality is a bit different. Think about it logically, if such a technique existed, how would the casino make money? They would soon go bankrupt.You see, casinos and gambling games are designed with something called a \"house edge.\" It's basically a built-in advantage for the house, ensuring they make money over time. True, people do win big sometimes! But it's a matter of luck, not strategy. There must always be some number of gamblers who will win, otherwise no one would ever gamble.",

However, although many will think that it is just about luck, but quality information, self-discipline and a little more money are something that turns the odds on your side. Gambling should primarily be understood as a form of entertainment, and it is completely pointless to think that there is some big money to be made there. However, I will say that there is an exception, because there are professional poker players who make really good money, but the cards are still something different from slot machines or roulette.",

Given that gambling involves a 50/50 probability, it should be obvious that this will be impossible to accomplish. Whatever method you use, a wager that cuts will still cut. However, it is best to adopt a strategy and make sure you take all relevant elements into account so you don't wind up regretting and gambling carelessly.

Everyone would have mastered all the methods and game patterns necessary to reach a 100% win rate if it were 100% guaranteed. However, if it were the case, gambling would have been so boring.",

There is no way you will consistently win more than 50% against casinos with a house edge. Their systems are designed to give them an advantage, ensuring they win in the long run. If you've heard of a system or betting method that claims to provide a 100% win rate, it is undoubtedly a scam. It's best to stay away and instead focus on studying the risks and returns of gambling to have a more realistic perspective.",

That's almost perfect number and even if you'll play with small multiplier to guarantee that percentage, there's still the slight chance that you'll lose.And if that number is existing for percentage of winning then majority of us have already became rich and if someone knows an actual strategy that can make up to that winning rate, it will remain as a secret.
