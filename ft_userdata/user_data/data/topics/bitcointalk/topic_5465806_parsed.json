But I'm curious and there's no harm in asking hereFirst, I would like to thank the electrum development team for creating an amazing wallet and I can use electrum for free. But this is where my curiosity arose, when all electrum services are free, then where does electrum's financial source come from??",

As you know, Electrum is an open-source software wallet. Since it's open source, developers worldwide can help develop features and fix the bug. My best guess is either they run it with their own expenses or some servers run from donations from users and the community to cover development costs and server expenses. I did not think about it before. After seeing your topic, I went to their website and found no donation address there. But, I found an option in Electrum to donate them. But unfortunately, it says, \"No donation address for this server.\"",

They are good people who have contributed a lot to bitcoin. I hope that one day I can contribute and support them by donating. For now maybe I can only say thank you for their hard work in developing electrum. They really are Big Man",

However, this shouldn't discourage people from donating funds to the servers if they want to. Running a server is expensive and they aren't being compensated. Not everyone has the capability of running an Electrum server or a full node.",

(maybe it has to do with your typical Bitcoiner's debt aversion syndrome).I was very impressed by what he had to say. He was truly an extraordinary person with great dedication and ideas. I think he is a person who can enjoy his great contribution with electrum and he can have fun with it, most people would look to benefit from their contributions and ideas, but it doesn't seem to be the case for @ThomasVHopefully electrum can be a good portfolio for ThomasV, and he will get other benefits for his dedication to electrum",
