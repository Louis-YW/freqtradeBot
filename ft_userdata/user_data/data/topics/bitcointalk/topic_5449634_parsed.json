I know i am new here and have only physical things for collateral what will be difficult online.What i offer to the person who can help out for the 20 days:- Full KYC and can do a video chat to see my passport and other documents you prefer to see.- Proof of income and work (working over 2 years for the same company)- Proof of addressI will repay the loan on May 10 + 20% interest.I only discuss here on forum, no invites to Telegram or other platforms.Also to clear things out, i am not a gambler and i have never scammed a single person in my whole life!No crypto collateral = No loan for newbies (especially if it's their first post).Physical goods might be stolen. Â Photographs of Documents can be forged.Quoteand i have never scammed a single person in my whole life!Now how many times have I heard that before I wonder?",
