Initially, they were great and were getting a lot of new users from India before making KYC mandatory but afterward, they were like any other CE. They did not survive because of impersonating a centralized exchange on regulation. If they had not implemented KYC regulations they would have become the biggest exchange in India.",

P2P isn't bad for all the exchanges to be honest. Obviously collecting data is a usual thing done by almost every exchange but even WazirX was having a very good P2P system. Person could easily transfer money from UPI and you can transfer INR. Similar system was there for other exchanges as well. Most of them as far as I know don't even charge any fees for this service or generally it's just 0.1% like any trade fees.",
