Do you think we could see a bitcoin strategic reserve anywhere else before seeing in one of the U.S states?If a scale of economy system as El Salvador could adopt the strategic reserve on Bitcoin as the first country adoption, I think any other countries could as well follow the lines overtaking the US.I think it is the global influence of the US especially now that Donald Trump has assumed office is the major reason of having the US in anticipation of economy reserve.Why the US proposal has long been so speculated this much is because there are lot of countries incorporating with them and the US has much had economy leadership among them.Noting that we talk about a decentralization economy market at mentioned of Bitcoin, it is self decisions towards who want to invest on Bitcoin and holds it value on Bitcoin reserve.The US can actually be left behind in this adoption rate but though we know they are being economically strategic in their decision before make this happen and when they do, it is sure to attribute a high velocity on influencing the market.",

It's also possible that these leaders want to steal a start from America, however, decision making can't be done instantly, I think we'll see the adoption of a strategic reserve for Bitcoin (BTC) first in American states, after that there will be an explosion of news about Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserves in other countries.",

You are referring about this news? Italy's Intesa 'tests' bitcoin with 1 mln euro investmentWell, that’s a bit different from the news in the OP since it’s referring to a central bank, the agency that regulates all banks and financial institutions. But the news you’re talking about is just about the biggest bank in Italy testing the waters with a $1 million Bitcoin purchase. Not exactly a game-changer compared to the billions of dollars that the Czech central bank might buy in the future.",

On the one hand, I understand that no one wants to be the first, but then again, if the US announces that it is buying BTC for its strategic reserves, everyone else who decides to do the same after them will pay for their BTC at a much higher price.As for the member countries of the European Union, I have already written on several occasions that there are those members who are also part of the Eurozone (they use the common currency Euro) and are under the authority of the ECB (European Central Bank) and should probably receive approval from the ECB for such an investment - while on the other hand, the Czech Republic is not in the Eurozone, which means that it has some degree of monetary sovereignty in matters like this.",

The Czech National Bank (CNB) Czech Republic Governor Aleš Michl is proposing 5% of the country's reserve which is about $7.3 billion ( the country's foreign reserve as at December 2023 is $146 billion as of ) for Bitcoin purchases which is a substantial amount.
