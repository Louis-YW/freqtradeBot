No. I'm not a supporter of ordinalsReread my reply maybe my wordings was confusing that's why I said ordinals is people chasing short term benefit while neglecting things in the long run. Ordinals like I said before are stored in different satoshi in a taproot transactions.You can read more about Taproot transactions and Segwit(which provides additional 3mb making the total 4mb) to understand better. The Taproot upgrade allows as much data that a block can carry to be stored,This makes it possible to accommodate more than an MB.   QuoteJust because there are more transactions, it doesn't make it less efficient.  It's just more expensive currently, because other people are willing to pay more than you do.  Which goes against efficiency to me. Paying more to get the maximum result.  You said currently?  Do you think it would get better or worse after halving?
