  "content": "Hello As you know USA gives a lot and a lot of money to a small terrorist and racist group that currently occupies Palestine and call themselves \"Israël\".They think they are \"the chosen people\" and they should lead the world.This is not a small amount, we talk about billions of dollars, that could be use for social help, to reduce debt or to reduce taxes.The terrorist group uses this money to buy weapons and to kill people and also to finance \"islamic\" terrorist groups to attack other countries Libya, Syria, Irak, etc.My question is, for American people, are you sure your interest is to finance \"Israël\" or is it possible that lobbies (for example AIPAC) corrupt your politicians and could push some policies against the interest of American citizens ?",

Nevertheless, war is an ill wind that brings nothing but suffering and death, we need peace in Israel and Gaza.I am not sure one is supposed to compare the case of Ukraine and what is happening between Israel and Palestine so easily. The Palestine-Israel conflict has been a problem which have been going on for generations on the middle east and there are both political and religious implications involved. On the other hand, the invasion of Ukraine does not have anything to do with religion or factions driven by spiritual pursue, both only because of political ambition of a big country and former superpower. Also, not even mentioning Ukraine-Russia tensions are rather a modern thing, when compared to what is going on in the middle east. The common factor in those conflict is the involvement of the United States and other countries which other apparent unconditional support to one side.",

If Israel were to collapse or be destroyed, then next target would certain be the United States of America. Bullshit.  My lilly-white ass is 'Amelek' just like the Palestinians (Philistines) in the eyes of these freaks.  When they finish up their final solution on the Palasinians my ass is next.  Actually it's on-going right now.  Looks who is driving the deprecation of the 2nd amendment of ordinary Americans with one hand and shoveling military aged 'migrants' in with the other hand.  'Islam is the broom of Israel.' as they say.The 'whites' are particularly problematic, and you can see it clearly described in the Protocols.  We are in not significantly inferior to 'them' in some important ways and thus pose a danger to their plans.  Schemes originating in the academic 'Frankfurt School' have a similar concern but are more directly aimed at the destruction of the United States.I left the United States not because it isn't the most likely to resist successfully, but rather because a lionshare of the focus of collapsing the world will be focused there.  It's one of the 'central pillars' so to speak.  If the people of the U.S. can pull their heads out of their asses before it's to late I can always go back.  Else, and probably more likely, I'll observe the smoking crater from afar.I should point out that I'm not at all looking forward to the fall of Israel because it would scatter the 'smuts' among 'the nations' even more than is still the case now.  I favor a 67-borders state for containment because I am not the kind of person who is in favor of an actual genocide.  Many Israeli's, and especially the genocide enthusiasts, sort of deserve eachother.",

People who research this a lot, some of them Jewish background, just laugh and say 'Zionism IS Talmud-ism'.  Seems to fit pretty well in most cases.  The idea is that what many of what these people are stirs in elements of pre-Abrahamic religions and also luciferianism/satanism.  That also fits many observations and historical writings fairly well as I see things.  'People of the sacred snake' and such-like are things that some of them actually call themselves on occasion, but they are quick to point out that 'it is complex' and goyim are to simple to understand.Some say that whoever authored the Protocols of Zion (or 'forged' them) were not actually Jews particularly in a spiritual sense and in fact had just about as much disdain for the run-of-the-mill 'Jew' as they did for the goyim.  Jews are just another useful tool to them.  Some claim that the 6 pointed star had no connection to Judiasim until fairly recently but was a feature of the 'Rothschild' family crest (or sign art), and this family was instrumental in funding the state of Israel into existence.  Where that family got the star is anyone's guess.  My guess is that it was associated with various perceived demonic forces which they fancied.",

Israel’s security concerns shouldn’t be a pretext for stealing land and displacing people from their homes. Zionists aren’t blowing kids heads off and dropping white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas because it’s going to make them safer.
