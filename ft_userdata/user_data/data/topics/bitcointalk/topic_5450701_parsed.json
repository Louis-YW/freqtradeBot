Perhaps that might work.I wouldn't say your money is guaranteed since the numbers on your account are just numbers not to mention, the website has a poor reputation.",

I also wondwred, as you don't have an access to your account, how did this photo taken? Did you still got an access at that point?Another idea I proposed, since your friend's account is not blocked, and given that their live support won't reply you, is it possible for your friend to ask the transfer to be canceled from his side? As the tip happened internally within the platform's system, I think it's quite possible that the amount displayed as your \"fund\" is just a number on screen. There's no real transaction on the blockchain happened until after someone do a withdrawal request. Thus, it's quite easy for them to \"reverse\" the transfer as they only need to adjust those recorded exchanges between account.",

They have nothing to lose here on the forum as they're already been tagged since 2022 and couldn't care less about it, their last activity on this forum was also last year, which means there's a very slim chance they're aware of this thread. Their ratings on other platforms are also low and they couldn't bother about it. Bottom line, your hands are rather tied on this situation, I think best you can hope is for your friend to jump in and ask for reversal from his side, since his account is still working.",
