They have flexible or 30 days period staking that suitable to what you are looking for. Just don’t expect a high APR because you are using a less volatile coin unlike altcoins.",

Its not a top altcoin however but if you have a huge capital I think it will be worth recieving while you make money just by staking. Its far from SEC's scrutiny afaik.ADA is a top altcoin. It sends out weekly. And just like Waves or EOS you don't need to deposit your coins out your wallet. EOS afaik is daily.",

However, I believe the most important staking coin is now ETH after the recent merge. There will be multiple staking pools available in a few days to start pool staking in ETH. I believe it's a great move and will help mass adoption of mining through staking. If you want to stake bitcoin, I believe some defi protocols will allow you to do that. But please understand the risk there as it entirely depends on their business profitability. Otherwise they can simply go down just like what happened to Celcius.",

As far as i know that exchange site like binance was giving you a choice to take flexible staking. I think that's good place to earn staking from your bitcoin and stable token. that's also even safer compared with defi. There's guarantee with binance exchange site and you must not feel worry about that. think about before use defi. Defi was not so safe as centralized exchange site.",

Even if it was just small amounts it's probably way more profitable for you in the future even more so if you are in this for a long term. With small APY you need a huge pile of crypto to make that staking meaningful income, while if you own small stack you can buy like 5% more to your stack with small amount of money instantly.",

Why not? It's better to put your coins at work than to just put them in some wallet... Small APY safer staking, higher APY more risky staking, I always advise to diversify, majority in small and with some amount try higher APY, without risk here and there there's no gain.",

You don't get it with APY because even you want a monthly percentage, they'll still have it calculate the way it is being offered for its APY.",

For Bitcoin, you can stake on the centralized exchange, since the projects I mentioned are tier 1 projects, they provide this service decentralized in their own wallets.",

On the others hand you can also use Bitcoin , BNB , LTC ,ADA , Matic (except the new altcoins)for Binance Savings those are also fixable . On the others hand there is also others option defi-staking/locked is available in Binance. But In my opinion it is better to choose Binance savings for a secure fund holding in this current bearish situation.",

You can monthly stake by locking in your local wallets as well, or you can also try lending for long term basis, more like loaning out. Best of luck 🤞",
