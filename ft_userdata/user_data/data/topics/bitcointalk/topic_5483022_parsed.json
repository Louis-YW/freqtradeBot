Secondly, assuming it is an empty block as you have called it, do miners get a reward from an empty block?Because that one transaction you see is known as the Coinbase transaction, which consists of newly generated Bitcoins to be paid to the mining pool (miners). So yes, miners will get the block reward (6.25 BTC) exclusive of all other transaction feesFor example, This is the Coinbase transaction - https://mempool.space/tx/4ef407af7ded0c34482c41b728a54ebd39e304b525a952355dde67de142e3a50",

Secondly, assuming it is an empty block as you have called it, do miners get a reward from an empty block?Yes it is sometimes called empty because ideally you’re not including any transactions into that block. The transaction you saw there is called a Coinbase transaction which is actually different from other transactions because it doesn’t have an input and it is use to collect the block subsidy for that particular block mined. Yes the block subsidy or reward is giving to any mined block, the idea is not that transaction must be included before block reward is paid to the miner. As long as the block is mined correctly like you saw there now the miner will receive the block reward in that coin base transaction there. Look at that blocks there you will see subsidy + fees=6.25 bitcoin. That  is the block reward which is currently that 6.25 bitcoin and since there wasn’t any included transaction there wasn’t any other fee collected. This block is an empty block with only the block reward https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000002166eed686f576b3dbac17dead73feaec36d0697c6699This is a mined block with transactions included in it. You can see the subsidy and the fees collected from those transactions https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000029f4f67d2e757022e9c051aec6138efc55d3a570b5805",

Sometimes 1 confirmation takes too much time That’s one of the most interesting myth of bitcoin, it’s block time interval although averagely set at a default of 10 minutes. The time varies because of the ability of a miner to get the correct block hash that Should he below the target value. It is this target value that is adjusted every 2016 blocks just to keep the 10 minutes average in check. Before the block time interval sometimes was higher due to maybe lack of hash power or lack of many miners. This days we have quite a number of mining pools with high hashing power so the issue of 2 hours block time interval isn’t that much common again. But still we can’t get a definite time interval because of the target that needs to be meet which depends on the miners finding it.",

Zaguru12 explanation is also correct and the similarity of my answer to his answer is that the block doesn't have any transactions included from the mempool.Actually the empty block must still contains some data from the previous block. Each block has its block header it is this block header that has the information of the block like its Merkle tree, Nonce and the block hash of the previous block. And afterwards a candidate block where transactions from memory pool are temporarily stored, but for this empty blocks it is just the Coinbase transaction that is in the candidate block.

What happens in a situation where no mining pools were able to get a block in that time?Yes the default time to get a block mined is 10 minutes but that doesn’t mean that this 10 minutes is the only time a block is mined, a block can be mined in just few seconds or a block mining interval can be no more than that 10 minutes there is no certainty as to when. That’s why we usually have a difficult adjustment every 2 weeks (2016 blocks to precise). The adjustment is calculate from the average time it has taken the 2016 blocks to mined, if the average is more than the default 10 minutes then the difficulty for the next 2016 blocks are reduced and if the average is less than 10 minutes then the difficulty is increased all this is done to keep the default 10 minutes in check. But just as explained it is not a must that a block must be mined within than 10 minutes, it can be more and even hours to get a new block.",

Thanks for sharing all the resources and everyone who replied to this thread. As it was the first time, I encountered a block like these two I got confused and without looking for any information in the meme pool and the forum, I went ahead and asked the question once again from the forum. It is interesting to read all the replies and understand why an empty block appears. Bitcoin POW protocola is a unique and at the same time a complicated algorithm as sometime the block gets mined in just 9 minutes and a few times it can take up to 20 minutes. I sometimes tend to observe the pool and that is why, I came up with these two blocks which for me was weird as they did not have any fees associated with them.I am not going to lock this thread as someone like me might not be aware of it. I will keep this thread open and if anyone else has more information then do share it.",
