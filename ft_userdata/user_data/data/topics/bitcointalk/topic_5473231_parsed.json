That might help explain things. And finally, I'd recommend reading the OP's last reply again.

Does that minimum withdrawal is available when you start being an affiliate or they just update it later on?You can find this definition under Article 10, point 5 of the Affiliate T&C. I can't post a screenshot, but here's a quote:Quote from: https://storage.googleapis.com/wolfbet-static/documents/Affiliate_TC.pdf10.

I gave the pdf a read [it's not that long] before I first replied to this thread, and can confirm that the ToS should be the one applies when this thread is made and the most updated one, it's the one where we got redirected upon clicking the link next to the box we should tick to prove our agreement.Nonetheless, OP is in touch with their admin, let's wait and hope it solves his problem.",

Years later these coins would have risen in value, but wolf.bet had completely deleted my account. I tried resetting the password just in case, but the username also didn't exist... At the time I had created the account there was no clause in the TOS that they would be ale to delete accounts, and yet they did. Retroactive changes to the TOS like this shouldn't be accepted by the community. At the very least they should grant affected cases like OP an exception as the rules weren't there before them. I'm just mentioning it to showcase that this platform has a history of weird changes to its TOS. To me it's not a good look to try and limit those promoting your service so much out of earning a few extra pennies, especially if it's done with suspicious changes to the TOS. I'd understand bringing changes to the TOS and reviewing a large withdrawal for holes in the system with large bets perhaps, but for a $18.55 as in OP's case? Doesn't make sense honestly.",
