When you've collected enough ETH, stop mining and claim your rewards.For a more detailed technical description, check out this page.  https://github.com/pk910/PoWFaucet/wiki",

I'm asking about some real faucet mining That's what they mean when they tell you you can \"mine\" Goerli or Sepolia ETH, use your CPU to mine some testnet ETH the old fashioned way... Here is the one for Sepolia, which will be the definitive testnet ETH after Goerli is sunset at the end of 2023:https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/",

I think it’s crazy how some are charging for these tokens which should of always been free.I don’t remember the price but I think it’s going for like $1-2 per fake ETH. It’s crazy paying for this but sometimes you really didn’t have a choice when you wanted to do some testing on the testnet.",
