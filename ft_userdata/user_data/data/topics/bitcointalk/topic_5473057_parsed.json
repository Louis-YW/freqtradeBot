Wow, what a nice business idea. I love the fact that you posted it here for others to be aware of it and not only Nigerians. This business idea is something that we should take advantage of. I have already opened the link and I watched the video of how the man produced the granut oil. Like in the video, the woman makes a comment and she says that after removing the granut oil from the grounded groundnut, the other parts are still for good use, which means that double profits are involved in this groundnut oil factory.With your comments, I can conclude that you are even planning to get started on your own. However, it will help you get more money that you can use to invest in Bitcoin.",

The business sound lucrative and bullish as there are not many people that are into the groundnut oil business at the moment, and I will like any investor that will want to buy into the idea of investing in the groundnut oil business to not just do so because of the bullish market status quo  as it's obvious the bullish price won't last for long when more investors start moving into the line of business making supply higher than demand, would you still continue or exit the business. Set your goals right ahead before trying to take the advantage from the start. My fvckin opinion though!",

The average peanut is used for snacks and seasonings only.In other words, if I start this business, I need a sustainable marketing because there is almost no enthusiasts at all.But maybe if you think about it, regarding the superiority of kerosene and also the percentage of oil content in peanuts is more good than, palm or coconut every kilo, I am interested in doing so, but I still doubt the results, this is quite risky because it is not there the market. The price of peanuts is also quite expensive so this is quite confusing if there is no knowledge in managing its manufacturing materials in order to benefit.",

But what makes the business more lucrative and profitable is what I can not really put my fingers on. It is not that their are additional delicacies that has been added to Nigerian meals to say that the demand is higher than what it was before except that probably the population of Nigeria has increased and that could be proportional to it use.Having said that, I think the other reason I can adduce to it profitability is probably the high inflation level in the country that has also caused multiple increase in price of goods. So the profit margin for business people is really high because there is no price control mechanism making any business person to sell with whatever price they so desire. The price of graundnut oil and palm oil have really skyrocketted.",

What I concluded from that, is the big demand for oil is due to the lack of raw materials. What will happen next year when production increases and the quantity of raw materials is ten times greater?Assessment of profitability in agriculture is not done only based on one year. I believe that it can be a profitable business if you look at it in the long term, especially if you grow your peanutsQuote from: Su-asa on November 06, 2023, 11:30:16 AMYou can also watch a little on how to  manufacture the graundnut oil, I can even invest more if I have this business and start making more money, so what are your takes in this idea? Looking at this, I would suggest that if you are already thinking about production, try to raise it to a higher level. More modern production with much higher hygiene standards.",

It will not be as easy as it sounds because of even after you start manufacturing, you will need to have some kind of registration or approval from the government to start marketing your products else the business you hope to start will close up faster than you expect. You will also need to invest in packaging because it is necessary to have better sales unless you only want to remain local. You will also need to invest in marketing of your produce.

It is not as easy as we say it, because for anyone that start up a business that he has plans for, he must know the in and out of that business so that he doesn't end up on a great loss at the long run.Getting the capital to get started and how to know the exact market strategy is what should be put into consideration, I know that whoever starts this business will make good profit because Nigerians uses more of peanut oil than other source of oil no matter how expensive it is. It is only palm oil that is highly used by everyone. The business is a lucrative one since you can also use the by-prodouct for other purpose. You don't consider only having the capital bit you should also have some reserve funds for other unforeseen challenges in the business.",

Kudos on sharing this information globally since this new to me because palm oil is the most popular oil production here in my country. There’s no demand for this kind of oil since this is new and I’m not aware that peanut can be use as an alternative oil.I believe it will be helpful if you can provide details in the post about the advantage of this oil compared to other oil industry especially on country that already have mass production of different oil such as palm oil.",

Groundnut oil production is capital-intensive and requires some basic skills. This means it is important to check if you have the finances to establish and run the business. From your article the business is lucrative but they also failed to inform us of how they came up with such a conclusion. The research also didn't tell us a case study of study so that we can compare it with the situation in our country. Anyway, anyone who intends to engage in this business should do a lot of research because there are so many hurdles to surmount. Groundnut seeds are scarce and very expensive in my location. So I have to consider if my selling price will be competitive based on the price in the international market. There is also a need to check the agricultural policies of the your country because since groundnut is scarce the government can place export restrictions on the product.

Why would it be the other way around if more people are able to see and understand what this little business idea of his entails? That doesn't make sense does it? Edible oil's the market to go if you want something that doesn't saturate as well. Just go and take a look at your local grocery and see how many types of cooking oil there are, pretty sure there's no reason for him to fear not getting the proper audience for this since, granted there's health benefits, people will be more than happy to try out new types of oil. Olive and Virgin Coconut's been in the market quite recently and it boomed cause people are health-conscious, I'm pretty confident in the health perks of this groundnut oil he's talking about so with that we can safely assume this business's bound to boom.",

So it can get tricky finding enough raw peanuts in places where they aren't grown much.  Not to mention more expensive.  But where peanuts are all over the place already the business could make good money. So while making groundnut oil could maybe work out, you really gotta check if the climate and weather conditions, and thus the availability of peanuts raw material, where you live make sense before jumping in.",

OP misspelled the term groundnut by writing it graundnut and he did it 2 or more times but I was ok with that, I thought it might be a writing problem or OP might be reading it graundnut instead of groundnut, but when I read your writing groundnut I got confused and started to search if there is any term graundnut or is there any oil named as graundnut but I don't found any. So both of you please clear up that confusion that we are talking about GROUNDNUT which is also known as peanut oil. Besides all that, I think it would be a good investment as according to the news you provided the sales are getting lower due to the demand problem but rather than selling it to the international market, we can get good demand at the local market. I don't know the demand for it in my place I don't even use it we have two types of oil here and almost everyone uses them. This oil has a lot of benefits for us, I like the idea but still DYOR before making any investments.",
