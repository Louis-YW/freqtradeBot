This is a place to educate ourselves about gambling, rather than seeing gambling ad on YouTube, social media and other places where the risks are not talked about. Visit the gambling board to know what I am talking about. Like me, the most common sentence I used most on gambling boards is to not use the amount of money you can not afford to lose to gamble and to gamble responsibly.",

      "body": "To answer this QuoteWhy Mostly Betting Platforms promote their Website through Signature Campaign? Because they want targeted leads if you're a casino operator you want your banners that contain information about your casino to be seen by gamblers, who post here, who read discussions here even though they don't have an account here, who by searching the internet find the answers to their questions about gambling here in Bitcointalk this is probably the best way to market casino, talking about casinos and strategy while they are seeing the casino banner  To answer this QuoteCause gambling is not for everyone. it's for everyone who wants to enjoy and have fun but if you want to make money out of it, then it's not for you and I guess everyone who thinks that wayTo answer thisQuoteMany people have been ended and loosing their money. And they have also their fault because why they go there and do gamble.You can say that to people who want to win money and are afraid to lose money but not to people who know what gambling is and what's not and who play without expecting to win but are there to have fun and try their luck",

Cause gambling is not for everyone. You are not really roaming around in this forum, this forum is not mostly casinos, there are other sections that cater to traders, miners, and investors you are only focusing on the gambling section and it just happens that casinos are active in promoting their platform here in Bitcointalk, they have the budget and there are many gamblers here. QuoteMany people have been ended and loosing their money. And they have also their fault because why they go there and do gamble.
