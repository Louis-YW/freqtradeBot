  "content": "Radiant: A Peer-to-Peer Digital Asset SystemAbstract. The Radiant network is a peer-to-peer digital asset system that enables direct exchange of value without going through a central party. A zero compromise blockchain with the inherent parallelism and performance characteristics of an unspent transaction output (UTXO) based architecture and the Turing Complete programming of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) architectures. This is a breakthrough smart contracting and digital asset system based on SHA512 proof-of-work, designed for extreme throughput and scale.White Paper: https://radiantblockchain.org/radiant.pdfWhat is Radiant?Radiant is a revolutionary network designed to solve the problems with all existing blockchains in terms of scale, parallelism and Turing Complete programming. Radiant is a peer-to-peer digital asset system that enables direct exchange of value without going through a central party. Similarly to Bitcoin, the Radiant network requires minimal structure, and timestamps transactions into an ongoing hash-based chain of proof-of-work (SHA512/256). We introduce two novel breakthrough techniques to validate digital assets: unique references and a general purpose induction proof system both of which operate in constant O(1) time and space. It is possible to compose outputs in any manner, without compromising the inherent parallelism and performance characteristics of an unspent transaction output (UTXO) based architecture. Therefore, users can leave and rejoin the Radiant network at will and be assured of the integrity and authenticity of their digital assets.Zero Compromise Open-source Blockchain: Hybrid Account + UTXO Smart ContractsThe world's first breakthrough hybrid Account + UTXO based architecture engineered for massive layer one (L1) on-chain scaling and Turing Complete smart contracts.Radiant offers the benefits of a UTXO blockchain along with the advanced capabilities of EVM compatible blockchains, but with none of the downsies.\"I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper. I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec.\"â€Š-â€ŠSatoshi NakamotoIn the same spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto's launch of Bitcoin, we released a fully operational and software development stack on Day 1, before even writing the White Paper. We wanted to be convinced that the revolutionary and breakthrough system worked before writing about it. No waiting, no limitations, just a scalable blockchain node and toolkit to build your dreams today.Network DetailsWhite Paper (English): https://radiantblockchain.org/radiant.pdfNetwork Name: RadiantNetwork Abbreviation: RXDMining Algorithm: SHA512/256 Proof-of-work (GPU Mineable) (FIPS Standard: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)Block Time: 5 minutesInitial Block Size: 128 MB, designed to achieve 10GB+Block Reward Schedule: 50,000 RXD per blockBlock Reward Halvening: 2 yearsMaximum Supply: 21,000,000,000 RXDDecimal Places: 8Launch Date: 2022â€“06â€“21 02:42 UTCRadiant Node, Source Code and LibrariesAll source code is immediately available and Open Source MIT Licensed.Radiant NodeA high-performance node, designed for big blocks and decentralized applications.

I guess any EVM chain u can see launching now is a thing hackneyed and boring to end user. New architecture is needed. Either comeback of deal breaker technologies we had a luxury of having in the past that for some reason ran out of steam or proper funding, or something better to reinstitute the novelty into this landscape.",
