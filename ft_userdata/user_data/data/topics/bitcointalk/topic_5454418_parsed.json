How does it have less when uniswap also offers Arbitrum to use? And can you explain the passive income thing. That's the only thing that sounds semi-interesting in here but i remain skeptical on that as someone gets to pay that income. So either fees are close to zero and you get no significant dividends or fees are high, which you said it won't be. So how does that work?",

I am not saying that the one you've brought is not actually a good one to invest but if you're not familiar with it, much better to find a better one.Quote from: timoshani on May 29, 2023, 09:09:13 PMI think even if there is an opportunity to invest in this project, it is better to allocate not the entire portfolio for this.

Perhaps with Bitcoin; in longer time frames it is bearish but with shorter timeframes. Contradictuons like this, is a warning that the market prices are moving sideways. On my end, I choose not to make a move as long as there is no clear trend. Ofcourse I would be missing some opportunities but atleast I won't gamble my money. It would only be rewarding if you will have the right guess but if it's the wrong one then goodluck. I think it would be better to wait for a little longer as this month is about to end and a trend might appear. But if you are that willing to still do so, atleast manage or make partial engagemrnts than going full in a single enter.",

Hyped are truly just there to make things hard for those who don't know what is truly happening in reality because everything they see is just a happy event and they don't know the storm that is about to happen once the hype is over. that's what the NFT fanatics think about last time they were buying expensive NFT products and others invested in some games that don't have any solid developers to support the game and they all ended up regretting their decisions because they wasted their investment and they didn't get the earnings from it as it didn't raise its price until now. so you really need to be vigilant when it comes to your investment in crypto so that you won't learn your lesson the hard way.",
