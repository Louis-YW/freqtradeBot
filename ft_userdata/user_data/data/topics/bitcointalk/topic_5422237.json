The top sites though still have no statement with regards to this, maybe they are still working on that or they are not considering this option and still choose not to get involve.",

If they have in btc, they could continue to source operational funds and when the bull comes they will rejoice in x3",

Imagine an exchange as big as FTX were just holding most of the users funds and they couldn't even afford 50% of them to withdraw causing a domino effect  . During this time millions of cryptonians withdrew their money from different exchanges causing them to halt or squeeze budgets , what makes a casino with a \"Curaçao\" licence  any special ?",

Anyways, I doubt most the casinos around here will suffer from this market. The World Cup is here and it is an excellent chance for them to attract more active users.Quote from: decodx on November 19, 2022, 10:13:50 PMI think all casinos convert cryptocurrencies into stablecoins or fiat immediately after deposit.

If that's the case then the same casino would have a lot of crypto during a downturn if they decided to convert that reserve stablecoin to something else.also during a crypto crash, more crypto per dollar is being spent, so I don't think casinos would have a problem any way; it's not everyday that a whale wins in these platforms, you have to keep that in mind.",

That idea is good though however since that wasn't the case for crypto-gambling sites today, nothing we can do about it.Honestly, I never think of that but since then, I always trust the reputable ones. I understand the risks here that's why I'm totally fine without knowing the money reserve of a certain site as long as they are considered a big gambling sites in the crypto-world.",
