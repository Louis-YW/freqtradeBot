I will advise you to hold for like 6 months before you can sell because, it will really help you to enjoy a big reward from your business and it will also encourage you to save more money to buy more BTC in future. Don't forget to store your coin's in cold wallet always so that you will not experience anything that will hurt you in future.",

Cold wallets are safest wallet type.Addition advise why you should avoid centralized exchanges.1. They can get hacked from any attacking source2. There's no privacy in using them because they can leak your data to third party3. You cannot recover your asset with them whenever there's something wrong with the exchanges either being attacked or went bankrupt because your keys for decoding your wallet address on blockchain is with them4. You're prone to KYC and AML agencies to investigate your informations abd account being subjected to them.5. You're no difference from someone using a bank because everything you do under a centralized exchange is from a central authority like the banks and other centralized institutionizations did.",

Cold wallets are safest wallet type.Exactly what I wanted to say. If you value your money, then do not leave it in the hands of someone who is not you. And do not leave it in a wallet, like that of an crypto exchange. Because the reason is that you would not be the only person who has access to that wallet. In the case of crypto exchanges, you are trusting them with your money. This goes against the very nature and concept of cryptocurrency, which is TO BE YOUR OWN BANK.But people still do it. And they think nothing bad will happen to them until it finally does happen.",

Banks are better because they are likely to protect your fiat than exchanges will protect your coins. There can be robbery in your bank, you can go to another branch the next day to deposit or withdraw, you can make use of their online banking, this is the way banks operate in my country, but if an exchange is hacked, your coins are gone or inconveniences may occur.",

Even if it's Binance or any other known exchanges, they shouldn't be used as substitutes for the storage of our bitcoins if we will hold them for a very long time.If you don't have a hardware wallet yet, you may choose to pick Electrum or any other reputable desktop wallet.And for the other options (https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet?step=5&platform=windows).

On the one hand, bitcoin can be seen as a currency and simultaneously as a new payment technology that emerged during the globalization of the economy as a response to the evolution in modern technology. Almost 90% of all bitcoins as of December 2022 are outside cryptocurrency exchanges. This is the maximum outflow in the last three years amid a crisis of confidence after the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange. Congratulations! You did a great job for your decision to buy BTS. I think you won't regret it! Except, really, it is better to keep it in a good and safe wallet.",

Though Op says his BTC is $163, so i don't think he should buy a hardware wallet yet for that amount, but it doesn't mean they have to store it in a hot wallet, OP is a newbie who might not know how to correctly use their online phone with BTC in it, they could click on one link and their BTC could be gone.I believe once a person buys BTC, the next important step is securely storing it, if OP has a device that they aren't using anymore, they can format it and use electrum on it as a cold storage. $163 is dust to a lot of members here, but if that is all OP has and he wants to hold it for long and accumulate more to it, then they have to protect the money.",

You might as well plan on transferring your bitcoins to a non-custodial wallet for safety purposes. But if you are planning to buy more like weekly or monthly with the same or even smaller amounts then you might not want to transfer them right away every time you buy. Bitcoin withdrawal fee in Binance is around $5 which is already 3% of your capital. So you can schedule your withdrawals to save fees. The most important thing is that you are aware and you know what you are doing.",

I think buying bitcoins at present is definitely profitable but I need to be patient enough.  But I don't have that much patience right now so I want to invest in Altcoin with a small amount first. And later invest some profit from here in Bitcoin for long time.on the other hand you create this account and participate on quiz with your first post for getting merit and you successfully got 1 merit there.Quote from: Bitcoin_people on January 09, 2023, 01:33:29 AMI am very happy to participate in this quiz. I first learned something new from this quiz. My Bitcoin history quiz answers..So it's not suspicious that you have another alt account. and this is too is a neat story to get merit",
