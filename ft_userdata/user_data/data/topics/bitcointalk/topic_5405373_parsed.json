  "content": "Earlier this year, boxing fans witnessed arguably the biggest fight in women's boxing history, the Taylor-Serrano fight. Thanks to Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing and DAZN. But we are not done yet. Bob Arum's Top Rank and ESPN are set to break women's boxing records. This time, it's a double-header unification event in London, England this September 10. The Ring, WBA, WBC and IBF undefeated middleweight champion Claressa Shields will unify with the last remaining belt holder in WBO champion, the undefeated Savannah Marshall. Claressa Shields is already a decorated fighter before turning pro. She is a two time gold medalist in the Olympics. While Shields wanted to unify all the belts to make herself an undisputed champion, she also wants to take revenge on Marshall who beat her when they were in the amateurs.In the other main event of the evening, undefeated The Ring, IBF and WBO super-featherweight champion Mikaela Mayer will try to add another piece of her collections, the WBC belt held by another undefeated champion Alycia Baumgarder. The other remaining champion is WBA holder Hyun Mi Choi of South Korea. The winner between Mayer and Baumgardner might move up in weight and fight the biggest name in women's boxing, the undisputed lightweight champion of Ireland, Katie Taylor.The difference between this event and Katie Taylor's are the trash talking. We won't be lucking them as both 4 protagonists were already trash talking each other since they became world champions together.",

Is Top Rank and ESPN just trying too much to market these ladies that they have to make it double unification. If they just move the dates to the most awaited fights, it will be more exciting. Maybe its just me but they are better fights that we'll rather pay in double to watch like GGG vs Canelo or Crawford vs Spence.",

Personally, I hate mismatches. I felt like I am just wasting my time since there's a very slim chance of an upset. It's like tolerating cherry pickers like Tank Davis, Leo Santa Cruz and others instead of fighting the big names and unifying belts. And if I have to pick only one to watch, I prefer this fight rather than watching a past prime GGG. And this is coming from a GGG fan since his Universum days.",

Shields is a bit annoying and at the same time funny with her trash talking. She talks a lot but she also gets easily mad. I want Marshall to knock her out. Although this is not an easy mission as the self proclaimed GWOAT got skills.Mikaela Mayer is a friend of Shields. She ridiculed Baumgardner for missing their first press conference.QuoteBaumgarder missed our first press conference. @alyciabaum, if you can't figure out zoom how you gonna figure out me? -Mikaela MayerI am rooting for the heavy-handed Baumgarder here though.",

      "body": "So these fights are happening this weekend. Women's boxing is back. These are all unification fights and all 4 of them are also undefeated so these fights should be better according to papers at least.The Ring, WBO, and IBF champion Mikaela Mayer finally shook hands with WBC champion Alycia Baumgardner but they actually continued their trash talking after this. I like Alycia, she's fast and she hurt opponents but Mayer's skills and experience in championship fights might be too much especially if the fight reaches the 2nd half.   The face-off between Ring, WBA, WBC, and IBF champion Claressa Shields and WBO champion Savannah Marshall. Claressa continued her trash talks but Marshall remained cool and silent. It is surprising that Shields is the slight underdog but maybe Marshall's KO rate and being at home are the factors. This seems like a clear Shields fight until Marshall starts to connect with her power punches.",

But I'm not taking advantage of the odds since I am a bit annoyed with Shields' trash-talking so I want Marshall to knock her out. I just see Shields as my odds favorite because she's a 2 time Olympic gold medalist. Although Shields' lost to Marshall before in the amateurs, she might be stronger, faster, and more technical this time. We will see if Marshall's high KO ratio can change the tempo of this fight. The other unification between these 2 pretty and sexy ladies, Mayer and Baumgardner have a more exciting build-up as both continued their verbal assaults on each other, unlike Marshall who's a silent type of person. This is the latest after their fight was moved to October next month. I think the changing of schedule will benefit Baumgardner a bit as the taller Mayer will have to spend more time making the weight limit.",

We have the rematch for the undisputed belts between Devin Haney and George Kambosos, the return of Deontay Wilder against Robert Helenius, and this double unification fight between the hottest women in boxing. I honestly prefer this event since these are the more intriguing fights; 4 champions and 3 of them are undefeated and all of them are in bad blood with each other. To those interested in this event.

It's hard to guess which one will win here, Shields is a brave challenger who chasing one by one belt from the champion until she get 5 belts except the WBO belt. I think I would bet Marshall here since KO is more likely to happen than decision.Mayer vs Baumgardner, Baumgardner is a KO specialist too but her recent result aren't KO streak so it mean her power might not enough for tough boxer. I think Mayer will win, but I wouldn't bet since the odds is quite small.",

The trash-talking and bad-mouthing make this event even more interesting aside from being unification fights. And I really hope they can offer us exciting fights and not boring ones. Shields has the 3 belts and the Ring but she seemed insecure and is so sensitive. She'll probably fight back when a dog bark at her.  What I expected earlier is starting to happen although a little late as the betting odds are now starting to slide slowly in favor of Shields. Shields obviously got the upper hand due to her vast experiences at the amateur and at the pro level. The same with Mayer but I think Baumgarder is too underestimated here. I am not missing these fights and I do hope Marshall and Baumgardner knock out their separate foes this weekend.",
