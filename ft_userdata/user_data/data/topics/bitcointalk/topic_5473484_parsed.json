Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000. Six is standard for most transactions to be considered secure.10 confirmations: suggested for large payments greater than $1,000,000.",

Be it a property or labor expenses.What measures and steps to be taken to make sure transaction won't stuck in the MemPool and all participants are honestly performing their duties?Ideally, bitcon and ether are already a contract in themselves, and intermediaries like lawyers are not needed, because the buyer will not forcibly send the transaction. But practice shows that transactions can get stuck, as the Author of the Topic correctly writes. And unfortunately it turns out that there is no way to do without a legal contract when buying something very expensive. Probably the best way would be to put more commission on the transaction so that it goes as quickly as possible and without problems. So that both parties to the transaction pay for the forwarding speed. There is no other way.",

By receiving a transaction ID, this is your Official Receipt (OR) as a record and verification that the transaction proceeds already with a designated number of confirmations. Other people before committing the transaction make sure at least 1 confirmation like an exchange is given. You can check the transaction in the following:Code:https://mempool.space/Code:https://blockchair.com/Those are just options but not limited to it. Consider too the transaction fees, sometimes its too much congested cause of the fees before proceeding is too much high like recently. Approx ~40 sat/byte.",

What about buyer reassurance?Buyer’s assurance is make sure you have confirmed the goods before initiating the transaction, once you broadcast the transaction it gets a block confirmation you definitely can’t get a reversal except if the seller reverse it by himself or on rare occasions a chain reorg drags it down to the mempool again where you can double spend. QuoteI mean something REALLY valuable. Not a coffee or gas tank!Then wait for Atleast 3 confirmations and at most 6 confirmations because a transaction left on the pool still unconfirmed can easily be double spend to another address by the buyer using the RBF method. A case like this was suspected on this thread when a scammer/buyer double spend or replaced the same unconfirmed transaction to another of his own address",

What about buyer reassurance?Bitcoin transactions are tricky business because once you hit send, that's it - no take backs! As the buyer, you've gotta be super careful to avoid losing your money.  Personally, I'd triple check that Im sending my coins to the right wallet address.  Can't get that money back if it goes to the wrong person! I'd also look into the seller see if other people have bought from them and confirm they're legit.  Make sure you fully understand what youre buying - read the fine print so there's no surprises later with extra fees or policies.  Check that everything's legal where you live too, just in case you need to dispute something later on down the road.  For expensive  items, I might consider use an escrow service as an extra layer of protection.basically, with Bitcoin you gotta look before you leap.  Verify everything cover your bases, and only send payments when you're 100% sure its all good.  It takes more work, but better be safe than sorry when that crypto's gone for good!",

Be it a property or labor expenses.What measures and steps to be taken to make sure transaction won't stuck in the MemPool and all participants are honestly performing their duties?While paying for an expensive item or making a huge transaction, first of all,, try to use a a wallet that supports RBF, and it would be advised to use this feature to enhance the fee so that your transaction won't get stuck in the network. In the past few few days,, I have seen two cases where the transaction has been stuck for quite some time. So if you don't want that, then increase the priority of your transactions by increasing the transaction fee using RBF.Second, I would advise you to check the receiving address properly. There is no doubt that you have copied it from the main source, but still, you have to check word for word as many scammers have found a way to trick you by creating wallets that has a same start and ending letters in them, and many scammers are using clipboard attacks, in which the address changes when you copy it and it goes into the the clipboard.So if the transaction is very large, then do not just copy; instead, write it down manually. Check the network you have chosen to see if that's right or not.",

I suggest that you read books about Bitcoin or watch some videos on YouTube, in addition to learning how to cold store and preserve your money well. Regarding fees, although they are currently expensive, they are in the range of $5 to $20. Note that the method of calculating Bitcoin fees does not depend on the value of the transaction, but I do not think that someone who wants to buy a property for thousands of dollars will be concerned about fees for less than $100.",

If you use one, I'd argue that you should move your coins asap if security is your concern. There have been multiple reports related to multi-currency wallet which shows they are insecure most of the time, such as privacy key leak, hijacking, etc. Not to mention most of them are closed sources to begin with. Not a good choice if you're dealing with high-profile transactions.",

You could already assure that you could really be able to get those coins.Never ever release or make deal or finalize something on a unconfirmed transaction yet it could really be having that possibility of double spend on which this something that should really need to avoid or simply you would really be scammed on this case. Always have that network confirmation first before proceeding on releasing items or giving out some service.",
