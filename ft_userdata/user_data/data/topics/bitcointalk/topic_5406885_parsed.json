People blame short term traders for price dump (it dumps because its shitcoin or crypto winter), for project failures (it fails because its shitcoin), for their own mistakes etc. In fact short term traders create volume and volatility, which brings market makers and arbitrage traders that create liquidity, which attracts bigger traders and bigger market makers, which attracts big investors that knows that asset is big enought and popular enought to enable them go in and out whenever they need to. not in and baghold forever becuase there is not enough demand to sell. All this increased trading traffic end up as price and project value goin up. Limit trading and you end up with shitcoin with high spreads, no liquidity and no investors.And no serious CEX will support that.",

I can't believe such a public lie still has the support of those who believe in its recovery. After what happened, I personally put it on my list of dangers not to be concerned about in this market. The way they got it wrong and justified it, the people who suffered a lot after the catastrophic failure that the project created, one of the worst pieces of history in the crypto space that I have witnessed.",

If the burn mechanism will be implemented and investors will become the party who already sacrificed by the developers. The luna developers are so shady. That's why regulators want to catch them all. There will be a big tax to the any transactions that will be done by the investors. The team didn't even take their responsibility to solve this.

They create it and pour it into investors' heads and then fix it by burning, and in my opinion, staying away from Luna related things is a way for me or many others to not have any more trouble with the investment. with this market.Before asking for comments from the community, they broke themselves and turned it into a pile of trash.

Yeah, the Luna developer scandal won't be easily forgotten.  There are lots of people who lose their entire life money because of the bad decision made by the project developer.  Besides, the UST crash was rumored to be initiated by the Project company's wallet, so I think the authority must investigate this.The burning mechanism is a big bull****.  If they didn't increase the daily creation of Terra Luna in the first place( now known as Terra Classic) it shouldn't have been exploited (who knows probably the hacker is within the team member) and there is no need for this burning mechanism.  Then they fork to new LUNA abandoning people who supported the LUNC to not get 0 value.  And now burning 1.2% per transaction, to decrease the LUNC token supply. How long will it take to get LUNC to million supply?",
