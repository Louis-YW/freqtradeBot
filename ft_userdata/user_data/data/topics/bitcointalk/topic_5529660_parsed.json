So the dip wasn't surprising to meSomehow I believe there's manipulations at play. Far from any manipulation. If you trade forex or have ever tried trading forex, you can relate some of the ideas to cryptocurrency trading, how their could be sessions to trading and how these sessions can affect the market with regards to volume of trade and the money in the market at all times.It doesn’t necessarily have to be manipulated. The market isn’t one that you can easily manipulate and get some consistency if your stands on the weekend are true. Not disputing that though, I’ve observed most weekends I would say to end on a negative note but, I’m saying, it’s not due to market manipulations.",

BTC please...Say, 3 or 4 weeks ago Larry Fink announced that Bitcoin was going to $700,000. Then he took BlackRock off Bitcoin. That's when BTC started to drop big time.He might have been playing a game.. spoofing us all. He or some of his friends are surely still 'playing' it. Just not fully with Blackrock. Methinks he was doing this because of Trump's looking into BlackRock for market manipulation in illegal ways.Expect that BTC will go back up... maybe not to $700,000 like Fink said. Remember that for many months now Robert Kiyosaki of \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" fame, has been saying that we will have a $350,000 BTC in 2025 sometime. This was based on general finances, not really considering the Fink BlackRock move. Fink simply doubled it Robert's number to say that either BTC was going up, or hat it was going down big time.I can't tell you what will happen, but these are some major points to consider... points that I think make it look good for BTC.",

Although everyone attributed the price decline to the tariff announcement by Trump. But we are still a long way to go for this month and many things that happen in the market that is very positive that will push the price to a new all time high before the end of the year.",

Fact is that price always goes back up to $100000 after it drops shows that market is becoming more stable. This up and down movement can actually be good for both people who invest in Bitcoin for long time and those who trade it for short time. It gives themchance to buy more Bitcoin at lower price. Overall it seems like current market situation is not something to worry about but rather a normal change in market.",

The current Bitcoin price is still around 97K USD, which isn't bad. I'm not obsessed with the BTC price movements and I don't care if the price drops by several thousand dollars. Being obsessed with the BTC price movements is a rookie sign, and you are a legendary forum member. You probably have big experience with trading BTC throughout the years.Maybe the \"Trump pump\" got exhausted and there are signals that the price might drop below 90K USD soon.

If it can go up 100% or 300% then a 30% or 40% correction is also normal and as bitcoin investors we should adapt to that. This correction is another opportunity for long term holders but I don't think it is a good opportunity for short term traders as there is no guarantee that bitcoin will not fall further. Especially as geopolitical uncertainty increases due to Trump's tariff policies, the market will become even more unpredictable.Of course, Bitcoin will soon surpass $100k again and even reach a new ATH but the question is how many people can wait for that to happen. I mean, when investing in bitcoin, we should stop asking when bitcoin will hit $100k, $200k or $1 million because it will almost certainly happen.
