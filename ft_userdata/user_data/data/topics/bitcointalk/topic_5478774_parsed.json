Depending on your requirement you could choose the fee, but you would need to first register to accelerate a transaction. It is similar to RBF but the issue here is that you cannot control the fee for the transaction. Below is the screen that you will see after you have clicked the Accelerate button.I have personally never used this new system on memepool, I feel it is far better than those BTC accelerators available in the market and the fee is not that bad.",

This is my first time of hearing this kind of wallet. But you want to spend up your transaction, either you use accelerator or you bump your transaction fee. Those are some of the options to go about it. And as others have said, you have to for the instructions of the comments if not your transaction will stuck for days or weeks.

The best option is for the Op to either use a free accelerator or, better yet, try using a wallet that supports fee replacement and spending unconfirmed transactions. That's a far better option for him. Or still, if not for privacy concerns, I could have also suggested he share the TX so that we can determine how much fee is needed to push that true and the size of the transaction. If that's what Viabtc Free Acceleration can be able to help with, then someone can help him submit it.",

But this wallet you are using doesn't support both. And other than this, all you can use it a transaction speed accelerator, there are many accelerator platforms like F2PoolViaBTCBTC.comYou can use these platforms to accelerate your transaction on your own, do not hire anyone as I have seen many people are giving this as a service in the service section all they are doing is asking you to give them the transaction hash and then they insert that transaction hash in these accelerators, actually these accelerators are directly related with nodes and they don't increase the transaction that much but effective to some extent.",

But in layman's language, ViaBTC will only accelerate your transaction if it is about 18 Sat/vb. A little lower than that might still go but I have never used lower than that before. Should in case you use a too-low transaction fee than that, I'm afraid you might want to either wait for the congestion to subside and fees go back to normal or you accelate it with a fee.",
