Same issue or has the balance reflected?",

Coinbase requires at least 2 confirmations for a transaction to be spendable as a security feature, this means that a transaction can de confirmed on chain but not yet on your coinbase account.Quote from: NIrish on June 11, 2023, 03:20:05 PMI'm really worried about my $BTC and why I can't access it all.To avoid worrying about your bitcoins, use them on a non custodial wallet like electrum.- Jay -",

I was also worried because in the Explorer the transaction was confirmed but at the same time, my wallet was not reflecting the balance. The problem was due to the network congestion.Check dear your balance on Explorer if there your balance is updated then nothing to worry just check for any updates and wait patiently. Nothing t worry about it.",

But just a little advise, don't use Coinbase wallet for your Bitcoins, it is a closed source wallet and what happened with Atomic wallet is still fresh in everybody's minds, so there is prolly no better time to move over to an open source wallet like Electrum, and if you have any inquiry about it, i'm pretty sure you'd be inundated with suggested solutions because it is one of the Bitcoin wallets that is widely recommended.",

You can spend once the transaction reached 6 confirmation.I recommend you to use non custodial wallet for further BTC storage because coinbase wallet is web wallet and doesn't share the private keys with you so you can't access the funds without their permission.",

One of them is non-custodial and gives you a seed phrase and the other one is custodial. I guess OP is referring to the non-custodial coinbase wallet here. If that's the case, he/she should be able to spend the fund once the receiving transaction gets one confirmation. It's also possible to import the wallet to electrum and spend the fund even when the receiving transaction is still unconfirmed. It may worth mentioning that even their non-custodial wallet should be avoided. It's close source and there is no way to know how the keys are generated.",

Electrum is the holy grail bitcoin software wallet for PC but last time I tried their android app, it's uh, too basic. I suggest you look into Blue Wallet instead if the situation is still the same. For ALTs there is also Unstoppable Wallet. Afaik both are open-source as well.But op, if we're talking about decent amount of money here and/or storing for long term, you're better off looking into hardware wallets instead since they're not hot wallets hence you'll be minimizing a great amount of risk, see: Open Source Hardware Wallets",
