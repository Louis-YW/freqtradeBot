ETH had high profitability for years and 2 weeks ago it went POS which means you can't mine it anymore.You can mine many coins right now, however you will not make a profit when you factor in your electrical cost. There is also ASIC mining which might be profitable with low power but the equipment is not cheap. And that type of mining is not done on a computer but its stand-alone equipment.",

It's a unique Proof of Work system mineable by CPU, GPU and ASIC designed for agility, flexibility, and DAO control so it is allocated as 48% CPU 48% GPU and 4% ASIC. So, 52% of the time your CPU or GPU would not even be consuming energy and it still earns more than mining any other crypto. And you can use software like SRBminer for AMD and TTminer for Nvidia which allow you to switch to other coins during non-GPU cycles.It is a little complicated to learn but if you're willing to put in the effort the juice is definitely worth the squeeze.I have been telling people about EPIC for years. Mining EPIC has been more profitable and more energy efficient compared to any other coin.And EPIC is just the first part of what the community is working on. There is an entire ecosystem in development and these guys mean business.People will know EPIC and the rest of Epicenter digital assets.t.me/epiccash is a good gateway to learn more.  epic.tech is the website",

The very first thing I learned when I started mining was to learn how to calculate profit. Now many coins are cheaper to buy.https://whattomine.com/coinshttps://hashrate.no   https://rafatech.net/overclocks#overclockamd Once you learn how to do profit calculation, visit this site.

That would be true but most likely not for GPUs. Maybe for ASICs for Bitcoin and Litecoin. The issue is that ETH had a large daily miner revenue. And there isn’t any coin that comes close that is POW and GPU mineable.Another issue is that there are lots of GPUs sitting idle waiting for something decent to mine. This will keep profits caped and you will all need to split the revenues between all the miners.",

Study this article carefully. The problem is not the absence of a bull market. A huge share of mining was occupied by the TOP 2 project - Ethereum.https://bitproit.com/gpu-mining-profitability-after-ethereum-merge/There are no new coins yet, and EthereumPoW, Ethereum classic and other forks cannot give a good profit to miners, and in most cases only losses. Electricity is getting more expensive in all countries, but there are still a lot of miners.",

      "body": "If you want to learn about mining, I think the first is you need to understand about the requirement first and how you can calculate the profit. You can use this site [1] since it's complete to choose the hardware you use, the electricity cost and what's the coin you want to mine. Actually setting up mining farm is quite easy since there's a lot tutorial about it and also how to set up the pools. But you need a good understanding how to take care of your hardware wallet in order to prevent from fire and would make a problem with your mining farm.[1] https://whattomine.com/",
