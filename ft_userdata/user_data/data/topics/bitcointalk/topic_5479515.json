  "content": "As of 26 December, while others were celebrating Christmas with various activities, Microstrategy were celebrating theirs with further addition of 14,620 Bitcoin which worth $615M. Since their start in August 2020, Microstrategy has bought a total of 189,150 BTC. It's certainly uncertain if Michael Saylor is slowing down soon, given his understanding of the importance of long term investment in Bitcoin. Microstrategy's current Bitcoin accumulation worth over $5B, which guarantees a very good profit in the next Bull market and beyond.Despite all this positive news, I suggest we shouldn't get carried away. Microstrategy has introduced a strategy of continuos purchase of Bitcoin. Why don't we do the same. As respective crypto ethusiast, continuous accumulation is also required, no matter the amount.What do you think?",

Microstrategy's current Bitcoin accumulation worth over $5B,If we are to work with the figure you just gave above as the total amount of Bitcoin Microstrategy currently has @ 189,150 BTC, then I think with the current price of Bitcoin at $43,100 per BTC, then it's accumulative worth is actually more than $5B, as it's currently up to $8B (i.e 189,150 x $43,100 = $8,152,365,000). Hence, this should be a sign for us all to keep accumulating ours just as Microstrategy has done theirs, if we really wants to reap good profit after the price of Bitcoin start skyrocketing after next year's halving.",

Microstrategy's purchase of Bitcoin and keeping it on the agenda is good news for Bitcoin, but this situation may also reverse in the future. What I mean is that if a person or institution holds a large amount of Bitcoin and starts selling it in the future, this will inevitably affect the market negatively. There's nothing to prevent this.Institutions and companies that purchase Bitcoin have a significant impact on increasing the price of Bitcoin and diversifying their investors. While talking about the positive aspects of such investors, we should also be aware of the negative situation that will arise in case of sale.",

I think Bitcoin investors will sell the coins when they get to the predicted price in the future. Every investor intends to make a profit, hence it is not out of place for Microstrategy to sell and make money in the future.When raising debt in order to buy Bitcoin, no, of course no one can hold Bitcoin forever. What MS and MS (funny, Micro Strategy and Michael Saylor - same initials) are doing is leveraging debt to accumulate more Bitcoin. This guarantees the sale of Bitcoin at some stage. Sure, the amount of Bitcoin sold to repay the debt may be minuscule in the future, however it also depends on market timing. If the debt is due at a detrimental time, Microstrategy could be hurt severely. If no debt was involved, there's actually no reason for anyone to sell if there is no pressure to. There might very well be no need for fiat in the future world, so Bitcoin could become preferable over fiat in the long future, Bitcoin's ex-changeability to a payment-focused altcoin or technology could be the way to move from store of value (bitcoin) to daily transacting (new payment-focused/cash technology) in the future.",

We know Bitcoin can be trusted to a very high extent giving its performance over the years. However as an investor we should never ignore the fact that it is still a crypto currency. Therefore \"invest what you can afford to lose\" acts more like a fail safe , or backup plan for investors in the crypto space.Investing more than you can afford to lose sometimes comes with a whole lot of profit in the end but it is also accompanied by great risks.Don't forget to keep your keys safe",

I don't see it as something good.Microstrategy is a software and cloud-based company in US and all the Bitcoin you are around is owned by the company and not Micheal. According to some latest report, Micheal Saylor in person has about 17,732 and Microstrategy as a company has a total of 189,150 as last reported, I'm not sure if Micheal acquisition of personal Bitcoin has increased but he doesn't own all the Bitcoin. However, he owned about 24.2% share of the company which makes him the biggest shareholder and that is why he is representing the company and always agitate for bitcoin adoption.What I fear is the rate at which they buy bitcoin and take all the bitcoins from weak hands and a time will come when the bitcoin community will be weak, all the power will be shifted to the institutional investors because they are holding large junks of bitcoin. Now imagine the total circulation, if 60% is been held by this group of people, are we going to have a say on how decentralized the Bitcoin network will be, I don't think so because by then, they will want to be in control of their investment and not with some boys that claim tech guru.Quote from: CODE200 on December 28, 2023, 06:41:12 AMI do the same, but I'm not Michael Saylor, I still can't gather even 1 full coin.

I know it used to be the wishes of Bitcoin enthusiasts for Bitcoin to start getting recognized by the big players like Microstrategy but it has it downsides. Bitcoin was originally created to be an open and distributed network but it won't be if a large chunk of the supply is controlled by big corporations like Microsoft, Grayscale, etc. Even Telsa sold their bitcoin when they felt it was right and caused turbulence in the market.As more and more big players acquired more bitcoins from the smaller users, they'd drive the price so high that it'd because a rich person thing.",

I have read various users talking about it and even I am also following the same since couple of years: the DCA. Thats the technique most of the investors use and the effect is even better if assets are bought in the bulk. Now when it comes to microstrategy things are obviously in the millions of dollars. So even a slight change in the market price can easily make them huge profits. If you study these financial institutes then they have upper hand of moving the market or at least stimulating it due to their mega purchases. Thats what happening here and yes let us not get carried away with this purchase. Better focus on DCA with our small purchases.",
