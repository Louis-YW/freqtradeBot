  "content": "I got a task on some crypto projects to finish up and felt I can get some interesting ideas on the Bitcointalk community to improve on my research. I have gathered some useful informations but I feel they are not enough so I decided to bring them here too to get more ideas. 1) Aave is one of the leading lending protocols in all of crypto. How have they maintained their status as a premier lending solution? How has the protocol evolved since its launch? What protocols and ideas are they most interested in partnering with? 2) Aptos and Sui are two promising third generation blockchain projects. Compare and contrast their technology and how they market themselves. Which chain do you think has a better chance to succeed? 3)How did Terra partner with fiat on-ramp solutions to bring liquidity into its ecosystem? What improvements have on-ramps and bridges made to improve onboarding processes for end users.Thanks all for your contribution in arias",

All altcoin related discussion belong in the Alternate cryptocurrencies and its child boards. [3][4][e]You might make a question that counts as \"beginner's\" or \"seeking for help\", but don't expect lots of people from a Bitcoin forum to answer questions outside the bitcoin space. Aave, Aptos, Sui and Terra are altcoins, three of which I didn't even know they exist.",
