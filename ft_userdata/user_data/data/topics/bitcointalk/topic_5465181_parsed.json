One thing I have noticed about the bonus buy is that they are not cheap, but with it you have high chance to win a big bonus. In gambling, always know that you should use little amount of money that you can afford to lose to gamble even if you want to go for bonus buy. Bonus buy can be from from 50 or 60 dollars or more.",

Would you like to do everything as it was before, without buying bonuses?As slot lover, bonus buy is a good addition for players, this option can be used as alternative to play the normal spins although I do believe that many players use bonus buy most of the time. I myself like to play with normal spins as it is the original way to hunt the bonus round and it is more enjoyable and fun that directly using the bonus buy feature. However I have to say that I also like to use bonus buy, sometime I play it in my whole single gambling session (always purchase bonus).",

But I don't agree that I have to discuss these issues in one thread, as they are different topics.Regarding the topic at hand, I never buy vouchers. I haven't studied it in depth but I understand that in the long run it favours the houses more than the players. The appealing thing about them is that they add more volatility, and therefore more excitement, but they don't get me hooked on them.",

When playing slots that don't have a freespin purchase feature, I often spin hundreds of times but don't get a single free spin bonus, that's really bad, friend. I only spend money to do spins with no bonus feature at all, if I play in a slot that has a buy feature, when I have 20 normal spins sometimes I buy free spins. Even though I might lose, if I get a freespin bonus it's better than not getting it at allEven though the slot has a buy free spin feature, I once got a 4000x bet from reguler freespins (without the buy feature).

From $50 or $60 and even more?   I can't say that buying bonuses is good or bad... we usually find that out after we buy the bonus! What I can say is that the odds are not in our favor, maybe 1 in 10 buys will be successful, if we are lucky a few of them. But I had 5-10 bonus buys in a row after which I could only stop playing because I didn't have enough money for another buy, all bonus buys wins were negative, some of them a total disaster with x1-x5 payouts. It's good when we can buy \"super bonus rounds\", but they are usually x1000 base bet, so they are not cheap. We shake until we just recover the money, which does not happen every time, even those super bonuses can disappoint big time... been there and done that.In the end, bonus buys are good for fast play full of excitement. Bonus spins can be with some crazy features and all that music and sounds can really be interesting... but don't get carried away, it's still gambling, just with higher stakes.",

      "body": "The feature of buying bonus rounds provides more sensation when playing slot gambling. Because we can more easily get bonus rounds by buying them. but what I feel after this feature is, it's very difficult for me to get big wins in this gambling. And do you also feel the same way..?I assume for now the bonus round cannot be a hope for us to get a big win when we get it. Which is very different from the beginning of its appearance, where there was no feature to buy bonus rounds. So I suggest that for now, play appropriately, don't chase too much after winning, which is difficult to get. Just enjoy the game and when you get a win in a slot, you should immediately withdraw from the game, before the winnings run out again in the next round.",

I suspect that it is one of those features and encourages a gambler to chase after their loses because it looks to easy to simply choose how much bonus you want to buy from the machine. This is a trigger for those who are struggling with gambling addiction and are trying to gamble under a budget. It may look enticing but after playing multiple bonuses, they may end up with a small profit on one bonus, but also experience losses on others.",
