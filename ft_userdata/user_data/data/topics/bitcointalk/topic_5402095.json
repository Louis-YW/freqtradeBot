Bitcoins are held individually demand and supply in the market are based on relatively unpredictable cycles.What do you mean there should be some coordination? could the popes form a group and drop the price together?",

Do you know these whales yourself? I can answer that for you that you dont. This is because bulls and whales are only terms created by those observing the market.If you look into the charts you may not get the complete picture. Often there is a selling vs buying pressure difference that is close to zero and the market remains stagnant but the daily trading volume rises. Only if this balance gets toppled to once side do we see the bull/bear move. This is more like being in the sidelines which the actual wrestling is happening in the ring and therefore is easy to comment but to not know the fact.A number of reasons are behind the current bear market. Unless there is a resolution of those or starting of new positive news, a bigger move is difficult to start. Just in case you are getting tired of the bearish trend, take a break from the market, it often helps instead of complaining.",

They don't care if the two countries are at war somewhere at the corner of earth. All they care is to maintain their wealth and how to expand it further. So on scale of 1 to 10, they gate 11 points as to be involved with the current opportunity takers. If anything is getting bought in the bearish market then its going into the whales wallet. They know the importance of buying at bearish, they have the capabilities to do so because they have the ready funds to risk. They are taking risks, because they make money from their money. They don't look for congested timelines but bigger scale, two to three years of planning altogether. Definitely the bulls will take advantage. Inflation is for poors and middle classes, not the riches.",

I should have probably said \"there could be some coordination\"Even if we call them whales this does not mean they are an uniform group with the exact same goals, besides whales are experts at taking advantage of the market sentiment, right now such sentiment is bearish so they are not going to waste their time trying to force it into a bullish state, you can be sure the whales are buying like crazy but they are doing this while being hidden from public view, only when the circumstances are right and they have filled their bags they will reveal what they have been doing.",

You cannot expect two large institutions that have held large amounts of bitcoin to coordinate with each other to hold bitcoins forever without spending them in a bull market. They also aim to make a profit but may exit gradually when the target is reached.The rules of the game are the same, so trust the community and never think that only whales can help you with this.",

I would have thought there would be some coordination between a few of them it will start the mother of all bull cycles but it seems no one is prepared to get the ball rolling.Maybe yes, i was just reading a post today some time back which stated that how market fell after the recent inflation report from Fed. But it's equally ironic to think that people might use bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Why would you want to risk 30-40% of your capital just to beat 7-8% of inflation each year? Doesn't makes any sense at all to me atleast, if someone wants to actually invest in bitcoin only then he will bring his money in not to beat 6-7% inflation.",

I should have probably said \"there could be some coordination\"It is definitely true that the whales can manipulate the market, but bitcoin marketcap of over $500 billion should be hard to manipulate, unlike altcoins with low marketcap. What I just think about this which I believe it is more accurate is that there is time for bull market and there is also time for bear market. You can see that from each 4 years after bitcoin halves. After bitcoin halves, it would be followed by bull market for many months to the extent all-time-high is reached. After, bear market followed.Taken 2016/2017 bull market that corresponds to the bull market of 2021/2022, 2018 was bear market which is corresponding to what is happening in 2022. People are following period to buy and sell bitcoin massively which may become what is happening without whales involved.",

Still, it's just a matter of time before the bull run that we've all been waiting for will happen. For now, just keep your patience and HODL. Buy more if you have some extra savings. This is buying season. There will come a time in the near future when we'll look back to this day and wish we've bought more. In these trying times, the call to take refuge in Bitcoin is strong.",

Manipulation continues to make prices go down. When the timing is right and all the fundamentals are supportive, then a bull market will come. Waiting for the whale to finish loading it would be better. We as small traders must also be prepared, don't waste this opportunity.",
