  "content": "Welcome to this post on Ferrite coin!FEC -> Scrypt ASIC coinAs one of the new developers and large bagholder ($200 of electricity) of Ferrite Core, I would like to ensure the security of the experimental blockchain from a 51% attack, which means that more hashrate is required and therefore would like to call onto the Bitcoin Forum community to particpate in the mining of ferritecoin.Summary:Algorithm: S-Crypt (scrypt)Block time: 1 minute. The purpose of a longer block time is to ensure that block propagation delays do not constitute a large percentage of the target interval. Compared to a decade ago, network infrastructure and computer performance have increased, and delays have been reduced to a few seconds. A propagation delay of 5 seconds correspond to a detached (orphan) block rate of 7%. This rate is similar to sales taxes, and is a fair trade-off for faster confirmation times as the network scales. A shorter block time will only disproportionately increase block time. Difficulty readjustment time: 60 minutes (60 blocks)Hindsight is 20/20. Given the volatile economics of cryptocurrency, difficulty readjustment is set to a shorter time span. While some may believe that an even shorter difficulty readjustment time would be better, 60 blocks will strike a fair balance between dynamic difficulty adjustment and difficulty stability. This is because blocks can be solved faster as a result of luck. By the central limit theorem, 60 blocks is a sample large enough to be approximately normal.Coin generation:No premineThe total number of coins are 60,221,400 because this means that the number of atomic units (10^8 per coin) is very close to 1/10^8 of the number of atoms in one mole of ferrite.Mining will generate 100 coins per block, with a halving time of 301,107 blocks. On the time this post was written (early 2023), the block height is 50,000 with a 24h average hashrate of a mere 3.0 GH/s across 11 pools. We believe that with a high block reward, this can offer users a concrete stake in Ferrite and its development. We hope that early adopters will be willing to support this coin and spend time to create services to improve this coin.Fair start:The coin wallet is released with precompiled binaries. You can also compile the source code directly from Github. Mining pools and a quick start wiki guide have been created so that even those new to cryptocurrency can start mining on rental hashrate.FAQI need help to install/use the wallet (https://github.com/koh-gt/ferrite-core/wiki/Getting-Started)I want visuals.Supply (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101822992/211856269-52aa141b-a737-4bba-b36b-4f84a3be5549.PNG)DownloadsSource code:https://github.com/ferritecoin/ferrite-coreBinaries:https://github.com/koh-gt/ferrite-core/releases/tag/v3.1.4Latest version (29 Feb 2024 - on a leap day!)List of mining pools:https://github.com/koh-gt/ferrite-core/wiki/Mining-Pools-Listhttps://miningpoolstats.stream/ferriteBlock Explorer:https://ferritecoin.org:53443Website:https://ferritecoin.orgForum:https://ferritecoin.org:52443Telegram:t.me/ferrite_core",

I have two L3++ mining FEC.Miners begin to mine and after 10 or 15 minutes, miners don´t stop mining, but hasrate in pool go to 0 about 10 or 15 minutes, after this time hashrate in pools is normal again, other 10 or 15 minutes and down to 0 .....Mi miners console hashrate is always beetwen 800 Mhs and 1200 MHs, but in pool hashrate is beetwen 0 Mhs and 1200 Mhs. The median is about half of total hashrate.Pools report me all is ok and problem is with blockchain.Are you stopping with maintenance tasks? Why this erratic work?Where is my miners hashrate in this downtimes?Suceed me in at least two pools I probe, only with FEC, other scripts coins work with full hashrate in the same pools where FEC mining fail.I have screenshots, but no contact way in website coin.",

      "body": "I think you should contact nikolett in the telegram group t.me/ferrite_core or at the discord. It is possible that your own pool share difficulty is too low/the hashrate graph is reporting an inaccurate hashrate.If you are getting more than 100 blocks a day with your hashrate currently I think all is well. Quotenikolett — Yesterday at 16:02Unstable hashrate can be a result of setting too low/high of a share difficulty for your pool. For Scrypt the share difficulty should be multiplied by 65536 - for 1 GH/s you might want to set share difficulty to about 250k-500knikolett — Yesterday at 23:56Do consider your pool latency as well, 1000ms of latency can reduce your block generation success slightly since 2s / 60s is about 3.3% of the average block time. Your latency should far lower if you port forward 9574, so that your node can relay any valid blocks to the network through fewer nodes.These days networks have been getting much faster, broadcast latency should be on the order of at most tens of milliseconds.For me I mine in one of the pools from https://miningpoolstats.stream/ferrite",

Ferrite coin has an effective [57,800 premined coins (578 blocks)](https://github.com/koh-gt/ferrite-core/blob/ferrite-main/src/chainparams.cpp). This significant premine may be considered unfairly mined, since coins will no premine are considered by the community to be more fair. It is explained that a large stash of premined coins will allow the developers to pay for bounties or events. It is claimed that the premine is to confirm the validity of the genesis block, as well as the difficulty readjustment. Quote> Dango Mango $FNNC (Will Not DM First):I saw a post on Bitcointalk.org about how there was a small premine of sorts> Dango Mango $FNNC (Will Not DM First):I would be curious about what you think of this, do you mind if I send you the post?> Dango Mango $FNNC (Will Not DM First):Also, this is a real listing for FEC right?https://xeggex.com/market/FEC_USDT> Dango Mango $FNNC (Will Not DM First):https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434601.0> nikolett:I think I read about the article from nagareteku. At the start there were few miners, to get the chain moving I had to solo mine about 500+ blocks worth almost 50k FEC (0.1% total supply of 60.22m)I recently had a conversation with Nikolett concerning the suspected premine matter, and she revealed that they've burnt not just the entire early mine, but all coins mined by her (there are like 800k coins burnt in the FerriteBurnxxxx from what I have seen in the explorer) When I asked why about the reasons behind this move, she shared an intriguing perspective: \"In the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, ultimate control rests with those who relinquish it willingly.\" It's quite an interesting take on things, don't you think? I find it doubtful that anyone would burn their entire stash, can anyone verify? I have everything to fear about, there are so many scams from medical AI to memes.",
