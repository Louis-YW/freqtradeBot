Probably that's the reason they do not want to caught up in FOMO just yet. During the last bull cycle, Bitcoin reached upto 69k USD. The current price level is nowhere near it. So there's a lot of room to grow. It doesn't make sense to give up on the hope just yet. Also another halving is imminent.",

The conclusion does not follow from the premise. The Bitcoin price, as you say, peaked in 2021 and a lot of people did not sell because all predictions gave a much higher price for the cycle. Now most holders are not selling because we are at the first steps of a bull market and it is not logical to sell now if you expect that in a year or two the price will be 5 times higher than now. That has little to do with \"really believe in it\" and more to do with a profit maximization calculation.",

Because Bitcoin can provide 5x or even 10x profits if you have the patience and strong belief to do it, because you learn from experience not to be too hasty.And as we know, we will face the next halving, and this can be said to be the beginning of an even higher rise.",

This Bitcoin hasn't been used for over a year.This is not entirely correct.Let me put it this way, imagine you earn $2 (two 1 dollar bills) but only spend $1 and keep the other. That doesn't mean you didn't spend your money. That means you only spent what you wanted to spend.In a lot of cases in bitcoin, this is what's happening. For example I own some coins I have not touched ever since 2014, didn't even claim the shitcoin airdrops. That doesn't mean I have never spent or sold my bitcoins. I have other coins too, for example I got some a couple of days ago and if I want to spend/sell some I would spend/sell those not the ones from 2014.QuoteSince Bitcoin reached its highest value in 2021, people who plan to keep it for a long time have shown they really believe in it, despite problems in the market and with the economy. The same. People who have bought bitcoin, do believe in its long term potential but when there is economic hardship they don't have to dump all their stash. They can sell some to cover their costs and keep the rest.In any case, people are always going to keep more bitcoin than they spend/sell because in the long run the price is guaranteed to rise, this is not just because of bitcoin's potential but also because \"price\" is measured in fiat terms and fiat is super inflationary thanks to constant printing of it.",

They are long term investors and hodlers they have fixed set of Target in their mind and no way they are gonna sell it before achieving that and it's not these 20% or 50% target which we set for long term rather a calculated one based on growth. We have seen people towards their pension scheme or stocks for decades to retire with ample amount of money and same logic applies here as well. Suppose a person bought 5 Bitcoin before 2015 at the price of $1k each and he sold one at 2017 bull run around ,$22k and another when bitcoin hit $69k in the recent bull run. They are financially good and looking for certain pumps and profits which they have incurred in the past.",

Bitcoin has reached way higher value over the past decade and now people believe that within next 10 years Bitcoin could go to so huge values that's beyond imagination of many people. Some expect Bitcoin will reach $1 Million or more in this decade while most believe that Bitcoin has potential to go beyond $1 Million per coin during those 10 years. I personally think that Bitcoin can easily cross $1 Million value even within 7-8 years and if that happens then the holders who bought Bitcoin at $20k would make more than 50x of their investment which sounds really amazing I guess. The holders also have such beliefs and that's why they will hold their coins for much longer periods in order to have better profits.",

The easiest way to get profit from bitcoin is to hold for long time and that’s why the bitcoin in some of these wallets are not moved. I will tell you that even if we enter bull run and get a new bitcoin ATH some wouldn’t sell still. Because the funds used to accumulate the bitcoins are not just funds they need now and that’s why even with the economic problem they still weren’t tempted to sell. With just 5 months or so left to the halving I doubt we will see much of bitcoin been sold. The only time I am expecting people to sell before bull run is of the ETF gets delayed or postponed again by the SEC because there some few new holders that have short time target believe it will be reach with just ETF approval and should it get delayed then they will pull out",

Most of them are not moved by FUD to dispose of their coins. They only sell when the price gets to their targeted price. $37,000 is a good price but I predict that the price of Bitcoin will exceed at least its ATH price, so there is still more ground to cover.

So of course most people wouldn't be selling this time around.I have not experienced any bitcoin halving but from what I have read so far this one looks unique because it might coincide with the approval of ETF. Most investors are expectant that next year has a better prospect for Bitcoin and this might be why the market didn't react to Binance's sanctions and Changpeng Zhao's guilty plea.",

They will sell most of their Bitcoins and keep the rest. They will buy Bitcoin again when there is a big correction after the price reaches its peak price.If you, for example, have had less than 10 BTC for a long time and held it until the price reached $60k, maybe you would sell 5BTC to convert it into fiat. You can have big profits while you still have BTC left. Meanwhile, you can buy Bitcoin again when the price drops drastically, as we have seen.Currently, people are waiting for a new ATH of Bitcoin and it is above $60k so they can sell it and get the profits. And they also do the same thing in altcoins that can rise high. They will also buy Bitcoin again if the price drops drastically because that can increase the amount of Bitcoin more than before because they have already made a big profit. Each person will have a plan to sell their Bitcoin or still hold Bitcoin.",
