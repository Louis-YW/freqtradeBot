Your story telling us that to be careful in protecting your seed phrases. It is really important to have more than one copy of the seed phrase and safe them in different safe places. We should also check that we have still access and use the seed phrase regularly. Your advice to not keep the seed phrase in one place is really good. By regularly checking our seed phrases we can reduce the risk of losing our money. I mostly safe the seed phrase on one place but by reading this story I have decided to safe my seed phrase in different places because being a human I can forget and can make any mistake like you have done.",

Although, i can not stress how important it is to keep abreast with key phases and passwords by checking often mostly as often as one gets to invest, because even the wallets or exchanges will have a reason to want to upgrade their systems or refresh and hence customers who may sometimes not see such notifications may be at the mercy of losing their coins because they failed to stay updated with the ever innovative blockchain network and exchanges wallets.",

If you are convinced that the first one that you lost access to due to relocation is not entirely destroyed, it's advisable for you to move out of the fund to a newer address. If you have not already done that, this is the only time you can consider yourself completely safe.

Once in a while, I usually go over the location where I keep my wallet to check if it's still intact, and the reason why I do check ones in a while is because I know that it's very safe where it's kept, and visiting it more regularly might even create the suspicion that very important stuff is kept there. Like you said, @OP, it's very wise for one to check their wallet phrase because there are also some external facts that can destroy the phrase, depending on the location where it's being kept. Some natural disasters, too, can affect the location where you hide your wallet.",

So on that note, I was able to make a rough sketch trying to explain on the good and bad ways of storing our seed phrase, so that if mistakenly it happens to get into the hand of a third party, they won't be able to know they are holding a seed phrase of a bitcoin wallet. This first image explains that while storing a wallet seed phrase, it's more advisable you do not write on the heading the word \"Wallet Seed phrase\" or the name of the wallet, but instead leave it blank, so that who ever happens to come across it will never know it is a wallet seed phrase, but if he/she is smart enough to know it's a seed phrase, he will not know which wallet it belongs to. (i.e Bluewallet, electrum Trust e.t.c). While secondly the words can be written either ascending or descending order, so that whoever finally figures out the wallet, will not know which order is the right order of words but only you alone.This second image also explains just like the first about how it's advisable to not also write on the heading the word \"Wallet Seed phrase\" or the name of the wallet, while the words can be written either vertically on ascending/descending order or in a diagonal form.",
