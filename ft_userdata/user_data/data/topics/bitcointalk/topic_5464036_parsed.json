Some people cares about winning first before passing KYC, it's cool you believe that you won't always win but the luck comes when we least expected. Imagine winning and you find it hard to pass KYC, trapping your money on the casino for like ever.It's not always the casinos fault, I know some are dubious but the thing is KYC verification is something you should first deal with before making your first deposit.Online casinos can be frustrating at times, some casino won't accept your submitted document even when you haven't make any deposit on the platform yet, so always confirm your identity first.Submit your identity and wait for approval, do not be in haste to make deposit first, because the identity you submitted without a green approval from the team can still be rejected, take your time to get the passed approval first before proceeding with gambling.",

It is good to pass KYC and then make deposit to safeguard the deposit amount.  I don't think there is any harm in doing KYC before playing as eventually you would be asked to do it sometime later by the casino.",

      "body": "This is not just the behavior of gamblers at casinos or casinos rejecting KYC after great wins. I have found out that on most occasions, it's always easier when someone newly registered on a platform that requires KYC to register that very moment or later before you even make any single deposit, as most platforms, after your money is in their hands, make your KYC process very uncomfortable. This is as a result of them having doubts about where your deposit actually came from, what your intentions are, or maybe they want to withhold your funds( that's for the platforms that are not transparent). We most often just care less about things that are very essential and can cause us issues in the near future.",

When registering take your time to read T&S properly so that you will know your next step if it is to continue with your registration or not. As for KYC,I have seen it that it is now mandatory for gamblers to submit KYC before they will be given full access to withdraw any funds either win or deposit that is big from the casino. Therefore, we shouldn't see the KYC as a barrier that will hinder us from cashing out or to have issues with the casino when it is necessary. Don't deposit only when you have submitted your KYC and have been verified by the casino,if not you might be faced some some challenges in the nearest future.",

But for those that wants to stick to a single casino it’s always best to look for a reputable casino that you can trust with your details and complete your kyc verification, but in some cases some uncertain suspicion could also make the casino request for an urgent verification before you can request withdrawal from a casino so in those case verifying kyc before using them is not fixable.",

A reputable casino will never do this kind of cheap trick and there’s always an arbitrage platform to handle case like this to prove who’s telling the truth between the casino and players.

Wouldn't even get the idea of doing KYC later, this only opens the door for problem, better to safe yourself the trouble.Some site though, when asking, say something like \"we don't require KYC for the moment, this can change in the future though\". If a site refuses to do KYC before making the first deposit it is easy to just skip this site, because this is very strange behaviour in my opinion. What would be the reason to not wanting o verify who you customers are if not you are thinking this is a disadvantage for your company.Some site speculate for deposits and in case you are winning they throw the multi account or whatever ban hammer at you. If you do KYC before that, you can pretty much prevent this. So always do it, if they refuse, just play somewhere else.",

As much as possible, limit your identity exposure to online gambling sites. Stick to reputable ones.",

I agree that the player who have huge bankroll should submit and complete their KYC as soon as possible, but the ones who have a small bankroll and they are going to begin with less than $1000 should start gambling one any reputed casino without much worries. If you know that you're someone who will play huge bets then go and complete the KYC before putting any money, but if you are a normal gambler with small bank balance then ignore the burden of KYC first and focus on increasing your balance first.",

Maybe after reading this post I will reconsider myself and begin to complete kyc where necessary.
