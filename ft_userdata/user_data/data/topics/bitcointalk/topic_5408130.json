I think the only one confused here is actually you.I never said that there are other crypto forums that I would recommend to new members, but other places on the internet with legitimate information. It is a general statement in response to the previously stated claim.This is generally known information anyway, but it is better to be recommended by people who use other sites on a daily basis. It makes no sense to claim that this forum is the only legitimate place on the Internet to learn about crypto. In fact, mk4 already mentioned other legit crypto sites in English and I have nothing else to add. I don't see the need for overreactions.I never make recommendations lightly, without careful thought and fact-checking.",

I think you can take a look at the list from these available sources: https://bitcoin.org/en/communityFrom the sources above I can say that bitcointalk.org is a great site for the community. Here we are not only talking about ideas, developments, trading, wallets but there are many other things that can also be discussed including politics, law and legality and this is perfect for beginners who are improving their knowledge.",

Instead, you open new topics one after another, probably in a desperate search to get merits, which is not in line with good forum etiquette and not a good way to introduce yourself.

It's no surprising OP has bee attached to the forum for over 2months, has got 2merits to show for it and evn though the forum has ranked OP to Jr. Member, OP still thinks of himself or herself as a newbie. Well practically, from band new - Member rank could be regarded as newbies, even though we've got a specific noted rank as that.Anyway, I think instead of creating threads such as this @OP, you should be engaged on reading more to grasps what you forum is chiefly about and then, you could come up with some new ideas out of the limitations on the threads you encounter on the forum and also some recent developments around you, in the wilder world and breaking news as well.
