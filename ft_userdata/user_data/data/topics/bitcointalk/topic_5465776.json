  "content": "With the recent congestion on the blockchain network. I have a pending transaction for few days which I didn’t notice that is still pending until now. I use 9 sat/vB transaction fee which is close to the current purging range of 8 sat/vB.My question is how long does it take to purge my transaction when it falls on the range of purge and will my initial transaction fee will be refunded along with my original sent amount?I'm planning to just purge it and wait for the refund if the fee will be refunded too since I'm not interested anymore to spend my Bitcoin now that I already covered using my fiat money the expenses that supposed to be use of my Bitcoin.",

Once it is successful the transaction hash will show up.I don't know if you can able to get the raw/hex code from the trust wallet but if you aren't able to get it from that wallet then try to get the raw/hex code from blockchair by accessing your transaction hash follow the instructions below this guide only works if the transaction is not yet rejected by blockchair nodes.- Go to https://blockchair.com- Paste the TX hash then enter- Scroll down you can find the \"Raw TX\" at the bottom and then copy the hex code- Then paste it to any PushTX sites below to rebroadcast the transaction.- https://www.viabtc.com/tools/broadcast- https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/assets/btc/broadcast-transaction- https://coinb.in/#broadcast- https://blockstream.info/tx/push",

I try to rebroadcast my transaction using blockchain.com transaction broadcast and I encounter an error written below.In OP, you said that \"I'm not interested anymore to spend my Bitcoin now\". Why did you try to rebroadcast the transaction, if you don't want it to be confirmed?All nodes that use the default setting will drop your transaction if the purging fee rate increases to more than 9 sat/vbyte. It's also possible that they drop your transaction due to staying unconfirmed for 14 days. With rebroadcasting your transaction, you cause nodes to receive the transaction again.",

There’s a suggestion above that the transaction will only dropped quickly if I rebroadcast the transaction or else it will not be purged even if my transaction falls on the purging range. I just want to make sure that will be purgedonce it’s on the range. Maybe I understand it differently but my is to drop my transaction asap when it falls on the purging range or meet the 14 days whichever comes first. I have problem rebroadcasting my transaction. It gives me an error shows that it needs to atleast have 1 input which I don’t have any idea. Anyway, I will lock now this thread and just patiently wait on whenever it will be confirmed. Thanks everyone.",
