It is possible but I don't see that much excitement in this topic from the community as of now. Play to earn for them seems like a child's play similar to hunting faucets at one time. On the other hand this concept can be utilised in a better manner but I am yet to see any.Bigger names taking up crypto realted stuff does face a lot of backlash so I guess it would be worth watching, maybe in near future.However if it does not generate a market, the games will die down.",

What? Why would they leave first class developers for hunting pennies? I personally think that in the future there are jobs inside games that can make you money. Or there's just ad revenue enough for poeple to make money in online games. People don't seem to understand that players are already trading skins and stuff in different games and those are not nfts.So basically they already have a system to make money. NFTs is just a one way to do it and p2e isnt just for cryptos, it reeks more like a desperation move for crypto games to get more players as their games are not good enough by themselves.",

Right now not any new concept with play to earn games launching and seems not interested yet from investor want to try get loss for second time.Better don't try for joining and spent much money to purchase with NFTs play to earn games because all new games concept finally their coins drop and loss chance to earn back our capital.

Honestly, P2E like other junk trends in the market, other than generating tokens for pumping and dumping, doesn't give us any benefit. The concept of P2E is great, but we can still exploit its full potential. In the future, if traditional game publishers can exploit and find a way to combine the two, it is indeed a market that will bring huge profits.",

Maybe the hype is gone already? we all know that projects here are based on who is the first, who developed the concept and what we call prime mover. So in any case that the prime mover is still on top, then it's hard to topple it. But there is a catch, it is also what we call hype.So if the hype is gone and there is a new one in the horizon, then maybe P2E might be dead or doesn't have the consensus and support of the community then. Just like what we have seen, after the success of Axie, there are a lot of copycats but they didn't get the success of Axie.",

I personally have the feeling, that the whole play 2 earn and metaverse topic is not the hottest thing anymore in the crypto space. This was totally different like 1 or 2 years ago when projects like Axies Infinity or Bloktopia gave early investors huuuuge profits and then all the copy cats came as usual. I am a gamer myself and of course it would be a dream to make money while doing the thing that i like, but i also think that this is pretty hard to do, because i would guess that only 5 or 10% of the total playerbase could really make a good income from a play 2 earn game that is payed from the other 95% of players. That every player makes money with a play 2 earn game is just not possible.",

Large companies that earn hundreds of millions of dollars from computer games are in no hurry to add cryptocurrencies to their business.

I believe the model of Microsoft and Sony will still stand the test of time, the reason being that the quality of games in the blockchain space is still  low, so for blockchain games to compete in the big league, they need to start to deliver quality games to the players, most people playing games to enjoy it and have fun and  do not care about tokens but the quality of the graphics and the storyline",

When it comes to Play-to-Earn (P2E), we're talking about concepts. This concept is truly revolutionary, but will gamers leave Sony's or Microsoft's games behind? I do not think so. It should be remembered that game players on well-known consoles are not looking to make money there, their goal is to play for fun, not to make money. But as for Blockchain implementation itself, most likely game companies will implement it in the future, but it's not about P2E, more about the real distribution of items in the game.",

I don't know at this time there have been a lot of P2E games that are not clear in my opinion and most of the time P2E games are very boring to play.but no one knows the future, maybe these P2E games will be able to develop even better in terms of game quality, prizes received and more importantly a game that must also be enjoyed not just to chase prizes.",

Because of the sudden breakdown of the market, even the most popular game have lie low on it and there has something to do with the management IMO.

I dont think these company giants would go phase out soon or would be eradicated or would really be closing up their doors.Yes, play to earn is something that interesting since you could really make money but we should really tend to look again that it does really need out an investment to make money or earn, which means that this isnt really for everybody and we know that we do havethat different market or audience.We should consider that not all is fully aware about these P2E which means that it wouldnt really be that significant to consider out on phasing these companies because demand would be always there.",
