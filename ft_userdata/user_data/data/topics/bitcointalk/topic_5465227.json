They can give you references to those threads and after reading a useful thread you can judge the topic by 100 views because there will so many comments on the thread and opinions by different users, This is what I like most about the forum. Its time taking but more efficient. In other way you can ask for the topics after getting engaged with he discussion on any thread, most of the times if senior finds the repitive topic they give the other references as well.Enjoy you journey.",
