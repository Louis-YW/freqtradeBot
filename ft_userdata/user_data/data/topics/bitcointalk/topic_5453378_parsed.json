  "content": "The official reason for why the Finance Minister of Pakistan wants to ban and never legalize the cryptospace in their country is to remove Pakistan from a FATF grey list. However, the skeptical me thinks this might not be the only reason. Pakistan has a pending approval for a bailout from the IMF and the IMF does not like crypto hehe. We also know what has happened to much of these bailouts. The corrupt people at the top enjoy it, while the tax payers at the bottom pay for it very much similar to what the bankers did in the 2007 financial crisis hehehehe.Cryptocurrencies will “never be legalized in Pakistan,” said Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha to the country's Senate Standing Committee on Finance on Wednesday, according to local reports.The minister said that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had set a condition that cryptocurrency will not be legalized to keep it off the international finance watchdog's so-called \"Grey List,\" according to one local news outlet, and another said Pakistan's stated position is because it goes against the conditions set by the FATF.Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/18/pakistan-announces-fresh-ban-on-crypto-but-adoption-as-a-hedge-remains-popular/In any case, this is very much the opposite of what Bukele is doing in El Salvador. I used to laugh and shake my head at Bukele because being the skeptical me, I thought he was only larping. I have now come to respect him.",

Policy discussions have mostly focused on the first aspect, but we believe the second should receive just as much attention.As a monetary instrument, CBDC provides safety; it alleviates counterparty risks and provides liquidity in payments. But as infrastructure, CBDC could bring interoperability and efficiency among private networks for digital money and even assets.Payments could be made from one private money to another, through the CBDC ledger or platform. Money could be escrowed on the CBDC platform, then released when certain conditions are met, such as when a tokenized asset is received. And the CBDC platform could offer a basic programming language to ensure smart contracts are trusted and compatible with one another. That too will become a public good in tomorrow’s digital world.…Of course these fuckers will want to ban crypto. It is because they want to eliminate any competition. They are fine with stealing all the tech from these open-source projects and then they ban them. That’s now fair.",

For many years the bankers wanted a legitimate way to run the government, so they introduced the Federal Reserve System in the US. It is the same in all countries, central banks are not subordinate to the government. Kennedy wanted to change that, and he was assassinated. In Russia, Putin wanted to subordinate the Central Bank to the government, but he did not succeed (this was at the beginning of his career).The situation is similar in other countries.Of course, such legislation is applied in the interests of the ruling class.",

The people desire to be free to make their choices in financial matters. But the government will always want to control its citizens to take more money from them through diverse means. Pakistan might not be the last country to regulate cryptocurrency. Many countries still rely on IMF and the World Bank for financial assistance. And it is becoming very clear every day that one of the major criteria to access loans and grants is to stay clear of cryptocurrencies.",

There are many enthusiasts and lovers of Bitcoin in Pakistan and some people like Waqar Zaka have been trying their best to legitimize crypto-currencies and particularly Bitcoin in the country, but the political powers do not listen to the ones whom they dislike. The voice of Waqar Zaka and many other enthusiasts is ignored by the political powers of the country and thus no one even takes any good actions regarding legitimization of the crypto-currencies.The situation is different this time in the country because when IMF and FATF orders anything to Pakistan, the government of Pakistan obeys it without rethinking. The government mainly does that because there's a lot of debt on it because they have taken many loans from IMF, and the other reason is the FATF.  The FATF has kept Pakistan in Blacklist for many years and now they're keeping it in grey list, the government's initiative is to get is accepted in the whitelist and for that they will do anything that would make them to have a place in that list.",

I used to laugh and shake my head at Bukele because being the skeptical me, I thought he was only larping. I have now come to respect him.This is a good point... I initially thought Bukele just got taken advantage of by social media influencers but (I'm pretty sure anyway) someday investing heavily in Bitcoin and related infrastructure will pay off for El Salvador. He had the balls to do something completely different, totally outside the norm for a world leader, and that's commendable.Banning crypto in 2023 is just a way to backwardize your citizens, an example of the state putting their own interests above those of the people.QuotePakistan's rupee slid 3.3% to an all-time low against the dollar of 300 per greenback last week, Bloomberg reported...\"I suspect that many people are buying USDT on crypto platforms as a way to get exposure to the US dollar,\" (chairman of KTrade Securities, Khwaja) said. \"Even Bitcoin has performed well against the Pakistani Rupee. During the crypto run, reportedly more than 20 million Pakistanis had opened accounts on crypto platforms.\"",

      "body": "@nutildah. The only problem of Bukele is being very open on his support for bitcoin by making it legal tender. This has caused him much problems with the IMF because it put the government of El Salvador in a position where it cannot get more cashflow but the IMF can lobby on policies because of cashflow given in the past.In any case, I am skeptical of this new adviser hehehe. What is a former IMF official advising on the government of El Salvador?El Salvador has tapped a former International Monetary Fund official as an adviser as it seeks a deal with the multilateral lender, according to people familiar with the matter.Alejandro Werner, who retired as head of the Western Hemisphere Department at the IMF in 2021, has been working with the Central American nation’s government this year, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.Source https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/former-imf-official-werner-said-to-advise-el-salvador-on-dealAnother problem for Bukele is the election on February 2024. His political rivals will certainly get the funding from the bankers outside and inside El Salvador.",

The great Pakistani politicians are the beneficiaries of all this and fill their pockets with corrupt political money while the Pakistani people suffer from poverty.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have opened a window to some financial freedom for many poor people around the world, but this does not appeal to governments, central banks or corrupt politicians.",

I reckon maybe one of the highest in the whole of Asia and they do not want to complicate this by having the cryptospace enter this.However, they have a bigger problem. It will be very hard for the government to enforce any type ban outside of on and off ramps. People can trade very much similarly like they do in China.",

I won't be surprised if some users decide to stop using crypto if they don't want to even try P2P trading. Maybe we can encourage them or give them help, but it is not possible if they don't even use this forum. Since the main reason they decide to impose a ban is to avoid getting sidelined by other major orgs, I guess we just need to see when the superpower decides the time to pump their bags has come and slowly allow retail to use crypto again.",

The prohibition policy does not work, you can easily open a company in the Emirates and engage in legal activities or use the services of decentralized exchanges.Moscow has the largest shadow market for cryptocurrencies. If you tell me another place where you can exchange tens of millions of dollars for cryptocurrencies in a day and back without problems without documents, I will be grateful.This works because there are certain agreements between illegal money changers with the police and other agencies. If they close these illegal exchangers, then in a month there will be others that will work on safer protocols, through hiding places, couriers and will not cooperate with the police. The number of crimes will only increase.",
