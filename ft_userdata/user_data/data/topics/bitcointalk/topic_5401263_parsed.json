  "content": "If the casino is provably fair, you can take the server seed, the user seed, and the nonce to see the result of the next X shots. This process is called bet verification. But we can't use it to predict the next results on the casino because the server seed is hidden, and the right way to see the real seed is by requesting a new hidden one to make public the past one.Thinking about that I developed a site where we can get the result of N bets using the same provably fair from the casino Just-Dice.And there is a section where you can find some Bots to run on the casino.This is just the first step of the project, I would like to discuss with the gambling community what features should I include and what casinos you will like to be able to run simulations.Source: https://justdice.lucky.lat/NOTES:*I know the perfect bot doesn't exist and all of them will get busted in the long run because that's what house edge does.*The faucet and the casino have Adfly links as a way to monetize the site, but users don't need to see those adds for running the Simulator or see the Bot Codes.",

This will help players to verify their games results on an independent third party verifier.I tried to crosscheck the results I got from your website with results from other verifiers (RGBkey and provablyfair.meand they match. So, this tool works perfectly. I suggest you contact just-dice.com ad ask them to add your tool to their list of verifiers (there are already four of them).On other verifiers, I noticed they ask for the hash of the server seed. I suggest you add this option too since it will help to confirm that the seed hash matches the seed.",

Well, I'll stick with what you stated, house edge does kill bettors regardless of the strategy we will use, so I thought it's very important to enjoy the game and personally I would just use the conventional way. The best feature is the bet verification as that would make us confident that gambling sites are not cheating us.",

Hey DoublerHunter, as you mention, Seuntjies bot is an awesome tool, but I don't like the fact that it only runs on WindowsÂ   while the codes i share work directly on the explorer.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on June 04, 2022, 10:27:22 PMInteresting concept for a gambling bot could be perhaps making one very hidden and impossible to detect?.You don't need to hide the bot, it can be blocked if your bets come too fast, but in my experience, i have done more than 40,000 bets and haven't gotten banned. A lot of users in JD run bots, is like a normal feature for them :p And what you can do is to hide your bets from other users if you want to bet with privacy.
