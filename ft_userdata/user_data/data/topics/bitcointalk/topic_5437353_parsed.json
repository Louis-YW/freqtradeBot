  "content": "I was discussing with a friend yesterday and he said the weather was too hot and decided to get a cold soda. I told him to get cold water instead of the soda, he told me he can't do that. So I asked him how many has he taken, he told me two bottles for the day. From what he said, he is now addicted to soda, anytime sun comes out or when there is heat, he feels like taking a bottleSo I advised him to try as much as possible to avoid it because of the devastating effect it has on him. The surprising thing he asked me was that, is sugar not healthy? Where do we derive the energy we use?So I started by explaining the little way I can.In terms of energy, the rice, pounded yam, beans, green plantain, garri all contain carbohydrates which when taken, your body breaks it down to glucose in your mouth (partly) or your small intestine and the glucose is utilized by your cellsThe sugar you take is sucrose which is a combination of glucose and fructose. Your cells easily use this glucose but it doesn't utilize this fructose. The fructose is metabolized by your liver. When you consume load of food that contains fructose, you put work on your liver and it starts converting it to fat (lipogenesis)The big question is, where does the fat go? Do we excrete the fat out of our body or is it been used later? The truth is that the fat (triglycerides) produced is deposited at the closeby adipose tissue (fat tissue) close to your belly causing pot belly or it causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (excess fat stored in the liver cells)You might want to ask, what about fruits because fruit contains fructose? The fructose found is natural are not like the type they put in beverages, ice cream, carbonated or any processed drink. The fructose used in industries is High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) which is a liquid derived from corn starch. What they do is to use a little quantity of this extract and they get the results that they need as what you consume. You may want to ask, what is the purpose of putting this content in drinks?The truth is, glucose is not as sweet as fructose. Among the types of sugar, fructose is the sweetest and the artificial HFCS is supersweet. This is only way they can make you get addicted to the drink because when consuming fructose, it activates a reward centre in your brain making you have more cravings (begging for more). The glucose is not the problem but the supersweet content (HFCS) in the drinks is the problem and pose a threat on your liver and kidneys.This is the level I can explain it to the best of my capability. I know it will be hard to stop taking these substance but you have to stop. These companies know what they are doing, avoid it all all cost or you...Sourcehttps://www.facebook.com/100039975201246/posts/pfbid0tscUAcLiQA8174eVpmK16CHXPAoi98wCLgZ4DRt5Y6aF6LNeVqbPbyndGx5ZGx97l/?app=fblLet's try as much as we can to take our health seriously and learn to avoid certain sweetened substances, for they only get sweet in the mouth, but have you asked yourself, does it also sit well with our stomach. It's only one life we have let's guide it with care, for we know we can't live forever but we can live for long here on earth if we prioritize our health the way we do with money.",

As we grow older, it is expected that you exercise moderation and cut down on those things you eat, habits or activities you engaged in without concern while you were younger. Sweetened things are very much included especially if you have a family history of people that sugar excess has caused health problems and challenges. As you grow older, be more concerned about living healthy.",
