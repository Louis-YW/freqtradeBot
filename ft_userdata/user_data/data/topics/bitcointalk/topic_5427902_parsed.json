I remember trezor also partnered with changenow, integrated their exchange in their platform and had a stance of no-responsibility hence why I assumed.Could you tell us more about how this partnership (in your case) works? Am I correct to assume that user deposits go to a non-changenow handled wallet? Would it not be possible for changenow to collect user data from ppl who use your exchange? by user data, I do not necessarily mean personal documents as it could also be addresses used.",

I appreciate you are working on supporting no-kyc policy, but you should be more careful with your promises and claims.It's not totally impossible to imagine that some hackers could try to convert that amount of stolen coins using your website and changeNOW exchange.I am interested to know what would happen in that case, and are you using some third party exchanges other than changeNOW?You should also add more information if you are saving IP addresses and all other details from your custoemrs. I compared your rates with other similar instant exchanges, and I am getting much lower rates on your website.Maybe you could contact owners of kycnot.me website, so they could test and rate your website.",

If this is true, then this is not considered money laundering?Overall it's good to develop the possibility of exchange although I think it's too early, you were showing yourself as an alternative to Preev which means it's a simple site to display the price of bitcoin.Perhaps, after gaining trust, you can perform the exchange, but instead of using changeNOW, it provides the user with the ability to use more than one exchange platform from the same site.",
