Buy little by little but don't displeased yourself to buy bitcoin.The investment you make now will definitely bear fruit in the future. Honestly, I'm quite jealous of you who can invest in Bitcoin every week, because I can't do that. At least I can only invest once a month due to limited funds. Hopefully I can increase the value of my investment in the future.",

Buy little by little but don't displeased yourself to buy bitcoin.Absolutely, holding onto Bitcoin long-term can be a wise investment strategy, especially if you believe in the future potential of the cryptocurrency. Enduring through bear markets and not panicking when prices dip is a strong indicator of a committed and confident investor. Remember, patience is key in investing, and it's important to stick to your long-term goals. Best of luck in your investment journey, and don't forget that when others panic, it's often the best time to buy.",

There might be some gatekeepers out there (or even here, I am not sure) that will tell you that you are not a \"tRuE BitCoIneR\" if you don't have these amount of Bitcoin in your wallet.I've been into that situation with my past friends.",
