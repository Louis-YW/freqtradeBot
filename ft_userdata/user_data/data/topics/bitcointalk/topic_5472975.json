A Telegram bot that sends you notifications every time someone:- Sends you a merit.- Mentions your username on the forum- Replies to your posts or quotes them.- Replies to topics you want to follow.- Creates a new thread in a board you want to track.- Creates a new post (if you want to follow them).etc...I know that some people don't use Telegram, so this means my bot isn't usable by them.Now the question: Is there is demand for those notifications outside Telegram? Would you use a website, setup email or browser notifications, etc... for all the stuff I wrote above?",

Will the person be required to use their personal email to communicate with the bot, or will it be done in any way? I was just asking out of curiosity, although people can just create one email for the purpose of this. and I think email will be more active than that of the website since they will receive the notification just like every other mail box, but for the website, how many seconds will it take to synchronise and send a new notification all the time, or will the browser need to be open in order for it to come in?Â After the telegram, I will also vote for email; those who want to make use of it will know their best choice and what will serve them better.",

I think it would be much better if a bot like yours can be packaged into a chrome extension so anyone can use it even without Telegram.",

Although something notifications may dalay (Due to network issue) but it is doing more then enough.Apart from telegram bot, how do you propose an alternative solution? If you use a website, will it be able to give us push notification like telegram does. I don't have knowledge in that side so I don't know. And 2nd if you try extension, when the browser is closed how are we suppose to get notifications?Maybe you should build your own open source app to run the bot. Off course, if you have the skills and knowledge for that. I'm using it through telegram at this moment and I'm satisfied with it.",

I think what we need is a dedicated notifications section for stuff like that in the forum directly. I've had lapses with replying to comments made under my posts/replies and that is mostly because there's no reliable way for me to receive notifications when people do so. I wish a feature like such could be made to make it easier for people within this forum, but at the same time the Supernotifier is a good enough alternative that I don't see any reason why we should have a dedicated website for it. If we could create a website that's specifically just for notifications, why not urge the bitcointalk devs to instead make the feature within the forum itself as with any other forum?",

If we can have an extension, an extension for our browsers that simply notifies us when any of the above-mentioned activity appears in the forum, it will be a fantastic tool for people who are not on Telegram.",

Yes, I would love to receive my Bitcointalk notifications directly on Bitcointalk.org.I mean, if you're asking for preferences, Yes I would prefer outside telegram notifications, but within the Bitcointalk.org website itself. For example, if there's a Chrome extension like this:I would love to have it. But I wouldn't want browser notifications outside of Bitcointalk.org. Notifications that pop up whether or not you're using a specific website can be quite annoying.",
