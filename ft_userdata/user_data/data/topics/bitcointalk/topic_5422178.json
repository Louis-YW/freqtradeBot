  "content": "It depends on how the owner treats it. I was really pondering on this and decided to share to know what others feel about this. If Bitcoin is preferably kept in Centralised exchange i think it is no longer decentralised to the owner because the don't have the keys to unlock and spend their coin but rather the rely on this third party intermediaries who decide how much the are eligible to transfer depending on their KYC verification level.I believe private keys is what makes every Bitcoin owner decentralised not just the coin itself so if CEX is preferred over DEX and hardware wallets specifically open sourced wallets then the idea of centralised slavery is what should be dealt with. The fear of misplacing seed phrase and private keys is still a big concern to many who believe they are careless with storing and keeping important datas.In my opinion if decentralisation were to be a coin then no matter where it is stored it should be accessible no matter what happens, even if the exchange fails. But because it is dependent on where the coin is stored then it is what the coin owner makes of it. It is decentralised for non-custodial wallets holders as the can always prove the coins are theirs anytime and centralised for custodial wallet holders because the can only access their funds if the are well verified and provided the exchange hasn't collapsed.",

The use of centralized exchanges and custodial wallet is not bitcoin, what is basically about bitcoin is the blockchain, running full node, mining and what is not centralized, like noncustodial wallets. Everything about bitcoin supposed to be trustless, but what people know these days is to depend on someone before try can own bitcoin, when they only just have to depend on themselves.Mr A has bitcoin, wanted to send to Mr B, that should be in a transaction which require miner to include the transaction in a block. If they use a centralized exchange or a custodial wallet, all what that would be done by the exchange or wallet is to just edit the number and no transaction occur on blockchain.

This is how Binance and any other Centralized Exchange works.  As a trader, particularly as a daytrader, you are looking for speed of actions.  You need everything to happen in one click.  So instead of every transaction happening on the Bitcoin chain, all you get is just the e-mails that your trade has been complete and the notification on the screen.  If you try to look any Binance or Coinbase transaction up on the Blockchain, except withdrawals and deposits, they are all nonexistent.If every Coinbase and Binance transaction happened on chain.  Sometimes you will have to wait hours for a single trade.  And I can not even imagine how clogged Bitcoin's mempool would be.  Imagine the mempool during a panic in the market.  They would likely need to use a second layer solution to make things easier on the Bitcoin Blockchain.If you are not in a hurry and do not care how quickly the Exchange orders fill you can easily use Bisq to fulfill your needs, but if you are and need to immediately swap funds then you will need a Centralized Exchange to work with.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Just as ETFbitcoin explained it, no transaction on blockchain because both Mr A and B coins are owned by the same centralized exchange on the blockchain, so the exchange just edit the number for them, no on-chain transaction.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 19, 2022, 09:21:33 AMBut from regular user perspective, accessing custodial wallet from browser and smartphone app are 2 different things even though both rely on centralized server. And i'm not even sure all custodial service also offer built-in exchange.Even if we should refer to custodial wallet, we supposed not to use exchange but wallet, that's a mistake from me. But what I meant was that the custodial wallets are web based, even if using their app. Or is it not like that? Any app that do not have the function to give some information intrinsically but rely purely on the web are web based.",

If a person is afraid of losing the passphrase, that is, if he understands his fears, then what is he worried about? What does he do in ordinary life? He does his best to protect what is important to him. Finally, if three archives of saving his phrases are not enough for the paranoid, he will make thirty-three. I mean, if we understand the danger, then we can prepare and protect ourselves.I still think the OP has some translation difficulties.

Refer to the following scenarios:A. if you sent your bitcoin to yourself/others to a non-custodial wallet like MyCelium.  B. If you sent your bitcoin to yourself/others to a centralized exchange (meaning, has the key of the wallet = custodial) like Binance.
