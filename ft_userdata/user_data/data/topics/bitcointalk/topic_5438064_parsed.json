It could even happen unintentionally, as a result of data they amass that one may not be aware of, which can eventually get leaked. Hell, you’ve even got to be wary of text prediction options.Follow the above links to see some interesting reads on the matter, that depict why it is not a good idea to use alternative keyboards on your phone.It’s not just a question of finding the keyboard to import your recovery seed, but rather being conscious that, when privacy and valuables are at stake, the less (crap one installs) is always going to turn out being the better.",

However, most phones have their own developed keyboards that can be used with them if found convenient.(it means if used to comfortable).",

Since the one that came with my phone is buggy what do you think I should do now? First I wouldn't keep any serious Bitcoin amount on any mobile wallet, especially if you are using standard android smartphone that is always connected to internet.Acceptable option would be to use your old phone offline as a part of multisig setup, or phone that is connected with your hardware wallet.In that case you won't have to worry about keyboard app you are using, but I would strongly suggest using some open source keyboard app with de-googled phone.",

Since the one that came with my phone is buggy what do you think I should do now? My contribution is this, 1. you should use only smart phone inbuilt keyboard2. You need to revoke the downloaded keyboard and restore back to mobile phone defaults.3. If you use clipboard; with the downloaded keyboard then you should create a new wallet and move your assets (safety first)4. Do not use copy and paste (clipboard) when importing your seed to a new crypto currency wallet; instead you should type out the words one after the other until the phase is complete.Finally, since your mobile phone is buggy, back up the device and restore to factory settings; then watch the bugs disappearRemember to keep your seed phrase safe",

Since the one that came with my phone is buggy what do you think I should do now? If you are scared about this kind of thing why don't you only use your smartphone as a watch only wallet? You wouldn't have to take care of those issues. Another way to circumvent potential flaws is to use it as multisig wallet along with another device(computer, tablet, other smartphone,...) as it has been suggested. But if you have a critical amount of funds it's not recommended to use a smartphone as your main wallet because besides IT security, your smartphone can be stolen or you can get extorted in the street by nasty people knowing it.",

Since the one that came with my phone is buggy what do you think I should do now? Like the post above, third-party keyboard software will reveal your detail also. better to avoid the third-party keyboard and uninstall it if inside your phone. I suggest, You buy an external keyboard which can connect to Bluetooth phone or if more safety buy a keyboard which can connect to USB type c > example: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=keyboard+for+android&ref=nb_sb_nossFriend, many scammer out there are watching you, if you have a lot of cryptos, better to use laptop or PC and save it as air gap device or use it for transaction with hardware wallet and etc. As I know, the phone is just a live spy who always watches your life, don't save anything on your phone, you have noted it.",

Famous Chinese phone brands like OPPO, Xiaomi, and Lenovo... are all popular around the world, and I haven't heard anyone complain about them being unsafe to use. Depending on the item, not all Chinese goods are fake, don't forget iPhone and Samsung factories are mostly located in China.",

Since the one that came with my phone is buggy what do you think I should do now? It's either you purchase a new original phone with a good inbuilt keyboard or you try to download Gboard (not recommended though)and try if suites you.From what I know, you don't have to type the full words when inputting your secret phrases, most wallet nowadays bring out suggestions as soon as you start typing the secret phrase so even if your phone's keyboard is buggy as you said in Op it can still work, all you gat to do is just type the first three letter and you'll see so many suggestions to choose from and I for one think this is better than copying the entire secret phrase and pasting them. Op, by the way,.I hope you're not using the mobile phone you're using to store your coin for other things? Because once you start to use it as a multi-purpose phone it increase the risk of the phone being infested with malware and then you won't have to only worry about your keyboard alone.",

To be honest, I wouldn't hold a lot of money on a phone, regardless of a brand. A good rule of thumb is to spend 1% of your money on securing the rest. If you're holding $1000 it doesn't really matter if it's a phone or desktop but if it's 100 000 you better have some security and good habits when it comes to browsing and downloading stuff.
