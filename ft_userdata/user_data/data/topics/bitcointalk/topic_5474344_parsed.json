Most times if you are with your female partner you'll discover that you always forget issier than them.  Maybe the last time you went out for fun, the last time you both have good times together, going to parties/clubs and maybe the last time you celebrate your birthday. Sometimes the promises you made the fight you both had and how you resolved it. The cases you had with your brother, sister, uncle, Father and mother and the exact date.  Sometimes I start woundering if women memory card are 1terabite that makes them to have such a retentive memory. But men they easily forget even when they had their hair cuts😂Why do dey have such a retentive memory?",

Therefore I do not agree with this opinion and things related to memory are more personal.",

Unlike with men, the stress is on us, we work daily and even overtime to our works and that adds to the stress.And as result, it goes to affect our brain and we become quick to forget things so it's all about the situation that we're with. Some women are also quick to forget if they are in the same situation as us like being the breadwinner and having a stressful day in work.",

From my study women always put there minds in unnecessary things. Just like a guy will be working and planning on how to make money and start up a business, build houses, buy car, marry a good wife, have kids,fly overseas and leave a comfortable life. Women will be browsing the latest shoes, latest wig or human hair to fix, latest iPhone, latest clothes,hand bags and other unnecessary things which dey don have money. More often they visit you just to check on you if you are staying with someone else. Instead of coming with a free mind, they always believed that since they are not with you, You are just cheating on them and they can go any length to prove irelivant things.",

On the other hand main has a lot of work they have family pressure official pressure etc at a time it effect on their brain and the forget about small things that's the reason women have more relevant memory.",

We work in our office every day, here we have to work with our head all day, it increases our brain stress. And after finishing the office we have to fulfill the responsibilities of our daily life. After all, our brain does not stop for a period of time, it affects our brain, so our memory is reduced. As a result we forget some things quickly.",

Lots of time women who do not  have too much turbulent live are usually top in their classes, it's most likely because they believe whatever they are taught more than the opposite gender while the men would apply critical thinking for the information that may contradict reality,  If there are contradictions that do not please them, the information becomes more difficult to stick in their mindsIt's much easier for information (whether good or evil) to stick on your mind if you enjoy consuming and accepting it as truth.",

But what about women who are the bread winner of their families whom work very hard to feed there family and also maintain there thinking faculty, what will you say about such people? And there some men who don't work very hard but yet they still find it difficult to think deeply like women what are you going to say about them?",
