I'm sure there are a lot of active cameras to connect the dots and figure out where they're hiding [there might also be fingerprints that matches someone with a history].Here are some of the websites that are connected to this specific type of scam [unfortunately, the last two are still active]:- I haven't completely checked all of the sources (#1, #2, #3, #4 and #5), so there might be more!coinstampwallet.comdeficode.onlineblockprint.onlinepaymetic.onlineprintkeywallet.com [archived]openchain.online [archived]",

Also drainers on eth addresses! OMG! People are doing crypto tutorials and leaking their private keys only to misslead new people to import their address into their trust wallet or whatever. Extremly easy scam!Binance addresses given away in tutorials are being funded daily by people doing these kind of mistakes, if you want a clue of how phenomena works",

Most of these people are in a very difficult financial situation, so they are ready to believe scammers and still take loans at the direction of scammers. Reminder will not be superfluous.
