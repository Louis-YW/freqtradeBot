From what I understand I'll try to explain the highlighted part: (it might not be correct though)Since Bitcoin transaction is not completely anonymous and anyone who has your wallet address can easily check your balance and also all your previous transactions, now to avoid that you can create a new key pair for any transaction you do or perhaps you can use some wallet that generate new public address so that every new transaction you want to make the person receiving can send different public address to different people and still receive their transaction into the same wallet without them being able to track the transactions of others. Although with some advance knowledge some might be able to trace and link all addresses together.So to provide more privacy it's not advisable to reuse addresses you can simply generate new public address with the same private key and use.

(means assume i created 5 addresses and i sent 20coins in one addresses than when i will check those 4 left addresses which are not used in payments then also they will show incoming transaction of 20coins?) or I'm feeling like i am totally wrong .",

Address AAddress BAddress CAddress DIf you sent let's say 0.5 Bitcoin into Address A and 1 Bitcoin into Address C.If you scan your Address A on any explorer your balance will be 0.5 Bitcoin, if you do the same for Address B,C and D you see 0 Bitcoin, 1 Bitcoin and 0 Bitcoin respectively.  But if you import your wallet you'll see your complete 1.5 Bitcoin there. It's just a means of improving your privacy. Wallet like Electrum and mycelium helps you generate public addresses so you don't have to kill yourself over it.",

If you use the a single address for any current and future transaction or any transaction you are going to make, it reduces the privacy you can get.

If there are two parties sending you a coin to a single address it means you are reusing an address. It is generally a good idea to use a new address for each transaction you are going to receive.For further detailed information about address reuse, you can look at the Bitcoin Wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse. There is information about what is the problem of address reuse.",

It is a complicated way of saying that reusing an address reduces your privacy.First, the presumption is that someone sending coins to your address knows who you are (or at least something about you). If you never reuse an address, then a sender knows only about the coins that they sent to you. They don't know what other people have sent you because they only know about the address that you gave them. When you reuse an address, then everybody given that address knows what everyone else has sent you.2. There is nothing preventing or prohibiting any number of people from simultaneously sending coins to the same address.Quote from: cafter on March 24, 2023, 03:30:51 PMmeans we can generate, multiple addresses with same private key, and they all will show equal amounts in all created wallets...It doesn't mean that. Also, a private key is generally associated with a only single address. While, a private key can be associated with multiple addresses because there are different address formats and transaction types, it typically does not happen.You are probably thinking of a HD wallet that generates multiple private keys (and their addresses) from a seed (via a master private key).",
