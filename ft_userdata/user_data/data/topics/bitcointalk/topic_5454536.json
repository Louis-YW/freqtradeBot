  "content": "Hello! I introduce myselfâ€¦Bitgree.com is a newly created website that allows you to make purchases on Amazon & MercadoLibre using Bitcoin Cash (BCH). It also allows you to acquire BCH without KYC. Both options can be done anonymously, and always in a self-custodial manner (both wallets and multi-signature escrows on the blockchain).The operation is similar to a P2P exchange, but instead of making a payment in fiat money, what is done is a purchase intermediated in an online store. For example:A user named Bob has BCH and wants to make a purchase on Amazon.In turn, another user named Alice has fiat money and wants to acquire BCH.Through Bitgree both are coordinated.Using a multi-signature escrow, Alice will make the purchase with fiat on Amazon by sending the product to Bob, in exchange for BCH.In the event of a conflict, Bitgree will act as a mediator using the multi-signature escrow.The platform allows you to make purchases on Amazon and MercadoLibre anonymously, delivering the order to Amazon Lockers or MercadoLibre Agencies. It also allows you to acquire BCH without KYC, without giving any personal information, and without bank transfers involved.If you try Bitgree, please leave what you think here. Thank you so much.",

      "body": "I browsed the site and found that it is a pre-made wish list? Can I customize it as I like and upload a picture, then the user can buy it and conduct transactions with me, or is the list fixed and cannot be customized?Why only Bitcoin Cash? You can add Bitcoin, Lightning Network and more, or is there a specific reason to accept Bitcoin Cash only?If the escrow is well managed, the fees are reasonable, and there is enough demand to accept the wishes quickly, then it is a good site.",
