I would suggest turning at least some of your work into NFT's and launching a collection, I think you would get some sponsors with the high quality of your work, and definitely reach a wider audience; also millenials and digital nomads who are very economical with physical space might actually prefer owning the NFT version...",

I think anyone interested might be waiting for the last minutes so they wouldn't start the bidding thing yet. We'll see!As for NFT's, this was already done. I should have made more fuss about it, but i was a bit busy with other projects at the time (I honestly almost forgot about these a couple of times haha)",
