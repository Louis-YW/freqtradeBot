In the first place — if you're an institutional investor(or at the very least, a very savvy retail investor), you wouldn't be asking for advice online.If you truly know what you're doing, then by all means go get a loan for investing. But then again, a huge majority of people actually don't know what they're doing but instead just think they do because of ignorance.",

Is there a possibility that the warning to not take out a loan to buy Bitcoin doesn't apply to institutional investors being that they have been performing well?That's a beautiful question you just asked @ O.P, and I'm going to give you a logical answer regarding this, because if you could make some research, you will get to understand that \"Microstrategy\" as a company has a net worth of over $3.77 billion dollars, of which taking a loan of $2.4 Billion was a risk they could afford, knowing truly that with such huge sum, they could make massive profit with Bitcoin investment, which is quite different from what we always advocate here on this forum for people not to take loans they can't afford to pay back if eventually the price of Bitcoin fall and yet it's already due time to pay back your loan. As such could be the worst period any individual could face, as load keeps accumulating daily.So on the contrary, those International investors take loans simply because they have an asset to pay back the loans if things don't go as plan.",

Don't forget that Saylor has a plan on what he is doing,I guess he did this due to the price of bitcoin that will hit the bull run 2025. In the forum,you are advised not to take loan to invest in bitcon due to its volatile nature,so that when the loan time has elapsed,without any profit yet,you might end up selling cheaper than what you bought. This will bring more problem to you because you will need to pay up the loan. Someone with an asset or a business can take to loan to pump the business,because he has what he can rely on to payback the loan. Remember so many businesses and investment needs loan to survive,especially when it is a big firm,you will have the banks on your tip.",

For retails investors, one the most essential factors is timing. When you go all in makes a difference for you but doesn't make any difference for Michael Saylor and other institutional investors. It simply doesn't matter if they buy at $20k or $70k as it's a long-term investment and they're not planning to sell/cash out in the foreseeable future.",

They are one of the top companies when it comes to Bitcoin holdings. I wonder what Michael Saylor was thinking. Is there a possibility that the warning to not take out a loan to buy Bitcoin doesn't apply to institutional investors being that they have been performing well?Well, just as the first colleague stated that the rule is mostly for retail investors, I would want to add that institutional investment is not just based on one person's agreement before taking out a loan to invest; it's usually based on the agreement of all shareholders of the company, which even has a well-mapped-out strategy to repay the loan.Also, before some companies take out loans, they consider what they already have, just like in the example of @CryptoHeadlineNews.So there is basically a higher possibility that a company can easily repay their loan without stress, while retail investors can have some little issues to repay when the loan is overdue. It's not as if a company cannot pass through challenges in loan repayment just as an individual would, but it seems they have a better chance than just retail investors.A company can take out a loan to invest and encounter losses, but they still have their company capital to cover their loan, whereas an individual can encounter losses and may not have anything to cover the loan. As such, they can sell off some properties, like houses, cars, or other things that belong to them, just to repay the loan, mean while those properties they are selling is still vital to them.Another thing I want to point out is that in business, the higher your investment, the higher your profit. Since Microstrategy invested $2.4 billion in Bitcoin, if Bitcoin just increased by 20%, they would have a profit of $560 million, which is huge, and they could use 5% of it to cover the loan interest. If the Bitcoin price also grows by more than 40%, it means more profit, and you can't compare that to a retail investor that can just take out a loan of $500–$20,000 and make a small profit and still cover loan interest from it, so they need a higher price to make enough profits.",

I think the advice should be, do not go beyond your means whenever you invest in bitcoin. Taking out a loan with the full confidence and guarantee that you would be able to pay it back even if the investment goes under is something that you should take into account before taking out debts. Microstrategy surely knows about this, they may have even put up their bitcoin investments as a form of collateral just in case they couldn't pay the bank. So, it's fine. Institutional investors as a matter of fact do this all the time, that's why they remain rich. However, for the common joe this wouldn't work most of the time. The money we earn is directly related to our capacity to work so the moment we got laid off or fired, we're fucked.",

Apart from that, and if the lender will collect collateral and with interest, there is no need to borrow and purchase bitcoin because the risk there is high. You can see the market these few days. Bitcoin was 30k$ and suddenly the price just come down too 27$k. And if you purchase it at the time of 30k and now that it is 27k. What will you do about? What will be running in your mind if you purchase it with borrowed money?Institutional investors can do that but with caution.

Taking a loan to invest in something is very similar to investing with high leverage. And trading with high leverage is a bad idea.

The mode of repayment is mostly the issue, most of these individual investors look at the profit that could be gain to pay out their loan which actually creates panic in holding. Someone that is not calm can’t hodl for long and might sell at a loss price during a bearish period if the loan repay date is due. But if an individual also has an outside income of repaying the Loan without it affecting is financing then it is slightly advisable to take loans. This could happen when an investor sees the market down and wants to capitalize on it but the money is expecting to invest in it might come late then he could just take a loan and repay with the initial planned fund.",
