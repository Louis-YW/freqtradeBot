Anyways, Be aware there have been other cases of newbies who join just to try to sell their casino code and some of them have tried to do so with code or software which does not actually belongs to them.Instead redirecting people to your personal Telegram you may inspire more trust if you let us try the demo through a link, instead asking you in a private message for it. Good luck and hopefully you will get paid for your effort in the future.",

Good luck and hopefully you will get paid for your effort in the future.  What you said is correct. Op should be transparent and allow people here to see the demo. The service board is the best place to drop this thread because it is concerning a service to be rendered. So there is the best. For transparency purpose op should do everything here and only discuss the important personal information on telegram. And for now there is no need to corner someone to telegram and discuss business. Let the forum confirm the working of the code first and when the recommendations has been given then the interested persons can contact you by pm or the telegram handle to discuss things.",

      "body": "OP would it not be better you further communicate here everything about your deal for transparency purpose so as not to cast doubt on your reliability. It is well known that scammers do opt or prefer telegram because of their ill intensions when it comes to scamming people and wiping off all  traces. It is well known that telegram is where all nefarious act takes place. I will advise you use this platform and this thread to further communicate with anyone interested in your offer so there will be a little atom of confidence in dealing with you OP.With respect to your post, just as you were advised earlier, you can move this topic to the service board there you can get more potential clients interested in your services.Lastly, a demo could allow for proper scrutiny of  how the casino code works and knowing the prototype of  the source code too would be better.",

To be fair, we have no idea on what the personal or financial situation of OP is, he may be desperate enough to offer that source code at that cheap due to an infinity of reasons, considering his story of not being paid what he needed , though, I agree with you when you say he should have linked to a demo and shown proof of ownership of this project. Since he has not yet provided clarification, I assume he already left this forum when he saw we started to ask for things he cannot give and we are not so easy to be sold whatever he is trying to sell around.  Whenever something is too cheap to be true, assume it is a scam, folks.",
