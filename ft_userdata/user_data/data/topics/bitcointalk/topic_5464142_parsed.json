I’m planning on going back to it in 1-2 months when I get back home, so I might as well get a few suggestions which would dictate where I should spend my time.If you don’t know the website, check the announcement thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5273824.0Which features would you like to see in the new version?

Also, would it be doable to show how many members of each rank was active in the threads/boards etc? I am asking because I would like to add that info in my brief monthly local boards overview and I don't know anyone who could provide such thing. Regarding the merit tab, why not show the 4 month charts instead of 3, since 4 months period becamse kind of standard on bitcointalk (at least when applying for signature campaign).Anyway, looking forwward to see the new version!",

That's why I said that the user would have to wait a few minutes or hours to get the result.The system may be set to only perform on-demand scrapings once per day. And this way, it will not overload the system.Furthermore, the bot currently scrapings almost live. A few seconds or minutes after we make a post, it is already listed on Ninjastic. Therefore, I think this question does not arise. Even so, I only believe that this type of scraping should only be done once a day.",
