If it was former and he actually has tokens but is delaying distribution, you have to provide some evidence for that. On the other hand, if Combo team is supposed to distribute them and decided to postpone, the rest nothing that he can do about it. Well he could have asked for escrow but if did that, Combo team would just find another manager who wouldn't ask for that so in the end result would be the same. Either way, you should be more selective when doing these bounty campaigns because stuff like that this happen all the time.",

Irfan_pak10 has nothing to do with the bounty distribution. He just has shared the promise he got from the team. That's how it works in most cases.I request OP to check out whether the bounty rewards is in escrow or not + whether the gas fee for the distribution has been shared by team or not, before participating. I had cases like this. Team shared me the rewards but haven't sent me the gas fee which later caused a huge chaos at the end. I was waiting for team to send the gas fee, participants were asking questions everyday lol.",

And I’m the thread he stated that when distribution is about to start the token’s value will be calculated with the current price so you shouldn’t worry yourself if the price of the token will drop as if won’t affect your reward (because most times that’s what bounty hunters are afraid of, they don’t want their payment when the token no longer has value as compared to when the distribution was supposed to have been done) so just chill and wait for the three months, it seems like a long time to wait but just be patient it will come and if it passes and nothing yet then you can go ahead and create a scam accusation against Combo.",

Bounty managers are pretty much hands-off when it comes to token distribution, unless they're holding tokens in escrow.  In cases where project owners decide to delay distribution, there isn't much they could do about it. That's a risk you have to accept when joining a campaign. Although, bounty managers should be a little more selective when deciding to run new campaigns.",

But even though this has been repeated a hundred times, if tomorrow a new bounty company with the same bad manager appears on the horizon, they will not think for a minute and will immediately begin to participate wherever someone promises them something. There is a good way out of the situation—not to visit the bounty section at all—but will anyone listen to such advice?",

You left us a link to the Telegram group, and in order to understand your problem, someone has to go through all the spam and trash hunters wrote in that group.Nevertheless, I will write what I understood here.- irfan_pak10 does not control the funds for bounty rewards or am I wrong?- I have not seen where it is defined whether the payment will be in USD or Combo token. - irfan_pak10 He said that the distribution of awards is expected in October. I don't see any specific guarantees that it will be like that. Plus now it's October 5, and there are still 25 days in this month, technically, October 30 is in line with this \"promise\"Quote from: irfan_pak10 on August 24, 2023, 10:33:53 AMCOMBO Bounty [All 3 Stages] Stakes and USD Rewards have been Updated. ...Distribution: Expected in OctoberI saw in the Telegram group that the manager announced that the team asked for the payment to be extended for December. Definitely not a good signal.Just another confirmation that most of these new tokens are highly questionable and almost certainly junk.Also a suggestion for irfan_pak10, he should pay a little more attention to the quality of the campaign itself. It is not mandatory to accept every client, on the other side spamming according to SM has no influence on the success of the project.",

If you join bounty projects it is safe to say that there is an insanely high chance you might not get paid after promoting them, and threads such as this won't get you the money, you prolly should reconsider your participation in such projects.",

As clearly mentioned in the bounty thread client wanted to distribute tokens in first week of Oct, but when I reached them about distribution of tokens, they wanted to extend the date due to bad market condition, as the tokens is old and big/ binance and other big exchange listed, price has already plunged due to bad market condition. They just wanted some more delays to protect the price as the total distribution amount is 100k usd in tokens. So upon their extension message, Im negotiating with them about the distribution date and also suggested them to distribute in phase. So In the last message they wanted until next week as they are talking to higher authorities and will come to us with a final decision. I conveyed this message in the telegram group.",

As far as reputation is concerned, it seems as though irfan_pak10 has no valid allegations in his trust history to suggest he is a scammer. If he is managing a bounty and has no control over the COMBO tokens (as bounty managers usually have to wait for the owners of projects to release bounties) therefore you calling him a scammer is somewhat harsh.Quote from: Little Mouse on October 05, 2023, 05:18:16 AMQuote from: Rikafip on October 05, 2023, 04:26:53 AMFirst of all, who was supposed to distribute tokens, irfan_pak10 or Combo team?Most of the times, it's the project team and same here in the case of Combo too.

If memory serves correct there was a time when bounty managers could (or did) take payments in advance using BTC or ETH but that was around the time when the ICO craze was at a peak. Also, when projects stopped paying in advance the release of bounties was usually locked in to the distribution of tokens after they were released. It is safer for bounty managers and participants to have some sort of guarantee/escrow but that would mean non-project tokens therefore project owners could be reluctant to go down that route.Quote from: Little Mouse on October 05, 2023, 11:54:56 AMTake some time to read OP before replying then.

Do you think building a reputation over the years is a joke for a good manager to just wake up one day and scam bounty hunters? If he had an escrow for this project payment that would have been a different case but it seems that was not the agreement and the project team are responsible for the distribution so in that case you will need to wait till December as they have said according the link you have provided up there.
