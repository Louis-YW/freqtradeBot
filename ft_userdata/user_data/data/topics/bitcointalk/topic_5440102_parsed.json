What has changed is the number of miners and the quality of materials used to compete for rights to the next block.In the early days, you could mine off your home PC and be very profitable, cause the competition was low as well as the difficulty level.Today, a PC is not viable in the mining space and you need lots of gear and high caliber equipment.- Jay -",

Simply because those coins weren't actually worth much, like 1-10cent/btc (pre-GPU prices).You kept your CPU crunching for hours/days and got coins worth cents if you found a block.And besides that, you couldn't even sell those coins to anyone outside of this forum or the irc-channel and most users here or there just mined themselves.So, it wasn't mining that was very profitable, HODLing those coins was though.But for HODLing coins, it doesn't really matter if you mine them, buy them, or get them any other way.",

The mining process was simple and only required a standard CPU to solve the mathematical equations necessary to verify transactions on the network. Miners would compete to solve these equations, and the first miner to do so would be rewarded with new bitcoins.Since the early days of Bitcoin, the mining process has undergone several changes. The most significant change was the introduction of specialized mining hardware known as Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners. These miners are much more efficient at solving the mathematical equations required to mine new blocks and are much faster than traditional CPUs and GPUs.Another change to the mining process is the increase in mining difficulty. As more miners joined the network, the difficulty of solving the equations increased, making it more difficult for individual miners to earn rewards. This led to the formation of mining pools, where multiple miners combine their computing power to increase their chances of solving the equations and earning rewards.",

People did not realize its value because they could mine bitcoin easily.It's true that mining bitcoin in the early days didn't require much computational power and you could easily find a new block by using a regular pc. This was due to the low difficulty and lack of miners (competition = low hashing power).But this is not the reason why bitcoin price was too low. The real reason is the lack of awareness and adoption, only few people believed in bitcoin back then.",

You construct a block, fill it with transactions from your mempool and compute the header's hash and compare it with the target. If it is bigger, you make small changes and recompute the hash until you find the hash that is not bigger than the target.It is not a monopoly either, it just takes a better commitment than just turning your PC on and using your CPU to mine bitcoin. You have to make an investment (commit some money) to buy ASICs and mine bitcoin with them at a much higher hashrate.",
