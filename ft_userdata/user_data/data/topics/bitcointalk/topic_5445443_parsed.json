Putin and Zelensky, the latter of which is expected to take place virtually, reflect Beijing's effort to play a more active role in mediating an end to the war in Ukraine, some of the people said.\"All of this suggests that Beijing's role as an influential mediator, at a moment Washington has remained resistant to seriously pursuing peace in Ukraine, is gaining traction in both Moscow and Kiev.The closely watched and controversial plans of Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit President Vladimir Putin in Russia is taking shape quickly, with Reuters reporting Monday it will happen next week, citing unnamed sources. If accurate, this will be a much earlier timetable than previously expected, following a Dec. 30 video call between Putin and Xi wherein the invitation to visit Moscow was initially made. According to The Moscow Times, \"Xi, who secured an unprecedented third term in office last week, had been expected to travel to Moscow in April or early May.\"Officially both sides are keeping mum on the reports that the visit is coming next week. \"As a rule, announcements of official foreign visits are coordinated synchronously by mutual agreement of the parties,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing. \"When there is such readiness, we will let you know.\"High on the agenda is expected to be China's efforts to get both warring sides to the negotiating table, after last month presenting its position paper, or a 12-point plan for resolving the Ukraine crisis. While it was immediately met with skepticism in the West, Ukraine's president Zelensky expressed rare openness....",

And we are driving this change together,' Xi told Putin via his interpreter – words sure to set alarm bells ringing in the West. 'Please, take care, dear friend,' he added, gripping the Kremlin leader's hand warmly before being waved off by the Russian despot, who bid Xi a 'safe journey'. After the two leaders hailed a 'new era', Xi's plane left Moscow's Vnukovo airport on Wednesday. He was seen off by a guard of honour who played the Russian and Chinese national anthems, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said.In February 2022, the pair announced they had forged a 'no limits' friendship and Putin invited Xi to visit the Russian capital. They have since publicly talked of strengthening their 'special relationship', with Moscow and Beijing both rejecting what they say are US attempts to create a 'unipolar world' controlled by Washington....",

You seem to be talking about barter. Money is just a convenience. It exists to make barter and trade easier. The Western money-mongers are losing their control over their own money. That's part of the reason why they are fighting with Russia in the first place.When it's not convenient to use money, don't use it. That's the position Russia is in regarding using Western money. They are working with other nations to make their own money - BRICS - because money simplifies certain aspects of trade.If one judges Russia by the Western money standard, she might seem to be floundering. But regarding trade, like to China - the pipeline - neither Russia nor China are floundering. They are simply on a different system... a system that might include barter and trade without so-called money, at least for a while.To suggest that Russia is cut off from money, is simply to ignore the facts of the strength of Russia.",

To the contrary, Russia's economy has been booming since 2022 and keeps doing well, also projected into the future. Why? \"We have exponentially increased our economic sovereignty\", President Putin commented at a recent meeting with aircraft factory employees in Ulan-Ude, Buryatia. The autonomous Republic of Buryatia is in the south of Eastern Siberia, along the border with Mongolia. Its territory takes up two thirds of the water area of Lake Baikal (see map below). This just as an idea of the enormous landmass, called Russia, and what lays above and beneath her....As usual, it is the European people at large who have been betrayed by their so-called leaders – most, if not all of them, scholars of Klaus Schwab’s school for YGL. By no means have they ever been “infiltrated” to serve the interests of the people, who supposedly “elected” them.
