An Air Curtain is either horizontal or vertical and is fitted to entrance/door. What a miner can do is project the vertical air curtains in such a way that they will throw out the hot air out of the mining box area.

This must be adding up lot of cost in your overall project. A) I mean the filter cost must be divided in the two stages viz., 1) Filtering unit - one time cost 2) Filters of 5 micron, 1 micro and 10 micron to be replaced now and then since they are not the permanent one. They have to have the wear and tear over the period of time. Is the water that bad in your region? I mean instead of this you should have one big storage tank where you should process the water and store then use. Not sure what's your process?Does the Point A mentioned above is correct in your case?",
