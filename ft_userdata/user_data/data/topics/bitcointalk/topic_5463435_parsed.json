I know of nft but have never own any nor done any transaction in NFT. All depends on what she did to get the NFT in the wallet. If she participated in any contest or others to have it then she know that it hers but whereby she just see it in her wallet without performing anything to have it then it is a scam. Me I never use NFT before so I don't. Know how it work and worth. But I have only heard about it. And from the story you just shared, I don't think you are going to have that token instead you might be a victim of the token. If you know what you did before the arrival of the token then you don't have to worry but if not you just have to leave it because the end will not sweet you. And if you want to know the legit NFT, there is a website for that but I have forgotten the site since I was not interested to participate in any of their token when it was trending. Check the clause I underlined in your post, only that indicates that, it is a scam. But let others also tok their experience on this matter.",

I no move di NFT and I just leave am like that and it's should be more a year now.E get techniques wey hackers dey take steal funds from people wallet, dem go send you fake token and if you wan try send am to anoda address or exchange, naso you go take compromise your wallet and dem go just steal all your funds.

This method of scamming was used during the ICO and other crypto hypes, Â where random coins will be dropped into your wallet without your involvement with the network and in an attempt to claim the spam coins they will demand for a fee, Â that few is where their scam lies. So it is better you ask your sis closely to know what exactly is going on and check the site out, Â we need to properly educate those around us so as not to fall into scammers' traps.",

Hackers no fit get you if you no lose guard, na the thing be that. Them need you to open whatever they send to you before them go get access to you because that thing wey them send na various. The thing been dey happen as you talk with airdrop and airdrop self na shit stuff yet person go carry hand take pack aboki shit. The simple matter na to avoid scammers.

I know of nft but have never own any nor done any transaction in NFT. I can't say for sure but I have been battling with an issue like this but my case was kinda different though mine was an airdrop I just followed on telegram and I haven't really done anything yet but I was flash a reward of supposedly 400$ saying that I need to pay at some fine for me to access the airdrop @sweatcoin and if it was same case with someone who isn't that much into crypto, they would have scammed the person but this your own case is quite peculiar as you said the Nft is already in the wallet although I don't know how Nft are been claimed but I think you have to sell and its picture like if am not mistaking.",

Okay, if what is shown above is what she saw & tried minting and lost some funds in her wallet, then I guess her wallet might have been compromised by her attempt trying to claim this free nft, which from my research I'm made to understand that \"Base nft\" is a Layer 2 solution built by Coinbase (i.e one of crypto biggest exchange) on Ethereum using the OP stack in collaboration with Optimism, providing a foundation for Coinbase's 100 million users to enter DeFi. For further details, check out link: https://www.coingecko.com/learn/base-nfts-potential-base-airdropHowever, I go talk say free things are not always good, and as such, if you get funds for your wallet, please avoid claiming any free things you see online, weather crypto or nft, so as to avoid later saying \"heard-I-known\" when your funds don disappear from your wallet.",
