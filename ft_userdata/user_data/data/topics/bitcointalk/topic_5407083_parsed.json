It's not 100% clear to me what you're trying to say.The escrow here reduces counter party risk. This is achieved by utilizing a cryptographic passphrase. In essence this time-based escrow  ensures the receiver of the payment acknowledges it with a given period of time and once this time elapses the receiver forfeits the payment. This receiver performs two tasks to access the fund.Input the right passphraseThen claim the paymentAnd this is done within a certain time frame in which if the receiver inputs an incorrect passphrase and cannot claim the payment within that time bound the receiver loses the payment",

As far as I can see, Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob; she use Carol as an intermediary node to route her transaction to Bob. When Bob tells the secret to Carol, he doesn't need Alice to take the bitcoin. Alice has given him a transaction that grants Carol the bitcoin, given Carol has the preimage. If Bob does not respond to Carol's preimage request, nothing happens. Carol cannot take the money, because he doesn't meet Alice's condition.",

It just seems to me that even if Bob is unresponsive, Carol doesn't have anything to worry about. He will only transfer the bitcoin if Bob has given him the preimage. Otherwise, the condition in their script is not met. In the sketch, I see Carol asking Alice to give him his bitcoin back, but that payment has never happened. In fact, Carol never gives Alice bitcoin, he receives from Alice, and sends it to Bob. (That, assuming Alice wants to send Bob a bitcoin, and the path looks like this: Alice <-> Carol <-> Bob)",
