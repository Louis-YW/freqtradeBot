Be aware O.P!There's no such thing as \"whatever payment option they offer\", I'm concentrated on Paypal, SEPA and FPS right now. You on the other hand should stop making assumptions and must read my replies, specifically the part where I will deal with escrow. And please, next time do not edit your replies if you want my answers.Quote from: SMB on October 06, 2023, 01:50:01 PMQuote from: BabyBandit on October 06, 2023, 06:34:29 AMQuote from: alterra57 on October 05, 2023, 10:30:05 PMQuote from: BabyBandit on October 05, 2023, 04:00:57 PMQuote from: alterra57 on September 25, 2023, 08:38:41 PMQuote from: balotelli on September 25, 2023, 01:40:43 PMNeed $500 paypal.Are you offering escrow or are you sending first?
