In addition, we have an optional \"duress\" wallet, which is derived from the wallet's seed words and is not independent. This means it gets backed-up automatically, and the original seed words also backup the duress wallet.By adding a BIP-39 passphrase you can unlock nearly unlimited additional wallets which derive from the original 24 seed words. The passphrase you use defines the wallet and cannot be changed. BIP-39 passphrases are not backed up or otherwise tracked, which gives lots of freedom in terms of plausible deniability.Note: creating multisig wallet with you having the co-signers on the same wallet is not secure, not advisable as I have mentioned before.",

I want to use this for creating a multi signature walletYou can always reset your wallet that would erase your original seed words, but make sure you have backup in safe place, if you want to recover it later.Than you can create new multisig (or singlesig wallet) and use it normally however you want, and you can do reset for this at any time.I don't own Coldcard wallet so I don't know all details about this, but I know they are using sd cards for encrypted backups.Follow instructions on their website advanced ''danger zone'', to reset and wipe your seed words:https://coldcard.com/docs/advanced",

      "body": "You can. Kind of.As others have already pointed out, you can't store multiple seeds simultaneously using only a single signing device. But given that Coldcard supports the creation of BIP85 deterministic seed phrases [1], you can derive multiple ones from your initial seed and even use one of these derived seeds temporarily on your device to sign PSBT files associated with the derived seed. That also means that theoretically, you can create a multisig address using private keys from different (albeit deterministic) seeds that belong to the same wallet. QuoteYou can use this feature on a seed with a BIP-39 passphrase. However, access to the derived seed will require that same passphrase in the future if you ever need to restore it. This can complicate the recovery process, so you may want to avoid deriving entropy from passphrase-protected seeds by using the Derive Entropy function before entering your passphrase.If you forget the index number, it's possible to search for the correct index because there are only 10,000 possible choices.Derived XPRVs or BIP-39 seed words (12, 18, or 24) can be used on another COLDCARD.Temporarily using the derived seed on your COLDCARD allows you to sign PSBT files associated with the derived wallet. The key stays in effect until next you turn off the COLDCARD or log out. You will probably need to consult Walletrecovery.org in order to build specialized PSBT files for recovery purposes.You can find more information here: https://coldcard.com/docs/bip85[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0085.mediawiki",
