      "body": "To be honest if metaverse was still an experiment these days. Some projects were combining their metaverse with play to earn even move to earn but these didn't even working perfectly and why? it caused by there are still loopholes with metaverse and play to earn project. Inflation and demand have still become the main problem why metaverse are a bit difficult to be hyped again. Enjin was good and this project already given decent ROI to the its early investors but again expecting if this gonna be pumped again during the bullish eason was making sense.",

Most likely, the second stage of the hype of the metaverses will begin with a new bullrun after the crypto winter. I continue to keep Enjin in my portfolio and of course I do not plan to sell on the bottoms. Enjin is not a dummy as it has created business solutions using blockchain technology. With Enjin software, users can use NFT to grow their business so growth is inevitable.",

I just learned from what happened with bitcoin a few years ago. The halving impact will come so late and may be this will become the main bet for you. I can't even think which was the good price for enjin but surely doubling from its ATH may possible but noone knows.",

This chain combination will make the Enjin metaverse ecosystem very viable.I agree, Enjin also had shown us that they have the ability to gather different game genres and the gaming community.  We all know that gaming is a huge industry so if ever they are successful in their endeavors price of Enjin will surely surge.This price prediction might get you interested.QuoteEnjin price prediction The ENJ token saw a rise of almost 15,000% from the beginning of 2021 to its all-time high of $4.82 in November, but then saw relatively large losses over the first half of 2022. This has led technical indicators such as the Stoch RSI and CMF to offer different positions. But a clear pattern is evident from a panel of 26 indicators provided by DigitalCoinPrice. 13 suggest selling and only three suggest buying. It is important to note, however, that technical indicators are not accurate representations of all current market conditions. WalletInvestor’s forecast for one year’s time is $1.23, while in five years it says the coin should be worth $4.33. The Enjin price prediction for 2022 says ENJ could pass the $1 mark in November. PricePrediction.net argues that ENJ will reach an average of $2.27 in 2025. However, its Enjin price prediction for 2030 forecasts an average price of $13.73, and it sees the token rising to $21.15 in 2031.Finally, DigitalCoinPrice suggests an average price of $0.89 in 2025, before dropping to $0.81 in 2026. For 2027, its Enjin coin price prediction expects it to average out at $1.13 and climb to $2.10 in 2030source: https://currency.com/enj-price-prediction",

      "body": "Enjin is basically an \"engine\", that is the thing that makes it so interesting. This is not really a \"metaverse\" coin but more like the engine for creating metaverse projects, allowing people to use Enjin to create games that would change the world. Of course not many projects pick it hence why it is not so high right now, but I have seen what could be done with it, I have seen the limitations of what enjin provides and that is much vaster than any other project that I have seen so far.It means that if one day some great gaming company realizes this and uses it, then it will be awesome for them, if not then they will stay low for a long time until someone does or dies eventually.",
