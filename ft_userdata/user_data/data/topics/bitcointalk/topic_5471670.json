Coin desk 2. Cointegraph3. Bitcoin.com4. News btcAnd5. Crypto briefing I think all the above mentioned sites are informative and helpful, nevertheless we still require the knowledge of people that have been on this platform for long to educate and enlighten us more about crytocurrencies as mare reading about crytocurrencies alone can't give us all we need to know, so it requires experienced and technical individuals that have worked on cryptos to lay more emphasis to the best of our comprehension, reading without guidance is just like reading an ordinary book but being guided while reading will broaden ones knowledge more about the information one is seeking.",

Would it not have been better you also provide links to the websites you have mentioned because I believe not everybody would have that time trying to search for it online to getting the original websites. Most times when one is presenting information of this nature, one should be able to also provide links as this is not a hard one to do. OP you did well but I can not really tell the exact website you are talking about.",

Coin desk 2. Cointegraph3. Bitcoin.com4. News btcAnd5. Crypto briefing Nice one OP, I am conversant with CoinDesk, Cointelegraph and Bitcoin.com, I have also seen Crypto Briefing a couple of times. Another one that I am also familiar with is U.Today and Decrypt. U.Today is a Dubai-based news outlets where you will get authentic news about cryptocurrencies. They also publish interviews and other relevant articles on Bitcoin and Etherium. Whereas, Decrypt is another news website where I go get updates on the Web3 to be specific and I enjoy how structured the solutions to problems are.Another way I dey try identify the legitimacy of these news organizations is on their social media platforms particularly on their X account (former Twitter). Before Elon Musk did introduced the purchase of the blue tick, I check if the company is verified on Twitter as one of the ways I dey scrutinize the company.I dey also go through their commet sections to check if the opinions of the commenters are positive enough to rely on them or whether they are saying something else. Sometimes I dey take my time to compare notes with other websites too so that I go fit know if the one wey I dey try follow legit.",

My twitter has been my major source when it comes to news but everyone might have a different source like for my brother Instagram is where he gets his latest news from.

This forum has been a great help for me as well in terms of cryptocurrency news, most breaking news brought here are being published elsewhere before being posted here but it is really helpful because we might have missed out on some interesting news then later find it here.

On the other hand, I have to admit that I avoid Youtube like the plague, I've heard nothing but bullshit when it comes to crypto news. I'm not talking about conferences but only about Youtubers whose business is to analyze the market while it's hot, there's nothing worse...",
