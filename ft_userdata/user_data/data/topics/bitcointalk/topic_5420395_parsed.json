You could try using electrum (from electrum.org) but you might need to get a script using bitcoinj if you find they're bip39 nmemonics and not electrum's native phrases (you can use electrum to import bip39 wallets but bitcoinj would be a lot faster imo for the amount of wallets you need to import).You could also use online tools to convert a nmemonic into an xpub which you can then put into a block explorer. One example of this is https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ but it's risky to use it online. (download a copy of the site and go offline and generate the 1k xpubs if you go that way before coming back online after closing the site).",

Maybe some tools from iancoleman.io can help you, or use their BIP39 tool and open it in 20 tabs and paste your seed phrase into each tab and take private keys then back up. It takes time before you get all the used addresses and then import all keys on a single wallet. Take note, always use iancoleman offline for safety, which only works on BIP39 seed. If your seed backups are generated from Electrum then this won't work. Also, take note of the fake iancoleman tool just recently found a fake one in Google ads this is the domain iancolemanbip39.info. Be careful of that fake one.",

I can't think of any legit reason why someone would have that many different used seed phrases.Another theory: it is an https://xyproblem.info and OP lost 1-2 seed words & wrote a script to generate all possible permutations of known and unknown words. I think better specifying the purpose of what people are trying to achieve, greatly helps in the forum's ability to find the best possible answer.
