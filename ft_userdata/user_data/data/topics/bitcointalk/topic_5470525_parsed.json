  "content": "I've stumbled across tokenized gold assets such as the ones mentioned on the title of this thread. I'm wondering which one is the best (safest) for buying and holding long-term? Knowing that Tether had a shady past, I'd be careful putting my money into something that might collapse in the future. Paxos might be a better option, though. Still, I'd like to know what do you think about each of these tokens. Any insights as to the amount of reserves they have, or how they comply with regulations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

In my country, digital gold is the safest gold purchase option we have. You can buy in fractions or small domination of gold and keep it safe with the government approved custodians digitally. You can sell it anytime you want and get the amount credited in your bank account instantly. So when it comes to gold, I would suggest not to look for centralized crypto issuers. Rather find something legal in your country.",

Rather find something legal in your country. Do you mean custodians like Goldmoney and Vaultoro? I was looking more into Blockchain-based digital Gold, because of the benefits it provides. Custodians charge fees for keeping your Gold stored in a vault. You don't have to worry about that with Gold-backed tokens on the Blockchain. You'd just buy, sell, and manage your \"digitized Gold\" on an ETH wallet of your choice. It's even better when you hold the keys/seeds yourself. Digitized Gold is certainly an appealing option for investors who want portability and unparalleled security. It's the \"best of both worlds\". This is one of the many RWAs (Real World Assets) that will take the world by storm. If I had to pick between the two tokens, I'd choose Paxos Gold. It's not as shady as Tether. Hopefully, we'll see more options available in the future as RWAs becomes more popular. Just invest what you can only afford to lose, and there should be nothing to worry about.",
