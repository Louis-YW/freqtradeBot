I have not used bot or AI bot to trade before. Some people can try AI if they think it can work good for them, but as for me, I see no reason to use AI and I trade myself. I minimize my risks and I prefer to earn little which makes my trading plan not to be very risky. In trading, some people use bot it AI bot to make things to be more convenient for them in trading but the traders analyse the market themselves and have trading plans. Some people use AI to trade to make profit, but AI can fail or may not fail, just like humans.The best that you can do for yourself in trading is to learn it and know how to trade yourself, even if you will use bot or AI bot or whatever they are called.What I have seen more about trading are bots, not AI. But AI can be used in learning trading.",

Since it's like that the use of AI in trading is still not that much taking the attention of many, it's the whole thing that's going to trade for us, right?There are already bots out there but it doesn't have a huge difference from trading manually. Well, for those that have been used to it, they can also prefer to use AI if they're able to get used to it as well.And for a trader that casually trades, whichever makes the most profit, there you should go so that you're able to see the goodness out of it because there are people that are not seeing it.",

People might be trading with AI and be making profit, but we don’t know what will happen in the long run, incase if the AI fails you will be losing all your money both the profit and the capital that you have made, and you will have to be starting from the beginning, I will not recommend anybody to use AI to trade, even if you don’t know how to trade, I will recommend you seek for knowledge on how to trade and learn to do it yourself than using AI to trade. When am trading on my own, I can easily control my lose, but when using AI errors can happen at any moment and everything you have been building is gone already.",

Also you wont really be having that feeling of regret on the time that you would be losing a certain trade on which you would really be having that kind of acceptance rather than on having a negative result on making use of AI then it would really be giving out that kind of annoyance on what happened and you would really be promising that you wont really be using it up once again. Profitable? You could always be making up that comparison in between because not all would really be that satisfied as long they could be able to experience for themselves in regarding the result. You would be able to find out on which one does really fits on your taste.",

It's just used to hype up people to buy the bots. If AI was perfect and flawless. Do you think the developers would sell it, knowing that they could mint unlimited profits using it? I guess not.Another question, What happens when over 90 of traders use AI to trade? Who will win? Who will lose?",

The first benefit of using a trading bot could be to monitor the market 24/7.Unlike humans, bots can continuously monitor the market without the need for breaks or sleep and they can analyze market data, news, and indicators around the clock, allowing for timely responses to market movements and ensuring you don't miss out on trading opportunities.So what I mean, using this bot makes your trading activity more efficient. It all depends on your knowledge and skills even though there's an AI or not.",

Because, that's not how AI works. Of course you must have tested some which are dedicated for crypto knowledge and past patterns.But they are only programs which works on the programming made by any person (that person might not be a good trader but he will get an help from a trader to create such AI). SO the point is, we should not totally depend on the bots but we should take help of the bots to narrow down our checklist and trades for better results. we could take help from the AI to perform TA and FA. But we should not depend totally on AI because AI can be tampered and thus you might lose your assets.",

If that so you can do this in every exchange because there's are supporting the spot trades and even in futures you can do this thing too but still of course have a manual intervention of the humans but again the same way with the AI. But the main difference is there are no emotions that need to occur in every trade such as being greedy or being hopeful with the position all about the numbers I guess this is the main point.

Lack of transparency: Some AI systems use complex analysis and strategies that are difficult to analyse.   Data bias and outfitting: AI stock trading depends on the data used in it. The quality of the outcome is only as good as the data fitted into the system. Lacks human oversight: The system executes trades depending on predefined rules, which may fail to recognise sudden market turns, leading to massive errors.Over-reliance on historical data: The system relies heavily on historical data.
