  "content": "Hello everyone.I’m very new to mining but have always been very intrigued by charts and instruments. Recently I come across GekkoScience Compac F’s. Instantly sparked an interest seeing 350gh/s advertised at $200 a stick, I snagged 2. I have not yet received them but in the mean time I am trying to compile the modifications a few devs have shared on GitHub I believe. Allowing miners to put these sticks to further use. I went a little down the GitHub rabbit hole with no knowledge of coding whatsoever.. kind of grasped what was needed in my situation to run these sticks and managed to get WSL Ubuntu setup and upgraded on win11.I have browsed the forum and come across a few issues from other users but mine is none of the same. I have got half way into the guide where it tells me to compile cgminer/mxe.sh b… this is where I have hit a wall. I do not know if I have been entering the commands incorrectly or I have a real issue.Here is the source I followed from. https://github.com/wareck/cgminer-gekko/archive/refs/tags/8c56556.zip using the windows-build.txt. I done all of the above correctly apart from this section:** Download MXE and build the libraries cgminer needs: cd cgminer/mxe.sh mxe cd mxe/** The versions of MXE after build-2020-06-06 fail to build cmake on WSL** You can skip this line if they ever fix that: git checkout build-2020-06-06** This compiles the mxe code needed - it can take a few hours in WSL ...** It also downloads each package it needs to build: ../cgminer/mxe.sh bThe error does not allow me to compile after the above 2 steps were fine. If someone may kindly give me their input it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
