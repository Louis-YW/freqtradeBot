In fact, on Crunchyroll it is rated for ages 14 and up because it has a lot of violence, and yet it is tender, and yes, this is the word I am looking for.It's about a spy whose mission is to spy on a man who is only seen at his son's school events, so he must find a wife and adopt a girl. And after many exciting and hilarious situations he ends up living with a psychic girl (she can read the minds of others) and a murderer who also seeks to keep up appearances. As the chapters go by, almost without realizing it, they will strengthen their relationship, thus complicating the mission. An anime well awarded at the Anime Awards.",
