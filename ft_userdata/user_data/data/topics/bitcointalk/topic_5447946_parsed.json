It sounds frustrating, but let's try to get a better understanding of the situation.To clarify, did you contact Cloudbet's support team to request a refund of the 1.6 WETH you mistakenly deposited? If so, what was their response? Have they given you any indication of when you can expect a refund?I believe icopress was their campaign manager last year. It's possible that he could provide you with additional contact information for a casino representative.",

You are thinking that it's pretty much an easier job. Just access the address with the private key and refund the fund. It's an easy process but it's not an easy process when you have to go through support. Because not everyone has the access to the fund; only a few have. Staff/Support have to forward the message and & with enough proof. That's a very lengthy process. Why would they waste their time for a mistake you did?",

You know how it works: not your keys, not your coins. \"Wrapped\" coins are a terrible creation, and any coins lost are pure profit for whoever created that token.I don't know what it currently looks like, but a while ago it cost 30 Euro to get Bitcoin Cash recovered when you sent it to your normal Bitcoin address at a German exchange. It is the most reputable exchange in Germany and I am sure they have security measures in place that can live up to relatively decent standards. The fee was flat (and still is I believe), no shenanigans and directly deducted with your consent from your account. @LoyceV, you are absolutely right that it's not like \"they have my private key, two clicks and there we go\", but if you take the example of the golden coin dropping into a brick, why not allow the customer to pay a company to recover it? The analogy is also not correct. The case you brought up is likely to be solved by an external expert. This is clearly a case that might take time, but could be done fully internally. They should just raise an additional fee, but if the exchange in Germany can do it for 30 Euro flat, I am sure Cloudbet can do it as well. Even if they deduct 0.1 WETH (which would be ridiculously high), OP could put the case to rest as a costly lesson. By the way: I have been using Cloudbet without issues for almost a decade now. I am indeed surprised.",

Calling Cloudbet scammers at this point will not solve anything, and can actually make things worse. You should approach this situation with a level-headed and objective mindset, and work with them to find a solution.Ok mate you seems you are missing the fact that 23 days passed already ! Am not nagging on day or day 2 and you and i can appreciate its not rocket science to make the refund the max they can do “ service fees” for 50-100$ and make it happen .Keeping my money for 3 weeks + without resolution = scammersNow someone will tell me yeah they didnt move the money ! Oh well they can not move it also and its considered in there books as its there address simple !All i want my money refunded and yeah am happy to pay cost for what they may ask extra time needed to recover them !Beside that am not giving up on my money when i know and everyone knows here that its not lost money not that case",

With any decent secure setup for an exchange (and casino), there's not a single person with access to private keys. Quote from: Mmaalouli on April 08, 2023, 12:29:10 PMIts scam since they admitted funds on there end as per communication with them and blockchain records and not refunding meI like this analogy: you walk into a brick and mortar bank (or casino), and drop a golden coin into a crack in the floor. You know it's there, they know it's there, and you want them to recover the coin for you. That means they'll have to spend time and money to start breaking down things while keeping the bank secure.Quote from: Mmaalouli on April 07, 2023, 02:47:35 PMam a coder all they need access private key of ny walletIt's not supposed to be as easy as it is with your wallet at home. Too many exchanges and casinos lost too much money in the past.Why don't you complain to the owner of the wrapped tokens? You know how it works: not your keys, not your coins. \"Wrapped\" coins are a terrible creation, and any coins lost are pure profit for whoever created that token.I don't know what it currently looks like, but a while ago it cost 30 Euro to get Bitcoin Cash recovered when you sent it to your normal Bitcoin address at a German exchange. It is the most reputable exchange in Germany and I am sure they have security measures in place that can live up to relatively decent standards. The fee was flat (and still is I believe), no shenanigans and directly deducted with your consent from your account. @LoyceV, you are absolutely right that it's not like \"they have my private key, two clicks and there we go\", but if you take the example of the golden coin dropping into a brick, why not allow the customer to pay a company to recover it? The analogy is also not correct. The case you brought up is likely to be solved by an external expert. This is clearly a case that might take time, but could be done fully internally. They should just raise an additional fee, but if the exchange in Germany can do it for 30 Euro flat, I am sure Cloudbet can do it as well. Even if they deduct 0.1 WETH (which would be ridiculously high), OP could put the case to rest as a costly lesson. By the way: I have been using Cloudbet without issues for almost a decade now. I am indeed surprised.Hey man, yes if they told me they want extra fees to speed this as if its considered extra job am happy to do it but keeping the money and almost month in that is now daylight robberyAm a diamond vvip with them even with years also, on my first issue with them instead of providing service that suits the maximum tier on there platform theyr disregarding me by thinking i will let this goI already raised complaint to the licenser of them and they saw what i raised is fair complaint and now case is up and they did email them lets see what cloudbet have to say..For me its simple refund me with whatever fees ( logic one ) and this matter is closedNot refunding me after this licenser case am taking it to police since i have records of cloudbet email admitting they got my money and month passed not wishing to refund so its like they admitted guilty easy case Its not about money for me more then i hate beeing stolen 3k is nothing i bet 500k-1m$ monthly betsIts all about principles ! Money admitted in your end, not refunding me = robbery and scam ! Cant make it simple then that ( considering month is passed also )",

For now there is probably nothing than you can do. You say you wager so much, are you usually betting with ETH or how did this mistake happen at all? Have you been a long-term VIP customer with Cloudbet? Which cryptos do you usually use?",
