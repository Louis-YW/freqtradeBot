Most Investors or traders don't know that investing a money you can't afford to do away with or money they can't afford to lose is the exact thing that makes you panic either as an investor or a trader, because as humans that we are, at some point we will always display emotions even though we really believes in Bitcoin, because their is a dip just as this current dip that might shake your confidence, which might warrant you to sell in panic, though newbies investors mostly are the ones that normally does that but even as a veteran in the the crypto space, if you invest or trade with what you can't afford to do away with or what you can't afford to lose, your emotions may get the better of you when the volatility of the market is in full display as this present one, and CZ who has the largest crypto exchange (Binance) has practically said it all in a summary, which I 100% agree to, because all he said is true.So let's try to invest only what we can afford, so as not to be easily shaken by volatility in the market.",

Bitcoin will grow beyond any dip and do numbers you as an investor how do you survive this dips is what actually matters, right now those who might have invested amount that they cannot afford to lose would have panic and sale at Loss or even break even when we know they market will most definitely bounce off and pump again. So if you have a large size and can’t afford to keep up maybe due to the funds you invested it is better to cut losses if it isn’t that bad but the best option is to hold for long",

It all depends on your trading psychology. This is more reason why as a bitcoin holder, you should avoid watching your wallet and the market too much. We all experience FUD but it depends on how we are able to control our emotions during the market fluctuations. The dips in the general market was unexpected, but that if BTC was already expected as there were many imbalance created by the market to fill up. If ones expect the market to continue in a bullish momentum for too long, then he's not ready to trade crypto. There will always be a season for the bulls and the bears, what matter is that you make the most of of them.",

Perhaps those who are not cautious has the wrong mindset to begin with when they enter crypto space. Perhaps they are \"influence\" by some streamers or some personalities that this market is very easy and that you can make a lot of money in short amount of time, becoming millionaire.And with that, when the price goes down hard, like it was a shake down as per definition of CZ, then immediately sell because they are worried and really be affected mentally as they never thought that this market is very volatile and very different as what others portray it. And it could also depend on where you invest here, for shit coins and meme coins, yeah, you could have sleepless night as you're thinking that it could literally go to 0 and before that could happen, maybe you are thinking of selling everything and not going to comeback.",

Almost all work in cryptocurrency is very risky, so before engaging in this risky activity, you need to prepare yourself in such a way that you can console yourself in case of a major loss. And it should also be remembered that everyone here must participate at their own risk. No one will take responsibility for anyone's losses and no one can be blamed.",

CZ is right and speak the same truth that you can get from intellectual members of the forum giving to you that you the same advise that you will need patience to make good money from buying Bitcoin. Without patience you will be selling at the sight of every bad market. There are many ways to handle your emotions in the market, you can start with only using a small amount of money for investing that you can forget about if the market crashes and you lose everything although that is not going to happen as the market is going to be alive for more than we can expect because Bitcoin adoption is increasing everyday and soon we will get to the peak of the adoption of Bitcoin someday. Another way to handle emotions is to get your mind occupied.",

You can invest an amount of money that you can lose and still have to battle and deal with the emotional trauma of maybe losing the money easily or the money not doing well in investment as expected.

Just like in all markets, there's risk in crypto. It would help if you learn to develop a certain level of risk tolerance. Otherwise, if you're too emotional, risk-averse, perhaps you are in the wrong space. You might consider getting out of the kitchen altogether. How much can you afford to lose really? Is it $100? Or $500 or $1,000? It's likely that during bull runs you won't be satisfied, or perhaps regret, with your $100 investment, but during crypto winters, you'd realize you should've invested much smaller amounts. This conundrum would go on forever in this volatile market. At some point, you'd have to temper down your emotions. If you can't do it, this market might not be for you.",

Very easy to say, but very difficult to apply.There might be some who can control the amount of money that they can invest, and they aren't affected if they lose it all, but there will be more that will throw their money even though they know that they can't afford it to lose. Why? Because of the desire to make more money. They believe that if they invest more money, they will make more money. At least, that's what most and newbie investors are thinking for most of the time. I've seen many on different social media platforms saying that they almost commit suicide just because they lost it all. I've seen many saying that they can't afford now to buy the basic things that they need just because they invested it, and they lost. This is why it's hard to apply the \"Invest what you can afford to lose\" thing because many wants to make money. At the end of the day, you will not really know how much you can afford to lose if you don't experience it first-hand. Try to lose 50$ and look how you will feel about it. Try with 20$, 100$, 500$ and more, and from there, you can decide how much you can afford to lose.",

Using money that they even still need for other purposes or savings for their lives, this will certainly affect their mentality when the market becomes very unpredictable as it is now which is experiencing a deep decline, only panic and the desire to sell always arise. I am probably quite reliable in any market situation because I have gone through 3 cycles of Bitcoin and will not be affected by a decline like this.And also I use the money that I do provide for long-term investment by buying gradually when the decline continues to occur.
