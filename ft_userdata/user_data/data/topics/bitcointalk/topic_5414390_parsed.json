  "content": "Recently I have been mining with a lot of different cryptocurrency platforms that looks so promising and real to work out eventually as claimed. How I got to encounter these alt coin mining platforms (am not sure if the right word to use is platform) was through a good friend of mine whom which we're in same shit together due to a pressing need that needs a lot of money for us to procure for our proposed business.He has been introducing me into lots of these mining platforms he gets from some persons he meets online, who claimed to be paying them for lots of months, and so for a people that needs money to run a pressing need we will both engage into it out of desperation, we will end up buying a mining machine from these platforms with even the little money we have that was supposed to be a starting point of savings to our proposed business plan. To cut the whole story short, we have engaged into four different platforms just in the past two months which initially only one paid just ones and crashed, the very last one we had to purchase the platform mining machine for $250 only to get bursted like the previous ones within a space of two weeks while waiting for the 30days interval for eligible withdrawal.Although I believe there might be some real genuine mining platforms that are really trustworthy and paying but I can't say for sure which is genuine. Am just using this to remind people out here to be very careful and exercise some patience in doing some few research about these kind of issues or as it relates to this kind of situation. Our desperation has really cost us even the little we had in the process of getting more.Despite all of these, we are still unperturbed and will really welcome any real genuine mining  platform that is trusted and working as we're in really need of funds for our business plan, but this time I'll put in a lot research work on whatever comes out way to know it's trustworthiness before involving.Thank you!This is a story told by someone I came in contact with in a conventional business meeting I attended within the weekend as we were having a group discussion. The purpose of bringing this here is to bring to the knowledge of some beginners and even old users in the forum about such platforms, and to create awareness of careful even in desperate times. Further more I promised the fellow that I was going to get back to him with probable solutions to what he's looking for, and so I'll really appreciate anyone in the forum that can give any genuine information on this so I can get back a feedback to the fellow.",

The thing looks very attractive, especially for beginners who think that they are really mining something, but in fact in most cases there is no company, nor any mining devices. Sometimes, in terms of deception, the user gets the first or second payment, but only to buy a bigger and more expensive package that will never pay off.Quote from: Lida93 on September 21, 2022, 03:18:56 PMHe has been introducing me into lots of these mining platforms he gets from some persons he meets online, who claimed to be paying them for lots of months...Your friend is himself in the wrong about all this, or he is knowingly dragging you and others in because of the profit he makes from referrals. Mining, online friends and business offers, perfect scenario to lose a lot of money.Quote from: Lida93 on September 21, 2022, 03:18:56 PMFurther more I promised the fellow that I was going to get back to him with probable solutions to what he's looking for, and so I'll really appreciate anyone in the forum that can give any genuine information on this so I can get back a feedback to the fellow. Unless your friend has a lot of money, lives in a country where crypto mining is legal and electricity is cheap, I would advise him to forget that he will profit that way.",

It was said far too many times. It's just nice websites showing numbers and mining nothing.Some act like Ponzi schemes and may pay a little at first, until they catch a big enough number of fishes. Then they close and that's all. Or may even ask for more money from those who were depositing, maybe they're stupid enough and let themselves get scammed further.No.There were in the past legit cloud mining companies. 1, maybe 2-3, I don't know. But I don't think that any legit cloud mining is still operating. And even if it would work, investing there is still foolish, since one may get ROI one week after the end of the world.So it's also no.If one wants to earn from mining, he has to actually get the hardware and mine. Of course, one has to do the math, since in many countries the electricity is too expensive and mining will go at a loss.",

Especially if you only recommended it and you have no profit from it. and it doesn't have to refer only too obvious scams like cloud mining, some big platforms have gone and their users have run out of money.",

      "body": "100% of all online \"mining platforms\" commonly known as Cloud Mining services are scams using Ponzi scheme to earn money. But some of them have actual hashrate though. The problem with this type of \"business\" (with actual hashrate) that relies on small investments from users is that it is very unprofitable. So at some point they have to turn into a Ponzi scheme (sell more hashrate than they actually have) to increase their profitability. But obviously that can not be sustained since at some point they have to pay their users back the money they don't have.This is why even if you found a cloud mining service that could prove they have actual mining hardware and were really mining cryptocurrencies, you should still not trust them.",

Which is also known as cloud mining. And cloud mining is full with fraudulent people. That is why this forum is good because when you brought an issue we check on the thread and tell the reality. One thing I will tell you is that when want to join mining platform again, you should read this here before joining any. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2415854.0 . Next time please ignore their calls if it is cloud mining because they will end up scamming you. Scammers are using all means to scam people mostly these days it is through phone calls. You don't have to just join mining but read more article about so that when join mining, you will do well.",

Running your own node to farm some coins is also more profitable (albeit needs a large amount of capital to start with) compared to cloud mining, for most of them at least.Staking is usually done with altcoins whose value tends to fall, hence the overall profit may easily be none.Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that farming is done on centralized platforms and those tend to fall / get bankrupt.In my experience buying bitcoin and simply waiting for its price grow was the most successful approach.Just to make sure: this is NFA; everybody should decide for himself what he does with his money.",

Either a scam, or a total waste of money.Even then, it's usually more than just plugging in, and raking in the profits. You should be considering a lot when you're going into mining. Especially anticipating drops, as well as rises. So, if you're operating on a minimal amount of profit, it's probably worth considering whether it's worth it at all. Although, the price of mining machines usually price out anyone that has cold feet, since they're rather expensive. Altcoins are probably the more lucrative market in terms of mining, and then later converting that to Bitcoin. However, that also comes with additional risks.",
