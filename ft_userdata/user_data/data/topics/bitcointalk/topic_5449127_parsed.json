The whole market in terms of coins and tokens, the technical information, how they work, the technology and competitors, etc. I zoom into Bitcoin and learn about it bit by bit, I've been doing that for about 5 years now and in still in the learning phase as there's so much knowledge to consume. You don't need all the knowledge to use Bitcoin though, just enough to verify it works.Quote from: Why you bully me on April 17, 2023, 08:16:59 AMI see so many coins yet If I read the whitepaper or try to dive into things I quickly find out I don't really know much. Yet I see many people who are very positive on certain coins as if they've understood everything within the project and also the competition and made a good logical decision. These people are mostly going in with luck. There are thousands of coins/tokens and hundreds keep on being launched, it's impossible to understand them all or how they work, people just throw money into a couple after doing a basic research and hope they don't lose out.Quote from: Why you bully me on April 17, 2023, 08:16:59 AMMy question is how do you get to that point? Anyone have a blueprint on what they did to acquire that knowledge to figure everything out? I'm willing to spend hours on end everyday learning but would greatly appreciate pointers on where to start and go to. Those hours can be spent into learning a skill or applying oneself to an activity. The crypto Space, particular altcoins, is a can of worms where devs want to rip you off your money.",

I think that each person develops their analysis technique, based on their experience of use.  Even if you can explain some tips and tactics they use, it will always be difficult for someone else to follow those guidelines.Because, deep down, everything will depend on the feeling that each one has, and that cannot be explained or taught. For one person one type of analysis may work better than for another.Therefore, the recommendation that I always make and that works for everyone is: never invest more money than you are willing to lose.",

This doesn’t mean that is what is meant for because they must have hidden something’s. And few years you find out your assertion of the thing was wrong then you take this experience into consideration when researching another similar project.The issue of cryptocurrency is broad and can’t be boasted off by anyone to have mastered it. You just grow in knowledge as you go in the game. People that are into trading look into projects from certain perspective like what they could offer, how they want to create solutions to the problems they present and if the problem hasn’t already been addressed before. But in all honesty I think most of these investors after all these research still just leave the whole idea on gambling because even the most knowledgeable isn’t sure of any other projects.That’s is why currently when you come into bitcoin it simple knowledge because you just have to learn about its securities and wallets guides. The issue of its potential has already been resolved long before.",

One thing that I learned by venturing around the corridors of this forum for years is that there are way too many projects born every day --or weeks, the token section is currently has been quiet for a few days-- that it's near impossible to handle and understood all of them at once, and that's ok.IMO, if you plan on a short term holding --or perhaps it suits better if I say \"trading\"-- stick to old coins which are more established and less likely to be rug-pulled. Only if you're ready for a longer period of holding, you can try investing on those ICO and ITO. And by \"long period\" I am talking a period that can span for years. Focus on couple of projects only, do a deep DD on these projects and determine if they worth taking and suits your financial strategy or not instead of trying to understand as many projects as you can.Those people who seemed very positive about some coins, more likely than not they're a hired shillers and/or hyping a coin with their comments to fulfill their own agenda.Give the projects you're about to invest a thorough read, check their roadmap and their tokenomy, feel how professionally-written their whitepaper is, crosscheck their team's background, visit the scam accusation boards of this forum to see if there any thread raised on those new projects you're about to invest. There are dedicated people on this forum who actively scan the token board trying to tackle scam projects from taking advantage from the forum's members. That'll help narrow down your options.",

When it comes to reading white papers and knowing a good project to invest in, those things, I believe, require individual interest in particular kinds of projects. There are people who already have it mapped out so that when they see it on a project, they see potential in those projects. I don't think there is any certain kind of special skill that one can use to predict a good project. I believe you just need to develop yourself on how the system works, and then the rest is based on individual assumptions. No one wins 100% of all their project predictions; some times they fail, but most times they become positive for the predictors.",

It is not possible to learn everything about Bitcoin so I focus on the basics and some areas of interest. Learning everything about the crypto space is not possible. It is like learning everything about the human body, which is usually handle by diverse specialists. Reading the Whitepaper is a commendable step and my advice is that you focus only in Bitcoin and build your knowledge base in the sector. As you keep spending time in the forum, it will constantly increase your understanding of the bitcoin sector. I also feel that nobody perfectly understands the crypto sector, so some of the investment or projects that turns out to be profitable might be as a result of knowledge and luck. But if you want to reduce the risk of losing your money, invest in bitcoin only.",

If you want to do well in the forum, you need to spend time in the forum and read the posts of senior members more and more. I have seen many new members come to the forum and do great things. If you want to do good in forum then spend more time in forum and read more posts of senior members. Then you can acquire all kinds of knowledge. I hope you understand my point. thank .",

Moreover, with the help of Google & the new A.I called ChatGPT, I don't think it should be any harder for anyone not to get the needed knowledge required to effective communicate in any crypto gathering, as much as you ask the right keywords. So I will love to advise that reading whitepaper of coins can be too boring and not contain what you need as a beginner, so for a start, you can equally check this out https://academy.binance.com/en/start-here",
