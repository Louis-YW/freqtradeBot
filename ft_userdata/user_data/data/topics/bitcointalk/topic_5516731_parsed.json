  "content": "QuotePakistan has moved to legalize crypto, marking a major shift in its financial policy, which has historically labeled digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as illegal tender.The federal government has proposed amendments to its State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Act, allowing the SBP to issue the country’s money in digital currency. read here In 2023, Pakistan was very firm on their stance about crypto. They promoted the idea that using cryptocurrencies allows for illegal activities and therefore will not be encouraged and anyone to use cryptocurrencies will not be protected by the government. But now we see that they seem to be getting more lenient with crypto probably after seeing many countries adopting bitcoin and reaping rewards.This just shows that even though a country has written off bitcoin, it doesn’t mean it can’t change. What other countries do you hope to reconsider their laws about bitcoin and crypto at large? China comes to mind first seeing how strong and largely popular was crypto there.",

Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized and most secure so that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.Bitcoin adoption has been increasing and has been better than ever. Fortunately and importantly, this adoption growth of Bitcoin is irreversible too. It causes unavoidable trend globally that nations have to join the trend if they don't want their countries are falling behind what they can not ban. They can make Bitcoin illegal in their countries but citizens there will continue to use bitcoin. So at the end, these governments are losers by wasting opportunities to gain more money in tax from their citizens.So it's time for change, to legalize Bitcoin in their countries.It's time to spread the Orange color (a traditional iconic color for Bitcoin) on the global map.https://newhedge.io/terminal/bitcoin/legality-map",

China comes to mind first seeing how strong and largely popular was crypto there. believe me that most countries that looks uninterested in keying into Bitcoin adoption are doing so just because of other countries that are still skeptical about Bitcoin. Like my country for instance, the only reason why they seems to be against Bitcoin and crypto in general and hasn't made an official statement allowing it full and unsensored operation is due to the devaluation of her local currency that they tend to attribute to be caused by Bitcoin users that are carrying out p2p transactions and fixing individual rates by themselves. If the local currency gains value and some of the world powers like China, Russia and the United States keys into adopting Bitcoin as her reserve, my country will easily have a u turn on the way they look at Bitcoin. In terms of popularity and the Numbers of holders, at least 20% of citizens already know about the functionality of crypto and that's fair enough to start with.",

The text source says:QuoteAccording to a report from The Express Tribune, government sources said that digital currency was being added to the SBP Act for the first time.According to the sources, the SBP has regularly rejected digital currency proposals and issued warnings against their use until now.The new amendments propose that digital currencies can be issued by the SBP as well as traditional finance. This would allow the central bank in Pakistan to manage the country’s money “in physical or digital or both forms.”Digital_currency is not a crypto, which are a form of current money, but they are digital, completely centralized, and do not have to be on the blockchain.  So if the above quote is the only update, then nothing has changed.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency",

Everybody with a right-thinking head will later come to realise that it's better to accept it rather than reject it, because when you compare bitcoin to every other currency out there, bitcoin is superior. With time they will all see it. The governments may not admit it openly of course and they will not make it legal tender, but it will not be illegal to spend or own bitcoin. I belive that what most countries that are very strict with bitcoin need is time. That's if the country actually cares about its citizens. By the time the see how beneficial bitcoin is to the individuals, they'll lighten up towards bitcoin.",

Of course Pakistan need to amendments their regulations because it doesn't make any sense if they reject their own currency.Reading the article on the link that OP provided, it didn't specifically state that the Pakistani government is legalizing cryptocurrency, so I agree with you that it must be the writers wish. Some people will publish articles with misleading information, and someone who is not vast in the topic will easily believe what is said. I believe that in the near future, countries like Pakistan and China, that are still being skeptical about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general will have a change of mind. Bitcoin has become a store of value and it's adoption is increasing despite the unfriendly stance by some governments, I believe that in near future, they won't have much choice but to fully recognize it. The impact of Bitcoin is being felt in the US presidential campaigns, this is to show that eventually governments will adopt what the people want.",

The article content says a different thing compared to what the title carries, and it's a bit misleading. The only improvement I see in here is that they are open to embracing digitisation on their country's currency, creating something they can control both digitally and physically.  That's, by the way, in the aspect of government changing from their first decision in regard to technology to more favourable terms is based on who they have in power within the agency and those in power during the time of the current administration. If there are people who are lovers of innovation, then there should always be a change in some policy regarding that angel; if not a major change, at least a proposal to revisit those old bills can be done.",

This is why research can never be overemphazied. There are many smart people in the country that can be called upon to study a new technology and give an unbaised report of it based on concrete evidence and not assumptions. It is only through research based on evidence that we advance and make remarkable progress as a society.

It's good that they changed the law because it's stupid to abandon Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, which are the innovation of the 21th century. Just imagine, there have been only two types of money before, Coins and Paper, for 21 centuries and then came a brand new type of money, a cryptocurrency. To my mind, it's a sin to ban Bitcoin, it's a crime, really.By the way, I also think that China will soon take U-turn on Bitcoin because the USA accepting ETFs and is gaining power on it, especially if Trump wins and decides to make his crazy dream realize, that includes trying to getting the rest of Bitcoins mined in the USA. Logically, China should be interested to take some power on Bitcoin from the USA, so they have to change their stance.",

Then they must have been made understand of how it could verily contribute to their economy and citizens adopting it may somewhere rely a so source of income there.They did well with the approach i must say.",
