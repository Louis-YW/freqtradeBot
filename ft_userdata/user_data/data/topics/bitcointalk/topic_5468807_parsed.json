  "content": "Many of us know the story of Didi Taihuttu. Whom everyone knows as the Dutch entrepreneur. Didi Taihuttu originally get the world's attention when he sold all his assets and invested in crypto. He created a stir in the world because of his dangerous policies. From his story, people's interest in cryptocurrency in the world increased greatly. Didi Taihuttu is one of those people who have good knowledge about Bitcoin and who have full confidence in it. Didi Taihuttu can be a milestone for those who have made the decision to embrace their lifestyles in the digital currency or Bitcoin. Although some of his behavior was generally too risky to be accepted by everyone. But there are some positive points of view that can inspire a bitcoin holder. I have tried to bring out some points from his Bitcoin lifeTried to become financially independentDidi Taihuttu sold all his wealth and invested it in Bitcoin which was a risky decision but there was no doubt about her faith in Bitcoin. He has basically tried to keep himself independent from conventional financial institutions.Taihuttu's vision and tenacity towards BitcoinTaihuttu was able to fully trust Bitcoin. He dreamed of owning a huge sum of money investing in Bitcoin for long-term. Which was certainly a realistic. He was adamant that holding Bitcoin for the long term would guarantee success.Taihuttu's Joyful ExperienceTaihuttu learned about Bitcoin himself and subsequently inspired his family members to learn about it. When the family members acquire proper knowledge, the family supports him.Taihuttu's Fast Bitcoin AdoptionTaihuttu's relatively positive view of the Bitcoin boom since its inception allowed him to accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin at a relatively low price which was definitely more profitable for him.Above all, we can welcome his visionary decision, the way he kept Bitcoin in mind and knowledge and created a buzz about Bitcoin among the people of the world played an important role for Bitcoin adoption. For those of us who are afraid of investing in Bitcoin, Taihuttu's story will definitely add some inspiration and help make a good investment in the bitcoin.",

      "body": "The answer to the question in your thread’s title is; yes. There are still people who still take massive risks when it comes to investing and not just in bitcoin alone, people out there still sell off their assets just like Didi Taihuttu did and sometimes they are lucky and come out to be millionaires or even billionaires while some become poor.

When the family members acquire proper knowledge, the family supports him.I truly do not know if he and his family went bankrupt to invest in bitcoin but if by any chance they did, then surely the experience won’t be a joyful one instead it is the result that was joyful.",

      "body": "My wife will kill me if I follow investment decisions of the subject. Afaik he is the guys that sold everything to invest on Bitcoin. He roam the world using their car or something and live on the road. He is very lucky that he has the family that supports his crazy decision. I remember that time Bitcoin suffer huge loss after its ATH due to strong sell off.I'm not saying his decision is wrong but it's high risk and involves the future of his family. That rime Bitcoin future price has no certainty. He might ruined his family life if his bet result went bad. I'm still not on this point because I preferred to invest only what I can afford to allocate on Bitcoin and save most of my salary for future. I never imagine myself doing this all-in investment no matter how high the success rate of the investment because there's always risk of losing even with high win chance.",

Imho, very irresponsible behaviour, especially when you have 3 kids travelling around the world with you. Lucky for them they were not yet a victim of a robbery. They are not very popular with regular people though. If they are and people know they have lots of money while their camper is parked in a place accessible by the crowd, they will be mugged. Hope they will always be in a safe place, the camper is a big advertisement for BTC.Didi Taihuttu family is enough. There should be no one else doing the same investment and showing the public they go all in. They'd be putting themselves in danger if they do.",

      "body": "His action is, I’d say, rather exceptional though, and although there are possibly other people who may have followed a similar path, his sole move was not just to buy and hodl (with the income received from selling his house), but rather, he has managed to exploit his fame through lateral businesses (i.e. councillor to various corporations, courses, etc.), as well as trading. Now that the bitcoin halving is not that far away, with likely 95% (wild guess) of the people around here believe that bitcoin will easily rise, and at least double at some point in the coming year or so, it’s pretty unlikely that this strong believe (yet not certainty) will lead anyone to perform a similar action in light of the coming halving.",

You can compare a government worker in a developing country with a government worker in a developed country.I believe investment has to do with taking into consideration your income and the capital you have at hand this would be your guide in know how much you can afford to invest in Crypto-currency.",

Bitcoin maximalists can cheer for him and even consider him a woman of courage but what she did can mislead many people into ruin. Bitcoin has its potential and it is a milestone of technological advancement and a creation of one or a few ambitious minds. It can do wonders in the future but betting everything on it can be a stupid thing to do. I saw people who took similar action in the past only by observing the bull rally of the bitcoin market and ended up being broke when the bear market showed their faces.What do you mean by \"embrace their lifestyles in the digital currency or Bitcoin\"? I can see bitcoin turning into a store of value like gold because most investors don't want to use their bitcoin to purchase goods from the market. This is why bitcoin isn't that popular in shopping malls even though it offers anonymity that fiat can't. The only positive side i can see is that it gave bitcoin some publicity, and it will put a wide smile on her face if she manages to hold it till the next bull run.",

But he says he continue to trade bitcoin and so I guess he is still making money thru it and has seen the bear and bear market, maybe sold and then re-buy or re-invest.And he is only making money thru his own trading bot here: https://thebitcoinfamily.com/bam-indicator/So for me this is a big risk and I don't know if I can take that, unless I have a lot of money or silently have a plan B in case my investment didn't go well.",
