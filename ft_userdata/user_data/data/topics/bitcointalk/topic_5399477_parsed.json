USDC on TRX network is not supported in Ledger Live yet and so cannot be displayed in the Ledger TRON account. However you can use Tronscan connected with your Ledger device to view and manage your token balance. For more information please refer to our article linked below: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403786119569-Set-up-and-use-TronScan-to-access-your-Ledger-Tron-TRX-account?docs=truePlease note that when you use third party wallet, you are only using their interface. Your private keys remain secured by the Ledger device.",

Unless you have Tron on that same address, your USDT balance won't be visible or accessible through Ledger Live. I guess it's the same thing with USDC. Fund your main address with Tron, and that might do the trick. You need that TRX anyways to pay the transaction fees, so you can't move them out of LL without the native coin.",

If it doesn't, you can use third party software such as tronlink or tronscan.The problem is that Ledger does not allow any TRC20 tokens.By default, Ledger only allows you to work with tokens approved by it.I wrote to Ledger support:Good afternoon!Accidentally sent USDC trc20 to my LEDGER wallet.ID:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs per your advice on reddithttps://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/uc0jyk/sent_usdc_trc20_to_ledger_by_accident/Connected my LEDGER nano X to my tronscan.org walletUSDC is not translated, gives an error: Confirmation declined by user.USDT and TRX are successfully transferred. What could be the problem? Why is the wallet not transferring USDC exactly?Ledger support responded:Hi,Thank you for reaching out to Ledger Support. My name is Felix, and I'll be helping you with your inquiry today.If you're following the steps to use tronscan, based on the screenshot it seems like you've rejected, rather than accepted the confirmation on the Ledger device:If you verify and approve the address on your Ledger device, this should avoid the message that you've received in particular, so that you can manage your USDC on Tron in particular.If you have any other questions at this stage, please reach out, we'll do our best to troubelshoot with you going forward.The support service did not pay attention that the problem is only with sending USDC, I have no problems with sending USDT and TRX.Later, I solved the problem myself, found in the TRX application settings the option \"allow unverified contracts\" which needs to be set to \"allowed\".After that, it will be possible to transfer any TRC20 tokens through tronscan.org",

Ahh, potayto, potahto. USDT is owned by a Chinese company, while USDC is closely connected to USDC. You really shouldn't trust or use either one if you don't have to. Better keep your wealth in USD instead of USDT/USDC. The purchasing power of the token is going to be the same as the fiat asset and its derivatives it's supposedly backed by. The difference is that the token can collapse within a day and cause havoc to its holders. Still, stablecoins are a necessary evil we have to put up with.

They usually reply in less than 20 minutes during working hours in Singapore about just blocking let's say illicit transactions which may be a liability for their company. They just block with no evidence, no criminal trial, just send them 2-3 blog articles or some txds sometimes with no link between them and they just lock itUSDC is more safer on this ground, perhaps because their team is somewhat ignorant. Most of the crypto hacks on defi right now, swap on tornado to usdc instead of usdt.Nobody should use nor trust both of them.There is no backing for tether, at least it used to be in BTC. At a moment they were stating that 100% of all tether was backed by assets (not us bonds) but..: https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegalso fuck these ponzi scams",
