  "content": "A few years ago, entomologist Dr Dan Bickel discovered a new species of fly while working at the Australian Museum.This museum gives the ability to name new species to their members, who have to bid to win the naming rights. Mark Carnegie and Sergei Sergienko did just that, interestingly, using Bitcoin.Quote from: https://australian.museum/about/organisation/media-centre/new-fly-species-bitcoin/For the first time in the AM’s history, the naming rights of the fly was paid using Bitcoin by Carnegie and Sergienko, who are working with cultural institutions to ensure they aren’t left behind as the digital world evolves.Quote from: Sergei Sergienko“Whether we like it or not, Bitcoin is here to stay. It has made, and is yet to make, great changes to our world. I’m proud to have been involved in naming this recently discovered species after Bitcoin, and I thank the Australian Museum for the opportunity,”I find it fascinating that traditional institutions like the Australian Museum are embracing Bitcoin.Quote from: Mark Carnegie“We have the capability to reposition cultural institutions at the forefront of the digital revolution, and are dedicated to ensuring Australia doesn’t get left behind through the ongoing disruption,”So, there you have it, we now officially have a Bitcoin fly:",

But he would tell us that newspapers don't get outdated because there is always information inside that is new to you . This great news is almost two years old and I am just reading it for the first time, indeed information is evergreen. Some people are doing everything possible to promote Bitcoin awareness and adoption. Mark Carnegie and Sergei Sergienko have decided to give Bitcoin a legacy in the animal industry. \"Chrysosoma bitcoin\" will forever be the name of a colorful and beautiful fly that is found in Papua New Guinea. It is also wonderful to know that a reputable organization like the Australian Museum also accepts Bitcoin.",

      "body": "This seems funny. Bitcoin has become a sign of online payments more than PayPal and Visa, which have topped the lists for years. Therefore, you may find it natural for some who believe in change or not to cling to the past to defend it. Now, when you search for the word Bitcoin, you have to specialize in any field you want to search.",

It has striking copper vittae on the thoracic dorsum (see Figs 1–2). Males and females have similar leg I setation, and females, as usual in the lucigena group, are slightly smaller in size, and have different wing maculation and tibia II setation.",
