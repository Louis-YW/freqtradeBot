You know most at times not everyone has this zeal to seat and reading information from the forum then secondly after some family challenges he may decides to focused in other area of hustle to keep his family afloat.Even myself it wasn't easy with me coming back here to be active posting and reading information.Omo if your pekin and family worry you no body go tell you say make you go find way to carry survive for life and dem dey distract person too much.",

Hello Everyone, Nelson4lov here once again. Thanks to Charles-Tim for the heads up about this thread. I'm alive amd well - I haven't been sick in a long time. So a lot of things happened in the past year and some changes with led to my absence here on the forum. For one, I just bagged a B.Sc in computer science - First in my family and it was possible because of the opportunities this forum and Bitcoin gave to me. It was really hard but God made it possible and I'm done now (Internal and external defense) couldn't be more happier.Secondly, I've been playing around with a lot of development stuff lately and that has been taking my time. My final year project was a blockchain based system that I built on Celo blockchain and it was fine so moving forward, I would keep doing that in addition to reviving my activities here on the forum. That, and figuring out my next move/plan in life now I can finally tick B.Sc off my wish-list. Thanks to everyone who cared/noticed my absence (everyone I tagged and others I couldn't tag - I'm still rusty with the quotes)Â   â€“ Thanks once again. I appreciate you all.",
