Or what?Am not here to argue that there are no strong influence of the so called whales on the bitcoin market price, just as we have it under the research we do when speculating for the market, that we have to include both the fundamental and analytical analysis altogether to see what impact they can have on the market price, then maybe you could have put in this way, that probably and not that the intention for crypto reserve is the main cause, after he mentioned crypto, we don't even know whether there will be high consideration for bitcoin before any other shitcoin got involved.",

Bitcoin is literally the very reason why there is a crypto space in the first place. Without it, what would be of the crypto community? Even if bitcoin was declining, I never doubted it. My expectations of a new ATH decreased yes but I never thought that it would crash and disappear forever lol. US will not be the last country to have bitcoin in their national reserve.",

Now with Bitcoin, you donâ€™t get much of that chance since, you donâ€™t activate any forex and the currency in use here is Bitcoin. Although, there is a number of ways Bitcoin would directly or indirectly influence the economy. Thatâ€™s in terms of;1. Printing of fiat: we all know it takes money to print money. Getting these materials cost money, the energy required for production.Nations get to save money in that, money that could be channeled towards other sectors needing development.2. Citizen empowerment: if your from third world countries and youâ€™ve got some Bitcoin hodlings of your own, you would tend to appreciate just how something small could add value over time and from this value, you could invest in fields that would serve you for a lifetime.This in a way reduces the burden upon the government to provide means to earn for its citizens who would in turn become entrepreneurs and employer of labor.",

Even before is that bitcoin pumps higher than it's price before so it's not just US having crypto reserves will make bitcoin pump. Let's put the price reaching 100k. What do you think is the reason why it reaches to that price?. In my opinion, bitcoin is always have it's own place in crypto space hence its existence for 15-16 years already.",

Trading volume only means that there's a lot of money changing hands, but doesn't say whether there's more buying or selling. You need to see candles for that and the candlers are bloody red, meaning nobody cares about Trump's promises because he promised an executive order and after he was elected he signed every single order that came to his head but for the bitcoin reserve. He was so concentrated on shitcoins when he finally announced it that he forgot to mention bitcoin. It's a joke not a reserve.",

The ones that want to buy more for accumulation while the ones that want to sell. A d those who want to buy prefer the market to go dip and dipper while those who want to sell like the market to rise. So I'm whatever ways, it favoured investors and in all levels people panic. Those who to buy and sell panic at all time. So there is no big deal here to discuss. Those who understands how bitcoin investment work will not panic or fear but those who don't understand are the ones causing the commotions.",

Was the need for a cryptocurrency reserve extended to the altcoins as well? The most Iâ€™ve heard has always been about having these reserves in Bitcoin which is more reliable than the unstable altcoin. It would be so much of a gamble I would say, to look towards altcoin to serve as strategic reserve. Although, the chosen coins are those that have made name for themselves and been around for a while, I still think the choice of strategic reserves should have been left with Bitcoin.",

AFAIK Trump's government hasn't said they will buy Bitcoin Bitcoins or other cryptos up to now. They will just put in a so called strategic reserve what the US administration has seized and will seize instead of selling it. It won't push strongly the market if their crypto reserve works like that, so it's not a very bullish news actually. Many people were waiting for more than that IMO.",

Finding absolute ATH and bottom is risky and impossible, so is timing the market like when to enter and when to exit for absolute bottom and ATH. These things are impossible to do for investors and traders and only make them more confusing, hesitating and stressful.They can do easier things like focusing on their capital management: invest what they afford to lose, don't (never) invest all capital they have, and concentrate on investment in long term rather than speculation in short term or trading actively.With this mindset for capital management and their investment plan, they can apply Dollar Cost Averaging strategy, buy and hold bitcoin to get very good ROI.Dollar Cost Averaging with costavg.com include exchange feehttps://costavg.com/This DCA website is very helpful tool for investors who are applying DCA and newbies who want to explore more about DCA for their investment portfolios.",
