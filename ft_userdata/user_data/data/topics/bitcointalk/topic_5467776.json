  "content": "I am a newbie, and I want be safer.      I'm not confident in closed-source hardware wallets like Ledger. There is no security without supervision. Open source hardware wallets can be found here. (Open Source Hardware Wallets, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0)       I plan to use a 2-of-2 multi-signature wallet (Ledger + Trezor) through electrum software to manage Bitcoin on a offline computer, and two single-signature wallets (Trezor and Keystone) with passphrases through metamask software to manage Ethereum and BNB tokens.             Here are my views, open to discussion:(1) Simplicity helps reduce the chances of errors, and the current solution is not too complex.(2) All the wallets and software involved are fully open-source, except for Ledger. This ensures sufficient community oversight and scrutiny, preventing the company from engaging in unethical practices.      As for the Keystone hardware wallet, it is my first time purchasing it, and it might be the only open-source hardware wallet that supports both altcoins and QR codes. What do you think about the security of this wallet compared to Trezor?[/list]",

This can prevent hidden backdoors in the mnemonic seed, which is very difficult to verify. If there is a backdoor why would you think a passphrase would solve it?Quote(2) If I wait a few months (>2 months) to update the firmware after it was released. Then this can against malicious firmware from Trezor or bitbox company. (see “How to prevent if The Trezor release new firmware update to steal Bitcoin”, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5386771.0). If there is high-risk vulnerability being fixed you should not wait to update. So it depends on what is being updated or fixed.QuoteAre there any other possible risks from the hardware wallet companies?Supply chain attack on the shipping process and their mitigation to prevent that. Data leaks. QuoteIs it really necessary to buy a bitbox for spread risk? Of course, I will not use ledger for altcoins. Half in trezor, and half in bitbox.Spreading your funds into separate HW surely mitigates the risk by any means, but the question is can you stand with the complexities? I rather think you add unnecessary burden, noting you already have 6 HW.QuoteIs it necessary to buy a new computer (~100 $), which is only used for send cryptocurrency?I don't think so. HW should prevent attacks from the computer itself. Furthermore, you might want to consider about cold storage option if eventually you want to buy a new computer, so you are not relying on HW.",

The simpler, the less likely to make mistakes. I only plan to invest in Bitcoin because it can utilize multi-signature technology, which is highly secure. If the price of Bitcoin becomes too high one day, I intend to sell it. I will convert 1/3 of the asset into USDC and store it on the Ethereum network using a Trezor hardware wallet with two passphrases (two wallets). I will convert the remaining 2/3 into Chinese Yuan. Since cryptocurrency trading is illegal in China, then transfer it to 20 bank accounts through Binance's C2C platform, in order to diversify the risk. I believe this approach is simple, feasible, and carries minimal risk for me.",

So you are worrying about the wrong thing here. The most important part of a hardware wallet is the seed phrase generation process and how the device keeps your key offline. The passphrase is not the essential thing that manages your seed phrase. Mostly it just a way to open/accees the device.Quote from: lyw123 on September 23, 2023, 08:05:27 AMQuoteSupply chain attack on the shipping process and their mitigation to prevent that. Data leaks.

For further information take a look at their blog post: Stay safe shopping for hardware wallets.",
