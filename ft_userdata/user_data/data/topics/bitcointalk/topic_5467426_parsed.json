Frankly, I don't understand why if the the funds will be from the exchange team or they'll use testnet coins.Could you also elaborate why you specifically need \"full-time traders\"?",

In general, if KYC were not mandatory, running a campaign for about $2,000 would be enough ($100 per review and about 20 reviews)You need a more professional domain name and an expert advertising team, as the competition in this field is intense, and even services such as LBC and Paxful failed to win this competition.Quote from: Potato Chips on September 21, 2023, 10:35:43 AMCould you also elaborate why you specifically need \"full-time traders\"?I think he is looking for people who have enough experience or consider trading a full-time job.",

The problem is that identity verification must be completed, so services like BinanceP2P are still better, or decentralized services like Bisq therefore he needs a specialized team to carry out a good advertising campaign after review campaign.I looked into his account and he has other projects in the past. I don't know if he is the main developer or not, but was hoping it was non-KYC service.",

If you are really serious on getting the userbase on your site and have real feedback for improvement, you need to think about the options mentioned by hugeblack and others.Quote from: hugeblack on September 21, 2023, 01:04:13 PMWithout running a review campaign, you will not get anything, and if it is mandatory to complete KYC verification, I think the number of people who would be willing to do that here is very small. In general, if KYC were not mandatory, running a campaign for about $2,000 would be enough ($100 per review and about 20 reviews)Also, for the forum members and the testing of your site, you can lift the KYC requirements for those who participate in the review campaign (in case you decide to run one).",
