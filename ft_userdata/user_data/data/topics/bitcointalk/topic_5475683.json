The post I just quoted was directed above yours and since it’s stickled, there’s no way for you to miss it. Read what I quoted and then analyze your post to see if you’d categorize it as a post of quality or one that was made without putting any effort into it. And if you’re placed in the position of a moderator what would you do when you come across post like this?",

It is because of this security that people use Bitcoin so muchI understand that you may actually be a newbie in the bitcoin network but that doesn't mean you should take such for an excuse for not knowing what is required of you when you first join the forum before you piled up activities upto 42, this is what almost everyone knows and understand about bitcoin, including newbies, your title used is even confusing to be honest because you mentioned \"the bitcoin network\" which i expect something nee you have to say or discovered about it and not repeating what everyone already must have heard or know about bitcoin, it's makes more of a troll with less quality taughts.",

It is because of this security that people use Bitcoin so muchYes, bitcoin is decentralized so no one can control bitcoin and or increase the number of bitcoins. But even though bitcoin is decentralized, authorities such as countries can still make monetary policies towards bitcoin, such as levying taxes or regulating how bitcoin is used. But as far as I know bitcoin will die if all miners turn off their computers.",

Well, whatever the reason would be, try to add more value while creating a topic because OP's post (which means the one used to open a topic) should have more data in it compared to a reply given under a post. So, next time insert more data in the post and make it helpful. And talking about your idea of why many people adopted it, I don't think most people adopted it due to the decentralization factor because as per my experience, most of the people are joining BTC to make money out of it. Whether they are miners, holders, traders, or whatever they are just trying to make a living or want to get out of the matrix of Financial Jail, in other words, they have adopted it, to become financially free.Besides this, some adopt it to test out new things like an experiment.",
