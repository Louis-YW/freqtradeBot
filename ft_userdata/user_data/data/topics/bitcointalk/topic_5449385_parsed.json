People don't usually realize the kind of garbage/harmful info a dirty mind can produce even though they may look too attractive/fancy/useful. But when they are subjected to thorough review it becomes obvious that they are not really safe. You don't just trust your mind when it's dirty. A clean mind will actually prefer mental images/videos that come automatically with little to no effort... Or without thinking about them. Those are usually messages sent from above inform of visions and they are very reliable and can be trusted. We don't just trust our human efforts... We may be lucky most times if we don't think or imagine outside our set boundaries, law, commandments or Word of the CREATOR. But not everyone understands or knows the boundaries.",
