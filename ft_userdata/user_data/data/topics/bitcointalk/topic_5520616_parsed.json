Firstly I don't know much about crypto regulations in Switzerland however from my speculation, since they have legit bitcoin ATMs there then obviously crypto shouldn't be illegal over there. Some of the things he should consider is if he's spending illegal funds or if his address was white listed for any crime or something. However based on your explanations so far I don't think so. The only things I suggest is that he makes sure his seed is safe and if he intends hodling, keep his coins off exchanges and make use of a cold storage.",

      "body": "The question regarding being flagged by his bank is complicated to answer since the mechanisms that are put into place to classify the bank movements as suspicious are not well known. I do reckon, however, that if he continues to make daily withdraws of 10 000 CHF, this will escalate pretty quickly. As OmegaStarScream mentioned, most ATM's have cameras directly pointed at them¬† (and some even have cameras inbuilt) so he'll always leave a loose end that may come back to bite him.I would highly recommend both applications/service mentioned already : Either Peach Bitcoin[1] or Bisq[2] would suit your friends purpose. Peach Bitcoin has the advantage of having a really simple interface and allows a variety of payments that can be used in Sweden[3].

This fee is typically charged as a percentage of the transaction rather than a fixed dollar value. Bitcoin ATMs can be very high, and the exchange rates offered may not be as competitive as could be found elsewhere. For example, Bitcoin ATM operator CoinFlip charges between 4.99% and 21.90% of your total transaction amount, compared to paying between $0.49 for a Bitcoin purchase of $1 to $4.99 and 1.5% on a purchase of $1,000 or more using Paypal.",

I would say that buying small amounts, multiple times using different phone numbers to later sell them afterward (days or few weeks) is definitely a red flag.

I wouldn't pay more than a 2% fee anywhere no matter how small or big the trade is. There are a lot of ways to buy Bitcoin without doing the KYC. It actually varies how advanced a user is and how well they know about existing services. They may not trust some online services and have a fear of getting scammed. In such cases, they prefer to pay 10% extra. It is up to them if they are okay with that. Since you have other options to buy Bitcoin without KYC and without paying that much fee, it is obvious that a 10% ATM fee is just a waste of money. But I am not in Switzerland. Their situation could be something else than what I am thinking.",
