So best of luck to you.",

Share a bit about yourself, highlighting your past achievements. Provide additional details about your token, including its purpose, uniqueness, goals, and roadmap. Explain the advantages for potential investors. These are just a few of the questions potential backers will have. After all, people are unlikely to invest in something they know very little about.",

Also expect that majority will not like this seeking for investors post since to many scam pass here so for sure many already aware on any schemes and they don't like people offering something to good to be true since they know that it is scam. Many wants result so best present a running product before asking that so people could decide whether its good to invest with you or not.",

I'm not sure your project is so convincing, not that I'm patronizing but the fact there is no chance of advancement in your project this feature is very weak and there is no innovation at all in my opinion.Investors will know which projects to choose, not projects looking for investors.",

And as far as your ultra innovative crypto token, not trying to be negative, it seems that the market is already saturated with such innovations.And unless your project is like bitcoin like, meaning prime mover, you might have a hard time trying to get angel investors in your project.But you can frequent other groups though, like Telegram maybe and search for what kind of investors you are looking for.",

That's something out of this world but you have to prove to your potential investors when you pitch deck about that ultra-innovative token that you've got.Honestly, it's hard to find investors nowadays if you're a developer. If you have no self-funding then it's harder for you to get them because you really need funds to at least propose it to many investors.Go to many crypto groups and maybe someone is sharing the same interest as you and sees the potential of what you're working on. It is not going to be easy but you'll be able to find one if you're convincing.",

You can at least put some words related to your token.  I understand your concerns. Calling ourselves 'ultra-innovative' without clear evidence is bold. Let's be clear: Cogitex is a project that has the potential to change the game in artificial intelligence and space exploration. We don't talk empty words, we work on solutions and results. Investors, smart and demanding, can always evaluate the fundamental aspects of a project. And we are ready to provide them with all the necessary information. Let us prove that we are worth your attention.",

No one is born an expert, and even the most successful projects started with small steps. The cryptocurrency world is developing rapidly, and many projects do bring revolutionary changes in the financial and technological spheres.Our plans include investments in artificial intelligence and space exploration, and we see huge potential in this. However, we also realize that investor confidence needs to be earned. We are working to provide transparent information about our plans and achievements.",
