You first can ask him all you want, to send a document from the bank or the app, depending on what you want specifically, only then, after you get the funds alongside the document of the operation, you accept the fact you got the funds first and you now need to transfer your crypto to a person.(not shilling OKX, I just did p2p there sometimes )",

Thanks to the exchanges and their mediation, I am always calm that the transaction will go well. However, sometimes I came across strange guys who ignored the information I provided about the card and wrote \"send me your phone number\". I did not quarrel with one because he was persistent and I refused the transaction. I terminated it. I thought this strange guy would ruin my rating, but this did not happen.",

If you release it, the trade is completed and coin is released to your trade partner. It happened means you must assume you lose your coins already.You can start a ticket and ask staffs of that P2P platform, to investigate the trade, and ban the trade partner, but the point is if he already withdrawn that money, you have no way to get your coin back. Staffs of the P2P platform has no way to refund you, only can ban that trade partner's account.Carelessly release coin is most common mistake in P2P trading. Scammers always try to force their trade partners to be hurry as it increases chance of making mistake. They only wait for your mistake to steal your coins.",

Make sure the p2p is on TOP cmc exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, etc.2. Pay attention to the time, if the time is almost up and he is not active, find another one3. If selling, check first if the money has come in, if so, release it 4. Pay attention to transaction review5. Stay until the transaction is complete, if you have a problem, contact the support team directly.",

Next, they will say to wait and then say that they have send it to you and request to released. But here's the catch, that is the trap, they might send you fake screenshot so you better be careful and open your wallet and see if the money really deposit or not.If not then don't released it, don't be pressured by them or it worst case, don't be afraid to have this mediated by the exchange themselves and see who is telling the truth. I have that kind of experience like 2 years ago. Good thing I have this presence of mind to not fall for the scam.",

Imagine the value of what I want to trade is 50 USD for example, and the buyer is pleading to pay 45 USD, shorting me by 5USD. I have met a few of this kind and have often threatened them with reporting their accounts because it is a shameful thing to the exchange that they have people like that ruining their name.",

I Would love to know if there are cases where you've lost your coin to the buyer or instances when the system might automatically send your asset to a buyer that claims to have sent you money when he hasn't done so. others might learn from you.I think chances of such cases are less on tier 1 exchanges as I mostly use Binance p2p and before any trade, I only check the number of trades and their success rate and yeah the rates too hehe as that matters most and then I make the trade but after learning few things from the forum that we must read their policy from that point to now I am reading the policy too as sometimes they can ask for your personal number etc. or bank account number just because they have read it in their policy as necassory. Although never found any buyer or seller with such policy in my zone till now. I never had this experienece but sometimes they send less money like not much less but like few cents less i.e 0.3$ etc. they say the finance app they used deducted the fee I had this experience two times the first was smoothly solves as the buyer sent the money ASAP when I said I won't release until he send my 0.5$ left. The second was very stubborn he was playing smart with me, said I used a third person to send you funds, and I am no longer with him, I left and now he is away, he actually introduced me the third person as a shopkeeper well I said go again and make the remaining payment, it was not big like it was also 0.3 to 0.5$ and he said I will cover this payment in the next trade haha, like I would make another p2p with him again. Well, he sent me my money back after like 20 to 30 minutes. Besides these small issues, I never had any problem. BTW is this thread suitable for this section?",

It is very clear that the transaction was delayed by the sender. He might have sent the money and perhaps the account cannot withhold such an amount then the money can be reversed back. But most persons dare to test the other party if they will be foolish enough to release the crypto since they have sent screenshot of the payment but the money was reversed. One thing about P2P transaction is that if the other opponent don't want to continue he is allowed to cancel the transaction but this guy here intentionally dont want to cancel the transaction proving he is in for scam.",

You gotta be careful before you release your crypto. I guess whoever regularly sells on Centralized exchanges experienced something like this. I have encountered it twice, and luckily, I wasn't affected. The scammer marks the trade as paid without sending the money or by sending a fake SMS. I had to complain to the support and let them know that the scammer did not pay, but they marked the trade as paid. Then the customer support helped me getting my fund unlocked and the scammer was banned from the platform. The suggestion is, always check your balance before you release your crypto.",

Also the more merchants are making it more problematic. Lets say if the 1 usd is equivalent to 22-25 something bla bla in my country after the conversion but those suckers are sucking blood out of hell while buying need to pay some additional 10-20 (my country currency) to them also with limitation on either all or non quantity and same while for selling too, keeps price below.",

Am glad you were not fooled by his malicious acts. Some persons may be pressured to have release the funds without receiving payment. Also, i want to say that the exchange you conducted your P2P in did not take actions quicker. 4 days is a long period when there is enough evidence against the scammer. This may put fear/panic to the other party who is innocent to make wrong decisions. However, the scammer is more familiar with this exchange and knows all the mode of operations in terms of longevity to response to issues like this. That is the main reason he left the trade active and refused to cancel it.",
