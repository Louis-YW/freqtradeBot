I have been following up on the games because my country Nigeria is in attendance,  I have also been expecting a thread on it, very good to see one here...We have some golds already to our name, what we (Nigeria) will be expecting is for us to break our personal record of finishing the commonwealth games with 11 golds as usual. We have 5 already from the games we have participated in, I am positive that this current team representing my country can break the Jinx.",

Just a 11 medals difference. Australia have totally won 145 and England have won 134. The difference in gold medal between the two is 7 medals. I'm sure this time the winner on the medals table is Australia and my bet is on Australia.",

Australia has three times as many medals as India, despite having just 2% of the population. During the recent years, there have been a lot of focus on sports, especially athletics and badminton. But none of it seems to have paid off. Luckily we managed to finish above New Zealand (which has 1/300th of the population of India). Maybe it is time to admit that Indians are not made for athletics. May have something to do with the genes.",

You can't be farther from the truth.India has a population of 1.2B, with enough talent. But they lack infrastructure, guidance, and in a few words: money.There's a much higher chance for someone living in a first world country to be able to dedicate his whole life to a sport without worrying about his livelihood, compared to someone from a developing/poor country(like India).My cousin(who won Silver in this CWG), is a farmer   They have almost nil familial wealth, could only practice for like 2 years and still won a Silver",

She is an inspiration to other athletes who believe that they will one day be the first to hold a world record for their country. Other records that were Ratified by the athletics body are;- Armand Duplantis record 6.21m (Pole Vault)- Sydney Mclaughlin record 51.41s, 50.68s (400mH)- Letsile Tebogo record 9.94s (WU-20 100M)source",
