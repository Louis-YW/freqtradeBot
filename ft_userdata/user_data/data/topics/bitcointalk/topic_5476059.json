  "content": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-crypto-front-emerges-israels-militant-financing-fight-2023-11-27/\" A new front has emerged in Israel's fight against the funding of Iran-backed militant groups from Hamas to Hezbollah: A fast-growing crypto network called Tron.Quicker and cheaper than its larger rival Bitcoin, Tron has overtaken its rival as a platform for crypto transfers associated with groups designated as terror organizations by Israel, the United States and other countries, according to interviews with seven financial crime experts and blockchain investigations specialists.A Reuters' analysis of crypto seizures announced by Israeli security services since 2021 reflects the trend, showing for the first time a sharp rise in the targeting of Tron wallets and a fall in Bitcoin wallet seizures.\"Earlier it was Bitcoin and now our data shows that these terrorist organizations tend to increasingly favor Tron,\" said Mriganka Pattnaik, CEO of New York-based blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, citing Tron's faster transaction times, low fees, and stability.\"___Previously, Reuters wrote bad articles about Binance, but no one thought that this would be the beginning of a major process against this exchange.",

I send Bitcoin from my wallet to the exchange, then exchange it into USDT Tron, and then send it to a local broker to convert it to a local currency because this is the only way available in my country.Yesterday I saw an advertisement on the Telegram channel of the financial brokerage I use stating the need to use a coin other than Tron, but I did not think that there were legal problems threatening Tron, such as supporting terrorism.This is really disgusting, so what is a good stablecoin that has cheap and fast fees if Tron gets banned?",

From the point of view of regulators, this is the correct “blockchain”, and the blockchain throne is alien from Asia",
