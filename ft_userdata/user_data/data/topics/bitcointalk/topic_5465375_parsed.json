If majority of tokens belong to team members or some whale wallets, you can smell risk of rug pull or dump from those wallet holders. Avoid any project has such risky token distribution.",

      "body": "Cryptocurrencies come in various forms, with differing levels of decentralization. At one end of the spectrum, we have cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are known for their high degree of decentralization. These cryptocurrencies operate on the blockchain youve likely heard of, where transactions are recorded on a global network of nodes. No single entity or organization has absolute control over these networks. Instead, transactions are verified and added to the blockchain by a decentralized network of participants using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). This decentralization is a key feature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, promoting transparency, security, and resistance to censorship.On the other hand, some cryptocurrencies are more centralized in nature. These often have a central entity or organization that issues or controls the currency. For example, Ripple's XRP is managed by a company called Ripple Labs, which has a significant level of control over XRP transactions and its supply. Also, stablecoins like USDC or USDT are issued by centralized entities that hold reserves of traditional fiat currency. While these cryptocurrencies offer stability and quick settlement times, they may not provide the same level of decentralization and censorship resistance as Bitcoin or Ethereum.",

So bitcoin became anonymity. As others have said, if any other cryptocurrency which the creators are well known and still involved in the management then it is a central system because they can manipulate the process for the owner.

Yea because the crypto is not bitcoin there is a high tendency that it will fail,and that is why you should only invest on altcoins with money that you can avoid to loss because it is like gambling. You can wake up one morning and the project have crashed. Sometimes they are scam projects.

We have an ongoing problem which is the blockchain Trilemma consisting of Scalability, Decentralization and Security. For the records, Bitcoin is the most decentralized but not the most scalable. Other projects that try to fix all three problems often have shortcomings in that regard. For protocol-level decentralization, we have nodes. If tgey have a foundation, then they need decentralized decision making which is expensive and time consuming.DeFi based projects often have access controls backed into their projects (core functions that only privileged roles can call).",

No altcoins could be Defi, technically, almost all of them are centralized.Quote from: Okwara on September 02, 2023, 09:09:12 AMBut again, I've heard about investors losing their money in crypto due to irregularities from the project owners. And this brings me to wonder if these teams still have control over the crypto that is supposed to be decentralized? Or is it that some cryptocurrencies are decentralized while some are not?There are many ways that investors lost money, there could be exit scams, hacks or just what you describe, owners themselves turns rouge and steal all the crypto of their investors. And with that, as a investors, just be careful where you put your money, that's why majority here invest it in BTC as we have total control of our seed and private key.",
