  "content": "FUDsters on social media are out in strong force again, trying to suggest that Binance would be about to collapse any day now.  While some criticism against centralized exchanges is definitely justified, the recent wave of FUD against Binance is not beneficial at all because it's mainly based on speculations. Due to the public nature of Bitcoin's Blockchain, some public addresses from Binance are providing an estimated insight how much BTC is owned by Binance. Yes, real Bitcoin on the Blockchain! CryptoQuant a company known for Blockchain-related researches has provided detailed insights: https://cryptoquant.com/dashboard/639937bbfbe454308ff04670Since Bitcoin is a public Blockchain, Glassnode is updating all Bitcoin holdings on Bitcoin adresses associated with Binance: Yes, we should go for \"not your keys not your coins\" and avoid to leave our coins on exchanges but creating unnecessary, unproven FUD, should be avoided as well. It wouldn't be beneficial at all if Binance FUD will become our Tether FUD 2.0. Calm down, HODL your coins on your own wallet but don't fall for such cheap and unproven FUD.",

They have always tried to reduce their expenses when other exchanges are reckless in spending. When FTX and others are splashing money on celebrities and several sports outfits for promotion and endorsement, Binance was busy building customers' trust and confidence. Binance is one of the few crypto companies that never sacked any of their staff during the winter season but they even added to their workforce. Although these exchanges cannot be trusted because I might not know what is going on in the secret but compared to other exchanges Binance seems to be the best among equals. This FUD is caused by cheap speculators and some Bitcoin haters that want to destabilize the system by all means. Also, the US government's investigation of Binance is one of the catalysts of this FUD.",

While there is still a chance of misappropriating user funds / hacks / management error etc. Well, let's see how this plays out, but all in all I am sceptic if big fundamental changes in crypto-exchanges and people handling their funds will be of longevity.",

But as Binance's CZ himself would have it:https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602590863451889665https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602905590384181248?cxt=HHwWgICytYqJ1b4sAAAASo, I guess CZ is somehow seeing some fair justifications of FUD. After all, he started some himself. In an unlikely event that Binance would \"collapse any day now,\" would Bitcoin's price be severely affected? Probably, yes. And if the collapse of FTX and Binance would also mean other centralized exchanges lose people's trust and confidence and would also collapse, it will certainly shake the market. But I think it would be beneficial to Bitcoin, and whatever it fights for, in the long run. For one, the age of paper Bitcoin and IOUs might come to an end. Anyway, I know this is a non-issue to many, but I find CryptoQuant's way of putting it a little odd. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1603537076225335296",

Binance will collapse, we just don't know when the exact date. I believe no one think FTX will collapse since many people considered FTX is a Binance killer or top 2 exchange, but right now it was proven. There's no effect between FTX bankrupt with Bitcoin price because the one who control the coins is Sam Bankman Fried, so if Bitcoin price is dropping, pretty sure he's the one who sell Bitcoin since the users don't have any way to access their coins.People who hold their Bitcoin on the other centralized exchange doesn't directly sold their coins to fiat if they see such news, they can easily sold it by send it to their non custodial wallet.",
