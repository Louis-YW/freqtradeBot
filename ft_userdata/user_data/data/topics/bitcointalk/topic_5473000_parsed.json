Can it be done?You are using a non custodial wallet, that gives you private key of your wallet.With private keys, you will be able to get public key, public address (receiving address).It is your receiving address for other people to send bitcoin to you.If you want to send your bitcoin to other people, you need their receiving addresses and you must ask them about those addresses.Learn more about Keys, addresses in Mastering Bitcoin Book. Also read more in the Wallets chapter.",

      "body": "Quote from: Cleanshit on November 05, 2023, 11:32:30 PMWithout installing any third-party software which I don't completely trust it functions wellBitcoin Core is no more official than any other Bitcoin wallet software.  It is just as \"third-party\" as anything else.  It has a fancy name, and it is popular so it's currently considered to be the \"reference client\", but if some other full node software were to become more popular than Bitcoin Core, then, due to how the bitcoin protocol works, that other software would be the \"reference client\".Quote from: Cleanshit on November 05, 2023, 11:32:30 PMIs it possible to use the send  toaddress and  get new address functions on my PC only if I have the wallet.dat file?To send a transaction, the wallet software needs to know what bitcoins you have.  Bitcoin Core determines this by downloading the blockchain and noticing EVERY transaction that sends bitcoins to a transaction output that it knows how to access.If you only want to store private keys, and generate receiving addresses, you can do that with Bitcoin Core without downloading the blockchain.  If you want to be able to tell when you've received a confirmed transaction and/or you want to be able to send any transactions, you'll need to have processed most of the blocks (enough of them to have gotten caught up to where the bitcoins are confirmed).Quote from: Cleanshit on November 05, 2023, 11:32:30 PMI'm not interested in downloading the entire blockchain files.Then you're not interested in running a full node.  Why are you using Bitcoin Core?Quote from: Cleanshit on November 05, 2023, 11:32:30 PMCan it be done?Sure. You can use a SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallet.Quote from: Cleanshit on November 05, 2023, 11:32:30 PMHow do ledger wallet keys operate?The blockchain is not replicated in this little key. And it functions!Correct.  The ledger device stores only the keys and the necessary software to communicate with other wallet software.To use the ledger device you have to connect it to wallet software (such as Electrum).  Most of the software set up to work with the Ledger are SPV wallets.  The wallet software handles verifying when payments are received/confirmed as well as building the transactions to send bitcoins.  When you want to send bitcoins, you first use the wallet software on some other device (such as a computer) to build the transaction. Then you send the unsigned transaction over to the Ledger device.  From the Ledger device, you can sign the transaction. The signed transaction is then sent back to the wallet software which then broadcasts it to the network.",

Can it be done?Then your only option is to use an SPV wallet (example is electrum and sparrow) which definitely you have to trust a third party and that actually hampers your privacy because these wallets know what you own. The other thing might be a pruned node but you still have to download all the blockchain but will just keep a few of them mostly the one that has details of the address you are using and if you want to use another address you will have to download all the blockchain again. The SPV wallet will allow you to generate new address for every new transaction but your privacy will certainly be at risk",

Also according to your explanation of a size of 10GB is assigned to the pruned node, it will delete older blocks as new blocks begin to build up, so as to maintain the size (I.e) or the new blocks just continues to add up which will actually increases the size and could make it bigger than that 10GB in future? Should the the older blocks be deleted what happens to the first address of one if its transactions falls into those deleted old blocks?",

Bitcoin Core already saved the related transactions in the wallet.dat file so your wallet wont need to rely on the raw blockchain to view the balance or create transactions.Besides, the \"UTXO set\" and \"block index\" aren't deleted with pruning so your node still know the unspent transactions in the deleted blocks.The issue is when it need to rescan and verify them from the raw blockchain which is needed when importing an address which will cause issues if it has txns from the pruned blocks.",

Ledger also offers the option of connecting to a Bitcoin node of your choice in Experimental Mode. This means that you don't necessarily have to trust external servers, but can also set up a node yourself and let it communicate with Ledger (live):Here you can see how it works: SETTING UP YOUR BITCOIN FULL NODEBut I have to admint that I have never used this feature myself.",
