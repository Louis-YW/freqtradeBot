Link to news:https://decrypt.co/118319/white-house-claims-meetings-between-sbf-and-senior-biden-officials-were-about-pandemicDo you trust this ? Define your question better.... I trust this news source as it aligns with other news sources that I have come across. Basically SBF was in bed with SEC chair Gensler and mainly the Democrat party (although he made donations to Republicans later in FTX's demise to obfuscate in my opinion). SBF laundered money to the Ukraine, I mean where is all this money going to for that war? The Democrats have passed numerous spending bills to support them yet they are still fighting this war with Russia to a stalemate and even loss in some regions (mainly the dominant Russian ethnic ones kind of like Vietnam or Afghanistan hmm). I'd say the money sent to Ukraine went into SBF and his Democrat's pockets matter of fact Biden once bragged about firing the head prosecutor in Ukraine for investigating his son but they didn't because he was fired because they wouldn't get the billion dollars back in 2016 or 2017 (I forget what year). The better question you should ask is why do you trust the mainstream media so much when they lie to you? I've got another thread on this here with a poll granted at present SBF is on bail but a lot can happen in a month or year. Regardless I'm closing polling in February:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5428115.40",

The government would always cover-up its shady deals with corrupt business owners. Sam Bankman-Fried was very smart lobbying both Democrats and Republicans because he wanted favor from both. It is not possible that they discussed just his donations to pandemic victims. There would be other secret discussions that would benefit a key donor like SBF. But the White House has bluntly that such discussion took place but the next government would unveil the truth to the public like in the case of Donald Trump. Returning SBF's donations to FTX is commendable and others should ensure they refund the money they collected. Joe Biden should be a role model, let him send back the money he collected, maybe some investors might be able to get some or part of their money from these refunds.",

Recently, the SBF pleaded not guilty in court, and the trial was delayed to October this year. I suspect this is just a ploy to deny all responsibility to investors. The government briefly arrested and prosecuted SBF when FTX collapsed but was later able to free him and postpone his trial until the end of the year. This is really absurd. Everything reminds me of the downfall of Mt.gox, almost 9 years have passed, and not a single victim has been able to get their money back.",

They may have met under the guise of the pandemic but what does SBF know about COVID? Is he in a business that's particularly affected by COVID? He's a big donor and this is how you get political sway in Washington. You donate a lot of money, then suddenly the political establishment begins to invite you for discussions of unrelated topics and seemingly the influence into policy starts there. The feds allege in their indictment that he used FTX money and donated it to political campaigns to gain political access so matter how the White House chooses to muddy the waters, he's being criminally charged for his political contributions.",

However, it seems a bit hard to believe the prima facie look. We do not have helpful information, such as meeting minutes or an official press release, right after the meeting. Let's wait for more details to get revealed!",
