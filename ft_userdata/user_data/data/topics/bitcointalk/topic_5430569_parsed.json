And I believe the Tekken mobile you mention is still something akin to the earlier Mortal Kombat.Since gamblers will not be relying solely on luck in this scenario, I doubt that the majority of them will agree to it, though there will be some who will strongly agree on this being integrated into casinos. After all, you shouldn't expect everyone to embrace your suggestions; there will always be those who will oppose it.However, bets like this already exist in local gaming shops where both players wager a certain amount that the winner will keep.",

Games on esports betting are mostly ones with huge community of players. If I'm not mistaken, p2p games such as tekken and mortal combat, has not that large community of players; mostly are the ones with consoles at home. Unlike with MOBA type of game or multiplayer games which somehow has a bigger fan base. I'm not quite sure why. I've experienced playing 'versus' games and they re fun to play but ofcourse 'majority' would be more considered. If you really like to, you may find fellow bettors on a p2p tournament to somehow be ble to bet on it. But it would be hard to assume it on a bigger 'stage' on this industry, atleast for now.",

Why not open games players vs players.There are some gambling games where you can duel against other players but that could still look boring to you if you compare it to your example of a PVP. It would probably take more resources for casinos to put up such type of games than you imagine so it makes sense to focus only on the usual.Maybe ask those creators of games such as Tekken why they don't add a betting feature.",

Poker is even great on the casino gambling side among gamblers yet it still have difficulty for casinos to have lot of players. I think cool games aren't for gambling, it's solely for gaming lads.",

But as casino are business, they will have to weight everything the cons and pros and it just shows that they are leaning towards the latter and so they won't incorporate it. Although there could be casinos that have specialized on it, but as we have seen, they are not as popular as a online casinos that have sports bet and slot machines and games that can be find on regular land base casinos.",

As this is considered as a business, releasing games that are mostly skilled-based (pvps, etc.) compared to the traditional luck-based games (poker, slots, etc.) would hurt the profit of the establishment. If a person can win purely based on skill, then it somehow eliminates the element of luck on which a casino is founded on gambling.In conclusion, there would be no \"gambling\" per se and as it can completely change the whole business model of the casino. I think that is the reason on why gambling companies are hesitant to release such games to date.",

Maybe this is more of a trend currently developing so that casinos only follow existing trends and try to develop them by owning or adding other gambling games that are expected to attract more gamblers.",

But games like mortals combats are old popular games that players will love to see them back on the casinos with advanced features and outlooks that will give combatants a nice experience playing those old games again, I believe the web3 virtual gaming industry is growing fast and soon we will have web3 casino offering such games for their client to enjoy and compete against each other.",
