  "content": "Hi everyone,I've been working on a creating a decentralized general artificial intelligence for some time.  Since I believe will be a viable project and I know how to deploy it properly, I decided to release it in steps and document each step properly.Ill be using this thread to update the documentation, creation and deployment of the project.Here's a more detailed post about the project: https://blog.steve.care/p/building-a-community-first-artificialThe first step to create a AGI is to first create tools to validate, parse, extract and compose data.  So I created a scripting language that do that.  Here's a post explaining the syntax of the language: https://blog.steve.care/p/bytescript-a-data-manipulation-softwareMy next posts will explain the architecture of the script's blockchain-based ecosystem,  Ill update this post every time there is an update.If you have any question about the project, simply post them in comment and Ill answer everyone.Thanks for your interest in the project everyone!",

But AI professionals must first of all take measures to ensure that the significant capabilities of AI that are superior to humans cannot be turned against humans themselves.Recently, the United States conducted a simulation of air combat between a person and AI. The man was only able to hold out for a minute and a half, as the AI fully foresaw his actions. Humanoid robots are already declaring that humans are imperfect and subject to destruction. Therefore, the Skynet version of their film \"Terminator\" now does not seem so fantastic. Early books on robotics always talked about the three laws for robots, and the first of them was: a robot cannot harm a person. \"If you do not pay attention to this, humanity will definitely be destroyed by AI.",
