Why don't you accept escrow as long as the buyer will pay escrow fee?Do you have a list of websites that have been tested using the card and proven to work?Do I need to do KYC or send personal information?How can it be proven that they are legitimate and legal cards and not stolen or hacked?Do you have a site to make transactions or is it done manually? If it is manual, how do you deal with reliable services (the third largest bank) and you do not even have a website?",

My telegram info is on the post or you can simply send me a message here. As for escrow. This is going to make me sound like an absolute class A a**hole but all the questions you asked me about my service, Provide me the member with the best escrow service here and besides the forum rep answer the same questions about them for me that you asked me about my service. Â As far as the cards being legality, these are cards issued from our accounts as either expense or employee cards. You`ll be getting the same card we issue vendors, employees or online service providers. Would be a bit messy using the same card for Google, AWS, LawDepot, state fees, and employee spending... Also we have multiple website. We provide non gray market business services on our site which is why I don`t list it here and why we have access to the tools and services we have access too. If this becomes worth time and resources then a dedicated a website will be created. Until then, its a post on a forum. With that said if you`d like a vouch card. Go ahead and contact me.https://i.imgur.com/B159yPK.png Your vouch card is ready to go. Next move is on you. @resellersolutionshttps://t.me/Resellersolutions",
