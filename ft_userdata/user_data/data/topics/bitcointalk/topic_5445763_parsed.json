  "content": "Another big fight coming up! There's been a lot of talks already about the lineal and former undisputed champion Josh Taylor fighting Teofimo Lopez. Today it is confirmed that both fighters will duke it out this coming June 10. It's weird since Josh Taylor was supposed to rematch Jack Caterrall in what was supposed to be his last fight in the division before moving up to 147. Now Caterall is anxious and mad knowing Taylor will stay in the division and will face Teofimo Lopez. Teofimo Lopez had a bad performance against Sandor Martin in his last fight. Unluckily for Sandor Martin, he was robbed of another upset victory.   Professional win-loss-KO/TKO recordsJosh Taylor: 19-0-13 KOsTeofimo Lopez: 18-1-13 KOsMy take is prime Josh Taylor would've easily schooled Teofimo Lopez and might take him out in the late rounds. But considering the 1-year inactivity of Josh Taylor and he admitted before that making weight is so difficult already as he aged. Earlier, the only reason Taylor stayed for 1 last fight against Caterrall is in order to settle their controversial first fight. Now I am not counting out Lopez as we do not how what version of Taylor will show this June 10. But I still believe Taylor will be the slight favorite here.    Source: https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/23399782.teofimo-lopez-confirms-date-proposed-josh-taylor-bout/",

      "body": "The records of this two players was almost same,but Josh Taylor was the opinion of the most of the gamblers.Because his strength was huge compared to the Lopez.Taylor had their huge records in the ring as compared to the Lopez.The Knockout time of the Taylor was less as compared to the Lopez.The punching power of the Taylor was huge and expensive one comparison to the Lopez.It doesn’t mean the Lopez was potential less and power less player,while comparing among this two players.Josh Taylor will be the opinion for the most of the gamblers.This is not by the single game of Tylor,this is because of most of tylor was huge difference in the knockout of all the games,his knockout styke was huge different one.",

      "body": "Another good fight, but it's really risky for Lopez to take this challenge, he's like beat the best boxer in light welterweight. However he reminds me when he take a challenge to fight with Lomachenko, where at that time Lomachenko is the best boxer in lightweight. The difference is Lopez was beat every boxers easily before fight with Lomachenko, this time he was struggling when he fought Sandor Martin, so I don't really expect Lopez will win this fight. Remember Jack Catterall was give a good fight with Taylor, but the judges tend to favor on Taylor. I think Lopez must KO Taylor if he want to win, if it goes to distance Taylor should be the winner.",

My prediction here is TKO because we already know how strong Josh Taylor is in this weight division and this fight here is his message for his next opponents in the upper division it means he will go to each one of them and they gonna need to watch out. Hope that he will win easily on this one and will gonna move there fast.",

After all June 10 we will see them which will really inspire the audience.Defeats? He has lost only once. I will be supporting Taylor in this fight. I dont like Lopez and what he has become after his fight against Lomachenko. He has defeated a very strong opponent and that made him lost his mind. His father made him believe that he is not the greatest and unbeatable, that he will now decide who is going to be defeated next. Glad that Kambosos has brought him down from heaven to earth.  Taylow has a perfect record, he is more experienced, is higher and has reach advantage. Everything points on that Taylor is going to win imho.",

Both are looking weak.Lopez has weird records somehow he managed to beat Loma yet was also close to losing against Sandor. He still manages to capitalize on Loma's loss giving more fights with weird results. I wouldn't say he could win but with his luck, he might actually just kick Taylor for cherry-picking, and if that is the case it's Lopez fighting Cattrall.",

      "body": "Great move by Top Rank to give Lopez a chance to get a belt at 140 lbs, hehehe. It was supposedly a rematch between Taylor and Catterall, but Josh got injured or something and so they postponed it. However, this news surfaces a few weeks after that and Catterall was sidestep by the announcement. But he can't do anything as this is official now. Yeah, lots of issues with Josh now, his fight with Catterall was controversial, having problems making the weight limit and his injuries. And with that, Lopez will definitely be a live dog against the champion here. He doesn't look good or sharp at 140 lbs in my opinion, but this is a opportunity that he won't passed and so I'm giving him a chance to pull an upset.",

Catterall did well and might deserve that win but the best of Taylor was supposed to just steamroll him that night.The fight will be in the US so if the rounds are close, the judges might favor Lopez. Devin Haney should he win over Loma might be next if Lopez wins. Taylor might seriously move up in weight after this win or lose.",

It would have been best to put an end to the doubts. Catteral would be a good fight and not the WBO's will for him to fight Lopez.",

Same with Lopez, he was in his prime, although one issues is that he has also a hard time hitting 140 lbs. And so was a narrowing decision win against Catterall. And they are supposed to fight for a rematch, but not going to happen.So this fight could be another break for Lopez, or Josh Taylor winning but might be moving to the higher weight division because he might not make the 140 lbs if he insists to stay here. I haven't seen the odds but it might be close.",

I think it's a good move by Bob Arum to bring Josh Taylor to US soil to exposed him because not everyone knows that he unify the belt in 140 lbs although he beat Ramirez in Las Vegas. But in his next fight which is against Jack Catterall it was in Glasglow.So if Taylor wanted to established his name, he should be fighting in the US more often starting in this fight against Lopez.",

As usual, Josh Taylor will be on the A-side because he is the WBO champion and will be a slight favorite among the bookies list. But comparing between the two of them, this will be a hard fight for Teo Lopez because Taylor is not an easy one. Even that 1 year inactivity probably won't have any setbacks on his side.",
