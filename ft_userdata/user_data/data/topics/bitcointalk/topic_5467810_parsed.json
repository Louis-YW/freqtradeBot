Before the meme coin bubble we were considered investors in modern, innovative technology, after the meme coin bubble we are considered gamblers with a kindergarten mentality. The meme coin bubble ridiculed the entire industry and probably scared away serious investors and technology creators.shame shame shame",

It's another meme coin following DogeCoin so that it makes it special?I think this is just another obvious post shill though, sorry to burst the bubble to the OP. I do understand, in the last bull run, perhaps a lot of us here makes huge profit from it and maybe there are individuals who wanted to have that kind of run in the next bull run. So they will have to shill it again and again. However, this might back fire for those holders, just saying.",

So far, Shiba Inu (SHIB) not build real community or get new partner for progressing their project in the future. Only how to make investor are interested for investing in Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin and waiting price up for taking profit, need new innovation for Shiba Inu (SHIB) if want to be more popular altcoin or shit in the future by adopting in real business and become partner for several payment transaction.",

I mean it all started with Doge and we all know that when you are a prime mover here, you will stay and survived in this market.But now sure about Shib, sorry for those supporters here, but I think it's just a fad or what we call hype in the market. So there will be time that it will be pump hard and then goes down. Unless you are in for that kind of pump and dump scheme, then maybe you will go and invest on this kind of projects. But for those who are really looking for solid project, I guess this kind of meme coins are not for us.",

Unfortunately, you'll make a mistake from choosing this while the hype is over and I will tell you that it was hard to expect from a project that comes from hype to rise again. Shiba was known in the fast few days but it was already closing its popularity then and all the investors who are still holding this is already suffering losses.",

We need to start analysing and shortlisted the potential coins now itself.",

Well, they offer a nice APR I saw it, but they are also \"KYC mandatory\", something I don't like... so I didn't even register on the site.

Well, Shiba Inu is just a meme coin... maybe we will see some price rise in the future, maybe not, but I don't expect miracles in some short period of time.
