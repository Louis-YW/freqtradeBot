Currently, the price of bitcoin is still low, which is an advantage for you and me, so you should use it for your benefit. Don't miss this moment because if the price rises above $ 30k, you will surely complain when the price drops again. And it will be useless if you complain because moments like these would have passed.",

Why are so many people now at 28,000 USD thinking about selling now? The price is nothing compared to the ATH, long term bitcoin is going to rise much higher. The inflation in the world is going to push BTC, so is the halving next year. Like you I was buying last year and all my purchases are in the green now. Making small purchases every month was the best approach to get cheap entry prices. In my opinion it makes no sense to sell any coins right now. I will rather keep buying more coins when I have available money to spare. When selling now the risk of missing out on the next big rally would be too big.",

First, it's important to recognize that investing in a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin (BTC), can be a volatile and risky endeavor. The price of BTC has experienced significant fluctuations in the past, and there is no guarantee that its value will continue to increase in the future.Quote from: Solokan on April 03, 2023, 01:49:35 PMI want to ask if you also keep holding btc?The decision to hold or sell BTC is personal and depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance and market outlook. BTC is a volatile and risky investment. However, if you believe in the long-term potential of BTC and can handle the risks, it may be worth keeping your investment.Quote from: Solokan on April 03, 2023, 01:49:35 PMand the reason I hold btc is because I believe the price of btc in 2024 will be high and there will be no more btc prices like now.It is also important to know that BTC has demonstrated tremendous resilience and growth since its inception in 2009. Many investors and analysts believe that BTC has the potential to become a valuable asset class and a store of value over time.If you believe in the long-term potential of BTC and have a high risk tolerance, it may be worth keeping your BTC investment in check despite short-term market fluctuations. On the other hand, if you need funds for other purposes or are not comfortable with the current market conditions, it is best to sell some or all of your BTC holdings.",

Many people are expecting bitcoin to recover quickly, and bitcoin will enter the bull market soon, I think they may have bought enough bitcoin for themselves, or they have bought too much at a high price. But honestly, I prefer bitcoin drop to a quick recovery because I believe once bitcoin recovers and enters the bull market, that means we will no longer have the opportunity to buy cheap bitcoins. as of now. I don't like buying bitcoin at a high price because the profit won't be greater than when we buy at the lowest possible price.",

Trust me, the more you keep your Bitcoins, the less you will want to let them go. Initially, it will definitely be difficult and conflict with needs, but back to the intention, determination, and belief that welcoming the Halving later we will see the highest price that exceeds last year.",

This is only the beginning, you could even say that bitcoin is still below the level, so DCA can still be implemented regardless of the current price.They could be under again but that's also not really a good reason to sell, we are here indeed maybe partly just to trade but partly it is clear that we are in for a long term investment so the current price is nothing if we look at the ATH expectations before even a new ATH that sooner or later was bound to happen.",

If you don't need money and believe that the price will be even higher next year, then forget about everything for at least one year.I personally would not sell at this moment if I were only focused on profit, because a few months ago (but also now) is perhaps the best time to invest, given the assumptions that the price will rise significantly next year after the halving. Of course, this is all just speculation and it doesn't have to be like that, so everyone has to decide what to do and at what time.",

But before the year ends, prices will still go above $30,000. Every Bitcoin investor always has a target price they wish to sell at, but due to market manipulation, they sometimes feel tempted to sell. I just learned that the best way to invest in bitcoin is to use the DCA strategy and also set a certain amount to invest every week or month so that you don't need to invest way too much that you will need to sell at a low price to meet your needs.For me, I am not certain as to when I will sell my bitcoin, but if I see a stable price and a profit, I believe I will be tempted to sell some of my holding.

Some other people like me believe that the price will still go higher than the current price, that is why we still need to hold. I have heard some friends state that they will be selling because they feel that the price will crash so that they can buy again and hold until it comes up gain.

As we look at the chart of Btc, you can say that bullish trend is going to take off. When you see a displacement, it only mean that there is a strong buyers or sellers. It should be a sign of strength, and there's a choch or MSbB already, this only mean that the reversal of the trend is already happened. Take a look at the weekly chart since the higher time frame will follow. There's a sign of weakness because the demand is low. In other term, it'll be called as a Distribution. So the possible next move of the market is declining or retracement, before it will continue to go up. That's why I believe that the price of Bitcoin will possibly break the current ATH in 2024.",
