  "content": "Being a natural statistician due to the responsibilities of adulthood, which include earning and spending among others, I stumbled on a statistical term applied during crypto and non crypto online casino/slot games alike. The provably fair system operates on the blockchain network with transparency, no third party authentication needed and a higher Return to player (RTP) ratio, which determines a punters chance of winning on a specific game.Provably fair system is an algorithm that checks and verifies an online casino’s fairness towards its players. It is a way of making sure that the gambling operator is not cheating anyone and that you get a fair deal on every hand you play.Provably fair uses three variables:*Server seed – this variable is provided by the site.*Client seed – this variable is given by the player’s browser and can be adjusted by them.*Cryptographic nonce – a number that grows parallel to the bets a player makes.The process is a bit complicated, especially for those who are not versed with bitcoins or cryptocurrencies. For more read in order to better understand this phenomenon, visit the link below.Ever heard of the provably fair system for both non-crypto and crypto casino and slot games? If yes, how did you get to figure it out? If no, would you love to research further and apply this?https://worldfinancialreview.com/what-does-provably-fair-mean-for-crypto-casinos/",

About the non-crypto casinos, i don't know never tried one, but i think they don't have such since i visited some casinos' site before yet can't find a page related to it.",

      "body": "The provably-fair system has been around for quite some time now, and even though I'm not familiar with the intricacies of it, I at least know how it works and why it's important in today's time for the gambling industry. It helps remove client distrust on a gambling platform by means of employing a tamper-proof verification system that the gamblers can do per roll if they want to. Of course no one will try to do that every bet that they do, which brings another problem that could possibly be exploited by the platform. Gambling platforms can, at times, alter the result of a bet because the gambler wouldn't really check every bet he makes anyway. But thankfully most of the gambling platform's provably-fair system can be trusted.",

      "body": "Provably fair is already with us from quite some time and as it is already known by all gamblers now that it adds to the belief of a gambler toward the game provider and the casino that is offering that provider.That is in theory because the provider can make it all the provable fair they want but as soon as they offer a changeable RTP-Return to the Player it means that the casino may adopt the lowest RTP of all options thus making the player experience not a pleasant one.That is why I always play in provably fair casinos that offer only providers that offer only 1 RTP per slot machine,that I know for sure that whatever the outcome of my game play session I have not been \"cheated\" by the changeable RTP in other casinos that offer such providers.",

If yes, how did you get to figure it out? If no, would you love to research further and apply this?Provably fair was already a usual term here since, in online gambling, we want at least to make sure that we are playing fairly on these sites. There is even a specific page dedicated to checking the fairness of the provably fair on some crypto-gambling sites, especially dice-related games.Since it's technical to some, others don't bother to research it. If a gambling site wants to build a reputation, they won't do some things that will give dirt to its name. With also lots of users playing on that site, for sure some knowledgeable gambler out there can determine if the site is not running a fair system.If we talk though about fiat online casinos, there's no way we can find out how to verify the fairness.",
