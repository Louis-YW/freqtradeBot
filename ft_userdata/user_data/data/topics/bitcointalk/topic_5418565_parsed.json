If it was a feedback left before 2018 then it was fine, we could say that JollyGood was not aware of valid practice of the feedback system.Isn't he making a joke of the idea of the feedback system suggested by theymos? Feedback left for BitcoinTurk is a joke as well.JollyGood is knowingly abusing the feedback system but unfortunately so many members are still trusting him in their trust list and giving him a pass.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on October 28, 2022, 06:53:06 AMBuddy, eight months?

Have you read BitcoinTurk's  request and also JollyGood's response? Somehow, it seems to me that you will have to wait a few more months, if not years. You are saying it's okay to leave feedback for such things and it's also okay to tell the users to wait some number of months to have their feedback removed? JollyGood actually told the same to BitcoinTurk with some usual hate speech against those who are not supporting his abuse.Quote from: JollyGood on October 23, 2022, 03:40:04 PMa couple of low-level attention seekers with grudges against me will continue to use this thread as a platform to spout their useless comments and it will only distract and divert from the issue.JollyGood should be removed from the DT system for his abusive use of the system.

As I do with many users that spam threads or make nonsensical posts in order to increase post count to build up accounts or earn signature campaign fees or simply troll and seek attention, I added you to my ignore list. Still, having said that I offer my apologies for not replying here earlier. Moving forward, in this particular matter you do actually have a case therefore the tag will be revised to neutral.If memory serves correct you posted football score forecasts in my Premier League thread a day after the actual games took place. You did this using minimal typing just in order to increase post count yet had you applied due-diligence you would have at least known what you were talking about before you messed up. On top of that your regular post pattern was effectively evident of someone trying to build up their account posting for the sake of that and for that I should have tagged you neutral instead of red.Kindly note, though it may seem inconsequential for the present I will still state it for clarity sake in order to avoid confusion for the future. As and when I become aware of any associated alt-accounts I will tag them all as I see fit and if that happens no amount of thread making on your part or peer pressure from well respected members will affect my decision to remove or revise my tags.Keeping that aside, I hope you raise your contribution levels in the forum with informative posts and in the process become a well respected member that is highly trusted.As this thread no longer serves any purpose I advise you to lock it because trolls and attention-seekers with ulterior motives will feel compelled to spout nonsense here.",

I won't bring this up here again what ever JollyGood feels is best as a judgement I will have to leave with it.This the first Pm I got from Jolly after a Pmed  the user.Quote from: JollyGood on February 26, 2022, 09:37:25 AMHello,Thank you for the PM. I hope you are well.When I left you neutral feedback you did not complain but as soon as I changed it to negative trust, you began contacting me. Why?If you were tired why did you \"need\" to visit the forum? People do not post imaginary sentences with conviction if they are \"tired\". You did not have a clue what was going on yet you posted as if you were the expert on that subject. The games were already played and took a day to post what you thought the results would be - just to fill in the blanks for your signature campaign fee?It looks like you are driven by nothing other than signature campaign fee income which should not mean you can post any nonsense to increase your post count.I will revisit this issue in 3 months time to remove or revise my trust depending on the quality of your posting. Thank you.Kind RegardsQuote from: dbc23 on February 25, 2022, 06:00:46 PMPlease the act wasn't by intention. I had a stressful day. Can I get a last trust from you. My content are quality I was just tired and needed to visit the forum. If I could be considered and given a last chance from you I will strongly appreciate thanks in anticipation...I got one more pm after wards I got ignored:which includeQuote from: JollyGood on May 02, 2022, 09:14:23 AMHello,Thank you for getting in touch. I hope you are well.Right now I think it is inappropriate to remove the the negative trust. I will have to review this in 6 months time and as long as there are no other tags on your account I will probably revise my trust to neutral or remove it.Kind RegardsQuote from: dbc23 on May 01, 2022, 09:24:53 AMThe three months is over please remove the negative trust.This happens to be one of my replies on his post that got deleted I will ike every one to look into it..Quote from: Bitcoin ForumA reply of yours, quoted below, was deleted by the starter of a self-moderated topic. There are no rules of self-moderation, so this deletion cannot be appealed. Do not continue posting in this topic if the topic-starter has requested that you leave.You can create a new topic if you are unsatisfied with this one. If the topic-starter is scamming, post about it in Scam Accusations.QuoteQuote from: JollyGood on April 30, 2022, 06:33:13 PMBefore the games were played today, Liverpool held a +4 goal difference advantage over Manchester City and when they went top of the table with a 0-1 win at Newcastle it increased to +5 but Manchester City thrashed Leeds 0-4 which means it is down to just +1 now.This one point difference will keep going on and on till the end of the season. As it stands both Liverpool and Manchester city are strongly eyeing both the championships league and premier league title and how will it be if either of the two secures both. City lead against Leeds city brought them back to the top else they would have been 4 points behind Liverpool",

The feedbacks left by JollyGood are highly valuable, even if a few of them are indeed controversial. As with Lauda, there comes a point where a DT member's wrongly-given negative trust starts to outweigh all the correct ones, and when that happens there's a dilemma: Does the DT community vote with their trust inclusions/exclusions to remove that DT member (and in the process reduce the weight of all the good feedbacks) or do they just allow the DT member to continue to abuse or wrongly use the trust system?I made the decision a while back to cast my vote against JollyGood, because it seemed like he wasn't getting the message and I don't believe in keeping a person on the DT list no matter how many good feedbacks they have if they're misusing the trust system.  Obviously I was in the minority, but I'd suggest to JollyGood that he review his trust page and delete all those feedbacks that were left because of a person's posting habits or anything not genuinely related to trustworthiness.  I had to do that when the merit system came about, and it was tedious--but I did it anyway because community standards changed.Anyway, good for you OP.  JollyGood is at least open to rethinking things.  Many members are not.",

That's how it should be handled.",
