Still, at least people have the choice of not using those centralized services and keep it P2P instead.

      "body": "This is the reason why a number of Bitcoin supporters are somewhat happy with what's going on in the crypto industry right now; because this is one of the biggest illustrations of how crypto shouldn't be. Crypto shouldn't have been about centralized exchanges and lending platforms and investments for annual yield and staking and so on. So, in a away, what's happening right now is helping the crypto market shake off those unsustainable, insecure, or simply unreasonable designs of crypto projects, platforms, services, and so forth. In a way, the crypto market is going through catharsis right now. From a certain viewpoint, this is actually healthy to the industry. Some crypto services and products are not meant to last as they are only damaging the very vision of Satoshi and the spirit of Bitcoin.",

The huge problem is that we are living in an open space and the whole cryptocurrency industry is open to anyone...nobody will be investigating anyone to be able to enter here. And so we can see bad and good actors doing business in crypto...and I think this is going to be true into the future. What transpired in FTX and its Sam Bankman Friedman - what a name sporting the word bank but we later realized he just FRIED us - is  big wake-up call to all to never, ever fully trust any platform doing business in crypto even including Binance so they can feel that they should be working to earn that elusive trust everyday. There should be a way to make these bad actors accountable and a good way to protect their investors.",

(speculation, sentiment, social drama has not scared the markets or mining to crash value)even FTX drama this week has not caused huge drops/crashes.. in comparison to normal price variance of the last 6 months all of this is helping prove the value support of $15k+ is strong and that the markets dont want to drop to stupid amounts you quote like $3k/$10kthe markets have tested lows this year via many speculative negative events (luna/ftx/elon)if big events like FTX cant kill prices in half or quarters. then that helps show how strong the market is supported at the $15k rate of value underlying the markets.. 2022 has shown to be a market average of $20k with speculative swings above and below of +/- 20% either side ($24k-$16k)we have seen a $17k in previous months and this weeks $16.5k is no different to \"norm\" acceptable swings.. this is a sign that FTX cant even kill the markets, and thus cant kill the underlying value supporting the marketsall of this is a good sign",
