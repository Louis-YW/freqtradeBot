Right now, Mark Mobius, a very popular figure in cryptocurrency, predicted in a CNBC seminar on Thrusday that Bitcoin is going to stay below $10k dollars very soon. That's going to be a 40 percent drop in current bitcoin value.Re: photo collected from GoogleHe adds that one of the reasons for this is that large centralized exchanges like FTX are getting involved in scams out of fear that those who have invested in cryptocurrencies or institutions that hold cryptocurrency investments by offering interest rates above 5% are getting destroyed.  Also, people don't want to hold cryptocurrency because of higher interest rate of USD.Mark Mobius had earlier given some predictions which were later corrected .In May this year, when the Bitcoin market was at $28,000, he said that Bitcoin would soon hit $20,000, which later came true.  But it is only a matter of time how far Mark Mobius's $10k prediction comes true. source",

Yes but a wise person or investor is somewhat informed about the Bitcoin market.  They should not be dismissed outright.  Some of Mark Mobius' previous comments have come true.  So the Bitcoin market can take a turn in any direction at any time.But it wouldn't be surprising if Bitcoin touches $10,000 in 2023. Because the Bitcoin market completes a certain circle .",

(public exchange, private OTC, mining)sellers refusing to sell bitcoin below X anywhere on the planet via any exit method (public exchange, private OTC)what many will find is out of exchanges, otc and mining. the cheapest place to acquire bitcoin anywhere on the planet is from the most efficient mining cost on the planet.so if you can calculate the cheapest mining the most efficient mining and truly calculate all costs to mine 1btc.. you will find a bottom number that then supports all speculative prices above that number..some will try to say that mining is as volatile as speculating on the market.. but it is notits actually a smooth efficient running businessthe true low cost mining do not have variable costs that change by the hour/day.they lock in employment costs on 6-12month employment contractthey lock in electric costs on 6-24 month contracts**they use hardware for 6-36 monthsthey use warehouse facilities on a 1-10 year leasemeaning their costs are locked anf frozen for 6 months+as for hashrate changeslets say the hashrage changes from 200-280exahash per year for the networkthe most efficient miners are constantly mining. they are part of the 200exa minimum that never stop mining whereby its hobby miners that jump off and on randomly t change the hashrateyes the change of hashrate changes the size of the slice of the pie all miners get because of that hash competition. but as said by locking in costs for 6 months. efficient miners do not react to daily whimsy of change. they just accumulate for 6months+ and then tally their total cost for 7 months vs coins earned over 6 months. so if you can see the average hashrate of 6 months+ and calculate the overal cost for 6 months cost. you find the bottom for that periodand miners are not going to waste 6 months of earning btc just to sell at a loss.so they become part of the group that refuse to sell below Xso while the market premium of speculation floats and waves above a bottom of X(not on public exchange amount)the market is getting support to no sell down to Xthus the market is trying to 'price discover' and test the markets bottom. now to the most important part.in 2022. the most efficient method to acquire bitcoin on the planet(a method below and outside of the public market). is supporting the bitcoin price above $10kthe hashrate has to drop below 200exa to cause enough hash competition change to earn efficient miners more BTC to shift their coin:cost measure below $10k:1btcoh and a note about one aspect earlier** electric costthey have not yet been hit by the electric hike in cost of 2022 yet. so their next contract period will be higher, meaning costs higher meaning wanting to maintain a HIGHER price to sell at, not lowerthe only big impact to lower the bottom would be if hashrate of network decline dramatically for the AVERAGE hashrate of a 6month+ timescale",

That's going to be a 40 percent drop in current bitcoin value.If famous people bitocin predictions would come true bitcoin would be dead in 2012, 1 mln $ in 2018, dead in 2019, 1 mln$ in 2021 and 10k$ in 2023. None of those extreme numbers were correct so far. Quote from: Rigon on December 03, 2022, 07:06:43 AMHe adds that one of the reasons for this is that large centralized exchanges like FTX are getting involved in scams out of fear that those who have invested in cryptocurrencies or institutions that hold cryptocurrency investments by offering interest rates above 5% are getting destroyed.  Its bullish for bitcoin that scam altcoins and scam services go bust. Only proves that bitcoin is the best long term crypto investment. FTX case made people withdraw from exchanges (what is exposing those who are swimming naked - with fractional reserve system, dumping users bitcoins on users)Quote from: Rigon on December 03, 2022, 07:06:43 AMAlso, people don't want to hold cryptocurrency because of higher interest rate of USD.Super high interest rates. -4% (negative) real interest rates (adjusted for inflation). Its definetly a game changer compared to potential +500-1000% for bitcoin in next 2-5 years with limited downside becasue bitcoin already dumped 80% and is the most oversold in history (monthly RSI at ATL). For sure people are rushing for negative 4%Quote from: Rigon on December 03, 2022, 07:06:43 AMMark Mobius had earlier given some predictions which were later corrected .In May this year, when the Bitcoin market was at $28,000, he said that Bitcoin would soon hit $20,000, which later came true.  But it is only a matter of time how far Mark Mobius's $10k prediction comes true.There are like 10 000 \"famous people\" that shoot and miss. The fact that 100 of them will be correct at least once is super high. It does not change them into crytal ball that will be correct next time.Also he is an emerging markets fund manager. So he gets new clients when he is bearish when everyone else is bearish. He can't be bullish when 90% people are bearish because his clients will call him crazy and leave. 90% of people are loosing on market. He is targeting them right now to dump BTC at loss and go to him because he predicted dump below 20k and is as bearish as they are now. But they are bearish because of fear, he is bearish to get new clients.",

Very similar to the weather forecast, which, as you know, has very large errors in accuracy. The same is true here. Too many factors can affect the price of btc, both up and down, which is almost impossible to predict. I am inclined to believe that the bearish trend will continue for a long time, and therefore, a fall in the value of bitcoin is quite possible and Mark Mobius's forecast is possible too. But I wouldn't say for sure. Even if this happens, then with a change to a bullish trend, BTC will still compensate for the loss in value, recover and show new highs.",
