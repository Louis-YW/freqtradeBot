As part of our ongoing verification review of your account, you are kindly requested to submit further documentation to verify your identity. 1. A street selfie: A photo of your face with your government-issued ID (Passport or Driving Licence) and a newspaper in one hand, taken outside your building or street sign. Take a pen/marker and write Cloudbet and today's date on the newspaper and sign the newspaper below the word Cloudbet. Please note all details. should be legible, including the building name or street sign. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Seriously, is this going to be the new trend in KYC verification?Remember, back then, all that most services required were the front and back part of your ID or passport before they started asking for simple selfies.Why would they need a street sign or building name?",

I do not think I can use any site like that when there are other good gambling sites with easy verification process.",

Cheaters will find ways to cheat (e.g. get someone on fiverr to take a picture for them) and legitimate users will laugh and leave, or perhaps will cheat too because who has even seen an actual printed newspaper recently.",

There are anonymous online casinos that never had KYC, and legalities in certain jurisdictions aside, they work fine.Ok, I know sportsbooks may need to enforce certain limits, but a street selfie isn't gonna help with that, and most of these casinos don't require KYC on sign up, which is what they really should do. I can't enter a local B&M casino without an ID, and I can't register on their website without an ID, so not sure why some Bitcoin casinos have chosen the shitiest possible way to deal with identification.",

They have no compliance tools developed that will acurately determine your proof of residence, and it's highly unlikely that some operator is goint to be typing this all by hand - and, if they ever get hacked and the KYC data is stolen (because there is no 3rd party in the world that does \"street sign verification\" - of course they are storing them on their own servers), you can be sure to expect a visit from some thugs who know that you have thousands of dollars worth of crypto in your casino account.For a reference, the only proof of identity services like Amazon need is a bank withdrawal statement.Never use a service whose KYC does not accept bank withdrawal statements as sufficient proof of address.",

Someone could conclude that this is an intention to delay or stop the withdrawal of money from the casino.why casinos do not have an independent KYC register? One registry for all, where users will be able to undergo verification, and the casino will only need some kind of verification code from this service.",

Making selfie with a street sign and snapping of a news paper is not a barrier at all for those that are selling verified account just like you said, I see it not necessary at all, even the exchanges I have used are not stringent with their KYC requirements like that while I expect exchanges to be more strict with their KYC requirements.Quote from: DaveF on August 16, 2022, 01:10:12 AMNote, I am talking about online casinos here not other services.Before I know this forum, I was using local gambling sites, they all are not yet requiring for KYCs in a hard way like that, just name, data of birth and other basic verifications, no IDs needed but they are fiat for gambling sites. I later used bet365, when I have no driver licence, international passport or permanent national id, I still was able to use birth certificate for the verification and I was verified.Currently I am using the gambling sites on this forum, all are not hard like that, some even do no require for ID card but just basic verification.",

On Cloudbet ToS, submitting KYC could be there, but no one would know if he is going to have to go through another type of selfies, so it would not be stated that street signs and news paper would be included, all people would be thinking is submitting IDs, making video or snapping.How many people read ToS, it is usually long, but it is important to read ToS though for not to make mistake. Some people may decide to have just a single account, not take advantage of deposit bonus with another account, not using VPN and making sure the betting site allows people from his country to gamble while gambling is allowed in his country. If the person know that what could happen last is is to submit his IDs and other details, but mandating street signs and news paper would definitely be frustrating.",
