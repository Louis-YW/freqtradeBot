  "content": "QuoteThe Bank of Israel also recommends a ban on algorithmic stablecoins if they become widely used for payments.The Bank of Israel on Wednesday published principles for regulating stablecoin activity in the country, which lays out the central bank's recommendations for supervising crypto linked to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar.The document follows the publication of guidelines for digital asset regulation from the country's Ministry of Finance in November. The goal of the central bank's proposed regulations is to allow stablecoin use in the country \"while managing the risk inherent in using them, and adjusting the consumer protections and prudential requirements,\" the document said.Although the document refers to the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD in May as a motivation for establishing regulations, the recommendations only target stablecoins attached to other assets and backed by collateral, not algorithms. The central bank said algorithmic stablecoins like terraUSD are not used widely for payments, but indicated it may prohibit them if they become too popular.\"If, nevertheless, this type of currency becomes a common means of payment, issuers will be required to hold full collateral, and in fact the issuance of a bearer currency that uses an algorithmic stabilization mechanism will be prohibited,\" the document said in Hebrew.The central bank recommends requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves matching the amount of crypto in circulation, covering \"100 percent of its liabilities to the coin holders.\" The recommendation aligns with that of other jurisdictions like Hong Kong, which plans to regulate asset-backed stablecoins by June this year.The recommendations include splitting supervisory roles between multiple regulators to enhance efficiency. The central bank proposes that stablecoins issuers should be required to obtain licenses to operate. It adds that issuers of larger stablecoins that could have \"systemic importance\" should be licensed by the Banking Supervision Department while others should be supervised by the Capital Market Authority.Payments-focused stablecoins \"shall be overseen by the payment systems oversight function at the Bank of Israel,\" according to the document.The proposed rules are open to public comment until March 15, after which the bank will make required changes and recommend legislation to the government.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/22/israels-central-bank-proposes-rules-for-stablecoins-including-100-reserve-requirement/....100% Reserve!Tether stablecoin has been investigated for its capacity of reserve since 2017. The story of stablecoins is slowly but surely transforming into an epic.Is bitcoin prominent in israel? Awhile ago I remember reading a statistic claiming that more than 95% of israel's population had been vaccinated against COVID-19. There are some who claim israel has the highest average IQ of any nation on earth. If this is true, is it possible that a high percentage of israelis are technology and tech savvy enough to enjoy a high percentage of crypto mass adoption coupled with high rates of bitcoin HODL?While I try to avoid being judgmental or drawing conclusions based on surface observations. I have noticed a high percentage of jews have the words \"gold\" and \"silver\" in their names. Long John Silver from Treasure Island. Terry Silver from karate kid and cobra kai. Perhaps in the future jews will abandon the \"gold\" and \"silver\" in their names and opt to include \"bitcoin\" or \"crypto\" instead?",

So it seems reasonable to me that stablecoins should be backed up by something that minimises the risk of it crashing. Holding a full collateral is exactly the sort of thing that would ensure the stability of a stablecoin, and while it can be a problem for issuers, I do think that the users will benefit from that. As long as Israel doesn't target decentralized cryptocurrencies and doesn't require them to be backed up by anything, it's fine by me.",

Use hardwork/PoW based ones instead. Then try and control the demand/supply to limit their ability to increase/decrease drastically in price. Hardwork based coins tend to continuously increase in value if supply is less than demand. Perpetually low volatility Stablecoins based on hardwork = demand ≥ supply. *Stablecoins backed by hardwork is still OK. Collateral = product of work. The work should be properly done to increase the product and currency value. * True/good Work = Solving problems properly..

Some brilliant mind created blockchain then some smart people using the tech to run their vehicles that is the bitcoin and altcoins and common people like you and me are using them to transact. It's simple formula and I dont really think we need some spiritual energy or text to let us know whether it is acceptable or not.

If there were such high IQ's then they would have been Bitcoin hotspot now however it is far west in the El Salvador where appropriate actions have been taken by the government and they are doing just fine with normal IQ. I don't really think having high IQ can lead people towards tech savy nations. If anyways all of them averagely have higher IQ's then it balance out the crowd to think about nigh parties and beach stuff with same pace but with different angle. It means nothing.",

Although they're learning lessons from the fall of an algorithmic stablecoin, since these algorithmic stablecoins are not widely used as payment, they could be left unattended for a while. I suppose this approach includes crypto-backed stablecoins like DAI, non-collateralized stablecoins, commodity-backed stablecoins, and others; although they singled out algorithmic stablecoins to be banned \"if they become too popular.\"Quote from: Smartprofit on February 23, 2023, 11:33:23 AMQuote from: Darker45 on February 23, 2023, 01:30:27 AM~snip~Creating a 100% reserve of issued stablecoins is very beneficial for the users of these stablecoins.  However, it is unlikely that the creators of stablecoins will be satisfied with the regulatory framework that requires them to make such sacrifices.  If a stablecoin is not 100% backed by fiat currency, but is partially backed or backed not only by fiat currency, but also by cryptocurrency, then the creator of the stablecoin has the opportunity to make a very good profit.  Flexibility and the possibility of financial maneuver are very important here.  The goal of the creators of stablecoins is to organize various financial schemes aimed at making a profit.  The creators of stablecoins are not against fiat currencies - on the contrary, they want to have as much money as possible.The legal framework of the State of Israel requiring the freezing of such a large amount of fiat money in reserves is unlikely to please the creators of stablecoins.Well, it's basically to protect consumers and stablecoin users. It's probably the safest way for them. It seems this is the primary concern of Israel's Central Bank. They're probably not inclined to look after the welfare of stablecoin issuers.",

Also in July 2022, MakerDAO became the first DeFi protocol to accept shares of public companies as collateral.With regard to the above rules for regulating stablecoins by the Central Bank of Israel, they are quite acceptable.
