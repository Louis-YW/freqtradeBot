So this tread was created to put smile on your faces and illustrate some concepts in a different way, which I will be describing a bit about each as the list keeps unfolding…1.   This illustrate the expression on most individuals face when been caught for plagiarism on the forum which is highly prohibited2.   This illustrate how Hhampuz happens to be to only current user with most active campaigns on the forum and as such the queue anticipating for his/her campaigns always much3.   This illustrate the most rated campaigns to the least with reference to the size of the ladies 4.   The illustrate the faces and feelings most users keep when they finally not get chosen for a campaign blaming themselves that what could be wrong.5.   This illustrate that special feelings each users get when they finally receive their first 1 merit, 100 merits and 1000 merits6.   This illustrate that special joy and feeling that comes to our face when we receive a campaign payment7.   This illustrate that sad face we ironically keep when our posted thread gets no merit after 24hrs8.   This illustrate that untold truth most users face in their early stages on the forum struggling to write a good quality thread/post9.   This illustrate how it has become a habit for most Newbies coming to teach us how to get what they don’t actually have (is’t that funny?.. it is truly funny)10.   This illustrate how most Newbies think there exist an easy way to gets merits and when they finally noticed its not possible, quit11.   This illustrate how most Legendary see all Newbies as people who don’t know anything about bitcoin and cryptocurrency, forgetting the fact that one could be a Newbie on the forum and an experience bitcoin lover 12.   This illustrate most rated and least rated campaign on the forum13.   This illustrate the most worthy campaigns with reference cars (self explanatory)14.   This illustrate the feelings and faces we keep when the price of Bitcoin rises and falls15.   This illustrate how the bounty board on the forum happens to be the place with the most users compared to the main reason for the forum16.   This illustrate the hierarchy of the forum starting from its founder 17.   This illustrate how there exist more shit-post compared to good quality post 18.   This illustrate that face most users keep when moderator deletes their post19.   This illustrate how Satoshi deserves a salute for his awesome project (Bitcoin)         I created all these myself, and I hope they are cool.

So I will love if the thread continue as users come to post self created memes with brief explanation.",
