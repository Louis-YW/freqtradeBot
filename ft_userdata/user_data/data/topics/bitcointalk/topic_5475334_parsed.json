It's good to know that a lot of people are still having their hard life being relieved even just a little with the help of bitcoin, apparently the worry of some that the whales taking over bitcoin is misplaced and not true because it seems that people are still able to get into bitcoin.Quote from: Eternad on November 24, 2023, 02:29:25 PMI’m from South East Asia.

I can tell you why bitcoin isn't popular among the many poor in the region, it's probably because of the obvious fact that most people from the poverty line and below don't really have the time to invest and most of them don't have any phone or device that they can use to help them navigate the bitcoin space and bitcoin related platforms and they're not really the kind of people that you want to invest for the long term because they don't have the ability to do that or even be able to do that because they need all the money that they can get and investment is the last thing on their minds.",

What does it mean to get to know and then buy Bitcoin? If yes then I think what other users say here is the absolute truth. That poor people living on the poverty line how do they have money to buy Bitcoin? If they even have difficulty with their daily needs?If you mean it's open because someone can make a few dollars from this forum, then that could happen. But before that, of course someone needs time and money to buy an internet quota and learn a few things about forums. And I don't understand if there are any users here who come from that situation?",

How is the human rights over there for example? Do they have a functioning justice system? Education? Health insurance? Any civilization? These people should solve their basic problems first and then the money will flow in any way. There are some rich countries in the world which you still wouldn't want to visit because money isn't everything. How about making less kids? If they are so poor why do they keep making babies?",

I could even say that we're in debted to other countries like the trillions amount of pesos, it might be literally from lack of resources but I would like to say its from corruption. This kind of issue can be helped through Bitcoin as we know the potential of Bitcoin to the people as long as they have the knowledge, funds, and time. Sadly Bitcoin is not that widely known in our country even having a group of people involved in crypto currency, you could literally see that there are only a few people who are active and engaging in the crypto industry as well as investment in Bitcoin. People in the PH actually not only that they lack the knowledge, but if they are just middle class, and just earning enough for you to live and survive, they don't have the time to study and invest in Bitcoin, especially enough funds to invest.",

Taking out a loan to invest in any asset not only Bitcoin is a very risky move. Even if it's 100% guarantee and in fact there is no guarantee that the price of Bitcoin will rise and you may end up losing money if the price goes down. In short, never borrow money to invest because it's simply too risky. Investment always comes with risk and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.Borrowing money to invest in Bitcoin is generally considered a bad idea. Investing always comes with risk and when you borrow money to do so, you are increasing the risk because you'll lose the assets if it backfire and you'll still pay for the money you borrow.",

Important topic but many of them have outlawed the use of put up taxation that is tremendous enough to discourage users.Bitcoin is not a silver bullet to cure poverty. It is a currency and to earn that you need to work or sell your skills just like you earn fiat. Maybe this forum can give a few of them livelihoods, but there is not stability on such jobs, even freelancing. So fiat and crypto both need to be targeted by users in such countries. Even then it will only provide a means of living and not turn the poor to rich.Those who live below poverty lines, bitcoin is the least of their concerns. For them clean water, cooked food and electricity with a strong roof to live under are way more necessary things.",

But there are people whom I have know their life has been changed they understood the technology and has been contributing at the same time earning a good fortune. But no-one openly discusses it as you never know when government will start crackdown on crypto and users. Bitcoin became too mainstream when celebrities invested into it in 2017. In last few years things have been changing and more users were adopting Bitcoin but Indian government introduced extortion sort of tax process for crypto trading which has left everyone bothered and some of the prominent traders have even shifted out of India but small traders and investors have vanished from market, this happened during the time we saw people started adopting crypto.",

Through this platform the foreheads of the people of all these regions are being opened.It is a big misconception that bitcoin can save someone or change their quality of life. No, it can potentially change the income, provided that a person learns the features of cryptocurrencies as an asset and trades on the exchange. Preliminarily investing a decent amount of money in the turnover. But as you understand from the description - a poor person has no start-up capital and can not invest in Bitcoin.There is a second reason, which I have explained many times - the volatility of cryptocurrency. Theoretically, it can be considered a good option long-term holding can give a good profit. Theoretically. Now model the situation for a person with very low income. Even if he was able to somehow save 500-1000 dollars and bought bitcoin. With a high probability, seeing the fall of bitcoin value (and this is a normal process), and seeing how his 1000 dollars turns into 850 and there is a chance to lose more - he with 99% probability will sell bitcoin to save something. Bottom line - only losses and no salvation. The fairy tale role of bitcoin as a savior from all the poor from economic woes, unfortunately - just dreams and fairy tales.With the same effect you can say that poor people should buy bullion, and due to the increase in price - they will get rid of poverty, but we realize how cynical such advice sounds for people who can barely support themselves....",
