Yes and centralized exchanges have started distributing them to all their qualified ETH holders.In case you have ETH in your non-custodial wallet by the time of the snapshot then you'll still get an equivalent amount in ETHW.Just add the following in your Metamask or other supporting wallets if you want,QuoteNetwork Name: ETHW-mainnetNew RPC URL: https://mainnet.ethereumpow.orgChain ID: 10001Currency Symbol: ETHWBlock Explorer URL(Optional): https://mainnet.ethwscan.comBlock Explorer URL(Optional): https://www.oklink.com/en/ethw- https://medium.com/@ETHW/ethw-mainnet-info-released-d775865a05e61 ETHW is curently valued at $6- https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-pow",

If that’s the case then man it is already having big price tag man. Since the cost is just 6 bucks per ETHW is too less for that conversion. However, on the other hand buying it as an investment is perfect Timeline. ETHW will be invested under an impression of making money because ETH too lot of it from the miners in the first place.

This will probably end up like those many bitcoin hardforks....they will be abandoned. The coin was also dumped hard like ETHW.Quote from: asyakashi on September 21, 2022, 12:46:22 PMGiven the existence of ethereum Classic, I think ethereum POW this time will be difficult to compete. Just as bitcoin has had many forks on the network, only bitcoin cash can truly compete with the rest of the world. Ethereum will have the same probability. But since it's free it would be better to grab the airdrop first.Time will tell. ETC and ETHW are both using POW algo but not exactly the same. Confidence on ETC's security have not been restored yet after multiple successful attacks so we could see an advantage of ETHW there.",

Lol this is going to end up a shit coin.Well the Ethereum team has nothing to do with this ETHW coin as far as i know, so i don't think that you can blame Vitalik now just because he updated his coin to a proof of stake consensuns mechanism now. I mean i can understand that people that were mining Ethereum are a bit upset by this switch but to be honest it was clear for at least 2 years now that this switch to PoS will happen. So everyone had enough time to prepare for that event. That ETHW coin is just a attempt by the big mining companies to create an ETH fork that will be used by the people and still runs on PoW. The problem is there is already ETH classic for that. So i don't think that ETHW will have a future.",

ETHW was a new fork coin that has no utility like ethereum. You must aware if we have ETC as most reliable fork coin for ethereum. we didn't even need a new one. The miners are so greedy to take money from the crypto buyers. After ethereum was moving to the POS and then miners are using so many ways to grab money from market. In this case, i would like to call those miners who agreed to issue ETC as scammers.The price will be going down even deeper as scammers are keep dumping their shitty ethw mined by them, Only stupid people who keep buying that shit.",

I think that most of the sales are made by large ETH holders who have received ETHW as an airdrop, since most miners have switched to mining other coins, such as ETC and RVN.
