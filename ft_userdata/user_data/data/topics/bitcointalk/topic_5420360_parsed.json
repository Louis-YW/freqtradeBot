The picture isn't cleared yet. I think these discussions are far behind the current scenario. It might be possible that china might provoke Taiwan. However, practically it would not be easy to attack Taiwan as Taiwan is a strong country in terms of economy and politics.",

But the thing is that it is too late now. People of China have been enjoying all the delights of the Western civilization for too long to be withdrawn from that easily. If the Chinese government wants to play this game of a formally communist state it's one thing, but if they will try to \"nationalize everything\", people will rebel against them, and they know it.",

US has the strongest military might that doesn't mean China aren't doing same. China too are investing heavily on their military might the only way China will get conquered is by joint force from the EUsQuote from: GloryBeryle on November 12, 2022, 06:06:15 AMWell, certainly it not China but the United States and other western countries that are playing with fire.

Taiwan issue has always been a political disagreement and never was/is a nation conflict problem. Period.This is a historical affair and one has to be well knowledgable about the case before taking sides. History tells us that the chinese had full control in the 17th Century when the Qing dynasty began administering it.Â  In 1895, Japan took over the Island when the won the first Sino Japanese war. China reclaimed it back in 1945 during world war two. Then a civil that gave the communist control in 1949 erupted in the mainland the communists won and controlled Beijing. It's this history China is pointing to as claim that Taiwan was originally their province and wants to reclaim it. The US and the Western countries will not want to get into a physical combat with China even if China strikes. The worst that the US will do is cut ties and close their boarders against China which will not be of any effect to the Chinese.",

There are no military strategies or weapons that guarantees victory. China is a also a military force in the the global stage and she also has very strong allies that are America's grave foes that cannot be underrated. America might have the best military weapons but China can boast of some key weapons that could compete favorably to a large extent with the US. The war between China and America might not end in years. But I am sure China knows the consequences of attacking Taiwan because America and its allies might would protect that Island with all their might. They would want to prove to the world that their refusal not to directly fight in Ukraine is not a sign of weakness. I am guessing that an attack on Taiwan would be the beginning of the Third World War and I am sure that no country wants to suffer devastative consequences of this war.",

Â That's why it will never happen. The last thing Chinese government wants right now is a global war. China is not North Korea where brainwashed population really hates West. Chinese people don't hate West. Many millions of them are earning good money cooperating with Western companies, millions visit the USA each year and millions visit Europe. They would rather overthrough their government than engage in a war with the civilized world.",
