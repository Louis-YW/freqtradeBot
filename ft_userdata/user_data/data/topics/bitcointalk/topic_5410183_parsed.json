  "content": "Since the beginning of bitcoin it is basically in a very volatile uptrend. It is not likely that it stays like this forever (50+ years). What are your thoughts on what could be a price target for bitcoin longterm?I made this calculation for an adoption of 50 % of the current world population:21.000.000 Bitcoins : 4 Billion People= 0.00525 Bitcoin per person on average. The average value of the wealth per person globally is: 79.952 USD. If you now would calculate the bitcoin price so that 0.00525 Bitcoins are worth 79.952 USD then you would end up with a bitcoin price of : 15.228.952 USD per Bitcoin.This calculation is of course very inaccurate and makes a lot of assumptions. Still it can show where in some specific scenario the bitcoin price can end up, since for now I feel the price has just random targets and is dictated by exchanges and whales.If you have different approaches feel free to share!",

Only what I guess is that the price would one day hit a million dollars. You have not even mentioned fiat devaluation as a result of inflation, that would also contribute to bitcoin price appreciation in long term.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on August 17, 2022, 07:56:29 AMAlso those 21million supply isnt 21million too.  Some of these are forgotten and loss in the blockchain due to such personal mistake and some of it also hasnt been mined all.Almost all bitcoin would have been mined by 2050, but some more would have been lost, the calculation may not be accurate, but definitely that bitcoin price would further be appreciating.",

      "body": "I'll say that sky is the limit if it's about the truest potential and price of bitcoin in the future. Take all of those halvings for example and when we say long term, it'll depend on how long you're looking at it. With halving, as the reward for the mined blocks will become lesser for the miners. That will result to the lesser supply and higher difficulty for it to mine a block and as well as higher price. Well, I don't have a price in my mind but I'm very much optimistic and waiting for it to come. Many might laugh at us for now if we tell them about 6 to 7 digits but who knows, right?",

So in 10s of years in the future Bitcoin may worth *a lot* because of its scarcity (and demand!) and also because fiat is losing value continuously.The only missing part of the \"equation\" is the demand. If, for some reason, the demand would go down, the price will also go down. If the demand remains the same, the price will grow. If the demand rises (and that's what I expect) the price will skyrocket.",

One of the link missing also is the numbers of bitcoin that will be lost from the newly mined in addition to the already lost bitcoins which is missing link. For the times so far that bitcoin has not dropped down to $10k and beyond according to predictions and speculators, we are going to see bitcoin appreciate into 6 digits.",

Which still leaves with 1.5 million per bitcoin if we are looking at averages. Do not get me started on the companies as well, because this is per person, if we are talking about prices based on companies, that's going to change it a lot as well. All in all, what I believe bitcoin is all about equals to no top price ever. Because, there is inflation as well. If the average person could have 80k per year salary today, it will be 100k in a decade or so, which means that we can't talk about how bitcoin is all great and what not, while also not realizing that inflation will make sure that bitcoin will be ever growing and will never stop.",

Whales will become more rich, and those who have at least 1 BTC can also live a happy life if they are able to hold until such time. The limited supply of Bitcoin is a big thing, once we mined all of them probably the supply will be limited and if the adoption also started, that will make the price of Bitcoin more expensive.",
