  "content": "We are all entitled to our decisions, but we still have to be careful of the gimmicks all around now. I always have strange feelings about the two names above as many have been victims of crypto scams either directly or indirectly, and these guys will not stop since the crypto scamming business is now booming. They will use all schemes possible even as they strive to make it looks more legit. Scamming vices are outdating and the surest ones that look almost totally legit and unchallenged for big scammers are through crypto and crypto-related products. It's been a while since I've been wanting to quicken you guys, Do Not Be Tempted By Many Of These, many more will still come in the name of crypto but they have their targets.And if my instinct is right, Chinko guys might be behind this, they always see the loophole in Nigeria mainly. I purposely pointed out Digitoads and Inqubeta since they seem to be targeting the Nigerian market in particular. I have been observing their tactics for a while, their marketing style is so influencing by downgrading some coins to appraise theirs, and they are so aggressive in their marketing approach, which raises suspicion.Digitoads claims it has raised $3.2M in presales according to Coincodex 12 days ago, right or wrong, I don't know. All I know is that some are in the business of \"Rug pull\" scams where nothing is real as they will merely pump up a new project to attract unsuspecting victims. But before you knew it, they will vanish. The progress of Digitoads might also explain why Inquebeta speedily joined in the same tactics.The loan shark business should be a lesson where many of them are not even traceable but has a business in Nigeria to further put pains and hardships on Nigerians. If a business could be rigged like that, how much more crypto in which they are not answerable to anyone?It's your decision, but be wise!",

As of now this is what I see $4,470,606.57, and that means the price of the is increasing every second and minutes. Di wey I si am di token sef e dey connected 2 di BNB. And piple dey use am well now nai make e dey increase like dis.Â  All dis new tokens and coins dey come out because of bitcoin nd dem want 2 compete with BTC, as Charles_Tim said, if u like 2 use dem, make u dey use money wey go lost nd e no go pain u. I no de trust dem oo 2.",
