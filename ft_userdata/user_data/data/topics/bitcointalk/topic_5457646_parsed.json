However, there's very little chance of this happening with low-end hardware. It would be a waste of electricity, and you'd be better off buying coins directly with that money. Because, for example, even if you solo mine XMR on your own, even if by some miracle you have a block, you'd only earn around 0.8 XMR, and that could take several years.To mine, either you invest the means (financial, infrastructure, electricity) and you do it properly, or you don't and you buy your coins directly. If you have nothing to invest, it's better not to waste your time and risk damaging your hardware.(tdlr : integrated graphics won't help in case of mining, and a i5 2400 is way far of being profitable)",

It's so easy to do this in a bear market knowing that in 1–2 years when the bull market is back, the coins or tokens can easily go x5 ROI and above. Now there is no way he will get even a half of x5 ROI in the 1–2 years using his current hardware to mine",

The motherboard socket is compatible with your processor. I was wrong that there are no new motherboards for your socket in China. In customer reviews it is written that these are new motherboards and not after repair.https://aliexpress.ru/popular/b75-motherboard-mining.html",

You still have to change the thermal paste, so $11 will not be there at the end of the year.Even if this is a question of a student who lives in a university dormitory and does not pay for electricity, then it is better for him to find another way to earn money.",

If you want to mine, then you need to have an advantage over other miners in the ability to find new coins, the cost of electricity or the ability to buy and repair equipment cheaply. Any old PC will break quickly, but if it lasts even a year and earns you some dollars, it's not the experience you need.",
