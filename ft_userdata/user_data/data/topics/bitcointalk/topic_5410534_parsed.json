  "content": "**Maya Protocol, the new best platform to provide liquidity?**Maya Protocol  has a really revolutionary model for liquidity nodes and liquidity providers, based on the classic pure bond model implemented by projects like THORchain.Maya obtains awesome capital efficiency by having nodes bonding LP units all liquidity in maya will be tradeable, creating a flywheel with plenty of benefits like:- Average yield for all players- Liquidity pool depth increases- Increased yield- Nodes earn yield while they wait in line, so its less risky to competeI'm keeping my eye out for Maya since there are no complex IDOs, Maya will launch with its own Liquidity Auction model, planning for a fair launch.Also Maya’s liquidity nodes are something i'm really excited for as an liquidity provider, and  their twist to the pure bond model have me getting my hopes up for the project.Any thoughts?https://www.mayaprotocol.com/",
