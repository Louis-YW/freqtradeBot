If you did manage to keep hold of your btc in the ath you are probably one of the few that managed to do that. Most people sold even the die hard btc fans. You would probably be better selling at ath and then reinvesting your money when there is a price correction.",

It was big enough news to make it to TVs and websites outside the bubble of crypto enthusiasts, so as you can imagine, my initial encounter didn't leave a positive opinion about Bitcoin. However, it gradually started changing as I learned more about banks, fiat, and how Bitcoin is different, and also figured that you can't really blame a neutral tool for being used for bad purposes (and all sorts of money are used by some people for bad purposes).",

Then I started using fiat currencies like Perfect Money and Payza. Some people encouraged me to use Bitcoin, which I disliked because it is volatile. But now I thank them for inspiring me, and I'm slowly learning about Bitcoin. When I discovered how Ponzi worked, I decided to leave them. Of course, I am opposed to all Ponzi schemes in order to protect people from them.",

But for you, I will do it again. Here's how it went. There were news about a game called Blue Whale which was available in the dark web. It seemed interesting to me, so I did some research on that. And there were this payment method where you had to pay in BTC. That's the first time I came to know about BTC. But I was not involved with the market yet. Cause the news wrote all kind of negative things about BTC. Then I came to realize that it's not bitcoin's fault, it was those who created the game.Then I forgot about it. in early 2020 I was told that you can earn some money on the internet. That caught my eyes. Then I did some research and found out that you can mine them. So I searched the internet about mining. And from that point I got involved with this community.",

Probably people have a different experience when discovering BTC but for me, I discover it on my own. Back in those days when I was new in the crypto space, I remember looking for a platform that something I can earn money while at home, after such time I discovered a platform that has BTC airdrop while looking to gain money and altcoins airdrop very popular at that day, I can even earn more than 100 bucks just collecting airdrop. Freebitco.in is what I mean and until now still, they are giving airdrop.",
