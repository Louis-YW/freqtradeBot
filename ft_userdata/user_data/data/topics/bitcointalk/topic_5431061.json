There are countries that don't want to adopt Bitcoin for one reason or another. There are countries that have and are implementing this such as El Salvador.We are not able to convince countries that they are willing to adopt Bitcoin. One of the most possible things for us to do is to provide socialization to people about Bitcoin with a note not to be recommended.Please follow the discussion of two topics related to this on the link that has been listed by solosanz so that it is aligned with what you want as you wrote in.this topic.Quote from: Solosanz on December 23, 2022, 05:11:25 AM[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5426093.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5430921.0",

In the same way, news about banks spreads bad news about bitcoin and advises people not to invest or use it. But I really don't believe what they say or what the media is spreading. I have the same thoughts as you, governments, banks, and people who are stigmatizing bitcoin every day are quietly accumulating more bitcoins than we can imagine. We need to remember one thing, business or investment has the ultimate goal of profit, as long as there is profit, those statements can change at any time.",

The Nigerian economy is mainly dominated by cash fiat transactions. It is not strange to see people in banks withdrawing Millions of Naira from the bank and putting them in big bags. This government policy affects only physical cash withdrawals. Other transactions option like bank transfers are open to Nigerians. Individual account holders can do transfers to the tune of N25 million and companies can transfer as much as N250million. The government wants to promote its cashless policy so it is encourage its citizens to use other payments channels beside cash transactions.",

However the reality of the situation is that cryptocurrency in it's present form is incapable of performing all the transactions that happen in the world in a timely manner, especially in comparison to existing payment networks like Paypal or credit / debit cards. I hope in future the transparency of cryptocurrency and the decentralization it is based on is capable of meeting that demand - while being impervious to things like the 51% attack, but we're still at step one of that process until people figure it out.",

Limited to a small subset demographic of society who pursued financial independence. It may be only recently that people have had their eyes opened to alternatives. The 2008 economic crisis served as a trigger event for the rise of this methodology. The global pandemic of 2020 and other crisis, could further accelerate the adoption of alternate views on economics and finance.The irony of the topic is we have seen leaders in government like David Walker warn about these types of crisis since 2009.QuoteCampaign for fiscal responsibilityWalker has compared the present-day United States to the Roman Empire in its decline, saying the U.S. government is on a \"burning platform\" of unsustainable policies and practices with fiscal deficits, expensive overcommitments to government provided health care, swelling Medicare and Social Security costs, the enormous expense of a prospective universal health care system, and overseas military commitments threatening a crisis if action is not taken soon.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Walker_(U.S._Comptroller_General)#Campaign_for_fiscal_responsibilityWhen David Walker did a nationwide tour on these topics back in 2009, I thought people would pay attention, wake up and the worst of it would be averted.
