I am not sure they are really hack cases or just manipulating ones.",

Substantially slim that the government can do anything, then the process to go about it would be something else, because you will have to prove that the funds were in truth, stolen. I can imagine losing $300 worth of bitcoin and going to my local police station to make a complain, i doubt if i will be taken too seriously.The government can't even do anything, unless there is an address on a centralized exchange that links to the thief, then the government will have to authorize the exchange to provide more info about the thief, what a heck of a process, and i can guess you will have to lose a very large sum of money for the government to do this.",

I can imagine losing $300 worth of bitcoin and going to my local police station to make a complain, i doubt if i will be taken too seriously.There are some chances , but first you have to show the police and mostly the cyper crime special teams enough evidences for what you complaining.In case of the Fake Malware downloads for Phonixminer we got there is already enough evidence in a few cases and a investigation is started.It needs the Hacker address where the coins was sended (if a hack was happend) , the malware you have got and downloaded and few more things.Connections to somebody that have access to the chainalysis software helps a lot for find services and exchanges.But for low Amounts of BTC the expenditure mostly is it not worth to investigate.",

To prevent is easy and cheap but to cure is hard and costly, that is also how stolen funds are.It is possible for you to make use of Chainanalysis for investigation, you can make use of other analystic companies too, but to begin is not easy and very costly. Not suitable if you are scammed with low amount of coins, but if you are scammed in millions of dollars, this would be a very good option to go for. Scammers are very wise, assuming the scammer make use of Tor and other means the transaction can not be linked to him, it would be very hard for analytic company to know the person, even if the person later got known, it could take months or years before his identity was known. If the bad actor is not known, you would have spent a lot of money.You may see recovery services online, they will all promise to look for the scammer for you and get back your coins for you, avoid them all, they will only request for money and later nothing would be done, even most of them are also scammers, they will collect money but not leading to any fruition.",

Because if we're talking about probably less than $10,000, it's likely that exchanges wouldn't care to help.Yes, this depends on how much money was stolen. If someone loses less than $10K or maybe just a few hundred dollars then I think the authorities will ignore the case. I think exchanges have a certain amount limit that allows them to handle hacking cases, obviously I think it's hundreds to millions of dollars.If I'm not mistaken, binance previously disclosed the hacker to the authorities until this hacker was caught. But I forgot where this case was discussed and did not find the link in the forum considering I'm currently using Android to post.",

Keep your keys safe2. Keeps the funds in wallet and if possible buy a hardware wallet3. Beaware of phishing attacks4. Make sure your devices are safe from any malwares",
