  "content": "Bitcoin friendly Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has announced on Coindesk TV today that he will be accepting donations to his presidential campaign in bitcoin for as little as 0.00034. He said that this is a process of developing technologies that are going to create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation and are not manipulated by a human beign's ulterior motives,political goals e.t.c.Mayor Francis has being criticising Joe Biden administrative on the way he is handling crypto and said that the administrative don't understand crypto. He said that he will ban CBDC. He vowed to make Miami a bitcoin hub and has accepted his salary in bitcoin. LinkWith all what these presidential candidate said,will it be possible for him to stand a chance to become the next president of US ?I think if he does become the president of US bitcoin price will shoot up in the nearest future  to six digits and bitcoin will gain more ground in the world.

Politics is still the same as a popularity contest that's why Biden and Trump are still the closest in the polls. The rest are just wallflowers trying to get noticed.",

What an interesting concept: a crypto-crusader in the realm of politics.But if you want to be president... What an interesting thought! How much of a shot would he have? What can you expect? This is politics, after all. As volatile and ever-evolving as the cryptocurrency itself, bitcoin.Your prediction... bitcoin's six-digit price increase if Suarez is elected president. Intriguing! Though Im not really sold on it. Its true that the president has some say in how things are run... The crypto market, however, is global. Its possible that's pushing it... In any case, the future seems bright... See how this political drama involving bitcoin develops!",

Maybe they're partially true, but once they reach power in a very simple way they'll give answer when questions were put on them connective to the statements during the election campaign. These are election strategies, one thing that is happening good is the spread about bitcoin. When someone popular shouts about something surely people will search and find what it is, and lets see does the electorial campaign brings him win.",

What are your suggestions on thisI'm not into US politics except for the last election between Biden, and Trump, but I'm curious on why there are many presidential candidates right now who are using the hype of crypto just to boost their popularity. Hmmmm.Anyway, for us who are involved into crypto, I guess this might increase the popularity of cryptocurrency, but realistically speaking, what are the chances of this Miami Mayor, and the other one who is also promoting cryptocurrency to win? As for politicians in general, I already have in my mind the thinking that these politicians are blabbering lies, lies, and more lies. I might be generalizing, but it's what I feel because most of them aren't doing what they're promising during the campaign. Same with this one. Do you think that he really will focus on cryptocurrency alone? His attention will be divided thus, he might forget his promises regarding crypto. Is there a chance for him to win? It's hard to know knowing that I'm not a US citizen, and I don't know the pulse of the voters out there, but if this Miami Mayor will run just because he want to popularize crypto, or he wants to use crypto to boost his popularity, I don't think he'll win. As for the 2nd question, it will not shoot up even though he will win.",

As far as Bitcoin is concerned, it has at least been getting some attention. Whether the candidates promoting it will win or not, at least it has been brought to the table. Kennedy Jr., Mayor Suarez, Governor DeSantis, and Ramaswamy have all been in support of Bitcoin. They've been vocal about it. While both Biden and Trump aren't fans of Bitcoin, at least the American people and the world as well have heard about it from no less than presidential aspirants.

It is a good thing that the politicians are talking about bitcoin at least this will make people to believe more on bitcoin. One thing that I know is that politicians can come up with big talk during their campaign just to win more people to their side but once they are elected into office they will do the opposite of their promises that is why this politicians are not to be trusted in whatever that they are saying during their campaigns. Bitcoin will continue to become popular with or without Mayor Suarez to winning the election.",

I feel bad that that's still how we see political campaigns as popularity contest, the incompetent one that talk loud and overpower the smart ones will almost always win but I hope that as we grow as a global nation, we would see more change in that aspect and choose the right leaders that will put the people's interest first before their's.Pretty nice publicity for bitcoin but I hope that the mainstream media has picked up on that because I don't see how it can really affect bitcoin in PR perspective if it's not shown to mainstream media where there's more people that don't know about bitcoin that watches there, comparing that to bitcoin/cryptocurrency news platforms that's mostly comprised of people that already know about it anyways.",

I honestly think Trump is more pro-crypto than Biden too. It is just that Trump likes USD more and that's only natural because he was (and probably will be again) the president of the US. Wouldn't it be strange for a president to support a decentralized project while they have their own currency? In the end the voters don't really care what they think about crypto anyway. Half of the voters are pro-Trump and the other half is pro-Biden and lots of people from both sides are pro-crypto.",

Bitcoin is slowly beginning to represent progress and technological innovation, and some politicians have undoubtedly decided to take advantage of this.Francis Suarez will ban CBDC? Don't make me laugh. He doesn't have enough strength or influence for this, and these are just another loud and empty words.Presidents don't become only because of the voiced promises. I think you overestimate this possible candidate and take his words too close to heart, and also on faith.",
