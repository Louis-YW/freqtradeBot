And just like those who predicted that there will be 2 big bull run after it has ended in 2021, which didn't happen.With that, I doubt that BitQuant statement or their predictions on Bitcoin reaching all time high before halving, in my opinion.",

But where I have some doubt is in what amount the all-time high is predicted because achieving a $250k price as predicted all-time price of bitcoin may look unrealistic at least not at this time.",

And that will be a new record for the price of Bitcoin because it managed to break through its last ATH.Bitcoin investors will agree to see it because they will make huge profits, depending on how many Bitcoins they sell later. But we still have to wait again to see whether it will happen before the halving or whether it will happen after the halving.I think maybe the price of Bitcoin before the halving can reach above $100000 but maybe it can't reach above $170000 yet. But after the halving occurs and after a few months, the movement of Bitcoin will increase and there may be mass adoption in the next year and 2025. But we'll see that soon. It will become more interesting.",

I’m not sure if we reach an ATH before the halving but the cycle high you mention there as $170,000 to $250,000 is actually what I think will happen. I think the Spot ETF’s getting approved will drive this run. It’s going to be an exciting ride, there is still chances to pick up cheap bitcoin before the fireworks begin though.",

I doubt it, and I am never going to change my plans because someone said 250k per Bitcoin is possible, it could be nonsense feed to people to keep them waiting for that 250k price and others take profits while you waiting.",

      "body": "Impossible to predict. Predictions based on 1 parameter (halving) and ignoring the entire complexity of the world are ridiculous. After a quick look at BitQuant's profile, I can say that the predictions are 100% pure fortune telling. You know what I mean? If you take a handful of sand and throw it on the ground, some out of the millions of grains will start to form patterns (from a mathematical point of view, it is impossible for no pattern to form). BitQuant takes these patterns and makes predictions based on them. Looking at the comparison to the Nasdaq, for example, I had a good laugh. BitQuant provides a pattern with N=0 (number of repetitions of the pattern) as the source of prediction. It happened once, it will probably happen again and on bitcoin XDTechnical analysis doesn't work like that. If you search the Internet for descriptions of well-known AT patterns, e.g. fallwing wedge, you will read something like \"A falling wedge stock chart pattern is 74% reliable on an upside breakout of an existing uptrend. When the price breaks through resistance, it has an average 38 % price increase. If the price breaks downwards, it is 71% successful, with an average price decrease of 14%.\" And based on this, you can make some predictions, instead of drawing in Paint what the chart would look the nicest and what would bring me the best profits and hoping it will happend. Its not analysis.",

It's high time we stop listening to these people and focus on our speculation, but may still listen to the external ones that are more reasonable and feasible. One similarity I noticed about crypto celebrities/businesses like this is that they always open their mouth to spit out anything that comes to their head but without any important data or analysis to back it up. These are mere guessers that people tend to worship as a demigod if their gamble narrowly happened, while some are only seeking attention. Many of such have been put to shame in the past with their outrageous pronouncement and this one will likely join the league soon.And of course, Bitcoin has the liberty and prospect to touch higher levels before halving, but one thing I would say I'm almost sure about is that it will not reach the ATH before the tradition. As for $250,000, I expect a surprise in about a year after the next halving, but for Bitcoin to hit almost x4 of the present ATH seems to be something impossible. Altcoins will have their fair share of the crypto capital investments too, it's not all about Bitcoin.It's more practical for the rise to be gradual in each halving season, however, it's not entirely impossible.",

Bitcoin has never gotten to all-time-high before halving and I do not think this will happen this time. But if to buy bitcoin now is the question, the answer is yes and people can also go for DCA.

There is no telling exactly when this ATH will happen but I will believe that the past will repeat itself until there is new history.$100k is a pretty low goal for me and $250k is actually pretty high for bitcoin to reach. But if the bull season coincides with the world economic recovery, we will have more catalysts and hope for the unexpected.",

I believe Bitcoin will have a very favorable run after the next halving, I am even going out on a limb and agree we will see a new all-time high but I don't believe we'll see one before the next halving.

Given that the deadline for the SEC to make its decision is sometime in early 2024, it is logical that all these \"experts\" compete in their speculations, which in the end are nothing more than that. I really don't want to speculate too much about the prices, it is realistic to say that it will be somewhere between $70k and maybe $150k at the peak, although there is a possibility that it will be much more.",

Halvenings are not equal, every halvning is weaker than the previous one, because a smaller share of total supply is being cut. Already over 93% of all coins have been mined, so I don't think we should expect from the next halvenings the same performance as when only 50% or 75% of the supply was mined.We already saw the slow down of growth during the previous cycle when the ATH only increased from $20k to $69k, and not to $100-300k like many tried to predict based on past performance.",

If the ATH is reached before the halving, then of course there is a big dump cycle after some time of the halving which will basically throw minners out of the back lane.The halving has so far tended to encourage more demand which has resulted in bitcoin hitting ATH. No one knows for sure how high the price will hit after the halving, but some predictions seem too high from what I imagine. Of course something like that is achievable, but to me $250k is too high.

In my opinion, a bull market or the highest price that can reach $100k because I don't want to speculate more than that price is difficult to happen before the halving is complete, even though when the next highest price is time to happen, the market will never tell anyone and not waiting for people to be ready or not.",
