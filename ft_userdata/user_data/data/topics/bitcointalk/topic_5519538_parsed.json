Seeing Green candles always and breaking ATH like this is quite a first to me because I wasn't really active during the 2021 Pump. It's a beautiful feel getting Richer and quite exciting if I may ask. While doing almost nothing.",

I don't talk to people about Bitcoin outside the forum for security reasons. People usually think that you are rich if you own Bitcoin. It is also believed by some people that cryptos are scams or Ponzi schemes. So people tend to think you want to scam them if you start discussing with them.The well-being of my immediate and extended family is my highest priority. So the most exciting part of my life is to see them in good health and having enough resources to survive. I also want to see positive changes in the political system of my country. Engaging in lobbying and protest for the respect of people's fundamental rights is also an exciting endeavor.",

Not only will it not benefit you , it can also get you into trouble .Have you ever thought about what would happen if their investment didn't turn out as expected and they started blaming you? Or if bitcoin is not legal in your country, you may face risks when giving investment advice to people...I'm not against introducing bitcoin to people around me because I do it sometimes but if they're not interested, I'll never introduce bitcoin to them again . Instead, I will only share with those who really need it.",

For sure that we cannot get anything from these people and we are just wasting our time with them. That's why I am so selective when picking up discussions in related on bitcoin since I don't want to receive negative impression about what I possibly tell to them.",

I talk about it as a strong medium to fight financial surveillance, but not as a \"invest in bitcoin\" medium. Most people (my friends included), have no idea what bitcoin is, but they only \"see\" it when it goes up in price.I don't discuss with my friends about bitcoin, because I hate this mentality.It's the exact same mentality that people investing in shitcoins have. It's a \"get rich quick\" mentality, rather than a \"I found a tool to become financially free\" mentality.",

When many people around you, change from lacked of interest in Bitcoin in many previous years, to very excited about Bitcoin now, it's early signal of Bitcoin market's euphoria phase. The top is not far and you must start to think more about taking profit. I am sure that you won't be able to time the market, find ATH to take profit but when you smell some signals of market top, it's not too bad to think of taking profit.Newbies with new capital will boost Bitcoin to its cycle top, and if you are not newbie, but experienced investor, you will take advantage of it to take profit.Are you ready for the Bitcoin bull market?

The buzz also is as a result of more countries enabling crypto mining farms and going as far as removing taxes on cryptocurrency transactions, a country like the UAE, Costa Rica also having to adopt the use of Bitcoin ATM machines, and other numerous to count.

Not only that, if a person wants to change his life then he must invest in Bitcoin as it will have life security. For example, if someone invests in Bitcoin now, after two to three months, he will see 2x, 3x and 5x returns.But of course everyone should remember, hardware wallets should be used to hold bitcoins so that they are far away from the reach of hackers. Otherwise you can lose the hard earned money. By doing this, the risk to the investor's life may increase and may cause a lot of damage physically.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on November 16, 2024, 01:52:16 PMPeople can learn about Bitcoin, online if they want, because there are many available resources, online and free for learning.

But if they are more interested then learn in different ways like: Youtube, Twitter Etc. Because I think that bitcoin is the most popular nowadays, many bitcoin holders do their analysis and know about bitcoin. By doing this it will be very useful for those who are interested because they will understand and learn better.",
