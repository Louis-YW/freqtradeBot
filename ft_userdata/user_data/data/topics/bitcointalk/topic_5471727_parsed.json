Then I think the melvin capital ceo has no knowledge about much of trading ? Did he learned hard way so next time he Will be betterThis is a story that people are quickly forgetting and which I don't think is related to the current dispensation anymore. However, Melvin Capital is a hedge fund, an American investment management firm that by its mode of operation hedged the positions of investors. That's the norm for hedge funds.They lose when you gain and gain when you lose. This is not about the leverage of a thing but their positions were unfavoured with meme stocks and adequate liquidity was against them.",

Did he learned hard way so next time he Will be betterIt was not that the people behind the company didn't know what they were doing. It was Hubris. Because they have gotten very used to winning for so long that they underestimated that a group of plebs from Reddit who were working together could play an institution in their own game, and out-trade them. Plus because of Hubris and believing they won't lose, they kept adding more money in the trade and thought that the plebs of Reddit would stop and give up.",
