Now they all take their MN cut. $5? Not a chance.Where are you getting the devs mined for 9 days, we Launched on August 4th, we announced multi places, and then announced here. We did not mine for 9 days, we mined just enough to secure the network, but this mining was also done alongside other miners. What masternode cut are you talking about, the community members run nodes. Please come to our community, discuss and get facts before spreading incorrect statements.Diabase Development Team.",
