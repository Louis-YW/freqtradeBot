      "body": "Do it on your own. That's the best thing you can do if you are looking for a long time trading journey. If you do not have enough knowledge and experience in trading, you need to learn that first. Knowing crypto and watching it does not make you a good trader. You need to use your knowledge of the market and try trading using that. That way you will gain experience. Most importantly, you need to learn other basic things that are highly required in order to start your trading journey. For example, emotion control. If you don't have that, you are more likely to drop out before you can begin. Using an assistant is helpful, that's for sure. But if you start with that without your own experience in the field, you are not going to become successful in life. When you are somewhat capable of doing your own trading and able to analyze the market, then you can get help from those assistants. use your own knowledge to get started and then when you feel like you are making a mistake or need some inspiration, you can get help from those services. As for me, I don't use any such thing as this anymore. So I have less experience with it. I can not recommend any or will not recommend any. Because I don't like them.",

There were leakage in the backend of Binance and 3commas that lead to many people to lose funds. Lots of people were complaining that their funds were missing which made Binance to stop offering API integration to this trading platforms. It was a like a partnership for Binance to drive more traders from other platforms to their trading exchanges but it doesn't worth it after that leakages. You can read about the API leak that happened last year that lead to loss of millions by 3commas...read moreI'm not trying to discourage you from using these platforms, I'm only preinforming you about the dangers of API while using other platforms because the result is not good anytime you leak your API to another platform. Instead of using this, I think Binance has improved on their trading chart view, make use of their exchange instead of another third party.",

It is also risky as mentioned above, not to mention there are other open-source bots if what you're looking for is a simple automation tool. Just remember that using a tool, which most of the time requires you to buy some packages will not magically help you increase your profits.",

Because basically, I prefer to trade independently rather than entrust it to other people or to a trading service platform. Besides doing independent trading,I think it will be better for trading career in crypto. Because the ability and knowledge in the field of crypto trading will definitely increase. So basically I am also not going to suggest any trading assistant platform to you. But I would rather advise you to trade independently. Moreover, you are still a beginner in the field of crypto trading, so it's better for you to learn about trading in crypto first, rather than immediately looking for a trading assistant platform. So that in the future, you don't always rely on anyone (trading assistant platform) to trade crypto. Even though learning to trade crypto independently, it will definitely take quite a long time, but you need to know, the results will really satisfy you.",

This means if BTC goes up you are taking a profit in the long but also losing money in the short too so not that help full. Plus they could make your trades automatic to some extent only. And could do proper DCA which you can also do or schedule at any exchange. The thing is many people do not want to connect their exchanges, or wallets to some platform that is ensuring money even.Because if that platform are hacked or goes bankrupt then what will happen to the details and data a customer had already given to these platforms? Although 3commas did not asked my anything personal yet instead of email but it did asked me to connect my wallet or exchange I think the only options I got was of exchanges well not so sure about it because did not gave it full glance. But still the problem remains the same of anounmity and risking funds to others.",

Also, the context of the post is also not clear as many platforms assist you while trading trackers help to keep records of the market, news, and portfolio management, Trading views help to technically analyze the market and the platforms like Glassnode help the long term on-chain activity analysis and assist in the decision making for the investors on a longer time frame.So about which type of the Assistance Op you are talking about....",

I did go so much into setting up the bot, but it tested its grid trading bot. It wasn't bad, but I was satisfied with the small profits, so I just continued to use the app as a portfolio manager.I know about cryptohopper, I even signed up for it but never got to use the bot. One thing that is work pointing out is that 3 commas was involved in some sort of API key leakage which led to loss of funds. So be very careful.",

And it is likely that you're just here to give them some free advertisement and you're able to get engagement with it. But, that won't give my curiosity a bite for what you've said. Even if there are other bots that are existing, those that will just be the same experience as what you're trying to find and prolong this talk. Anyway, if you want to make a good discussion about such then you should have explained a bit with what you've mentioned and give us an idea on how it is whether you're connected to them or not or basically just a happy user that made you remember it.",

After this I wouldn’t trust 3commas.",
