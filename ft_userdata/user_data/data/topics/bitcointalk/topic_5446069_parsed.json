  "content": "Hello,I've been trying the lightning network recently with my own node. Unfortunately I experienced a power outage which turned off my node and my channel with ACINQ has been 'Remote Force Closed'. Now I have a pending on-chain Bitcoin transaction that remains unconfirmed for already 3 days. Could you please explain when I will be able to use again this UTXO. Sorry I'm still a beginner. Is this because the fees have been set at a very low level (1.02 sat/vB) so no miner is picking-up the transaction? Is there a way to speedup the transaction from my side? Is there a risk that the funds are being returned back to ACINQ?Your help is very much appreciated. Kind regards",

If you did, you can just send another one with a higher fee.If you didn't, there isn't much you can do.If you check http://mempool.space/ you will see that transactions need about 10 sat/vbyte for a confirmation, as there is high price volatility now and people are making lots of transactions. You can paste your transaction ID there to see how much time you are likely to wait. But it will eventually get confirmed.",

So you are probably looking at about 25 Sat / VB as of this moment at a minimum. ACINQ might be able to bump the fee on their end but I don't know if they do that for people.-Dave",

I don't think I can increase the fees at this stage.Actually, my understanding of the context of the transaction is not clear. I just know those funds are mine ;-)This is the transaction ID: 46fecd345b06242984e57e0cc437cf3178cfa7a581a9d84e59dc7c742e6aa6e3Thank you again",

Even if we pay a fee with which we could \"speed up\" the transaction, the time until confirmation depends on when that pool will find the next block. The best way is still to check the mempool before sending the transaction and adjust the fee depending on the time in which we want the transaction to be confirmed.",

It's even possible that nodes remove that transaction from their mempool earlier due to reaching their size limit. I can vividly remember a time I had an unconfirmed transaction for over two months. It was from my wallet to one of the exchanges that I am using. I couldn't do RBF because the transaction was made on Coinomi (I was using Coinomi at the time), also I did not have any unspent output pertaining to the transaction which I can use to do CPFP as I sent all the coins at ones to an exchange. I got no option than to wait for the transaction to be confirmed. It was a frustrating experience as my wallet is rebroadcasting the transaction, I guess. Even while using Electrum, it is better to not let the wallet to synchronize with the blockchain and leave it not connected at all, because very possible any synchronization will likely rebroadcast the transaction. Or maybe the transaction did not leave all the mempool nodes and still was routed to another nodes. I just did not know what happened, but my transaction stuck like forever until it was confirmed after two months when the mempool become not congested again.",

I have then re-initiated all my set-up and downloaded again the blockchain and opened again my LN node with the seed that I saved.Then I noticed that the channel had been closed (remote force close) and that there was a pending transaction on-chain that I believe correspond to the return of my funds from the channel previously opened with ACINQ.Now Ride The Lightning is showing my on-chain balance as \"pending chain balance\", and I am not able to use those funds.I can also see the funds on my Bitcoin wallet but I am not able to withdraw them.I don't know what I can do to make these funds spendable again.Thank you again for your help, very much appreciated.Kind regardsHello, I'm really sorry for all the misleading information.I've been checking again what could have happened and realized that the issue with my stuck funds is not related to the closure of the LN canal but to a Loop out that I have performed just before by using Ligthning Terminal. ie. in order to send liquidity from one side of the LN channel open with ACINQ to the other through a server that sends back the BTC to my on-chain address (atomic swap LN to BTC if my understanding is correct).This is the transaction: 46087e7a28056dc4e134007426b48dc4ca8d7898439644da33084628a0c517d0I don't understand why the transaction is still presented as Unconfirmed and I'm not able to use my funds. What could I do to unlock those funds?I'm so thankful for your help.This post found on the web exactly describes what happend to my funds:\"I was trying to open a new channel but I was not able due to not having enough BTC. I tough I had, but when checking thunderbub I saw I had a big amount pending. I was not sure why, but it is due to an initated but not confirmed Loop Out on lighting terminal. I think it will take long due to the very low fees I used.Does anyone know A. If a loop out can be cancelled (I'm prety sure It cant be reversed) and B. Where to find transaction ID to check on current status on mempool?\"I also found this, which might describe the situation and potentially the fact that I lost my funds:\"What happens if lightning loop transactions drop out of mempool?I've looped out of a few channels a week or so ago. I normally use a UI but was having some issues at the time so used the terminal. So when I looped out the transactions were made with a really low default on chain fee (1 sat/byte). So they've been sitting unconfirmed for a while and probably will be until I start bumping fees.I've noticed while these transactions are unconfirmed my channels do have the updated inbound capacity and I have been able to send payment to them (whereas they didn't have enough capacity before looping out).What would happen now if the loop transactions dropped out of the mempool? Can that happen or will the lightning loop servers just keep broadcasting the transactions? Will they bump the fee?\"Somebody then answered: \"Your loopd should automatically increase the fee over time as once the HTLC expires technically the loop server can steal your funds.\"Did the loop server just stole my funds then?Mod note: consecutive posts merged",
