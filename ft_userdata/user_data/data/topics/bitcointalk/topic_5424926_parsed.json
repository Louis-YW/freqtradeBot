  "content": "There ia the big evolution that allow live play roullete and black jack and more.I consider bw the first one to open live casino street games.The one that simple players play like 24 (alternatove to roullete)Coin flip and more all broadcast from thr streetsWhat you think?Edit; i dont think all understand here what live casino games means.If you dont understand  what is live gamre watch endoephina is mean the bets ard played live by real person every few seconds. (Real blackjack dealer,real roulletr dealer etc)So if you think it can be rigged it doesnt make sense. Live casino providers dont gain anything from rigging a game tFor example if lose win 5k hand live black in stake.com by evolultion provider. Evoulution gain about 0.5%.  Stake.com gain the most.Livecasino providers dont gain shit fron rigging games this why they are much better option than playing on a regular self made casino games. Is more trusty way to gamble.",

Lolz, how is he possibly going to find a away to make something that is illegal legal?, is it by bribing the government? Can he afford the amount the government would  ask,? Or is it by cajoling the government to change their mind and unban what is banned, where in the world has one man been able to achieve such a great deal?The long and short of the story is that what the op ask is not possible, though I didnt quite understand completely what he is really asking about, this comment is based on what commenters believed op to be inquiring about.@op, And like the quote above later pointed out, simply get a shop and design it the way you want and  get your video hosting service,  I believe that when inquire what it cost to get a personalized video hosting service and compare it to what you are likely to make out from idea, you might discover it's not worth it after all.",

However, it will be a challenge for you how you are going to stream this fight on the streets?And probably this is the reason why online casinos are not doing live casino street games, maybe the profits is not there because like the coin flip, they will have to wait for players to bet so it might take some time to load and re load the game. And who is going to throw it? So again, more challenges for them and it might not be worth it, just saying.",
