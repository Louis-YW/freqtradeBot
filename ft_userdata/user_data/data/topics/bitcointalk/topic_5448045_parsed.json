There are some brands that we can see on mobile stores with 8GB of ram that only cost $80. I'm not sure what the difference but they all seem to be faster nowadays maybe if you have installed different apps already, it will have an effect. With 12GB RAM I guess you are planning on play-to-earn games?",

I mean, I can belive that part about you buying that mobile phone thanks to signature campaign earnings and kudos for that, but this part about being your first mobile phone ever, when you could buy pretty decent new smartphone (Xiaomi for example) for $150 like 5 years ago? Honestly, smells like bs merit fishing story to me.",

I'm happy to see that some people are using the bitcoin they earn here to invest in things like phones or laptops that can help them be more productive in the future. You seem to be a hardworking person with faith in your dreams and goals. I believe that signature campaigns could be of great help to people living in third world countries, as they often pay better than some jobs in real life.I love your tenacity, even though you lost a decent amount of money ($3,000), you didn't give up and started looking for more ways to make money. Keep it up and good luck in your future endeavors!",

That's not possible. Also, this phone is very costly, why spend a lot of money on a smartphone with 12GB Ram when you are recovering back from your loss? I will also like to ask what your plan is currently, if you aren't accumulating Bitcoin right now you are doing everything wrong. I'd rather buy a smartphone with 4-6GB Ram for my benefit right now when Bitcoin is up for the discount price.Still, I wish you the best.",

Bro I don't think there is need to be such a detective in someone posts that is trying to express his joy in achieving what he has since long for. Anyways the op clearly stated that he has been working hard and maybe he earn not only from the forum signature campaign but the money from signature campaign working here helped him in achieving what he called his dream mobile. Op am very happy for you and like you and everyone else, we all have dreams he or she wants and for me I really want to start a business but am currently struggling due to the high inflation also in Africa but since I found this forum, I have been exposed to so many opportunities and I have also started hoarding some bitcoin through DCA and hopefully I will hold till the next ATH we will experience in the market.",

What problem do you have with that?Quote from: Maxre on April 08, 2023, 01:53:39 PM I am a student and I have to bear my expenses too. And that's why I am still happy by having my dream mobile to come true.OP, just keep striving for good things, and success will be yours. As a student, paying some bills for yourself is really a good effort you are making for yourself. Also, be more careful so you don't fall into such a scam that you would have to lose up to the amount you lose. Also, be aware of the new email scams that have been trending recently.",

If the store did accept crypto payments, that important detail would have been mentioned in the OP. The photos look like Binance P2P page, I think OP converted his bitcoins to usdt and then sold on p2p for fiat. Quote from: Maxre on April 08, 2023, 01:53:39 PMI don't know about other countries too and I hope that some of us members are earning more than 1000 dollars plus per month from here. And I can't believe that Signature is a good thing by having high quality post and that helps forum to grow and also sponsors to get their traffic from it. I remember reading  this thread  not too long ago and the OP was very happy as you are now with his first signature earning. At the moment I don’t think there’s any signature campaign that you can earn up to $1000/month. It’s good you have other skills to support yourself, signature campaigns are only part benefits of being a quality poster on the forum, it’s unstable and I wouldn’t take it as a full time job. Congratulations on your new mobile! ,",
