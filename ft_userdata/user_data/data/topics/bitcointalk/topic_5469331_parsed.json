  "content": "About three months ago, I launched a digital course to teach some writing and building skills that I learned from trial and error.The setup is quite minimalist: a simple site built with WordPress. I enabled Stripe and BTCpay ( hosting with voltage )Â  as payment options - I even offered a 5% discount when paying with Bitcoin.Result30% pay with BTC70% pay with FiatI do need to say the feeling of receiving Bitcoin directly into my cold wallet feels beautiful!But do you think is it currently a bit too early for BTC only projects? ðŸ¤” However, the course's testing pool is currently limited in Chinese, so it can only be used as a reference.Part of me is curious to see how the future of e-commerce works, and the best way to learn is to do it - I am in the middle of building a BTC-only project: bridging BTC with real-world goods ( stay tuned for more ), but here are some of the problems I have not thought through:1. Pricing in satsI know the fiat price of BTC is a distraction, but as a business, you want to make it easy for people to pay.Would BTC-only businesses adjust the price when BTC is $600k and $60k? For hard-core Bitcoiners - 1m sats are 1m sats, so I guess there is no need. But in reality, most people still change it to fiat price when understating the value of their Bitcoin.Understanding the value of a new currency takes time; at least, that is my experience of living in other countries. But sooner or later, you could use the local one as your default mental value calculation - like you'd know how much a coffee should be worth!2. I could not find the pricing option displayed in sats.The current pricing option in WooCommerce is in BTC, but I prefer to show it in sats. Does anyone know any good tool or plugin to make this happen?Or would it be easier if pricing in USD but pay with Bitcoin during this stage? ðŸ¤¯3. I am happy to hear from existing BTConly projects' insights._I do not have any Bitcoiners around to discuss these with me. Much appreciate for everyone's input. ðŸ§¡Original article by natalia on stacker newsStacker news its like hacker news but we pay you bitcoinJoin the discussion https://stacker.news/items/241076/r/02b7622c79[/orange]",

They are determined to not fall fall any temptation that will make them use some part of the bitcoins that they are keeping, so a 5% discount which is also a good offer is also a temptation for them to tamper with their bitcoins, so they avoid it.

That can be a reason more people paid with fiat.",
