So in trading, it is advisable to remove whatever that will make you to be emotional by following the rules of the system.You don't need to be too anxious of anyone who offers to give you ideas on how you can make profits while trading as if it was that easy i believe they will rather prefer sharing those ideas with their close ones. Although some of their ideas do work but its dependent on how focused they are in following the exact rules that will enable the system to work.Instead of paying someone that claims they know about how the system works its rather you use that money and start investing then follow the rules and basic techniques that the system requires that's sure the right way to go.I know that almost everyone goal is centered at making huge amount of money in trading but that shouldn't be your most priority yet as you need to know the things that are more important in trading as quick as possible because if you ain't able to identify how the market is going on time then you might likely lose out at a time when the market would have been favourable to you.And again do not allow your attention to be divided while trading and at a time when you are looking for the best time to invest you should be able to identify the wrong signals from the right ones.Just like wetin I talk for the other side naim I carry come here make una reason together.",

Dat money wey you wan give person so, why you no use am learn how to trade yourself. Nothing better pass when you sabi trade instead of depending on another person to dey give you signals. At the end of the day, you go realize say you been dey make the wrong decision. Me self I go prefer you go to a legitimate trading service providers wey be say you go give them money like investment  and dem trade and give you returns and use that time dey do other meaningful things wey go add to your life than to wait for signals wey you no understand how dem carry get am. If you want to trade yourself, spend money and learn it perfectly before you start thinking about profits.QuoteAnd again do not allow your attention to be divided while trading and at a time when you are looking for the best time to invest you should be able to identify the wrong signals from the right ones.Investing and trading different, both can be done simultaneously and you no go get any challenge. Investing no get much work as all you do after you dun see coin wey you wan like na to buy and hodl am. You no need to they monitor the market or do anything active but just wait until time dun reach wey be say you dun get get better profits and you sell or you wait until they time wey you give yourself to hodl dun reach and you sell. Trading na say you need dey active for the market and they buy and sell almost daily so doing the two no get problem. If you plan yourself well you can multitask on various profit generating activity and come out successful. People dey wey dey run am so e no dey impossible to achieve.",

One thing is certain, you can never be very successful while investing or engaging in a business you don't know about or you're now willing to learn its modus operandi. Those who pay those signal providers want to skip the learning process and their success is entirely dependent on the signal they receive. Now they don't even know if the person they are paying is just like themselves or even worse then them. They're lazy to learn and most of them pay dearly for it by incurring significant loses. Learning is encouraged everywhere including in the trading career, that's why there are demo accounts, I remember one meta  trading app, I used to learn last year, they gave me free 140 dollars to trade and learn with the agreement that I'll return it after 30 days and take whatever profits I made there. The problem with these new guys in the building is that they are faster than their shadow and want to reap the fruits without labor. For me, a newbie shouldn't rush to the real trading, they should start with demo accounts, build their experience. Know some hidden and exposed tactics before even thinking of investing real money.One thing is certain, \"if you think education is expensive, then try ignorance\". If dedicating your time and resources to learn is a stress to you in trading, then the loses you're likely to incur will stress you more. This is the general rule everywhere, even in this forum. Learning is encouraged to be able to engage properly and reap the bounty of the forum. So I don't think there's any shortcut to success, you must learn, before you earn.",

      "body": "Trading and investment should be done with emotions Infact any financial systems that holds strong to emotions will fail.Its sad that almost all beginners in anything always wants to speak the learning process and start making money, this actually can likely be a cause of greed or ignorance, no matter how much financial down one must be, its not possible to skip the learning process in order to earn. I no longer hold much regard for signals, I see it somehow as gambling (like you are getting a betting code) if the market goes out against you, you won't know what was wrong with the analysis given to you only the owner of the signal will his/her flaws and continue growing while the beginner remains stagnant or regress. Though it's also good for beginners to compare their analysis with professional but they should keep in mind of human error in case there is an obvious error my the professionals analysis, they won't just accept it because he or she is superior to them in trading",

Because one thing I have come to understand is that trading is one skill best to be learnt physically, where all  technics and strategies are well explain to the best of your understanding, far better than buying a course or joining a WhatsApp group where trading is claimed to be taught at a subsidized rate, as most always end up been scam, while others only the basic are always been explained.

The thing is that as a beginner is better you just focus more on holding instead of going for trading because as trading seem to be a way of making profits that's also how the risk is also high so the best way is to eradicate any trading mindset you are having because you may not like the outcome of it. However is mostly the beginners that normally fall victim of trading because there major target is always the profit without knowing the possible risk associated because trading has to with understanding the fundamental and technical analysis of the market which could allow you no the market structure so if perhaps you don't understand the analysis there is every chance of losing or blowing your account.",

For instance, if you are a trader trading with $100 in capital and you experience losses to the extent that you are now left with $20, if you allow your emotions to take play, you might end up losing it all, but if you have a good skill at controlling your emotions, you should know that with such a loss, you should take a break and try again later or the next day. The same applies to gambling. The advice is for a trader to always not allow their emotions to control them while they are trading.",

Trading is one thing that deals with prediction which applicable to one emotion just that detail knowledge and rules guide one not to fall prey to some losses but loss can't be root out completely.",

There's days when your star is shining and you're winning, making gains and all that, you need to remove your profits from the platform to safeguard them from being lost in the events of tables turning round.Also there are bad days, like days you lose as though losing is your calling. For example, like you're gambling with $100 as you mentioned above and you've lost like 50% of your capital, your mind should be alert to avoid going further for the day, and even if you go further and somehow loose up to 70%. You should take a serious break as that day isn't going in your favor, if you blindly continue, you might loose everything and even deposit more out of desperation. Believe me, the possibility of losing all is very high because your star isn't shining that day at all.In a nutshell, there are good and bad days, your ability to recognize bad days early enough and avoid the total mess it brings along is a testimony of your gambling discipline and high emotional control.",
