  "content": "In all history of investment projects both government structures bitcoin has the vast transformation system e.g when it was first launched in 2009 with less than $10 rate, many major breakthroughs come from there as people hips plenty units of bitcoin, the first bulls was extremely recorded, this pupms progress from $10, $50 up to $60k and that makes a lot of changes over this intervals of years. The trade and investment interest rate is accumulating everyday. Prior to this time before the price reducing to $29k, bitcoin have add history to development, standard of living, help many in reaching out to the less privilege. All this shows great transformation, I urge everybody to keep building bitcoin image, buy and store even with $10. I see freedom from financial burden to me and you, our children and unborn generation if bitcoin shines more life will definitely shines more to many.",

Personally, bitcoin has helped to transform my life financially and socially.But we can't disregard the fact that not all people have the financial capability to save some for crypto market. Also, up until now, a lot of people are still clueless on how to transact in crypto, so we can't expect them to go into this investment.For now, buy what you can afford to lose as everybody says. Because we have no idea what the future holds for this currency.We can't say, this market is sustainable for you as the price volatility is still the major factor why many investors are interested on buying some.If you are a long-timer and strong believer of this market, then, go for it. But if you still have hesitations, don't force yourself into holding one.",

      "body": "Well, many have even treated it as a retirement fund but thinking of that only those people that can take the risk will do it. I'll still have my own personal savings while keeping a part of my bitcoin holdings as I how I understand the future that it's going to give me. While many still doubt it because of the changes that we're having in this world and it's a technology and finance related thing, they're unsure if it's what we're intending to say to them. But it doesn't matter, whether these people will believe or not. We do understand that the potential of bitcoin is greater than we might be expecting and that's why even with less money, we're allocating for us to accumulate little by little of it.Quote from: TimeTeller on April 23, 2023, 09:59:06 PMBut we can't disregard the fact that not all people have the financial capability to save some for crypto market. That's one of the biggest problem that others who want to invest in bitcoin but have been dealing with that problem of inability to buy because they've got less budget or they've got other priorities. But I think if they'll put it to a major priority, they'll do something with their ability to at least give it a budget just as what OP has given as an example like $10 per accumulation.",

      "body": "When we talk about the transformation you have to be specific on what aspect you are dealing with because I can take Bitcoin price as the development of a transformation since it was covered in the white paper how Bitcoin price movement will be even though with an unpredictable price and direction for movement of its price and in the space from 2009-2023 Bitcoin have record thousands of luxe benchmark movement with proven track records my thought a good transformation and sustainability are on the bedrock of it layer 2 development that could eas fees and fasten transactions for a better scalability and mainstream usage.Because not many have the mindset of an investor because even when the price was less than $10 many still did not find Bitcoin attractive to have invested back than, but most people could likely use Bitcoin to perform transactions if the fees are low and the network is less congested, especially in trance border transactions.",

Some see it as a way of financial freedom, others as a means of profitable investment, and yet others as a means for swift international transaction. Everyone has a different perspective on how it should be used. In order to see mass transformation in the use of bitcoin in the future, all bitcoin lovers must agree on enhancing and sharing the good news about bitcoin and encourage others to join in.",

      "body": "Bitcoin technology has made many richer than they thought; for example, the man who accepts pizza deals with Bitcoin payments, although he sold his Bitcoin early, still made a lot more profit than it cost him to purchase those pizzas. Despite the fact that some people bought Bitcoin in the early days when the price was still very low, if we still buy now and hold for a long time, time will tell how profitable our holdings can be in the future. For instance, those who were able to buy one Bitcoin last year at $16k already made an extra $16 when the price hit $30k this month. Bitcoin investment is just about patience and timing.",
