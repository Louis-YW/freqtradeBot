I think it's not that big after I calculate using whatttomine site and use an average electricity cost.Gamble online isn't making money, you're will lose in the long run.Crypto investor, it's not an active job since you need to wait for at least few months or years to make money.I guess the reason why you not interested with cattle farming is you don't have any experience about it and you worried of getting scammed for trusting your money to your friend. Well, you need to educate yourself and know the risk.",

On the other hand, if you are just an investor, then probably your investments are designed for a long time; why not have a second income, the profit from which can again be transferred on the Internet?If we talk about how it happens to me, then Bitcoin is a secondary occupation for me; all the most important things happen offline. There is a business that brings in fiat.But I think we ourselves should determine for ourselves what is more interesting and important to us. Do you know what the ideal job is? This is a hobby that brings you profit; this is a job that you do with pleasure every day.Therefore, do not burden yourself with other people's problems; live your life and do what you love.",

Since you are so fun with your online businesses and you won't be able to put your time and resources into a physical business, you should go on and do whatever is profitable to you,since it can provide you with whatever needs that you want. On the other hand,these online businesses are not permanent source of income and the income vary time to time. Investing on a physical business doesn't mean that you must be there to control your business. Like you said about cattle rearing,you wouldn't be the one to take them around in search of pasture. A herdsman will be in charge of your investment and managing it for you, with this you can still go on with your hobby online. It is wiser that you shouldn't lay all your eggs in one basket.

It is kind of why many people actually prefer government work than companies. The reason I feel like you ain’t concentrating is because before venturing into crypto trading you weren’t into any of these business before. People that easily do both are mostly people that were involved in offline business before coming to the the crypto space so the knowledge was there already and someone like you need to learn the new business and I think that’s where the laziness kicks in (trying to learn a new thing)Quote from: KiaKia on May 04, 2023, 11:06:54 AMyesterday friends came to me and we have some discussions about businesses, they advise me to invest some money into raring of cattles,  I know how profitable the business is because I know those who are really into this and they are doing fine, I'm not ready to enjoy it because I enjoy online hustle than others, the world have called me freak for going down this path but it favours me and I am a living proof. Animal rearing is not that quite hard but for a total newbie it requires knowledge although I will say it is a good business too and will also be proper you invest in it from your earnings online. You can actually have people to look at them and you check on it on your leisure time, also since you have just into online stuffs I don’t see it taking much of your time Atleast there’s free time everyday you can spare for it. If animal rearing is risky to because it is certainly his due to the mortality rate attached to it, you can try holding of agricultural produce. This is quite stress free",

We all have a favorite subject in school for a reason, Bitcoin is just mine. Out of school though. Accumulating a lot of Bitcoin for retirement could lead to a happy life, but the question is, how much do you want to be satisfied with your retirement?From my past experience, during the 2017 bull run, I had a decent amount of Bitcoin, but I set a high target and continued to hold, hoping to reach that target so I could retire. Unfortunately, the market eventually crashed, but I still didn't sell my holdings. In the end, I regretted my decision. So, the lesson from my story is to always have a realistic target, and once you have enough money, try to cash it out or maybe a portion of it, since we cannot rely solely on Bitcoin for retirement due to its volatile price.Additionally, having a business aside from your Bitcoin investment is nice, as we cannot predict what the future holds for cryptocurrencies.",

It's like a distraction to me. People are motivated to establish and run a business because of money or passion. Individuals can run a business with little or no profit because of the love or passion to meet a need by offering a product or service. But when a passionate business is also profitable, the investor will be focused. Your passion for bitcoin and its profitability is making other ventures look like a distraction.QuoteHow are you guys running two business together? If the hustle isn't online I don't like it, I have few asic miners that I use to mine Bitcoin and I monitor the farm every day, I also gamble online too, I am also a big crypto investor, I am convenient with these.You are already running more than one business. You are a miner and an investor. But running more than one business in different sectors is time-consuming and demanding. You might also employ someone to manage the business or you go into partnership with someone. But if you can satisfy your need and other expenses, you can stick to your current venture. But it might also be good if you diversify your income to other sectors. Quote yesterday friends came to me and we have some discussions about businesses, they advise me to invest some money into raring of cattles,  I know how profitable the business is because I know those who are really into this and they are doing fine, I'm not ready to enjoy it because I enjoy online hustle than others, the world have called me freak for goindown this path but it favours me and I am a living proof. I have an offline job but I am more attracted to online jobs because I am a houseman. I have observed that people that prefer online jobs are mostly introverts. They just want to be inside their homes alone carry out their job description and get paid. Some other people want to be among colleagues interacting and sharing ideas. Another reason why I like online jobs is because it is mobile. Your office is the laptop, which means you can move your office to any location. If you are rearing cattle, you have to go to the farm to monitor your animals which makes it stressful and demanding. But with your laptop, you can monitor all your business online.",

There was a time when I can do all this myself but now I can't anymore because I now have much more interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, still I don't leave my family business because in this life nothing is guaranteed, anything can happen to any business at any time.My advice is sometimes two businesses are better than one but if you are getting the right results from whatever you're doing right now and you are contented with it then keep doing what you're doing.",
