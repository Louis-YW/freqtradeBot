Has all the channels anyone could want, every channel has an fhd/uhd channel, and also a really good selection of movies, and shows with subtitles. And a plus because it’s the only reliable service that’s not down at the moment!",

      "body": "Had a 24 hour free trial - t3enz0 was very helpful and quick to respond.  I tested with Kodi, VLC and IPTVSmarters.   Turns out that VLC choked on the playlist which I'm sure is due to sheer size.  Kodi handled it but I found that editing the playlist was impossible (memory usage was 2.5gigs in Win10).  Smarters is okay... very quick with the channel list but I had some issues with blank screens and audio only and also some of the VOD wouldn't play (though the same ones would play in Kodi) That being said, I'm trying it out for 3 months on a pared-down playlist (t3nz0 modified the playlist on my request).  VLC and Kodi are great with the smaller list.  I've also tried it with the Tivimate app and it's awesome. I might have to try the full playlist in Tivimate because I am impressed.  TBD.edit: I should clarify that SimpleIPTV (in KODI) and VLC were never designed for large playlists.  Once my 3 month was up with no issues, I did another 6 month.",
