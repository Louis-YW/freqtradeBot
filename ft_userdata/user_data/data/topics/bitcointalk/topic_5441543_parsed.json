      "body": "For me, the project looks quite sensible. Created and managed by people experienced in the business world, it has a lot of supporters, especially in the local Japanese community. Importantly, Jasmy is fully complies with the legal requirements of Japanese legislation, which strictly regulates transactions with cryptocurrencies and is subject to all kinds of financial audits. It certainly gives investors a sense of security. Basically, everything looks nice, except for the price, which drops regularly and is extremely low relative to ATH (ATH = $4.99, current price = $0.006). Certainly, the presence of the token on the world's leading exchanges allows you to think about profit, taking into account the current price, but I have doubts whether it is a good investment in the long term.

I'm curious how do these people on youtube sound like? I would stay away if they only talk about the positives like a typical salesman would do. It's already a huge red flag if they're somewhat connected to the project.Another thing you have to look at is if they had a token sale and accepted investors or buyers from the US. You don't want to be bothered by an SEC inquiry or lawsuit in the future hehe.",

So i am assuming if you invested you must know some where to get more info.From the English on their web pages i get that their whole idea seems to be all over the place. I don't have a clue what they have build already and how this Jasmy IOT platform is supposed to work.Are they giving people a way to sell their customer data as behavior and consumption patterns to companies?Trying to monetize big data via blockchain isn't anything new but i never got the idea why anyone would be interested on that. If you try to sell your own data via blockchain, how much you think it's going to be worth exactly?And why is the blockchain even needed for this? Is your customer data really such a high op sec that you need decentralized ledger and military level encryption to protect it? Yet everyone gives it for free for most the phone apps and web pages that can sell it forward without you knowing it.",

Well, it might still be under the radar of many but it's all up to you guys if you think that something good might happen on this. Only those believers in this coin will do much research about it but someone like me, I don't spend a lot of time researching it. I've heard good things about it, but despite that, the market of it also experienced a bear market. It's still on good exchanges so, its volume is being supported by those traders that are into those big exchanges. Btw, looking at their website, it doesn't really tell a lot about the project but the people behind it and its company profile.",

But don't let yourself fall on promises and sell immediately once bullish scenery occurs already since if you let the devs or other investors sell first then maybe you became a bag holder. This cycle repeats so better be wise on investing than be sorry later on.",

The current price is $0.0063 - price predictions for next years bull run range from $0.20 - $2.00.Some of the predictions are over the top but you never know, altcoins have pumped over 200x before.

Im not sure how long it will take to fly but when bull season arrived. Surely this could be a multiplier of 10x, 20x and 50x. But you need to take a deep review if the project has several plans for their platform or any form of development been working on to make sure you have been supporting a great team of course.",

See brief description below I have taken from internet. It has created a good history in intitial stage where it's attract whales and gives 10x profit to early investors. Later this tokens lost its value and continue down fall. I don't see any potential in this coins and I think it is same token like other pump and dump. I have seen many times Jasmy coin in Binance gainer list but after some days its again dump to that price where its pumped. I think there is no real potential in this coins. It is better to invest in other coin or invest very small amount and forget it until any miracle happen and its start pumping like memes coins. Currently Jasmy is trading at 0.01$ which is 36% up in 24 hours but after 2 days you will see that price will again dump to 0.008$. If you are active traders then might be beneficial otherwise I don't think you will get profit just by holding for long term",

So, if it's close to that target price of yours, sell. And as you observe, you have to wait until the right time comes if it's going to exceed on that part or not.",
