I know that the video that was shown on social media and in the news spark a national outrage for justice. But to see the images of a nation being destroyed and burn to the ground is terrible and should not have come to that point. I know that most of the people of France want justice because they are mad for seeing how a police officer shot and killed 17-year-old Nael M. If the nation of France could simply think with a calm head and not erupt in violence then maybe we can find peace and healing for the family of 17-year-old Nael M that was shoot unnecessarily and could have avoided that tragic day.",

I know that the video that was shown on social media and in the news spark a national outrage for justice. But to see the images of a nation being destroyed and burn to the ground is terrible and should not have come to that point. I know that most of the people of France want justice because they are mad for seeing how a police officer shot and killed 17-year-old Nael M. If the nation of France could simply think with a calm head and not erupt in violence then maybe we can find peace and healing for the family of 17-year-old Nael M that was shoot unnecessarily and could have avoided that tragic day.There are already several topics on this subject on the forum, where you'll already find the views of many users on this subject.As a Frenchman, I can tell you that I don't have a single relative or friend who sincerely believes that these riots are really related to Nahel's death. Otherwise, wouldn't they started the day following his death ? Admittedly, that's what started them, and what ignited them. But a large part of the population will agree that this is just a pretext, as it always is.However, who in good faith believes that burning schools, town halls and cars, and looting stores, is going to appease the police's relationship / way of working with some of the population ? Of course, the police is sometimes excessively violent, but at the same time, do you know many countries where it would happen like that? I can tell you that in most countries, a clean sweep would have been made. So if the police's lack of resources is what's fuelling the rioters' violence, isn't the snake biting its own tail?On the whole, the French are fed up with a section of the population that has become self-excluded and is using the death of one of its own to cynically destroy public property. We're not naive, we know very well that most of these rioters are minors who have no political conscience and who only function out of anger and frustration.",

      "body": "Such issue can be quenched via justice, else the victim resort to jungle justice or lawlessness until relieved or satisfied. It's more like the universal law of \"you reap what you sow\" , or \"those who kill by the sword die by the sword\" kind of thing, otherwise the evil hangs on and continue to weakens the Community's shield. Once blood is spilled or justice is done, the evil lessens and the heavy burden of evil/sin on the shield is reduced.People do animal sacrifice for a reason. But that is not a enough. CHRIST sacrificed HIMSELF instead. It's important they accept HIM and be relieved/satisfied",
