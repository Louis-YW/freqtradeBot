Every 4 years (approximately) there is a halving and the block reward for miners is reduced. Soon we should see that the block reward will be less than the transaction fees in the block. There will always be miners, if the algorithm does not change, but their number will be regulated by the profit from mining. The more miners, the more secure the blockchain.",

Sure, miners will still be there, blocks need to be found for the transactions to be confirmed. Otherwise, transactions would be stucked in the mempool forever.But I think it is not going to happen before the year 2136 (or 2140, not sure of the exact date)After this date, as IIrik11 said, they will no longer receive block rewards, but only transaction fees. The fees are not negligible for the miners, even if the price doesn't go up much more. It's more the adoption and usage of the blockchain that counts, recently we saw blocks with a reward (block reward + fees) that went from 8 to 11 BTC. Huge reward per block, even with fees only. Imagine the same reward with a BTC at 60 or 100k However, the real question is, will BTC still be needed and useful in 2140? And for the time being, I don't think anyone will be able to answer that question with any guarantee.",

I believe Bitcoin is here to stay, miners will always have something to make from transaction fee at least which is a very good thing.The only thing miners need to keep doing is upgrading their mining equipment, and the profit will be lower unless transaction fee increases, I hope this gets to new bitcoin miners that are worried about the uncertainty of mining in the future.",

And ASICs in the apartment are also difficult to use. Therefore, I do not know now any owner of an asic who supports the bitcoin network for the sake of the idea. All my acquaintances miners consider only profit and want to recoup their ASICs as quickly as possible.",

In addition to large mining pools, small mining pools also work, which will confirm transactions. Mining pools do not own all the equipment, and any action by the pools that will mess up the network with the cost of transactions will result in an outflow of miners from such pools.",

In reality, miners do have the job of confirming our transactions and the confirmation is unlimited times, from one peer to another peer, the cycle goes on and that is why we keep seeing old transactions with thousands of confirmation done already. Thats because they were confirmed by that many times with high confidence level. Miners will still continue to confirm the transactions because of the PoW algorithm of the bitcoin. If in theory bitcoin turns into PoS then miners will be done forever other wise they would still exist.",

The simplest answer I thinkMiner will be there but they will have efficient mining and big farms might cease to exist only small miners who will get from the transaction fees. and the price of bitcoin might be crazy at that time or the community has new consensus system I don't no like move to PoS but without adding more coin but this is high unlike to happen",
