And you're right, many miners aim to use cost-effective or renewable energy to stay profitable. The debate continues on how to balance crypto activities with environmental concerns",

Bitcoin is a consumer of electricity, but certainly not as it is presented. Cointelegraph could do some researchcheck this https://bitcoincleanup.com/or references listed at https://endthefud.org/",

Â this is where they will identify whether the miner is using the grid or their own green-environment-friendly energy source. i guess they would do something to those miners using the electricity coming from the grid. most probably collect their share maybe but don't think the green energy miners are safe. my guess is, the miners will sign contracts to only sell BTC to the government?or the government will get its share from the BTC Â they mine?or this is where miners are going to be united by the government to censor transactions.",
