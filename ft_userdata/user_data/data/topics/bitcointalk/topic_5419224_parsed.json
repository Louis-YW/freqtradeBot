Normal aging of the coin?It’s brass so it’s prone to rust, that’s why I put it in the little coin holder thing. I was told not to clean my coins because it would make it worse over time but I’m also no expert. I think it would come off easy by gently scraping it off dry but I also don’t mind the little spots and don’t want to make it worse since I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing.",

Happy to authenticate any Casascius coins for you or anyone else. How would that work? Would a HD zoom call do the trick? I really don’t mind the authentication, it has corrosion spots so you already know it’s about 10 years old. I’m slightly worried about the tiny & almost non existant lost package during shipping which would get doubled if it’s shipped twice.. If I declare the full value of the coin for shipping insurance reasons, would the buyer pay the duties on it? Have you ever authenticated these coins before? What’s the best way to do this?",

If I declare the full value of the coin for shipping insurance reasons, would the buyer pay the duties on it? Have you ever authenticated these coins before? What’s the best way to do this? From the photos you have provided, the coin appears genuine and the address still states loaded with the 1 btc.If I declare the full value of the coin for shipping insurance reasons, would the buyer pay the duties on it? Have you ever authenticated these coins before? What’s the best way to do this?Depends on where the buyer lives..  in the US, we do not pay customs/VAT fees.Due to the value, best practice at this time would be an agreed in person meeting if possible while funds were held in escrowOther options would be a secure shipping method such as USPS Registered Mail, which can insure value up to $50kI have authenticated hundreds of Casascius coins to date and have recently posted information about fake holograms.Hopefully others can reply with some recommended ideas for this transaction!",
