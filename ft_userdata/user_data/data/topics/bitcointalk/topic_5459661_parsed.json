I am always amazed by the level of knowledge myself and my peers have been exposed to since we invested in bitcoin. Our non-technical background hasn't stopped me from stretching myself to learn about the universe of discipline that is embedded in bitcoin.Understanding market trends has made me dabbled into probability and statistics. The concept of 21 million bitcoins supply cap has pushed me to learn and understand more about economics. The law of scarcity, supply, demand and the concept of money. My journey into bitcoin has lead me to learn about computer science while trying to understand how blockchain works, peer-to-peer networks. I have been also able to learn about on-chain analysis through using transaction data to make prediction of the market and  public sentiments. I have likewise been able to gather knowledge in relation to bitcoin concepts like signatures, keys, hashes, wallets. These fall under cryptography that plays a huge role in safeguarding our bitcoin transactions. I will not fail to mention how because of bitcoin I have taken a dive into the world of finance, through learning how bitcoin can help improve the problems faced by financial system and well as bringing about financial freedom. Lastly, I have been able to learn how Bitcoin protocol leverages game theory to ensure network security.Please note that I don't know it all but I can have a light conversation on each of this disciplines in respect to bitcoin.Thank you Bitcoin.",

Anyway great to see that you are learning about Bitcoin and enjoying too. You have learned a lot from Bitcoin and obviously we also learned about the future of finance or currency. I feel most attractive about it's decentralization and that was the first reason to love Bitcoin and also it's potential growth. I also want to thank Bitcoin for my little journey with a lot of learning.",

The law of scarcity, supply, demand and the concept of money. Only scarcity does not make a high price for Bitcoin. You must learn more to know why Bitcoin is favorite than altcoins, Bitcoin forks and why with same total supplies like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Forks don't have same price as Bitcoin and many of them are dead coins.Some forks and you can check like 5 forks to see their prices as well as check their network hashrates.https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/",

That’s is a great advantage in terms of crypto. The fact that there is unlimited and lots of opportunities also means that It is a self phase learning. 10 years delving into this will surely be fruitful because learning is continuous.",

I agree with your 2nd sentence though, this forum is a great place for all of that, all I've learned about bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, I learned it here first and did a little reading on articles after learning about something here.",

For me, at the beginning, it was quite challenging for me to understand the concept of bitcoin as a whole, but as you stated, with dedication and understanding to the trends, I was able to begin to assimilate.

      "body": "Ofcourse, Bitcoin is really nice and a great alternative to an unfair, centralized, closed, limited and rigged system that's built to benefits certain people & further certain agenda. Bitcoin is a clear opposite of this, as it's open, fair and benefits every participant equally just like the sun in the sky benefits all community members equally. The idea behind game theory is contrary to Bitcoin ideals. Its competition is fair, and no one gains undue advantage. Maybe the theory should be redefined to mean Healthy Competition for the benefit of the Community or all participants, and your submission concerning the g.theory would be considered. Being selfish is harmful to the System/Network, those who work most for the good of network benefit more. This is unlike the concept of game theory. Bitcoin rules treat everyone equally, whether poor or rich. It provides equal opportunities too . And both poor and rich are rewarded equally, according to the size of their contributions.When it comes to its principles, everybody rights is equally protected... It's consensus mechanism(Proof of Work) is fair and just.",
