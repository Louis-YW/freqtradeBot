The project operates on a community-driven basis,So it thrives on shill marketing it can only reach $1 if people shill this token, no technological value that it's bringing for the benefit of the community, its a waste of money investing in his meme coin.",

Do your analysis and drop it here or you are just promoting the coin because you are being paid or should I say maybe you are even the owner of the coin and you are  the owner of the coin and you are trying to promote your project, because you can’t just come here and recommend a coin to everyone to buy, a new shit coin for that matter.I don’t trust any shit coin I will rather invest in bitcoin and incase if I want to invest in altcoin, I will rather leave just small amount in strong altcoin, I mean altcoins that have been in existence for long period of time, and I don’t also trust them so I leave just little amount in them, most of my investments is in bitcoin.",

Keep in mind that it is memetoken we are talking about and there's no utility of it; meaning, demand will only be created by shared interest and if that thing is missing, huge investors' manipulation is the only way possible for its market value to blow up jist like last time. I personally never heard of this token before which for me is doubting. But if you could afford losing an amount to somehow 'bet' on it then you are free to do so. Who knows? Maybe it become a huge thing as well on its release. Better lose trying than to do not try at all if it really caught your interest.",

I don't believe that there will be achievements like what op said because others are still not able to do that.Will there be any surprises in the future?
