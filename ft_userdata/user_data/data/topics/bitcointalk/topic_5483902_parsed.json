Not sure if that's their worth of Bitcoin though...but It can't be over 11,439 BTC worth.But the main question to answer here would be if they can influence bitcoin market. I'd say, being the largest asset manager, they should have a small chance of doing that. And that chance would be the capacity to attract other investors and have a good impact on the legitimacy and adoption of Bitcoin as they specialize in alternative investments.",

But we expect they to have this heavy influence only on short run, because once they manipulate the market once, they are going to lose the resources to do it again in the future, unless they purchase the coins again when the price hits the bottom.That is why average independent investors should take advantage of such manipulative events to buy Bitcoin cheaper and take the coins from the hands of the whales of this industry, so their power decreases as Bitcoin becomes splitted among more different investors' hands, decreasing the potential of future manipulations happening in crypto market, at least in big proportion.About Black Rock, only now people are starting to talk about it more frequently. They not only own huge sums of BTC, but also large positions in titan global companies like Google, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Disney.",

It's said they control more than 50% of the world money but in reality, they are just fund manager that manages the users fund according to their choice for a small commission. They just make it easier for it's users to buy and sell. Black Rock had been the leading force in listing Bitcoin and ETH ETF as it were demanded by the users. The group may have a number of bitcoins but most of those in stat are users money and the Black Rock group itself have no full authority over it.",

No, Blackrock might hold tiny piece of that but I'm not sure if Blackrock owns these Bitcoin, they are just like centralized exchanges that hold people Bitcoin where they allowed you trade numbers and when it's time to withdraw, they sent you real Bitcoin to a destination wallet.Blackrock is similar in the sense that in every Bitcoin ETF investors buy from them, they have equivalent Bitcoin as reserve and this is the reserve that has been updated everyday, for every Bitcoin ETF sold, there is an equivalent Bitcoin that is peg to them.Influence, I'm not sure about that for now. The ETF approval has been done and Bitcoin has reacted from their price already and it's making Bitcoin centralized even more moving away from the central purpose but adoption, they are making Bitcoin name to go places.",

Why not GBTC? This actually proves that BlackRock and others (excluding GBTC) did not want to manipulate prices and were genuinely worried about low liquidity on bitcoin exchanges. They knew if they started buying it would pump the price, but GBTC did not care and decided to dump everything to Coinbase. I don't know how they benefited but I can think of ways they could, for instance by telling a few trusted individuals to place levered short positions on Bitcoin, since the market obviously did not expect they'd sell so much Bitcoin in 1 week.",

It might be the case ETF issuers won't be able to user customer funds to heavily influence the market in their favor. Their primary revenue for such service would be from their fee. Still, the possibility is there even if the chance of happening is slim.Also, the reason why those sell-offs affected the market was because customers were not able to sell GBTC for a long time but finally got the opportunity to sell when Bitcoin ETFs were approved. I don't think such big events would happen anytime soon.",

They actually did their due diligent research about Bitcoin and its potential to help them gaining more income for their company.Now, they succeeded with their Bitcoin Spot ETF application and are going to be a biggest Bitcoin institutional investor. With their accumulation rate, they will surpass MicroStrategy in coming months. If we see how MicroStrategy gained profit with their DCA investment in Bitcoin, for their portfolio in Bitcoin and their stock MSTR [1], we will see how BlackRock will get profit from their Bitcoin Spot ETF product.They will even submit for more derivatives after Bitcoin Spot ETF.[1] https://saylortracker.com/",
