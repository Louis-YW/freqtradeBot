I mean, no developed or developing  countries would want to be left behind in this new transition that the Global economy is gonna experience through the enactment of laws that will support Bitcoin and it's possible adoption by the incoming government of Donald Trump. We are yet to hear more positive news about proposals for Bitcoin's strategic reserve either before the inauguration date or after.",

This is certainly positive news, because if this bill is passed, it means that Bitcoin is starting to be recognized by more people and strengthens its position. And directly it will increase the adoption of Bitcoin in the future.",

Now looking at some points given by Wu jie in his assertion of considering using bitcoin as their country strategies fiscal reserve such as lower storage and transaction cost present some reasonable advantage of Bitcoin over some traditional reserve and for these reasons I believe that many people and some countries in the world will be convince to consider the possibility of using Bitcoin as their external reserve in the the future and if this is actualize it's very certain that what we are seeing now as a bull run direction of Bitcoin may be a step to what the value of Bitcoin will be in the future.",

I'm waiting to see how Trump will convince Congress to change the law so the Fed can add bitcoin to the US reserves. If the United States succeeds in including bitcoin in its national reserves, other countries will surely follow suit as the United States is the world leader and is considered to be the trendsetter. But the question of what the Trump administration will do to make that happen is what we need to worry about first. The Federal Reserve is the custodian of the nation's reserves and only Congress can make them change their mind, the president has no authority to make a decision on this matter on his own.",

It’s not like they’d put all their funds into Bitcoin but just a portion, treating it as an investment. They’d likely only allocate what they can afford to lose, similar to how individual investors approach it.As for El Salvador, the criticism is pretty normal, especially since it’s tied to politics, but now their decision seems to be paying off, as their Bitcoin accumulation is profitable at the current prices.",
