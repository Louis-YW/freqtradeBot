But it's not possible to steal Satoshi's glory! PayPal may be trying to implement Bitcoin payment on the platform as against what it is right now,  but this statement still sounds sarcastic to me PayPal with all its restrictions to countries want to make Bitcoin a global payment network,  because in my region right now PayPal is not operational but I can still do all the payment using the bitcoin network so I wonder what I will be needing a third-party centralized payment system like PayPal. The statement is from an ex-CEO who may be making an outdated statement since he may no longer be involved in the ruining of PayPal,  but in general, I don't see any positivity in this and should not make any news.",

It is a must situation to move along with the need than just trying to matchup with the traditional system.Earlier Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal have said in an interview that if they had known blockchain technology earlier they could've used it. In such case bitcoin could've gained importance as payment source, however things hadn't favoured. So, there are more positive thoughts on bitcoin and it's backing technology.",

So that they would remain in the competition for a while. Haha, that's really so hilarious. And many short-minded people (by short-minded I mean those who have little or no knowledge of BTC) must have fallen for this shit. Because for them these suited and booted people are real people and to them our talks and discussions are nothing. Well, at least people will adopt BTC using this excuse. PayPal is playing the same game that ETFs are trying to play here. The game of manipulation. hehe. I don't think they can really steal Satoshi's glory because PayPal is Centralized and Satoshi's glory is decentralized. Case close.",

He needs to chill lol. Bitcoin is in its own lane and it's already one thing to pull it into the paypal which arguably didn't really sit well with both avid paypal users as well as bitcoin users since they don't really employ the blockchain technology in the equation but instead is offering what could only be described as \"a stablecoin pegged to bitcoin\", saying useless stuff like this isn't going to push people back to their sides lol.",

Bitcoin was created to become the decentralized payments system and it is working fine that way till now. now they are trying to provide service for it and telling the world we are going to make it a global payment system. Look we are doing you a favor. This is kind of funny you know.If we keep the criticism apart and consider PayPal's influence in action then I can say they can make Bitcoin transactions more user-friendly for their users. This will provide a convenient way for their users but this will not benefit the decentralization of bitcoin.",

Trying to convince the world or their customers that they have a separate technique for making Bitcoin a better payment option than it already is If they are trying to make bitcoin a globally accepted payment option, why do they make a huge move by getting their own stable coin (PYUSS), for which I believed they would have to put more focus on promoting its use to the highest possible level? Why not try to channel that energy into Bitcoin and see how they can promote its use on the global market if that's what they are really trying to do? What I see here is them trying to attract more customers to their platform using this convincing strategy and speech so that those who believe in the bitcoin dream can join their ship, but that will really be a collapsing ship, by the way, as what they might end up doing or coming up with is an altcoin maybe to support their dream, which they could also suggest is the best alternative as it could be considered faster and has a cheaper fee rate. All I could see in this is a business looking for a new way to stand out above their competitors.",

Not possible I believe..They can not steal the Satoshi's product because Satoshi had made his product open source and decentralized but PayPal is totally the opposite. I just read a post about Vitalik's Twitter handle which caused a huge loss when people connected their wallets to that fake link. These centralized authorities and platforms have always blamed others and tried to save themselves. Still, PayPal will use the BTC blockchain technology and build its umpire on those who have not adopted the BTC yet but once they see it coming in PayPal they will definitely try to think for a second about BTC and try to adopt BTC and its derivatives. They are fooling those who are traditional or I should say old financial people who still fall behind in the race of adoption of new technology. Why because they fear the new technology's volatility and existence. I think they are just trying to make some good image of PayPal in front of people because they also have to rope onto something if they want to remain in the competition I think they might fear the existence of a BTC payment system that has the potential to replace them and it do have replaced it. But people who did not adopted BTC yet are the old ones.",

Bitcoin is already a globally recognized payment system that would have achieved more global adoption if not for some unpleasant policies by the government. Marcus was simply advertising his company Lightspark that deals on lightning network. It is a subtle strategy to introduce people to his lightning network services.",

They forgot the fact that Bitcoin is available to everyone because Satoshi made Bitcoin for everyone and no country or any institution can control Bitcoin in anyway. Everyone in the world can trade with Bitcoin and everyone can purchase and accumulate Bitcoin and that's enough to confirm that Bitcoin is in fact a global network since its beginning and it will remain as a global network forever.",

It may be possible that the former president downplays the importance of Bitcoin for the purpose of promoting his own products. Bitcoin is a proven technology and it has a million of users around the world so it is inappropriate to say this as it is already a global payment technology.

I am not surprised one bit; the power tussle between the East and the West leaves a lot of uncertainties with fiat and centralized payment systems. This might give a kind of clue to the recent huge buys of Bitcoin... who knows if such buy came from institution like Paypal (just my opinion though). The future is truly looking so bright for Bitcoin and those of us who are already in should endeavor to maximize the opportunities that Bitcoin offers.",

      "body": "David Marcus, the former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightning Network’s Lightspark, recently shared his vision for Bitcoin on CNBC’s Squawk Box. He aims to transform Bitcoin into a global payment network. This vision goes beyond Bitcoin’s current status as a digital store of value, and charts a course to redefine the financial ecosystem on a global scale.Marcus believes that Bitcoin’s potential remains largely untapped, with opportunities for it to assume a more expansive and pivotal role in the world of finance. He emphasized the urgency of Bitcoin’s evolution, focusing on delivering faster, more economical, and exceptionally efficient transactions.Your analogy of “trying to make water wet” suggests that you believe Bitcoin already functions as a global payment system. Indeed, Bitcoin is already used for transactions worldwide. However, Marcus’ statement likely refers to enhancing the efficiency, speed, and accessibility of these transactions.As for your question about “stealing Satoshi’s glory”, it seems Marcus’ intention is not to take credit for Bitcoin but rather to contribute to its evolution and increase its utility as a global payment network.https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/09/11/former-paypal-president-david-marcus-sets-sights-on-transforming-bitcoin-into-a-worldwide-payment-networkhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/former-paypal-president-david-marcus-aims-to-turn-bitcoin-into-a-global-payment-network",
