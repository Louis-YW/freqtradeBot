It is possible that people may send Bitcoin to an address which haven't yet created for example. Well, anyone can send Bitcoin to any address (considering correct format). What if the address hasn't been generated yet? Is it possible that in future someone will be able to generate that address (not vanity address of course, so no intentional attempt I mean)? If the funded address has been generated by someone coincidentally/unintentionally, will there be Bitcoins? How lucky would they be if they find Bitcoins out of nowhere lol!",

I think this where the issue of validity comes into place. If we check there is checksums in all addresses created to check the validity of the address, so a wrongly typed address will definitely not have PKH because the private key isn’t generated yet. So the checksum won’t tell you maybe the address is correct, but will tell it’s validity. And according to learn me a bitcoin the probability of getting this, is around 4 billion.",

The only coins which are truly lost forever are ones which are provably burned and cannot be spent by any means, such as those in OP_RETURN outputs or those behind invalid locking scripts. Coins sent to address with unknown private keys could still be recovered in the future with sufficient advances in computing, especially if the address was generated from a known public key, such as 15wJjXvfQzo3SXqoWGbWZmNYND1Si4siqV which was generated from the public key 020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.Quote from: Zaguru12 on July 22, 2023, 01:56:07 PMAnd according to learn me a bitcoin the probability of getting this, is around 4 billion.For legacy addresses.

How lucky would they be if they find Bitcoins out of nowhere lol!That \"luck\" also applies to our own bitcoins...You see, an address isn't reserved for a private key, the ownership isn't solely established by first one to generate the address.For example, your p2pkh address is based from HASH160 of your public key which is 160bit in size while private keys are 256bit in size which is a lot more.So technically, someone else's different private key could produce the same hash which means that he can spend your funds...but as you can see, no one is lucky enough to find a collision.Not to mention, generate the same private key from luck.",

If I were you, I wouldn't worry that one day someone will discover the private keys of this specific address because chances that one randomly generates this particular address is almost non-existence and so non-existence is the chance of someone successfully brute-forcing that address.",
