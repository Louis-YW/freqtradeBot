This reminds me of the 2018 bear market when harmony, Matic, and a few others find their way to the binance launchpad, almost all projects from the binance launchpad became so big, I am not saying this will be the same, I expect everyone to do their research. I feel like participating in this launchpad but the fear of this present market condition won't let meðŸ˜†, holding BNB for the next seven days is a risk.",

      "body": "Just to remind those who may have an interest in this token. I saw the Binance Launchpad HOOK announcement is getting used as a scam material. Refer to this thread: [SCAM ALERT] Fake Binance Launchpad token listed on Pancakeswap. It is quite a pretty method noting some of the token investors might have a FOMO about this particular token in regard to the news, so, there is a scammer who tries to get benefit from this.I don't know if there is another similar approach to this scam or if the method itself is already being used in the space, but just be wary, and make sure you get information from official sources.",

      "body": "It seems like that binance was starting its launch pad again after it has been in the silent mode for a few times due to the crypto market condition. Thank you for this news and i have been registered myself to get a spot but i didn't expect to get a big portion from there. Waiting for this to did another airdrop for its users. I've been participating in the minting NFT for its community and i hope there will be a good news like it was launched through binance launch pad as well. Hopefully the trend for new project to be launched through launch pad will come again soon",

      "body": "It seems Binance Launchpad are back in action. Its been how many months since they did one and probably this will made a huge pump for bnb as people are looking for some big token sale and we all knew that Binance never did a poor project. For sure there will be many follow ups on this. But thinking about it. Maybe a recovery on market can be assume soon as usually Binance launching projects when the market started to go back on track.",
