You can use this as a valuable reference for investment.https://heartbitintro.oopy.io/As you know Bitcoin price shows that it follows a cyclic pattern so comparing it with the NASDAQ or some other stock is not good because of its own price history you can easily compare its current pattern to the previous one. Investors look to the previous history of bitcoin movements and then they predict the future price of it. Comparing it to the stock or other assets it's not familiar Besides this you can compare its current patterns to the previous one as bitcoin has a log price history. But one thing to be noted is that if someone predicts the future price of Bitcoin it does not mean that it will occur or follow the previous pattern 100%, bitcoin is volatile and its price can change from time to time so be careful when you are going to buy or do investment in it.",

You can use this as a valuable reference for investment.https://heartbitintro.oopy.io/Comparing bitcoin to some other stocks is doable, but I don't think it can be considered a good reason why someone should invest. I tend to expect someone to study bitcoin, how it works, as well as its the innovation before investing instead of comparing it to stocks, that seems reasonable. Stocks and bitcoin are of course different, so I think the behavior of investors and traders towards both assets will also be different.Even though you see similarities in the short-term price movements of these two investment assets, Bitcoin should be different. There is no definite way to determine how it will move, but investment decisions on bitcoin should not depend on price movements of other assets including physical assets or stocks.",

I may predict that we may likely see a drop in stocks because more investors would be drawn into investing in bitcoin through the ETFs and less of their focus would be on stocks. Cant really totally tell for being the reason on why stocks are dropping just because of market switch up? Possible but not something that precise that we could really tell but pretty sure that there would be investors or tothose people who had able to see on how this crypto market is really that profitable for them instead but somewhat it is really that more risky compared into those traditional markets that we do know. Its true that there's no really sense on trying out to compare charts with Bitcoin and some stocks because it wasnt really that correlated in the first place and this is why its really that safe to say that there's no correlation to that and as an investor then it would be better on making out some analysis which it doesnt really connect out Bitcoin into those fields. Just simply look at on the history of Bitcoin when it comes into its price progress and recognitionthen you would be able to simply tell that adoption and demand is really that increasing year by years passing. The current price movements are those actual market behavior which we do able to encounter even if you do find yourself dealing with those traditional markets then these kind of moments or conditions are normal.",

Is this the basis of crypto trend? As far as I know with the history of the price stocks doesn’t affect the price of Bitcoin that much and it has its own trend and cycle. Better not to complicate things and just try to compare the price history of Bitcoin alone to its current value, this is more better for me.",

Stocks and bitcoin are of course different, so I think the behavior of investors and traders towards both assets will also be different.Exactly, my point, just as if you said what's in my mind, is that comparing bitcoin to another stock is not something we should do because how bitcoin's market moves is not the same as other stocks, and for someone to come and say this is how it will go today, tomorrow, next month, or next year, I think that person is just predicting, which may not be like that; we just get to know this based on the movement of how it’s been going since the existence of the currency, and that’s why we said 2024/2025 will be the next bitcoin halving. However, bitcoin should not just be something someone will come and invest in at once; we need to study it well as well as how the market works, when to sell, and when to buy, because these are what affect some investors and make them panic when they see the market start declining. But knowing this and how it works, I believe they will know that is not a problem and that they will definitely get their money back with profit by leaving their coins there for a long time.",

However, there is nothing new here because scenarios like this happen in the market but seldom. I used to spot charts with such similarities when trading, infant the previous month there was a scenario where I was looking for an entry opportunity to take my position in the market and I spotted a chart that looked the same, I did a crazy thing and took a risk of the trade, and mirrored the chart until the end, and I must admit that the risk worth it.

If fact the comparison is not visible because bitcoin has a history of really increasing very high every 4years and stock doesn't have such pedigree and that is already a difference which makes it not comparable. The stock investors might be cashing out to do a quick DCA on bitcoin to have some fast profit with bitcoin bull, so no basis for comparison as they are different commodities and doesn't have same parameter for comparison, unlike silver to gold which have the same characteristics.",
