  "content": "HIWith previous versions of Bitpay Apps, when I needed to generate an wallet address to \"receive\" a transaction. Now in the latest bitpay version I doNOT that option in the \"receive\" section. It generates an address then there is a QR code.Â  I would like to send the newly generated wallet address to myemail as I did before. I touched the generated wallet address and a statement appeared that read \"copied to clip tray\" where can I locate the clip tray, andis there another way I could transfer the generated addresses outside of the app???Â  I hope to hear from you reasonably soon!!!",

      "body": "Odd, I am on the latest version and it is using the standard copy / paste. There is the copy icon next to the address when you click it, it becomes a check-mark and then I can paste it into my email. Either Outlook or the GMail client works. This is on Android, can't comment on the iPhone version.Works on both my phone and my Tablet. -Dave",

      "body": "It depends on the device you are using. Every device has a different way to save copied content. For example, I am using Samsung and there is Clipboard where a lot of copied content is stored. I can paste it anywhere from there. Check on your keyboard, the Clipboard ðŸ“‹ should be around there. It's not the problem of the wallet. It should work direct paste as well.",
