The worst situation any nation should find them selves is falling into the arms of wrong and unproductive leadership. With bad leadership comes economic crisis, excessive and unaccountable taxation, static growth, low GDP, poor return on investments and the most killing factor is high inflation rate which uncontrollably result in high cost of living.Insecurity could be caused by internal or external factors. Internally insecurity can be caused by poor economic conditions and political agitations. When there is high rate of unemployment and bad economic conditions, many people will turn to crime to survive the economic hardships.External forces such as other countries could decide to destabilize the political or economic sector of a nation because of some reasons. Some powerful nations can instigate political crisis in a country because they want to sell arms and ammunition or take the market share of a country. Some insecurity can be caused by the ripple effect of war in neighboring countries. The war in Libya have caused so much insecurity in some African countries.Political agitations such as the rise of sucessionist groups like we see in Ethiopia, Cameroon and Nigeria are offshoots of the failure of government to uphold the fundamental human rights of citizens, tribalism and lack of respect for rule of law. This has made some tribes or regions in some of these countries to seek greater autonomy and even independence.QuoteInsecurity is highly transmitted in countries where government policies, decisions and tussle gets so tough and where the populace are left with no option but to seek a means of survival.

And legal actions taken against the lesser citizens.Poor economic conditions should not be an excuse to engage in criminal activities. The people that suffer from these criminal activities are not the corrupt government officials but the poor masses. We must not embrace crime because the government is bad. Citizens must seek for alternative legal means to survive. And we must engage in activities like constructive criticism and peaceful protest to oppose bad governance. If you also have the means or opportunity, you can seek greener pastures in other countries that are friendly to immigrants.",
