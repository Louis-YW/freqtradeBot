Banks are given license to provide crypto services to customers in some countries.Now, bitcoin spot ETF will later be approved by United States SEC. Approved already in some countries.Just like your fiat in bank that you do not have full control of, bitcoin can exist like that. Although not recommended. Is that a disadvantage? No. I can still see bitcoin to be the superior. Yes, the recommendation is, backup your seed phrase (+ passphrase if included). Many people lost their seed phrase or private key backup in the past because they thought bitcoin price would never increased like this. The price increased and they were looking for a way to access their coins when it has been too late when peanut money become huge amount of money.",

They aren't!Many people are just ignorant about how banks operate, or are simply lazy and careless when it comes to safeguarding their finances.They would rather push the responsibility to someone else or a third party, and you call that safe? Hell No.One of the main points of Bitcoin is for you to become your own bank, have a complete control over your funds and by this it's also your responsibility to safeguard those funds, just like how you would keep your fiat cash in your wallet or pocket.",

We can't complain to anyone if that happens. The banking system will provide compensation if our account is hacked by someone or reset the password if we lose the ATM password. But that's the difference between decentralization and centralization, in a decentralized system no one can freeze our assets but in banking they can freeze our accounts.With bitcoin, we ourselves hold, maintain and manage our assets without anyone being able to intervene as long as the bitcoin is in our wallet. Different from banks, they are the ones who have full access to our money. So, bitcoin is freedom and liberty, it is more expensive than anything else",

As someone who has continously lost money held in centralized orgs like banks, money market firms, etc, I've not had such experience with Bitcoin since I got involved with Bitcoin and this community. If anyone says otherwise, it is the case that they didn't take all the precautionary steps to safeguard their asset.I actually thought the concern with this thread would be that there is no straightforward way to do on/off ramp for Bitcoin in most countries and there's only small number of support of businesses that has integrated Bitcoin for buying and selling of goods and services OR the fact that Bitcoin fees might not be favorable to the wider population especially in 3rd world countries.",

Bitcoin gives you full control, helping you proactively use your assets without the help of any third party. So the safety of your property depends entirely on you. If in case you lose access to your wallet, it is your fault, not bitcoin's. As for the bank, even if it's not your fault, your assets can still be confiscated or frozen for no reason. Choosing bitcoin or a bank is up to you. If you don't trust yourself but trust others, you should choose a bank.",

I'd even make the whole situation bitter and drive the fact that unlike traditional banking, if you get hacked or scammed in crypto you're pretty much bound to destination fucked. You're not getting your money back and your wallet's at risk of getting attacked in the future. The lack of a central government controlling and regulating the intake and outpour of transactions in the bitcoin network is a double-edged sword per se. It's just that at the advent of a more privacy-particular crowd, everyone would highlight the fact that crypto's decentralized and secure over the fact that it practically leaves you for dead when you get forked over by someone from the other side of the planet.",

So it will be the same on Bitcoin, but I wouldn't say it's a disadvantage, it's more on you should learn how to protect your own assets because who wouldn't, that is yours and obviously no one should take it away from you. But if you didn't take security very seriously, then it's your downfall.We have a lot of methods already on how to keep Bitcoin safe, and it's also all over the forum. It's just a matter on whether you will execute them, I mean if you have like 1 BTC in your wallet, then you should also increased your awareness on how to protect it and also be private and not tell anyone about how much you have. There are also criminals in real world that are targeting Bitcoin holders.",

But I would say volatility is the #1 reason why Bitcoin fails to achieve wide adoption as a payment method, people don't want to hold a currency that can lose its value suddenly. It's similar for a store of value use - people don't want to invest in something that is not guaranteed to grow.",
