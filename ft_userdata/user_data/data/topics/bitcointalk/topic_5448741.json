If someone thinks BTC is a failed project, then it is not only when there is a bull run or the price starts to pump that they can be proven incorrect, the utility of BTC and ability to spend it proves them to be incorrect on a daily basis.Quote from: JamesBorn on April 13, 2023, 10:33:56 PMWe are expecting the bullish price to pump 60k straight up even against all odds.  I do not expect to see 60k per BTC anytime soon, i think this kind of price and more will be possible after the next halving.Quote from: JamesBorn on April 13, 2023, 10:33:56 PMIf my plans works out am ready to buy more and store!

Dca is the best way to buy, and i think you should use it, so it won't matter if the pump happens soon or later on.",

While I do believe that Bitcoin has the potential to do very well, I think that we should be careful not to get too carried away with our expectations. The market is always unpredictable, and there are no guarantees when it comes to investments. Do not get me wrong, I think that Bitcoin is a solid investment, and I am excited to see where it goes in the future. However, I also think that we should be mindful of the risks involved and not put all of our eggs in just one basket. As for me, I am more focused on long-term investments and building a solid portfolio.",

Â The increase in price is natural and is due to the demand of people. Â We might be seeing an uptrend in price due to the positive and bullish sentiment of the market but I don't see $60k Â in the coming weeks or this month. Â The stated price is possible probably after the halving when Bitcoin starts its uptrend and rally of breaking and recording series of Bitcoin ATH.Quote from: JamesBorn on April 13, 2023, 10:33:56 PMIf my plans works out am ready to buy more and store!

Â But I don't think that the pump toward $60k will happen soon. Â It might take sometime since Bitcoin has to get over $40k and $50k and $59k which is somehow a bit too high at the current market price and the effect of market sentiment.",

Because if bitcoin is not pumped now, it will surely be pumped in the future. As long as we hold on patiently, it's only a matter of time before bitcoin rises.

It started in April and ended in June or July. Basically tripped in price in a short order.If we get something similar and end up at $50K next month then most likely itâ€™s a repeat of 2019 and best to scale out. Seems like it might be an echo bubble which many are predicting. Same with stocks. They are also rallying like crazy but the world is still in trouble.",

Bitcoin has always dumped and pumped and that's how it'll be trading. I think your prediction of $60k is too positive and that might not happen this year, maybe during the halving year or one year after that, we can reach the $60k price but not this year and to achieve that price, we'll have some months Bitcoin will dump and not a straight forward pump to $60k.",

We are clear that bitcoin is moving quite slowly at the moment.I have no plans to buy bitcoins all at once as this is a bit difficult for myself and the finances while for DCA it is much better I will continue to do it before the real pump occurs and this should be my estimate of being above $70K and going up so on.With the market returning to green, it indicates the market is healthy.Quote from: philipma1957 on April 14, 2023, 02:18:31 AMI would sell everything if we go to 100k in mayI'm ready to hit the SELL button",

We were at 16k a while ago and now at 30k, which is a long distance without a clear correction.It is true that we can see prices such as 40k and even close to 50k dollars at best, but 60k seems very ambitious.There are indicators that you should follow, such as:US Consumer Price Index (CPI): It did not give a strong reaction, and thus the correction is near.Rejection to break the next level: Rejection could lead the price of 32K to return to test the critical support level at 26k.The next trend is bearish in the short term.",

This can be simply demonstrated at any particular exchange, as there will be more buy orders then sell orders. So yes buy as many coins as you can in this pre pumping era, hold it for few months and sell in great price later on. This should be the planning for all the crypto holders.",
