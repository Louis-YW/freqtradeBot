  "content": "Would you bet on a fight that is scripted even with the promise that the outcome will not be leaked to the public before the match ends? What is the ethical consideration is this case? Well this is the new information regarding the WWE about to explore this new type of betting option. You can read a part of the news quoted below and make your comments.QuoteWWE Keen to Explore Betting on Scripted Fights as an OptionBut if the states were to clear this type of betting, that would only raise integrity concerns observers believe, as the outcomes of fights would be known and the possibility of a leak – high. WWE is reportedly working with Ernst & Young, an accountancy firm, to prove that the results of such fights would not be known to the public beforehand nor that they would leak out of the organizaiton.Ernst & Young has previously advocated for the legalization of Academy Awards betting, and worked to keep the results a secret, proving that it’s possible to know an outcome beforehand and still have a fair betting market on the activity. WWE is of a similar mind, as the Oscars are already supported as betting markets in some places in the country, so why would sportsbooks hesitate to offer WWE fights, which are a form of entertainment for the most part rather than a pure athletic contest?No official comment has been made by WWE officials to further elaborate on the situation, but Colorado has already denied the rumors. The Colorado Division of Gaming spoke to CNBC and briefly said that it had no intention of allowing betting on WWE matches as of right now. Legalizing WWE fights as viable betting events is not a stretch, however.https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/wwe-wants-to-launch-gambling-on-scripted-fights-in-colorado-michigan/",

For the real life matches in sport, we have so many options that we can just go for instead of the wrestling that is only meant for entertainment, not for betting for me when I have real life ones that can even take away my whole day if I want it to be like that.",

It has a possibility that it can be fixed, meaning it depends on the director and who he wants to win a fight. Let's just say that it is really in favor for person A to win because he is very powerful, and for sure people will bet on person A, but it ends up losing as person B won the fight, meaning they amass a lot of money on that. Also, how do they take care of their personnel, like if they know the script and they bet secretly on their homes on the wrestler that will win based on the script? I won't be betting on this kind of event.",

Therefore if that is introduced into gambling and it finds it way, people will bet on it  So whether the allusion of being scripted or not, people will bet on it. After all wrestling will not be the only scripted option for gambling betting. For example there is visual soccer which is also scripted and many gamblers like and see it as favourable betting option. I think the point is people choose to bet on what they get lucky and favoured on into profit, nobody would like losing his bet.",

Perhaps those enrolled in the WWE are there because cannot do the same in the UFC or in other championships for whatever reason. If that is what happens, then It would be sense they would rather to partake in the WWE in scripted fights rather than not partaking in anything at all. If someone can confirm or deny my assumptions, it would be appreciated.",

After all, I don’t see wrestling games are certainly real even before, so it’s not really an issue for me.
