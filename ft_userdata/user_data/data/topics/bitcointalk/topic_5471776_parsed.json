The site is pretty new it seems most of the newbies nowadays directly post newly created sites(obviously to get link here) which makes me think that they own the site.So do you own this exchange?",

      "body": "Whether it's a scam or not, does it matter? It's pretty much unknown. There's no record of it on either Coingecko or Coinmarketcap. And since you've also done a little research on it and found no information even on Twitter or Facebook, what reason is left then for you to further inquire about it? Wherever you found it doesn't matter. I wonder what made you curious about this unheard-of exchange. Do they offer something enticing? I think the rule of thumb when it comes to security is to avoid anything which you cannot verify.",

If you see this one on YouTube, it is just a scam video. And they will likely comes with big offers to attract you so that you can pay to an address on the exchange which is a tactic scammers use to scam people. If you want to know if an exchange is legit or not, first start by checking it on Coingecko or Coinmarketcap. If seen there, then you further your research, like ask about it on this forum if the trust score is low. But asking on this forum as it is not see on those sites is also very good, you are welcome and you can always ask such a question.",
