The representative of Azerbaijan, Yashar Aliyev, in his speech denied the false accusations that Azerbaijan created a humanitarian blockade of the Armenian population of Karabakh. The Armenian ploy she used to try to solve the political problems of the Karabakh conflict was well understood by the members of the Security Council, which was reflected in his decision to deny Armenia its intention to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning Azerbaijan. It should be noted that the support of France, following the lead of the politically strong and large Armenian diaspora, and therefore traditionally hostile to Turkey and Azerbaijan, could not change anything. The representative of Russia clearly stated that the issues of integration of the Armenians of Karabakh, including the humanitarian one, should be resolved between the population of Karabakh and the government of Azerbaijan, thereby making it clear that Yerevan has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, on the simple basis that Karabakh is the territory of Azerbaijan, which, by the way, was recognized by Armenia itself.By appealing to the UN Security Council, Armenia once again demonstrated its ingratitude to Russia, which created a state for it on the lands of Azerbaijan and which refused Armenia to help create another Armenian state of Artsakh inside Azerbaijan, which actually looks like this. The hope of Yerevan to find a new patron who would rush to build them Great Armenia from sea to sea is failing so far. In fact, it is better for Armenians to hold an independence referendum in California, today there are more than 1.5 million Armenians living in America, which is much more compared to 120,000 in Karabakh.Armenians, like gypsies, live in many countries, but there is one very significant difference between them, the gypsies do not claim to be states, and the Armenians create permanent compact centers of residence, build their churches, create communities, while spreading the opinion of their superiority over the indigenous people, which can turn into a situation that took place in Azerbaijan. You can accuse me of bias and even of nationalism, but well-known authorities also paid attention to some feature of the Armenian character.Ilya Chavchavadze, a Georgian poet and publicist of the 19th century, wrote about Armenians and their mentality: “Armenians “settle where they have never lived. Is it not clear that with this superficial scholarship they want to convince the world that they have the historical right to occupy these places ... \"The opinion of Vasily Grosman echoes Chavchavadze: “With insidious ease, the nationalism of the people loses its noble foundation, it does not become formidable, it becomes pitiful, does not cause, but humiliates. So trying to prove some kind of inferiority, a person discovers his own. Some of my interlocutors in all areas of human creativity, first of all, emphasized the Armenian national priority in architecture, science, and poetry. They emphasized the superiority of the architectural merits of the temple in Garni over the primitive architecture of the Acropolis that seemed to them: speaking of the poet Tumanyan, they persistently convinced me that the genius of Tumanyan was higher than the genius of Pushkin. The point, of course, is not that the architecture of Garni is not more perfect than the architecture of the Acropolis, is Tumanyan more brilliant than Pushkin, the essence, and the essence of course is sad, is that poetry, and architecture, and science, and history in itself, according to their essence in the conversations of some of my interlocutors cease to mean. They only mean to reveal the superiority of the Armenian national character over the national character of other peoples. It is not poetry that is important, but it is only important to prove that the Armenian national poet is higher than, say, a Russian or French poet. My interlocutors, without noticing it themselves, impoverished their souls and hearts by ceasing to rejoice in poetry, the perfection of architecture, the greatness of science, and saw in poetry and science only a means to assert their national superiority. This desire can be so fanatical, narrow, that for a moment it seems like a manifestation of madness.”In more detail, my opinion about the Armenian people from a historical point of view is set out in previously written articles, a list of some of them:1.
