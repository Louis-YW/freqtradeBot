At some point the entire Block space would always be filled up and some amount would be new miners and others would be regular transactions. You can create your transactions now while it is early and you can use them forever. They will never go away unless you spend them. Smart to take that real estate right now while it is easy.",

The mining pool cannot sign the block after it has been found, the user that owns the transaction is the only one with the key. Plus, the only way to mine is to use user transactions. It is highly inefficient for users to send all their txs to a centralized pool and have the centralized pool send them out in batches.The transactions are the potential hash power that the CPU can operate on. You want your CPU to be busy as possible doing PoW on the transactions to find a block. This is the key to the algorithm and prevents mining pools from operating with this coin.",

I gave my address on TG hours ago, and reveice anything thanksPools will not be able to mine this coin.This algo is a combination of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Transactions (PoT). A wallet generates many transactions. It is these user's transactions that are used for the PoW to solve the equation and mine a block. Once the miner finds one of the transaction hashes that solves the PoW equation:hash(previous_stake_hash + others) < bnTargetThe winning transaction gets the block reward and it will be spendable in 3 blocks. You need at least 1 satoshi to generate a transaction, then you can mine. In reality, you want to generate 10,000 transactions per wallet (or more) so the CPU has much more work to keep busy trying to solve the above simplified equation. This is why we are sending out 0.1 BTCW, it gives enough to start mining well.If you did not get coin on Telegram, please ask again. Sorry, it has been very busy on the BTCW chat.",

Mining starts with as little as 1 satoshi. The more txs you have, the more work the CPU can do.Your math is off. Sending 0.00001 with a fee of 0.00001225 can get you almost 5000 transactions to mine.

Could it be that the mining conditions are too difficult?    There are at least 400 wallets mining BTCW. Competition is growing. Each block has around 4000 transactions. Your 3000 is a small fraction against the community. Don't forget, it is NOT txs that make the hash rate, it are the CPUs iterating thru the txs that give the hash power. You can consider transactions to be 'FUEL' and the CPU needs 'FUEL' to do its PoW. The more CPUs running 'FUEL', the more hash power you have. Each CPU can only handle so much 'FUEL'. So at some point you need to use more CPUs. This is 99.9999% PoW coin with a small amount of PoS that makes this coin impossible to be centralized with a mining pool.Come learn how to mine BTCW on Telegram:https://t.me/BitcoinPoWPoT",
