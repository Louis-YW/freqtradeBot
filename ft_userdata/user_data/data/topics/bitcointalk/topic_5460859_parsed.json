  "content": "Over some time now, I haven't been active on the local board for some obvious and personal reasons and I also think it will be wise to seek the opinions of others as to what they think about a convention.~ Well I know and also understand that, this very discussion and thread might not go well with everyone for some several  reasons especially  with regards to the fact that bitcoin and cryptocurrency isn't generally accepted in the country and as such, not everyone will be willing  to identify with it openly.~ I also want to firstly say that, I respect  everyone's opinion but how about we see things in an entirely different  perspective, and judging from my personal observations, Nigerian also falls in the list of active users on the forum and contributing positively  to the bitcointalk community. ~ from my personal observations,  it also shows that we also have higher rates of users battling with merits and quality post as well as ranking  up.~ From my personal observations, I've also realized  that we have alot of highly ranked members who haven't identified  with the local community for some reasons best known to them.~ From my personal observations, it seems the board also suffers lack of merit give aways as it seems we have just one merit source with very low smerit allocation.~ It is obvious  that we all found our ways to the forum through several means and there are people here who came into the forum as a total stranger without any mentorship whatsoever and battling with growth and how to get familiar with the forum.~ These and many more to come later are few observations I've made that has prompted my call for a convention to discuss some of the challenges and the way forward as well as get to meet ourselves in real as there are alot to achieve together beyond the forum.~ Less i forget, there is lack of love and cooperation in the national (local) board and this is the first killer of growth.N/B:. THIS THREAD ISN'T FOR SHOW OF INTELLECTUAL PRUDENCE BUT A PEACEFUL DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION ON THE WAY FORWARD AS WELL AS TO SEEK THE OPINIONS OF OTHER USERS AS TO WHAT THEY THINK OF A PHYSICAL CONVENTION TO DISCUSS WAYS TO HELP MEMBERS TO GROW AND RATHER THAN FIGHT, PLEASE JUST VOTE ON THE POLL AS THIS WILL BE A GREATER DETERMINANT OF THE NEXT MOVE OF ACTION.",

      "body": "I commend your thoughtfulness op and personally, I must say your observations are quite correct especially in terms of helping to coach the younger ones to grow in the forum but another thing to consider is, if this convention is held, how many people will be in attendance or how many will practice what they've learned? In this forum boards, there are pinned rules and regulations on what to post and countless \"pointers\" have been giving by not only higher ranking users but those who have known their way around here to help these newbies find their way here. If there's still peeps that flop, is it the convention that would change it?Another matter you brought up is the issue of lack of love and co operation and I find it quite disturbing because I've observed that some of our guys here just like to call out our members in the other boards. It's not like I'm saying they should support them even when they are doing wrong, but at least you shouldn't completely throw them under the bus...",

      "body": "First let me commend your efforts to pen down your personal assumptions and speculation pf what the local board is and what the impact of the Nigerians community in the larger Bitcoin talk forum,  but more than that is the fact that the Nigerian community may have suffered a lot of setbacks just as you already mentioned the challenges facing Nigerians at both the local board or the main forum boards,  more also is another fact that Nigerians make up a large amount to the active members of this forum. But as we all know that some weren't built in a day,  so is the Nigeria local board community here on bitcointalk,  and this is something highly commendable as we keep fighting for the admin of the forum to create more subboards and moderators with a couple of merits sources to keep the merit cycle in this Local board rolling. Back to the topic of discussion which borders convention which to me is a bad idea and against the ethics of what Bitcoin stands for which is privacy,  so just as you rightly said,  not many will be cool with such arraignment",

Then your recommendation of physical convention or meeting will not be possible as this time of high tfaire in the nation. And the love you tok about in the local board, I don't know of others but as for me I see love in the forum but the problem is the newbies that people are introducing to the forum. They are just posting anything that comes to their head making the board a shit and spam boards. If the people who are bringing newbies give them good orientation and of they do well here then everything go dey alright. I now y u left the local board for a while. And na this di same issue. And dat di same thing is still on ground. Oya look at the first page of this board u go confirm am. Di matter dey make everyone vex. So your convention go hard for us for now.",

Without exaggerating I believe say dis our forum na im de for di forefront of anything bitcoin and crypto matter for inside Nigeria, diafo, anything wey go make am beta and give am a stronger voice de welcomed by me.Aldo I no know how di convention go take de possible because of some reasons1: Bitcointalk forum de anonymous, meaning say dem create am to hide the identity of the members. So dis convention no go go against di ideology of di forum? 2: Location, dis na di real koko, because I believe say we live for different locations for Nigeria, some of us sef for dis forum live for outside Nigeria. So wetin be di possibility say most of us go fit to converge for one venue at di same time to hold di convention? Considering cost of transportation and lodging accommodation. I for advice say if we want to hold convention, we fit to open something like a telegram platform, zoom or even WhatsApp.",

But how about if people living in the same state of the 36 States of the Federation fit just come together and discuss way forward, I think that will be far more better than expecting everybody in the 36 States to convey one place.",

This post made me realize that we even have one merit source here on our local board, as I went to check on . Re: [LOG] The ranked-up members are: Congratulations!  and saw only one of our members listed as a merit source. That being said, we ordinarily do not wait for the forum admin to approve any of our trusted members as merit sources and add them to our list; we can as well help our fellow members in whatever little way that we can. If you come across a quality post made by one of your locals, either here on the local board or outside, we can spare a few merits for them as it will push them a little further on their journey. Regarding the convention, like CryptoHeadlineNews has outlined, we don't need to gather up all at once to discuss some press matters; technology has helped reduce the stress of F2F meetings as everything can now be done online and everyone's opinion will be taken note of. While we wait for those to happen here on the forum, we can always address one another when we see where the other is going the wrong way. We can either DM them privately and call them to order, or a thread for addressing some certain issues could possibly be created here on our local, with the discussion purely in our local language, \"Nigeria Pigin,\" because not everything that we are discussing here is meant for outsiders to understand freely without stressing their brains.",

High cost of transportation  as a result of the hike in fuel prices 2. Location for event but I been don reason this one major and I also see say most persons dey point to the fact say some of our users dey outside countries and that's no doubt but the truth be say,  no be everybody dey attend meeting na, even for family meetings, you no go expect your family member wey dey outside to come down simply because una wan do family meeting except he just wan come back and that is to say that as a first time convention, everybody no fit turn up. 3. Funds, cost of organization  go also be a major challenge and not many of the users go easily donate especially  for the local board considering  the state  of the economy  and the load fit end up for my neck but I been dey look beyond that.These na the challenges me I been dey consider and I don also see wetin everybody talkQuote from: Merit.s on July 25, 2023, 10:08:37 AMI guess that OP,was busy doubling his Naira notes and investing his profit in bitcoin.

To be a merit source is different.Really Charles-Tim you have an application for the merit source thread,  I haven't seen that and since I hardly read most of the posts that are not bitcoin related or other coins that may be of interest to me,  really the only merit source that we have here in the local board is CryptopreneurBrainboss who have been absolutely ok in the dispensation of merit and if I have to vote for an increase or write a PM the admin it will be for an increase in the merits allocation to CryptopreneurBrainboss since his pattern of merit distribution here in the local board have been highly professional and even though he has low limits of monthly merit allocations,  CryptopreneurBrainboss has made each and everyone feels the impact of him being a merit source here in the local board despite that he is not Nigeria local board merit source. But having a new merit source in the local board is a nice idea and everyone can apply for that,  if you feel that you will be selfless enough to distribute the merits allocated to you without any issues,  we don't need those who won't ordinarily not support members here in the forum to become merits source.",
