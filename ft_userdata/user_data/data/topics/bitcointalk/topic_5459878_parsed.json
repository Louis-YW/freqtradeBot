You can always try later since you have until September 29 to fill it out.The website load fine from my end and I was able to see all the features and access forms for compliant but since I was not a customer of FTX I did not try to fill and submit the form to see if the final steps is working. FTX have made some good attempt to for recovery and at the same time exposes some of the channels in which they customers funds was wasted,  because from what I read on the confessions,  FTX spent over $300 millions to get a Europe license normally should have cost them $30million and that was a big pip in the hole. https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/13/ftx-europe-bankman-fried-john-ray-bankruptcy-claw-back/",

They may be willing to, but I don't think that will happen. If they really had enough money to give back everyone what they owe, they wouldn't even be in this situation.

Asking for such details, which they already have make no sense.FTX filed for bankruptcy so there is certain procedure set. Another thing, what would be the point of restoring the exchange and just letting everyone withdraw their money willi-nilly if they don't have enough, which they obviously don't. I mean, how would that look like, if for example they have 7 billion USD while people try to withdraw 10 billion?

Anyways, i again received a reminder email from FTX to claim my funds. So i tried login the site and this time i was able to sucessfully login.When i tried the KYC process, it failed at the Address verification. I submit my documents few times and finally it says that proof of address isn't valid.

Why then is the proof of address invalid this time around. Proof of address is an advanced level of verification that is not present in a typical basic KYC request, let's say Level 1. I think it's the business account equivalent to withdraw up to 10k BTC worth. Sounds a little crazy for retail users.I found a list of documents related to this type of KYC request. Maybe it can be used as an alternative if one of them is rejected.Quote from: https://statrys.com/blog/what-is-a-proof-of-addressProof of address can be one of the following documents: - Water, electricity, gas, telephone, or Internet bill- Credit card bill or statement- Bank statement- Bank reference letter- Mortgage statement or contract- Letter issued by a public authority (e.g. a courthouse)- Company payslip- Car or home insurance policy- Car registration- Authorized change of address form- Letter of employment- Official letter from an educational institution- Municipality bill or government tax letter- Driver’s license- Residence permit- Lease agreement for your residence",

It doesn't help that the murky process is made more complicated due to a good amount of influence and politics at play. We don't know anymore what's true and what's not, what's real and what's fake.
