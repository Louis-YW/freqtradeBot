This is not how bitcoin works! That's the beauty of a free global market where no one controls the asset. Bitcoin is available now at a super discounted price and bitcoin believers are accumulating more because we may not see this price point ever again in the future. Those who understand how the bitcoin market works, they are not worried about a person leaving bitcoin. Once this bear cycle is over, it will be a grand slam run awaiting for us!",

He has highlighted many things about Bitcoin which hasgot a lot of people thinking differently about Bitcoin other than its use as an alternativecurrency, transfer of wealth or payment system.If at some stage when he decides he needs to sell his or part of his hodling it will be sensational,but not the death knell of Bitcoin. There were many many people involved in Bitcoin way beforeanyone even knew of Michael Saylor or Microstrategy.",

If micheal satoshi saylor leaves ntc company ?Time for exit ?[/quote]According to coindesk desk hub updated on june 29- 2022 written by Stephen Alpher.Michael Saylor MicroStrategy (MSTR) on Wednesday morning said it purchased 480 bitcoins for about $10 million – an average price of $20,817 per coin – during the period from May 3 to June 28.The new additions bring company holdings to 129,699 bitcoins (BTC) acquired for $3.98 billion, or an average cost of $30,664 each. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $20,100, making MSTR's stash worth approximately $2.6 billion. So how can someone be buying more 480 bic be said that he is leaving he is more into stratigizing please",

He simply just moved from the CEO position to an executive chairman position. I assume Saylor simply wants a CEO that would replace him to handle all of the non-bitcoin related business arms of MicroStrategy.Fun fact: MicroStrategy provides business analytics services, financial services, healthcare, etc.",

Even if MicroStrategy decides to eventually leave bitcoin behind and focus on other investments, bitcoin can most probably take the blow and come back stronger. There's no use spreading doom and gloom propaganda. We heard it all, and every single time, we just shrug our shoulders and carry on.",

How can the \"father of btc\" been a naysayer once?Quote from: https://twitter.com/saylor/status/413478389329428480#Bitcoin days are numbered.   It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.And he started first buying Bitcoin with Microstrategy in like mid 2020. Hes more like a relative newcomer.He also didnt sell any Bitcoin or left Microstrategy. He simply switched roles to focus more on Bitcoin. The complete opposite of what you tried to imply. And that you even considered exiting Bitcoin in case of if saylor did it/ that Bitcoin would fail without him, shows that you still have a lot of learning to do and still dont understand why its important to develop knowledge yourself, instead of trying to sheep onto whoever seems smart.",
