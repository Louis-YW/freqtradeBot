      "body": "QuoteIf I setup the pubkey with transaction I have no guarance to take the solution.Technically, it could be possible to create a Script, that will force to reveal the private key. The easiest way is to have OP_CAT, but this is beyond Bitcoin. However, some tricks are still possible, for example you can create two signatures in your output, and then require revealing a public key, that will connect both of them. And to be absolutely sure, you can require a third signature for that derived key, that will be different than two previous signatures. Also, to keep the same z-value, you can wrap all of that in OP_CHECKMULTISIG, for example by using 3-of-3 multisig, where all three keys and signatures will be dynamically adjusted. And then, some P2WSH or P2TR should be standard. Or you can try it out on testnet3 first, and make sure that the input data is useful enough, and then do the same thing with the real key you want to break.Quoteeverything is clear -> you must give a working algorithm.This is also something you can require in your Script. Even if something is not directly supported, you can still create some longer Script, or even a chain of transactions, that would allow all of that. Because still, we have for example opcodes, which works on 32-bit values. And that is enough to for example build a custom script, that would be unlocked, if you would break N rounds of SHA-256. Of course, the naive approach does not scale, so for that reason you should probably start with testnet3 anyway. Or even with something like custom LN-based script, but I guess that would be harder to start with.",

      "body": "Quotein this example when the nonces are less than 129 bit -> you need only two transactioons for lattice attack.You should note one important thing: for puzzle 120 and puzzle 125, you have private keys with many zeroes. But nobody revealed the private key anyway, even though there are two or more transactions for each of them. Which means, you need a nonce, that has many zeroes, not the key itself! And that difference is quite important. Surprisingly, you can swap a key with a nonce, or even do a bitwise-swap, but it does not help in this specific case.Another important thing to note, is that lattice is far from perfect, and can give you no results, even if your keys are quite small. I had some cases, where 8-bit keys were not broken, because some numbers were not aligned well. So, this is not the attack, that always works, even if someone will give you the proper algorithm, it can still fail for some specific keys.So, good luck, but remember: lattice is not a solution for all problems, and it can easily fail even for weak keys (you can try using only lattice for all known keys in the puzzle, and see, how far you will get, you may be surprised, how many keys could fail).",

I try to reorder/combine/add/subtract and other weird operations with the Signature proofs that we have on puzzle 120 and 125 without any success. I did all this thing trying to construct manually the LLL matrix but i see that is not possible interchange the privatekey and the nonce in this way.Quote from: garlonicon on September 26, 2023, 05:19:12 PMAnother important thing to note, is that lattice is far from perfect, and can give you no results, even if your keys are quite small.

So, this is not the attack, that always works, even if someone will give you the proper algorithm, it can still fail for some specific keys.This is last part is some new for me now that you mention it it make a lot of sense, i am not a LLL expert, but I can explain a little bit this part and why it is not perfect.In the video that i mention before : Biased Nonce Sense Lattice attacks against weak ECDSA signatures in the wildWe have some values in the Series of linear equations like:Code:K1 -t1d - a1 = 0 mod NK2 -t2d - a2 = 0 mod NK3 -t3d - a3 = 0 mod N...Kn -tnd - an = 0 mod NAnd we need to write a matrix like in the image:If you see carefuly we are omitting those constans a1, a2, ... anThose values aren't necesary to construct the matrix becuase the lattice nature can more or less handle some of those \"errors\" but as you mention it is not always the case.In the video Nadia said that more or less like:QuoteKind of high level version of this attacks is the if ummh, the secret nonce is kind or is small then the system of equations likely has only one solution and lattice can magically find itVideo at time: 5:53",
