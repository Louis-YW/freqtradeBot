The reason is because when they quickly accept bitcoin based on the one-sided information that you have given them, they will be really disappointed to the point of discontinuing their adoption of bitcoins because the event they are faced with is something that is unexpected. If they have the full information on bitcoins, they will react differently.",

It is critical that individuals conveying Bitcoin explain the entire picture, including possible risks and the slow nature of gaining profits.  And you are correct when you said  that success in Bitcoin trading is not guaranteed, and it is critical to be sceptical of persons who claim to have flawless tactics.",

The wise thing to do whenever thinking of a business to invest in is to conduct your research, don't rely on hearsay alone; check how profitable it is, how much risk is involved and also how much capital is needed. In Bitcoin, it's advised to use the capital you can easily afford to part with.  If you are not fully equipped on how to go in Bitcoin, you might end up loosing more than you bargained for because with it's volatility rate, price can fluctuate and as such because you want to meet up, or probably you may have been told it's a get rich quick scheme, you put in more funds, and when things go downhill, you blame the market.",

Some individuals has already digested the wrong ideas about Bitcoin and this can affect its adoption rate. It is correct that one of the impediments to the spread of Bitcoin adoption is misinformation. People are brainwashed that Bitcoin is like altcoins and it is marketed as a means to make quick money. However, the major cause of this misinformation is unfavorable government policies. When the government is not friendly to Bitcoin it will discourage many reputable firms from investing in the country and this has made scammers use the opportunity to defraud people. If the government allow genuine business to run in the country, most people will not heed the advice of these scammers hiding in social media. To discourage people from investing or using Bitcoin, the government also engages in smear campaigns to frighten the people against using Bitcoin. Negative news about the Bitcoin system gets headlines in the news, while positive breakthroughs get no publicity. The government is a major promoter of FUD, all in a bid to reduce Bitcoin spread.QuoteBitcoin holds the potential to aid countries with stagnant economic growth and has opened up new vistas of financial freedom for them. Bitcoin can help nations bypass high transaction fees during international trade. It could also be of help to nations that are suffering from sanctions since its decentralized feature can be used to bypass intermediaries like SWIFT. Citizens who invest in the sector can make a profit and increase their earnings. But Bitcoin as a currency or investment cannot grow a nation's economy. Economic growth is propelled by many factors, Bitcoin can be an addition.",
