Among sustainable energy source, hydroelectric power accounts for 15%. In the report, clean energy generation for mining bitcoin has increased if compared to 2021.QuoteDespite Bitcoin mining significantly relying on coal and hydropower, the shares of these energy sources in the total BTC energy mix have been dropping over the past several years. In 2020, coal power powered 40% of global BTC mining. Hydropower‚Äôs share has more than halved from 2020 to 2021, tumbling from 34% to 15%.We can see on the images how fossil fuel energy production is decreasing, while clean energy production like natural gas and nuclear energy are increasing.",

Miners can use only the cheapest energy, else they will mine at a loss.Especially with China ban on mining and the energy war Russia is doing against the world, this is pretty much what we have now.",

I still don't think that Bitcoin should be blamed on the scale it gets blamed, as electricity sources are often not something people can easily choose (there's a big role played by the country you live in, and how its energy system operates). Moreover, the argument that Bitcoin mining is unnecessary and should thus be stopped doesn't quite hold when there's tons of gaming people do, which also isn't necessary and affects the environment, and yet nobody's strongly campaigning against GPU and CPU companies to make them stop making even more power-hungry products.",

Even the environmental champions are now silent because they are now the number one destroyers of the environment.Hence, it is a piece of excellent news that the perceived greenhouse gas (GHG) that BTC mining emits is gradually reducing. The unexpected ban on cryptocurrency mining in some countries made miners desperate to seek other locations and sources of power without really considering the environmental implication. Although the impact of mining on the environment is always overblown by critics Bitcoin would keep proving them wrong. Although it might be gradual, Bitcoin mining is transforming to become very friendly to the environment. If the government would consciously and genuinely cooperate and partner with miners instead of attacking them, this power switch would be attained in a few years.",

Now that nuclear energy is being used and it's sufficient than the other energy source, more of it will come and will gonna use the same method for crypto mining in the coming days. nevertheless, this is a really good thing for the crypto market. since the war broke out, lots of things became expensive and luckily they found a way to cut their bills and to still earn with the current situation of the world.",

I'm having a hard time believing this percentage and the article claims it comes from Cambridge, I've already debunked their report about hashrates from different countries where they don't use any kind of logic or calculation but instead gather the news in the media and report percentages that way!!!This could be the same. Only under developed countries that don't have access to energy or have super expensive ones use coal to produce electricity. India, China, US and Japan are the biggest ones. China's hashrate is very small, India was never a big player in mining scene and US miners are mostly using cheap electricity that doesn't come from burning coal (I don't think Japan has high hashrates either). The rest of the world use gas and other fossil fuels and renewable energies to produce electricity.",

The truth nobody wants to hear is that coal and gas are cheaper than anything else, hydroelectricity is only for a few places, they run on long-term contracts, and most of them work as grid balance so it's pretty hard for miners to get directly this source. Solar work only during the day, the wind does only when lol, it's windy, no sane miner would rely on this for its business. It's hard to go over the price, and I'm really getting tired of pointing out how Riot and Mara are getting 2-4 cents kWh from coal power and switching to green or renewable energy that is simply going to bankrupt you long term.Look at what's happening in California, going all green spending billions and with the most expensive kit, the highest increase in price compared to any other state, and, what a surprise the most blackouts.",
