I find it hard to believe that a bank would have problems with you receiving income from a job, as long as it is legal and declared. it's not that the bank has any problems with the op making money. The point is that banks with low trust do not get along well with others because the banking system operates on trust. So if a large European bank has to send (or receive) a transfer from a small bank in an underdeveloped country with a shitty currency, the fees can be really significant adding to this the currency conversion on a low-liquidity pair.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on October 08, 2023, 05:08:14 AMOn the other hand, if at the end of the day you have to convert part of the P2P bitcoin to be able to pay in fiat, I don't see much difference to cashing in fiat, spending what you have to spend and buying P2P bitcoin with the rest, apart from the problem with your bank.You receive a bitcoin transfer at a cost of $1 and only what you need for food is converted into the local currency by p2P trade at a small cost because you exchange bitcoins for cash outside the banking system (banknotes hand to hand).I do bealive that such a solution can reduce costs and make life easier, especially if the local currency has high inflation and low liquidity.",

But there's no way to know that.Yep, sending foreign currency using local banks is possible as long as the banks accept it, the matter is only higher fee. Even it's not possible, I think Paypal is more popular in freelancing, but definitely it's better to use Bitcoin when it comes to cross border transaction.",

First getting a bank account that accepts international payments is very hard here, there are a lot of fees, it takes a lot of time for funds to arrive, banks ask you stupid questions etc. These are just a few major examples. And no its not black money, its completely legal money from an established and registered business. I guess it would even be harder for someone who wants to receive black money  This has been my experience, experience of my friends and countless people who do business internationally. Just do some research on some freelance boards on how much of a pain it is to get money in underdeveloped nations and you would find this more sound. It isn't hard to look for.Now onto your second point, did you read what I posted before imprudently writing your message here? Yes, I am converting to fiat because I have to spend some money of course for living, but the good part is all the bullshit and problems go away. Its so much quicker and cheaper. And I can save the rest in the BTC.Quote from: un_rank on October 08, 2023, 04:39:25 AMQuote from: wd1 on October 08, 2023, 04:22:05 AMI think they are higher when you get into complex stuff like multiple inputs and outputs.

Not only OP, but I think we would all be very happy if our work was paid in BTC, as BTC becomes more and more popular, people see many benefits through using it. We still have to look backwards because this is a personal issue, so we need more time for people to become familiar with the technology and use BTC.This is a little difficult because many countries have not legalized Bitcoin so there is a fear among people to pay wages using Bitcoin. It is true that there are many positive things that can be obtained from this transaction, for example, small transaction fees or recipients can use Bitcoin with the intention and own goals (if indeed he is a Bitcoin user) but again we cannot equate everyone because Bitcoin has not been legalized and not many people agree with this.However, in countries that accept many purchases using Bitcoin, this might make it easier.",

Bisq is so far the most Decentralized EXchange with no KYC that I know of and every trade is peer to peer with the company providing the servers to connect peers and the option to use escrow.",
