Quote from: _act_ on May 18, 2024, 12:47:04 PMI think you will need to edit the OP and first explain what bitcoin spot ETFs are.so... edit my thread to say the exact same thing as in the thread you linked? yeah... no.here, it's gonna be data, news and possibly analysis. maybe that way, when people ask \"why dump\", we'll be able to direct them here and tell them \"well you see those guys here, Grayscale, they still have 290k BTC to sell, and yesterday they decided to sell a few\".",
