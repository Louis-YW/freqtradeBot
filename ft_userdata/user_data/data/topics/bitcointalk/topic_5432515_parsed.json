May your kindness and help us return to you many times over!Today, December 31, the bastard regime of the Kremlin launched another missile attack on the peaceful cities of Ukraine. No, not at military facilities, not even at infrastructure facilities. This time in Kyiv, rockets flew INTO RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS! One rocket hit in Kyiv hit near the school. One rocket hit a residential building. 1.5 kilometers from the place where I live, a Russian rocket fell, which simply did not reach its target ...These were not downed missiles, these were their GOALS - residential buildings, schools, hospitals .... In Kiev, 1 person died, 11 were seriously injured.I believe in the victory of reason, civilization. And I really wish the destruction of rashism - this vile, vile, cowardly regime and its henchmen!Ukraine and the entire adequate world are obliged to defeat rashism and their terrorism in 2023!I wish that in all countries, there will be peace, prosperity in families, the restoration of the economy of your countries, and the opportunity to live in peace and enjoy life without hearing air raid warnings every day and without watching cruise missile explosions in neighboring houses!Happy New Year !!!",

I don’t think that the inhabitants of Europe or Canada or Turkey or another country, congratulating each other on the new year 1942, did not mention the evil",

Regarding peace with Russia, this is not possible. Russia openly, officially says that its goal is the physical destruction of Ukraine and the enslavement of its people. Therefore, they left us no choice - only one country will remain on the globe - either Ukraine or Russia. Russia left us no choice - we will fight for our survival with all possible methods! And I'm quite satisfied with the appearance of 5-10 new republics, on the eastern border of Ukraine",
