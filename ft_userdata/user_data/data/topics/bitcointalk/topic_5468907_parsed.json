  "content": "This is a fix for an old issue that Foxpup diagnosed:Quote from: Foxpup on March 05, 2017, 02:56:48 AMThe cause is that Arabic text automatically switches the text direction to right-to-left, and since the immediately following text is just numbers and punctuation marks, which can written in either direction, there's nothing to change it back.Mods can fix it in this instance by adding a left-to-right mark (U+200E, &#8206;) to the end of the thread title, though that doesn't address the underlying bug.Basically, topic titles ending with certain characters will cause the page numbers to mis-render, like this:It's easy to find many examples of this on the Arabic and Hebrew local boards, like the following:With this patch, the two previous examples would render like so:Here's the diff for @theymos:Code:--- baseline/Sources/MessageIndex.php 2011-12-22 22:56:39.000000000 +0000+++ modified/Sources/MessageIndex.php 2023-10-02 14:44:40.000000000 +0000@@ -495,32 +495,32 @@     // Decide how many pages the topic should have.    $topic_length = $row['numReplies'] + 1;    if ($topic_length > $modSettings['defaultMaxMessages'])    {     $tmppages = array();     $tmpa = 1;     for ($tmpb = 0; $tmpb < $topic_length; $tmpb += $modSettings['defaultMaxMessages'])     {      $tmppages[] = '<a href=\"' . $scripturl .

Here's an (Urdu, I think) example:If you read the OP carefully (particularly Foxpup's quote) then you'll understand this issue better. Some Unicode characters are meant to be laid out right-to-left instead of left-to-right, and sometimes topic titles end with character sequences that leave the text direction flipped, which then messes up the way the page links are rendered. What this patch does is make sure that the text direction is always set to left-to-right before the page links get emitted.Quote from: digaran on October 02, 2023, 08:48:44 PM(...) this bug shows when there are no new posts, [new] seems to fix the bug temporarily.Hmm, I don't think that's the case (though, maybe I misunderstand you).

I'm not sure why your button is textual and mine is graphical (maybe it's a mobile vs. desktop thing, or a BPIP vs. vanilla thing), but if you understood my previous response (and carefully read Foxpup's quote in the OP), then I'm sure you can appreciate why putting the text \"[new]\" between the topic title and the page links will flip the text direction back to left-to-right. It's kind of interesting, but doesn't really have any bearing on this patch, so I don't think it's a tangent that justifies further discussion.",

(I mean, a lot of people probably won't care about this one, because it's an issue that rarely shows up on the global boards, but, it's an easy thing to improve, and I have to imagine that the people using the Arabic local board, the Hebrew local board, and maybe future RTL-script local boards, like an Urdu or Persian one, will appreciate their board views looking a bit less borked, especially because this issue causes the graphical \"new\" button to only stay on the right-hand-side of a topic's title up until that topic reaches a certain number of replies, at which point the button suddenly switches to being on the opposite side of the title, or sometimes even buried within the title itself.)",
