Those who accept Bitcoin - is it worth it? And do you accept Bitcoin straight to your wallet, or do you use third-party services?If you use a third party service and you get fiat then I guess you already have nothing to lose, although such services may be more and more avoided by bitcoiners because of the ever growing KYC requirements.If you decide to keep the coins yourself or exchange (parts or all) yourself then the recommended software is BTCPay server, but that's about investing and it's a decision you have to make for yourself. Also in this case you have to find out how will the accountancy look like.However, it's said that it's always the good time to start with bitcoin.Whether it worth it or not? It's hard to tell, it may depend on each and every one's goals.Whatever is your choice, good luck!",

The price of bitcoin has always been volatile, so if that's worrying you, you'll keep worrying because that will always change and the characteristic of bitcoin being like that will never change.Quote from: BroganWessex on May 25, 2022, 11:18:00 AMThose who accept Bitcoin - is it worth it? And do you accept Bitcoin straight to your wallet, or do you use third-party services?Thanks in advance!It's always worth it to receive bitcoin as a payment. Whether it's for products you sell, services or just a gift. You should practice receiving it directly on your wallet because that's how it goes, there's no one that should receive it for you even you use an address from an exchange, it will still count as your receiving address.But technically, you don't own your bitcoin there if it's a centralized exchange because you don't hold the key.",

Those who accept Bitcoin - is it worth it? And do you accept Bitcoin straight to your wallet, or do you use third-party services?Thanks in advance!Bitcoin is not for the indecisive. If you're in doubt just because the problems out there are temporary in my opinion, fix your mentality regarding Bitcoin long-term perspective. Don't compare it to a short duration as it's irrelevant for Bitcoin.If you are aiming to invest then get to know them all, not because of the hype or the news at a glance. Your money means control is yours. Bitcoin does not have time to explain to doubters.Receiving Bitcoin in the amount of $1 is much more valuable than receiving millions of Shitcoin. Because Shitcoin cannot offset $1 in Bitcoin.Whether to choose third-party or P2P services depends on your own preferences and needs. It doesn't matter as long as the Bitcoins arrive in the wallet with the amount we ordered.",

What kind of business are you running? You need to ask yourself, would Bitcoiners and other crypto holders be interested in my products and services? Some marketing that your shop is accepting Bitcoin could also help. After that, you have to decide if you are going to keep the coins you receive or convert them immediately to fiat. Many shops use payment processors that convert crypto to fiat and that way they don't have to worry about the volatility. Besides the inflation that is already eating up your spending power.",

It's best appreciated i the dip. Although there is no right of wrong timing to transact in crypto but if you must accept crypto directly into wallet you should also be a good market analyst to know when to go stable since it's not an investment tool but a legal tender at the moment.
