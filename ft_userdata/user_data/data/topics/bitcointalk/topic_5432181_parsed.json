Now I only do 2 to 3 legs at best since I prefer to keep it as short as possible and to avoid cashing out frequently. As there would be rare moments where you'll contemplate if you should cash out a parlay or not after hitting more than half of the legs. One of my unforgettable parlay losses though was from an NBA game where it's the last leg and the team had like 1.1 or 1.2 odds and they somehow threw it.",

For example:- If the parlay will be composed of 5 legs, the odds to consider will be around 1.5 - 1.6.- If the parlay will be composed of 10 legs, the odds to consider will be around 1.2 - 1.3- If the parlay will be composed of max legs available (25 legs on Stake), the odds will always be on the Favorites ranging from 1.1 - 1.2.",

That's awesome odd you got there though it was risky going with the underdog. I wouldn't dare to get such underdogs on my parlay or even if I did, I would barely take risk for odd above 3 LOL. You are lucky.Quote from: goinmerry on December 28, 2022, 07:55:54 PMShould we also post a screenshot for reference? No of course. I guess it's a bit of hard request to ask for screenshot as they may be more careful with privacy; lots of gamblers never share their gambling activities publicly I guess. Moreover, there's nothing to prove LOL.",

      "body": "Every time I bet on the parlay option, it all depends on the teams that will compete. I mean, I only focus on a few leagues namely the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, including the Champions League and Europa League. of the many matches that will take place every week, I only choose 3 matches. with a note, I will first do a detailed analysis of the many teams that will compete. after that, then I choose which one is appropriate for me to include in my parlay betting slip list.Believe me, the less you bet on the team. the greater your chances of winning. I won't say the amount I've gotten, because I think it's very relative depending on our desire to bet the size of the money at stake. I have a principle, I will only choose 3 fights, after going through the results of the analysis and all the information that I have.To be honest, most of the times I often get wins from parlay bets. even though the odds are small, but if I collect the results it will add to my balance. things to note for those who like this type of parlay, the more matches that are included in the parlay slip list, the smaller your chances of winning the bet.",

I have lost a parlay because of losing one single match which had an odd of 1.4 I guess. Well, the maximum odd I won from Parlay was around 7 including 4 soccer matches.What's your maximum parlay win (don't share the amount). Share only the odds you got and total matches you have included in your bet.I won 3 match parlay with 5.x odds or higher, (just recently, you can see it here), and probably I have 4-5 match with 7.x or higher odds. I try to aim to hit more than than 10.x or something but as we all know, parlay is very hard to hit, everything should be perfectly aligned that time, meaning there is a extreme element of luck in your side just like when I won that 3 match play, it was all ML bet and the team that I bet just won with a 1 point lead and there are chances that the opposing team can score and changes the outcome, unfortunately they missed their goal. While the last match, the team needs to overcome a huge lead in the last minute of the game. So there are a lot of tense moments watching the game itself and praying to the Gambling Gods that you will win.  I don't usually look at the odds though, I mean I bet on the team that I think will likely win the match, so if it's lower than 1.4, I will still take that game and include it in my parlay.",

Share only the odds you got and total matches you have included in your bet.By the way, why didn't you yourself write how many games your parlay consisted of and what was the final coefficient? There is an important nuance here - if you make more or less reasonable bets with chances up to 12 (approximately), then it is more profitable to look for a single event with such odds, since the bookmaker's margin will be less than in the case of an accumulator bet. But if you bet with much higher odds, then you can’t do without parlays.",

I don't like to make Soccer parlays because each game can have 3 outcomes (Win, lose or Tie) and that gives us lower chance to win in any of the matches. That's why I prefer to make parlays in MMA. By the way, some casinos offer live betting, and if a basketball quarter is a tie they pay x15, if you parlay 3 draws and win all of them that would be an x1000.

I used to try parlay all the time at that time. Whatever I won from that acca I can guarantee that I lost more than that LOLQuote from: goinmerry on December 28, 2022, 07:55:54 PMFor example:- If the parlay will be composed of 5 legs, the odds to consider will be around 1.5 - 1.6.- If the parlay will be composed of 10 legs, the odds to consider will be around 1.2 - 1.3- If the parlay will be composed of max legs available (25 legs on Stake), the odds will always be on the Favorites ranging from 1.1 - 1.2.I see there are some strategy you are following but do they really works. Sometimes you will find a leg which is obvious win but the odd is higher. One of my favorite strategy was to create a long slip in football matches after the half time in over under goal market. The teams who had higher scoring rate, you can just select over x.5 after 60 minutes. Hit and miss but if you get it right then a 3 fold or 4 fold always have a good chance to win.",

      "body": "well, I could see that making multibet bets was something very risky and the same as playing the lottery, while also making single bets was something that in the long run is not very profitable, in fact it is even a headache, that's why at the end of the day both multibet betting and single betting are both something that is not profitable in the long term, but speaking from my experience in my case the maximum I have ever won was a game with odds of @9.00, I have already made many bets with odds of @ 7.00 to @9.00but I have to add that my criterion when making a parlay in which the odd reaches @7.00 is that I don't put too many games in the bet because that increases even more the risk of losing bets, so I add games where the odds are in the @1.70 and up and where there is a favorite team and another team is a weak team but due to some events the bookmakers place the two teams almost on the same line of odds, of course these scenarios are not so easy to findThat's why I have to resort to having to follow several sports to put it on the parlay, for example something like putting an NBA game at odds of @1.70 and then 1 league game, then 2 premiership games, then 2 league games Portuguese, with that I try to see if I can hit my multi bet, but I confess that it is not an easy task to hit multi bets with high odds, I am amazed by the guys who constantly manage to hit multi bets with odds of even more than @15.00",
