Users that have left positive and negative trust on other users that is accurate and who are not scammers. When you trade with someone and it goes pos or neg you open the trust page and can click post new feedback. Then leave them a + or - review for your trade. If you trust someones judgement and they seem to leave accurate feedback you click trust settings and add them to your list. If they leave bad ratings on people you click trust settings and ~xxxxx name and exclude them from your list.I think this is a common occurrence in collectibles. Easiest place to farm trust just like wall observer is the easiest place to farm merit. I don't think you did anything wrong, maybe just misunderstand the trust system.

In addition to leaving feedback without references, it is very difficult to determine the truth of his claims, also his feedbacks are in opposition to each other.positive feedback to yogg is still there, while at the same time, there is feedback where it is written about yogg scams. now think how confusing it can be for someone who comes for the first time and is not fully informed about the whole thing. at the same time, there are no references to do personal research.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=142910 yogg    2021-01-01        cool guy, and do serious businessQuote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=142910 cygan    2023-03-23        Good GuyCygan reimbursed my swept ColdKeys during the Yogg scam; thanks !",

The OP is not a staff member but seems to know a lot about DT therefore he could have contacted you directly to bring it to your attention but opted to not do that.Not sure what staff has to do with DT, virtually nothing as far as I understand. It's simply a lot more likely cygan would listen to higher-ranking members, rather than a single lower ranking member criticising thier trust list. I really don't understand your point overall, unless it's to try and discourage DT members being criticised in public which sounds like a dangerous precedent to encourage.What the OP did, while probably a bit more \"aggressive\" in the wording than necessary given cygan's response to the issue, is the recommended thing to do if you think someone is abusing DT trust. There is no drama, as cygan has quickly recognised the errors in their trust inclusions and is rectifying them. Drama would be aggressively defending themselves, ignoring criticism, attacking the OP, etc, etc.Quote from: cygan on March 31, 2023, 08:55:58 AMi understand the trust system already so slowly and your hints/posts/links have contributed to it now quite a bit 🙏please give me some time now so that i can revise my trust list calmly and carefullyCongrats on taking the criticism on board and taking the time to review your trust list, sometimes it seems like a rare occurrence that DT members can take constructive criticism, let alone appreciate it!",
