You're right with your observations sir but it was for some definite reasons beyond me but I always related every details with Shashan and stayed committed to paying an agreed interest And just for a little record that I've been a fateful and committed fellow and member of the lending board and I've had about 3 times loan from shashan which all was cleared.And the reason for my initial  loan of $500 was for a business and I even asked him of a $1000 before asking for that of $500 but both were rejected and I had to let the business pass till I can afford it.The intended $210 loan is for my health issues and I incase I get kicked out of my signature campaign, then I'm still certain of clearing my debt and still keeping in touch with my lender.Thanks",

So, you can lock your thread and keep the payment schedule.You are right that I accepted the loan request and wanted to send the funds. But probably OP didn't notice that and didn't provide the wallet so it remains unaccepted. Though Op created a loan request again on my thread before that I found that OP has an alt account that has an open loan with another person. So, obviously rejected the loan.",
