  "content": "The idea behind Exorde is to create a system capable of tracking the spread of information across all Internet networks (European, Chinese, Russian, etc.) and to do this in as neutral a way as possible in real time.Exorde's goal is to find the original source of viral information in its original form, before this information went viral, but this does not mean that the original source is the true information and the true state of affairs.Therefore, it is important to understand that Exorde is not in the business of fact-checking. Determining whether information is true or not is too subjective a job, so the ecosystem simply keeps track of how it is spread. By doing this, you can already get a much better idea of what is going on in terms of misinformation.The Exorde protocol takes publicly available information as inputs: social media posts, press articles, photos, videos. These URLs are processed in a decentralized data pipeline, providing as outputs graphs that link all similar data and facts.Bringing many participants together around Exorde is not easy, and this is where the web3 advantage comes into play: the ability and ease of creating an economy that can organize and fund the Exord ecosystem. This is why Exord created its own cryptocurrency, EXD, to reward participants for their work and motivate as many people as possible to participate in the Exorde protocol. This token also allows the protection of the protocol. Any participation in the protocol depends on a betting and consensus mechanism.The project is currently testing the platform.If you want to take part in the testing, keep in mind that it is only available for Windows for now (tested on Windows 10). Other operating systems will appear later.You need to go to the official Exorde discord server to get a link to download the distribution to install the testnet.You will also find instructions on how to install and initialize the testnet, everything looks very simple.#exorde #crypto #web3 #EXD #ambassadorprogramOfficial linksWebsite: https://exorde.network/Twitter: https://twitter.com/ExordeLabsDiscord: https://discord.gg/ExordeLabs",
