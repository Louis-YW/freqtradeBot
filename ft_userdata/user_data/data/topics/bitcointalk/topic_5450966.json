  "content": "Hey guys.My site (notatether.com) seems to be steadily performing better in terms of clicks, so I am going to rent out a single banner at the top of each post (does not include the homepage).This is not specifically a bitcoin site: I get non-bitcoin clicks and viewers as well, so non-crypto advertisements are also welcome!I will be listening for offers similar to how avatars are rented, so same procedures and terms apply in this case:- We agree a length of time for the ad to be displayed- Sponsors must pay me in advance the negotiated fee- Any kind of banner advertising does not serve as an enforcement from or affiliation of me or NotATether.com to the service provider- I reserve the right to remove the ad at any time if it is linked to a scam or fraudulent or illegal service, WITHOUT REFUND- I also reserve the right to change these terms at any time.And also:- All payments are to be made to me in BTC.- Only one banner will be rented out at a time.- I won't accept offers for NSFW (read: porn) links.Prospective buyers can PM me. In terms of eyeballs seen, it is similar to renting out signatures of Ãœber-Legendary members.",
