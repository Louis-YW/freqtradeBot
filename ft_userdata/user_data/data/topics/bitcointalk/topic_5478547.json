  "content": "Bitwise published a document highlighting their top predictions for 2024: The Year Ahead: 10 Crypto Predictions for 2024  The ten prediction are: QuotePrediction 1 : Bitcoin will trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high.Prediction 2 : Spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved, and collectively they will be the most successful ETF launch of all time.Prediction 3 : Coinbase’s revenue will double, beating Wall Street expectations by at least 10x. Prediction 4 : More money will settle using stablecoins than using Visa.Prediction 5 : J.P. Morgan will tokenize a fund and launch it on-chain as Wall Street gears up to tokenize real-world assets.Prediction 6 : Ethereum revenue will more than double to $5 billion as users flock to crypto applications.Prediction 7 : Taylor Swift will launch NFTs to connect with fans in new ways.Prediction 8 : AI assistants will start using crypto to pay for things online, affirming crypto as “the native currency of the internet.”Prediction 9 : More than $100 million will be staked in prediction markets, which will emerge as a new “killer app” for crypto. Prediction 10 : A major upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain will drive the average transaction cost below $0.01, paving the way for more mainstream uses. Bonus Prediction :1 in 4 financial advisors will allocate to crypto in client accounts by the end of 2024.I think every prediction has a different kind of boldness in it, from the most boring one, as Prediction number 1, to the one i find more exciting, prevision number 8. Where there is a precise scoper per Lightning network, that is perfect for cheap, instant, reliable micropayments between agents. What do you think? Which prediction excites you the most?",

Quote from: fillippone on December 19, 2023, 12:29:05 PMWhat do you think? Which prediction excites you the most? Prediction number 1 and 2 are the ones I found more interesting. They are mainly about bitcoin price and bitcoin ETF.One of the predictions that I think will fail is the number 10 which is about Ethereum network fee to reduce. Since many years ago, people thought that would happen but it did not happen. Ethereum went from PoW to PoS, but the fee did not reduce. A simple update from PoW to PoS can fixed that but Ethereum developers did not fix it.",

Prediction number one made me more excited.Because the number one prediction is that Bitcoin will go above $80k I am so excited that I now have some Bitcoin that I have held for a long time. If bitcoin goes above 80k$ then my bitcoin holdings will go over a thousand dollars which is why I am so excited about this prediction.",

Maybe with second layer solutions it will come to something close to that.Anyway, I'm very optimistic about the year 2024, it's going to be an incredible year after all the suffering we've been through.",

With BTC halving approaching, you would expect the price of BTC to pump as high as 80k, and with all the speculations in recent months, BTC spot etf in the U.S. is probably now a question of when and not if.The prediction i find very 'interesting' is prediction number 9, it says prediction markets will emerge as the new crypto 'killer app', that means a lot of people are going to lose their money staking on future events, well like always i guess, in betting some get their predictions correct and win, but most get it wrong and lose .",

Predictions 1 and 2 are what got me excited.$80,000 is quite a high price for me to imagine because I have never experienced it since getting to know Bitcoin that I know that the previous highest price was below the price of $80,000 as included in prediction 1.$42,963 the current trading price, if I can collect the full amount of Bitcoin, then when Bitcoin trades in 2024 at $80,000, I will have earned double that.And regarding prediction number 2, maybe for me who is still new and has not been in the crypto world for long, I will say to people around me that this is the fruit of my belief while in the crypto space and optimistic about Bitcoin because of the new history in industrial development with technology which is great.Prediction number 7, I don't really care because it will only last for a moment as long as the NFT trend continues. When the trend disappears, I'm sure it will be forgotten too.As for prediction number 8, it has begun to be felt, although not directly, by people in general. Several large and advanced companies have started to take advantage of the sophistication of this artificial technology.",

In case of prediction number two, the probability of ETF being approved is very high.

I am also one of the people who is most eager to see how much impact this bitcoin ETF will have. Because we have gone through many adoptions from various institutions, but Blackrock is something different that was able to steal my attention. Not only from the positive side, Bitcoin prices have certainly skyrocketed, but will there be any negative impacts from this Bitcoin ETF? I mean with the involvement of a large entity Blackrock in the future it will not be far from the control they want.My question is based on a personal position that inevitably as a holder thinks that releasing ownership and holding it is a dilemma between needing to take advantage or remaining strong in holding it longer?",

Don't forget that bitcoin is up 145% since January 1st, so ...Don't get me wrong I don't care about the price at all because I use bitcoin as bitcoin. Well, now that fees are that high I struggle a bit, but you get the point.Anyway bitcoin is only going up because it is valuable. We just have to be patient.",

If the Bitcoin ETF gets approved, then there is no doubt that Bitcoin will trade above $80K, and it will grow above $100K as well for some time. Its because of ETF hype and also for halving. Bitcoin halving is very near, and it is possible that Bitcoin ETF is near too. If both happen together or near each other, then Bitcoin will skyrocket. We may not see Bitcoin's current price as it is trading now. However, it's my expectation, not predictions. In crypto, anything would happen at any time, and it would break all our expectations.",
