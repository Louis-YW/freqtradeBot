  "content": "As per my understanding. there are major differences between bitcoin tech and tulip mania. Some people still asking bitcoin is the same as the tulip bumble. Tulip is a non-tech bubble and BTC is a tech bubble. My points areA tulip is a just flower and has no long useful life for it.Tulip flowers do not have a use case Tulip flower investment does not use any security standardsAs per the white paper of the BTC , BTC is for peer-to-peer exchanging money with any border limits, and it's a real use case. BTC has had a long useful life, from 2009 to now. And its adoption especially in the tech sector so we can predict this has to be in another 100 years. There is another valid point that the last BTC going mined in 2140 or near year so for that period BTC should survive. BTC is secured with Blockchain technology and millions of computers are now connected to the newtork. Hashing rate is very high so its almost impossible to break the security of the BTC network.At last, i would say, Tulip is a just a flower without long life. Everyone can not get it. BTC is related with tech and everyone can use it. No discrimination, no boarder , no third party. So BTC will be king of the financial market in near future on the internet.",

Don't compare an apple with a shoes, you need to compare an apple with an apple too. Tulip was expensive because not everyone know Tulip and it's been used for speculation, while Bitcoin, everyone almost know about it, but some people still not want to try to buy Bitcoin.Bitcoin wouldn't crash and become worthless, if anyone ever predict Bitcoin would worth $0 in the future, it's a people who doesn't anything about Bitcoin.",

There is a speculative aspect to crypto that follows many other market cycles. Take a look at Gold's all-time charts for instance and compare to Bitcoin. Looks pretty similar.Bitcoin will continue to rise and fall but ultimately will rise in the long-term.",

Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million units and every day some of those units get lost. There are probably not more than 16 million bitcoins available nowadays. You can’t plant bitcoin on the ground like you do with tulips.Tulips look cool though. I can’t ignore their beauty.",

There is no bubble in bitcoin.Quotewe can predict this has to be in another 100 years.No we can't. The way technology is developing the gaps between massive innovations that revolutionize the world is decreasing so we can't predict what bitcoin is going to be like in 100 years from now.We can only predict the short term. For example we know that for the coming decade or two bitcoin will dominate as the only decentralized currency.QuoteThere is another valid point that the last BTC going mined in 2140 or near year so for that period BTC should survive. Again you can't make that prediction and your whole reasoning is wrong. Bitcoin doesn't survive based on its block reward.",

If you read about it in depth, you learn many interesting things, like what the tulips were being used for and why they were important at that point in history. You could make the case that government spending creates the effect storm for Bitcoin, but unlike Tulips, there is no ability to increase production and it’s likely demand will grow instead of shrink.",

And personally I'd say it's quite an unhealthy comparison if used against Bitcoin as if you observed during it's reign centuries ago, it's value climbed to an ath and crashed suddenly. Which is not the case of Bitcoin..  Bitcoin has intrinsic values and has been referred to as a store of value whereas the tulip mania has known and it's acquisition was as a result of greed of then investors which ended in foolishness, because when prices crashed, so many lost.",

The people were rather undeveloped back then about a lot of technical stuff and you're comparing a flower to a currency, not to mention Tulips can be grown, hence an ever-growing supply, unlike Bitcoin with its limited supply. The people then lacked a lot of information but now? The internet is a sea of information. Quote from: udayantha11 on October 16, 2022, 03:27:09 AMSo BTC will be king of the financial market in near future on the internet.Technology is improving at a rapid rate, it wouldn't be odd for it to be replaced a few decades later on imo. It's the king now, but who can say the same a decade later? I guess most just ignore the possibility since we're like 2 decades in and none has gotten near its place, but I still wouldn't consider it an impossibility.",

ATH prices are not the sustainable value line they are the short term events of hyped up speculation that do correct downhere is the thing. many people think tulips are a example of market failure where tulips died after the failurebut guess what even today hundreds of years on you can still buy tulips.the things you need to realise is tulips were not used as common currency for a nation they were an asset currency, driven by the elites wanting to show off their wealth by having gardens full of what they claimed were unique exotic flowersit was not a plain tulip breed where thousands of bulbs were selling for near house prices... it was actually only a single bulb that sold for a house price the mania was not that tulips were being used to pay rent and buy groceries.. it was that elite/rich/politicians were going through a frenzy outbidding each other to try to compete for higher social/economic status  it was where if you can have a garden in the political/rich guy streets of a notable town you are displaying your nobilityit was never about a failed nations FIAT. it was about a reproducable plant that starts off rare and becomes common. tulips were never meant to be a value guage of \"money\" or utilised as money. they were just a display of wealth by decorating their lawns with the \"first\" rare hybrids they could get their hands on which they were all trying to create the next best beautiful plant to display in their garden tulip mania is more on par with ICO. creating new hybrid things to display as something unique trying to get as much money for the initial premine before the widespread production begins of that hybrid",

Tulips had one huge bubble and they didn't recover from the crash. Bitcoin has many bubbles and it recovers from them. But there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue recovering, it could stabilize or even decline. Tulips utility was overestimated, same can happen to Bitcoin or any other asset. We all know that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency, censorship-resistant payment method and so on, but how much such solution should cost? 100 billions? 1 trillion? 10 trillion?

Because that time, tulip is one of the most sought after flowers and it become a commodity, the price skyrocketed that time. However, when the market becomes saturated, i.e. when everyone is planting tulip and selling them, then it collapses.However, we can't say that for bitcoin, yes we have highs and lows, bulls and bears market, but the thing is that bitcoin always recover so there is no bubble as per definition of it. And so the comparison with Tulip mania or bubble is very flaw in the beginning.",
