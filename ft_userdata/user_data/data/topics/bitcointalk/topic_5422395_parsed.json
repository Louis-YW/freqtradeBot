In other words dropping down to 15500 doesn't mean it should continue dropping another $2k.QuoteWhat Will Be bottom Of BTC in 2022 YearImpossible to predict. As I have been saying over the past couple of months, the market is completely unpredictable and the only way to see major drops is to see major events (eg. US/EU economy crashing or the FTX scam).",

Drops are part of the market, as much as price rises are. If we drop below $15k, it's an opportunity to buy at cheaper prices.Quote from: fennic on November 21, 2022, 03:58:30 AMAnd also 2022 is going to slow down and so what are you thinking about what will be the lowest price of Bitcoin in 2022 Fiscal Year.  Doesn't matter, neither does the highest price of 2022.Just, do your research, buy and then hodl, if you consider it purely as an investment. And if not, buy and use it for regular transactions when you can.",

All markets are quite shaken, and Bitcoin has been further shaken by recent events, so most investors are on high alert in anticipation of what will happen next.All in all, for those who have witnessed bear markets in the past, this should not be too stressful a period, because after the rain, there is always sunshine. It is also an opportunity for all those who have constantly complained that Bitcoin is too expensive, and now have the opportunity to buy at a really reduced price, unless it is still too expensive for them. The question of all questions is, do you believe that the time will come again when we will see some new ATH, maybe finally with numbers of six digits?",

This will make you to lose the moment to buy the bottom, it's better if you do DCA strategy from now. Maybe the bottom is $16? so you're already buy the bottom.

So why are you still in panic mode just this time? And it doesn't matter if it crashed in the future or if it goes down hard to $10k or less.It's the question on how you are going to take advantage of the situation. The price is very cheap, are you not going to buy and just be the one who panic? And then when the bull run starts you will be the one buying at $60k? That's very wrong mindset of a beginner, and perhaps you are going to regret your decision in the future for panicking in 2022 and not accumulating more.",

If I see $12k, I will be all in. Otherwise, I'm following my strategy to buy in DCA method. Well, it's very possible to get further dip once it hit $12k, I'm not expecting instant bounce back or even a bounce back within a year. As I said, I just want to get rid of my USDT I have for buying BTC and I would be happy to get the maximum from the budget. So, it doesn't matter a lot for me even if BTC gets further dip from $12k.",

The fact that all of this is news driven makes predicting the bottom a useless exercise, as there is nothing we can take a look at the charts right now to predict what it may happen, even if the charts gave an indication the bottom is already in if another exchange or big coin collapsed then it is obvious the market will react to it and go lower than the level we thought to be the bottom, so right now it makes more sense to keep ourselves up to date about the events surrounding the market in order to predict short term trends.",

There's no stress and this is clearly the opportunity we've been waiting for a long time. I don't know if anyone here is like me but I would like to see bitcoin hit 10k this bear season and I hope it happens next year. Bitcoin hit six digits it's only a matter of time but I hope before bitcoin gets there bitcoin will drop even more  .Quote from: Fundamentals Of on November 23, 2022, 01:56:12 AM...
