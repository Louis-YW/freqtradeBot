  "content": "Everyone likes cool calendars and it's even better when they are connected with Bitcoin.There is one very cool project called Bitcoin Timechain Calendar that is showing real-time data from the Bitcoin timechain with immutable history.You can see bunch of information with Block Height in center, supply and epoch is shown in upper left corner, sats value is in upper right corner, time clock is in lower left corner, and date in lower right corner.Above Block Height you can see average block time, next difficulty adjustment and hashrate.Below Block Height there are four categories of estimates fees with mempool stats and unconfirmed transactions.Great thing about Timechain Calendar is that you adjust settings how you like them, and got back in time since Genesis block, or go in future.All this is packed in one simple tool and I see no reason why this wouldn't be my new daily Bitcoin calendarÂ  in 2023  https://timechaincalendar.com/I am not affiliated with Bitcoin Timechain Calendar in any way.",

I feel the project needs a little more of SEO because the title of the site is the current block, and is a nice feature to have it that way, but it isn't good for the search engines indexing. It should have the name of the project and then the current block. And another feature that I would like to see in this time machine is the bitcoin forks. That would be nice.",
