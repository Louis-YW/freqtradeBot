This country's government currently holds over $828 million in BTC.\"Bhutan has built bitcoin mining facilities in multiple locations, the largest of which is at the site of the now-defunct Education City project,\" Arkham Intelligence said.Arkham also said the crypto intelligence firm explained that it was able to confirm the activity by reviewing satellite imagery and matching the timeline of onchain mining operations. \"We were able to support the timeline of on-chain mining activity with time-lapse satellite images of the facility's construction,\" unlike most governments, Bhutan's BTC law enforcement does not come from seizing assets, but from bitcoin mining operations, which have dramatically increased since early 2023 increased.News link: 1) https://news.bitcoin.com/government-of-bhutan-holds-828m-in-bitcoin-arkham-data-shows/2) https://www.aicoin.com/en/article/419903",

Any medium-sized European city has more GDP than this country. Although it is logical that the pro bitcoin movement starts in small countries like El Salvador or Bhutan. Hopefully larger countries will join in over time, perhaps soon the USA.I believe in the philosophy that says, Rome was not built over night and that big steps begin with small moves and that is why I am always very happy and excited to hear about news like this. When countries were being colonized, it didn't necessarily begin with the big country but small and medium sized countries, before they gradually take over bigger countries.El-Salvador is one of the countries who have participated well in the adoption of Bitcoin technology in its country's financial institutions. Now, imagine if Putin finally gets to implement its announcement to adopt Bitcoin for its international trades and if Bitcoin also get favored by Donald Trump when he assumes the office as the presidet of the United States of America, what will you think about bitcoin by then?",

It has a surplus power generation that is even exported to India, which means that Bitcoin mining is a good option. Not selling the coins they have mined might be an indication that they have the long-term knowledge of investing in the sector. The Kingdom of Bhutan might not be a big country, but it is a plus to the Bitcoin ecosystem to see nations that are genuinely investing instead of waiting for seizures.",

And that is something that their government should be proud of, as it could mean 25% of the country's GDP.And if you can see, they have a diversified portfolio. So along the way, the government of Bhutan knows something that other government is the world doesn't, and that is to stack as much Bitcoin and other crypto as they can.",

I think there are many more countries that own bitcoin and dont publicize it. El Salvador will always be the number one country that has decided to do this and so far they are successful with it and I think in 2025 they will be even more successful. Many other countries will see this and discuss to buy bitcoin. Bhutan has made it right now, very well.",

It really underlined the strategic shift toward holding $828 million in Bitcoin, mainly from their mining operations. That wasn't due to seizures of the assets, as some governments do, but large-scale mining that really ramped up in early 2023. By using Bitcoin, Bhutan should be able to broaden its traditionally single-industry economy, which depends on hydropower. Their strategy could easily become a model for other small nations willing to enter the crypto world.",

First, the $828M holdings are not just for Bitcoin alone, but they comprise the holding at the address that belongs to the Bhutan government.Â According to the source provided above, the actual number in Bitcoin is 13.076 BTC, which is worth $826.31M. The rest of the holdings that amount to $828M are from Eth, which is 656.013 Eth worth $1.6M+, and other coins that don't amount to $20 each.",

These days, news of a country holding bitcoin is no longer surprising news, especially for small countries. You are right, even if more countries openly own bitcoin it does not mean that bitcoin will be widely accepted as an investment opportunity for governments. Like the German government, they don't even care about it and are willing to sell it all at any price. I guess many people here didn't even know Bhutan existed until this article appeared.",

They nominal GDP is tiny, one of the smallest in the world. It is only 2.8 billion dollars. I know, hard to believe, but it seems true. So if annual GDP is 2.8 billion USD, then we're talking about almost 30% worth of GDP in BTC holdings. Now that's hugely impressive if you ask me.Of course, since it's a small country in an isolated part of the world, and since in global economy this amount isn't that high, the global impact of such news is not significant. But on the scale of this country, it is a lot of trust being put into Bitcoin, and I hope it works out for Bhutan.",

I did not know that they had Ethereum holdings so they may not have only been mining Bitcoin or they have been mining Bitcoin and Ethereum for a long time. It's probably around 13,079BTC based on the price of BTC when OP made the screenshot/post. @Ricardo11 take note and possibly change the amounts to be writing in BTC as hugeblack said. BTW, it's a good move that the country in question has chosen bitcoin to be their biggest investment in crypto and since they have a very small number or citizen and a small capacity for natural resources they have figured out that BTC might be another for of mineral resources (digital gold) hence putting some of the countries capital in to it is very good. We will keep seeing adoptions like this, fact remains that major countries would probably be the last to adopt but smaller countries would find themselves into it first.",
