Each card of this edition will have a BTC face value equivalent to 50‚Ç¨ (0.00152597BTC for this edition), allowing you to track the progress of this magic internet moneyThis edition is also an opportunity for artists in the crypto community to express themselves and share their vision of the crypto universe. Every quarter, we will collaborate with a different artist, offering a diversity of styles and perspectives over time.Each month during the quarter, a new design from this artist will be featured on a series of cards, making each edition limited and collectible. The Timeline edition will be buyer funded. You can load your card if you want to. This November edition is also the very first to represent our new Icarus hologramFor this first quarter (Q4/2023), the supply will be 42 cards per month. In addition to that, 1 artist proof card will be produced per design, and offered to the artist. We reserve the right to modify and adjust the supply for next quarters, if we see that too many people are not able to get a card. This quarter, we have the pleasure to work with mx12.levins and release the second Timeline card edition for Q4 November 2023.Icarus Timeline Edition 11/2023 (designed by mx12.levins)üîêüï∞Ô∏èCode:TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.1 ¬† ¬† :bc1qsn7z0dmmwx54j3xeedqsxlxcxq30hdwzjlhylsTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.2 ¬† ¬† :bc1qnggr6n49djrkawwtxapf0c82j329ns6z5juwwtTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.3 ¬† ¬† :bc1qddeg4puf9jal923w4659nqa0txs57k4hzq59z7TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.4 ¬† ¬† :bc1qte7qapwdnmxcs3uvcgj7ugtnly9s3gghdra8apTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.5 ¬† ¬† :bc1qlatytk54lhhcuznt0jp5xlpc68pzuct2p2rqw9TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.6 ¬† ¬† :bc1qxwc3s7y8gtmpmtmjjx9f9ssgzuemcgjzxq76ljTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.7 ¬† ¬† :bc1qgcj336kdmeszdyq3fl4sq4hrfgftmflu5qx5q5TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.8 ¬† ¬† :bc1qsmjyapn7vmqn2pvv94xytsxmj5hz7cvl5wtgelTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.9 ¬† ¬† :bc1qtx2v9qaem2skx0qv4cwxqt2zcmmp5ew2gz40rqTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.10 ¬† ¬† :bc1qxcxfjvm7v3v92hr73jvwn2pfepk3mjhnna96zsTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.11 ¬† ¬† :bc1qdefd63jdga08rk248nrrl485380rxpg23uezyhTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.12 ¬† ¬† :bc1qs0ssl68k9m52qvnpz0afd5fjlt2tdysdnm8ca3TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.13 ¬† ¬† :bc1qs4vgfzdcdc250wn9kcwtdsaahtfxe8f55qv93zTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.14 ¬† ¬† :bc1qfqecxvacr6s6j7glkqks74gs6de78fk93zqf7eTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.15 ¬† ¬† :bc1qa7dmxhtt0ccx0stwllgxg6yrs7wsp92fg76smmTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.16 ¬† ¬† :bc1q3n7h6n6szcnhyvc7wpsd2shkavq6z4wuzw7rk5TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.17 ¬† ¬† :bc1qk32ujn5lsn7j955nrgu8m2dzsezmy2e4umyn3dTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.18 ¬† ¬† :bc1qkjghx97ddl45vddgdzruwhzesevq64vhda6lnwTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.19 ¬† ¬† :bc1qqxh6wyeup9dht8s5ue6af9m0672q6gd4qr0lk8TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.20 ¬† ¬† :bc1qq0kxrqr9lc4aws9cxjr5lts784pmp4adgfx48uTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.21 ¬† ¬† :bc1qrf5a8guwuuenwp3p9rxtu34t0a9c38zp867w3dTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.22 ¬† ¬† :bc1qq84nalf0qr7qqtsxkrljyv44fu8hp5wkl4kp4uTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.23 ¬† ¬† :bc1qq0l6hx9wtjdz4l8xwxkm9lk6g5cjze40kp8hd4TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.24 ¬† ¬† :bc1q6xk589ak949j969hc5q5p2y3vcneqvmfdyjfujTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.25 ¬† ¬† :bc1qusvggvqpp9wz0hjhkezgvadkzmqvchp339wrazTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.26 ¬† ¬† :bc1qsl663x6hrmc9nfe38737u2k0masgcdejf943h4TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.27 ¬† ¬† :bc1qeejuwwatsxjjgkeg0wdchhwmgk9lljj2ejgtrvTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.28 ¬† ¬† :bc1qdt20yarr3djhhmvdq586077ny5pzg67rdvmgy7TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.29 ¬† ¬† :bc1qm3xdur5yxsny3elwxva7myn7gaw5wltz22c28nTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.30 ¬† ¬† :bc1qgszwfjwvv5u6snhhw4lm4rdaagjcfggrphw2knTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.31 ¬† ¬† :bc1qqyzacpwhfqq2mhm3fjqnwstamy7ds4z2w2wcynTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.32 ¬† ¬† :bc1qvua57xtgzk22rvr480vhn2xgmregyle349srxgTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.33 ¬† ¬† :bc1qd2h2latq0ns6zlja9vrn6xekh2270gkp80hlczTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.34 ¬† ¬† :bc1qgge76grhsxmeq9lawdg825m3d3xemqwftt30flTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.35 ¬† ¬† :bc1qt22m703ahvq4zyt2hxj32ccveu4u5y0xpz4sr8TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.36 ¬† ¬† :bc1qklre5vse25crt5r5gqpfsr3ksy43hhvay2xtmhTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.37 ¬† ¬† :bc1qs82370zu96ckaztq7zpy594f5r80ef2z8yserqTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.38 ¬† ¬† :bc1qv0p7j7ljtxgvjtlpj7gpgwzuj4eewrur8cxxuwTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.39 ¬† ¬† :bc1qxx6pvvc7thyvmz5p5h98w6un967nx3w98938tzTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.40 ¬† ¬† :bc1qzdycyfjm0k8nl2djwf49ccqk9dnacwefyg9l4vTIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.41 ¬† ¬† :bc1qnsvjqfgewf94lspqmyz7867nz4v6j3puqx68f0TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.42 ¬† ¬† :bc1qyhdcc260jnfzhwkvxstapkhqf29wyqwdd3psv6the following users (subscriber) have priority on the following serials:Code:krogothmanhattan------ #1sunnybwoy------------- #2Primo-bit------------- #3chronicsky------------ #4LitLitBit------------- #5Hhampuz--------------- #6Cyrus----------------- #7MrDipBuyer------------ #8geophphreigh---------- #9MoparMiningLLC-------- #10Agrawas--------------- #11Mitchell-------------- #15Humble Bitcoiners----- #17geophphreigh---------- #18Hookzup1-------------- #19Hookzup1-------------- #20Hookzup1-------------- #21MrDipBuyer------------ #24paid2----------------- #28MrDipBuyer------------ #33  Sales list:TIMELINE-Q4.11.2023.1 -
