I'm one of the senior advocate of this because most times I blame my late adoption of Bitcoin on Ponzi scheme and I really regret it so hard so at every instance I get to educate people about Bitcoin I do and I also make it very clear to them that Bitcoin isn't a get rich scheme just as Ponzi schemes posses as, hence Bitcoin isn't Ponzi.On the other hand, many persons are truly misinformed, even some persons over here as may think there is anything like free money and many think Bitcoin is free and the forum with its name as Bitcointalk, should be an earn ground for Bitcoin without any effort and at the end get so disappointed and in some cases abandon their accounts.Quote from: mk4 on March 09, 2023, 05:43:36 AMProps to you for putting up with the bullshit, but I'm personally done with trying to fight these types of cases.

I'll just allocate my investments in a way that I can be personally comfortable even if bitcoin doesn't pump in 5 years.Yeah it's not easy preaching Bitcoin to people especially in a country like mine where people think you might have some personal interest before trying to get them into Bitcoin and at the end, I feel so bad about it.One of the best way to draw attention of people into crypto is to live a life worth asking how you made it.",

Unlike what other people say about this topic as been unimportant. I see it as a topic that is very important. This is because when scammers comes up with method of scamming people they use bitcoin as a payment method and some of those people that are scammed are newcomers into this cryptocurrency or even the Ponzi scheme. So when they make payments with bitcoin, they know nothing about it and they will assume they have invested in Bitcoin not knowing that they sent it to the scammers in the end of the day. They will say that bitcoin is a scam not knowing that it is a method they used to make the payment.",

Bitcoin is just the medium of these ponzis and scams for them to attract more investors. Just like the typical scam and ponzi that uses fiat, if they have to describe it by how they're describing bitcoin then it should be fiat that's also a scam.

Many schemes are running which use stable coin for payment and later these schemes are fraudulent.And there are many schemes that use Bitcoin as payment.Now any project uses any currency, stable currency or Bitcoin as payment,And if it is later found out that the project or scheme was a Ponzi scheme,So it would be wrong to blame Bitcoin for this.Paying into any ponzi scheme by buying bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency from an exchange and later blaming bitcoin would be redundant.I myself have been a victim of such a Ponzi scheme where payment was made in USDT. Later it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme. But the USDT was not to blame,And I never blamed the USDT for that.payment can be made in any form,so it would be wrong to blame the Bitcoin or other currency.",
