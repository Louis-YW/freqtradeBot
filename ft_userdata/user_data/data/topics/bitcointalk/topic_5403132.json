When you consider that the price was not flat at $30k, but actually a little below it, and the price now is hovering above $18k; considering the values of the couple hundred dollars, it runs up to about 35.9% drop.Quote from: LegendaryK on June 18, 2022, 06:20:39 PMMainly talking about the last 24 hours where Doge has barely moved, and btc dropped ~$2K.Doge has dropped about 9% (that's not barely moved) within the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin on a drop of ~11%.Bitcoin is a lot more expensive, so a drop in it would be massive (relatively) when you compare it with other coins.Consider the percentage difference and not the actual price movement.",

      "body": "While I ain't taking anything away from Dogecoin, I like to mention that it already had its fall (it could still fall more) a few weeks ago while Bitcoin remained relatively stable above $30k until recently. Doge isn't really that bad as highly criticized in public spaces, anyway. Those who think it's a fun and memecoin aren't going deeply into what Doge is actually. Come to think of it, I've read several reports projecting Bitcoin to hit $12k in this crash. It's already doing $18k at the moment. Perhaps, we could see $12k in days to come or not. No crypto is immune to this dip. Everyone of them is seeing enough red now. However, I see this as market's own way of correcting and balancing its books. No panic.",

Most of the altcoins now move a lot less due to the bitcoin dump because they don't have much room to dump, they are already on the floor prices. The strange thing is that this is a free fall constant dump with no relief rally",

As doge dropped 31% in the last 7 days.While Cardano dropped only 21% So ada is stronger because of Elon?i think you need to understand that the elon is a clever man. His big investment is in bitcoin, and tweets on doge is just a joke to him. so dont take his tweets seriously, but if you want to follow him. buy btc and hodl as he is doing.",
