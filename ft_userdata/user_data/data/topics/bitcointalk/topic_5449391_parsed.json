And one transaction of 1 BTC on 1st of July 2026. And one transaction of 1 BTC on 1st of July 2027. And one transaction of 1 BTC on 1st of July 2028. And so on.Maybe starting from 2030 only 0.5 BTC. Because the value goes higher and higher with the time.If I am still alive end of June 2024, I just cancel the transaction of July 2024 and make a new one for 1st of July 2029 or another date.Like that I make sure that:1. as long as I am alive I never have to share my private keys.2. if I die, my BTC are not lost and will go to the person(s) I want.3. my daughter will never lose all of the BTC because someone scammed her.If her lover/friend/unknown scammer scams her, she can only lose the BTC for 1 year.But she will never lose them all.Just have to wait until next July, when a new transaction arrives.Maybe I will send every year to a new address.To avoid that if the seed phrase of the wallet of the year 2024 is exposed, the scammers have no access to the wallet of the year 2025.That is my wish.Please devs, do something.",

There are many wallets like that. I check wallet like Electrum last year and I noticed it supports using unix time as the lock time, also using normal time for it, and also possible you use block height. If you can do that on some wallets for now, I think it is more than enough.",

And that I am able to (4)cancel that transaction.As it was mentioned you can use OP_CLV for #3 but the other three are not possible in the existing protocol. However you can use workarounds to do something similar by using a more complicated smart contract through OP_IF + OP_CHECK(MULT)ISIG.Basically you combine your own key with the receiver's key in different branches of the OP_IF that way you can use the other branch to \"cancel\" the transaction (#4) by spending the outputs to your own address while at the same other the other party can use the other branch to spend the same output to their own address (#2).QuoteIf not possible, then maybe on the Lightning Blockchain.LN is a network and has no blockchain.QuoteI make a transaction of 1 BTC on 1st of July 2024 to the address of my daughter.If I am still alive end of June 2024, I just cancel the transaction of July 2024 and make a new one for 1st of July 2029 or another date.Code:OP_IF  <your pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGOP_ELSE  <1st of July 2024> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP <your daughter pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGOP_ENDIFThis would be your redeem script. You hash this and use it to encode an address. Then send the coins to that address. At any time (before or after July 1, 2024) you can spend these coins and send them to a new address. After July 1, 2024 your daughter will also be able to spend these coins assuming they haven't been spent by you first.Quote from: wstmo345 on April 20, 2023, 03:14:57 AMwhat about this?bugs in 10% of timelocked transactions?https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/01/bug-in-timelocked-bitcoin-contracts-could-spur-miners-to-steal-from-each-other/That is about fee sniping which you shouldn't be concerned about. It is a theoretical attack which is basically like miners competing over transactions with very high fee. It is also unrelated to OP_CLV.You can read more about it here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fee_sniping",

I have just signed a transaction using my signing device. I have set it to be able to be broadcasted after block height 786243. The current block height is 786238.So the transaction was not broadcasting until we reached block 786243. Then I broadcasted it successfully.However, who was going to broadcast the transaction in case I died before the block height 786243 was reached?",

The code for the initial release can be found on github[1] and the script part of the code is almost identical to what we have today. OP codes such as OP_CAT that were removed weren't providing any kind of \"transaction execution programming\" that you claim. Their removal also had nothing to do with \"making network faster\" they were removed because they made no sense and were buggy.[1] https://github.com/Maguines/Bitcoin-v0.1",
