I wonder what elon did for sure. he said that he would be eliminated bots but it seems that many bots still exist. It's an easy trap for lazy and greedy people but the real supporters who have been eligible for airdrop will never fall into the old scam technique like that. There are thousands of accounts being made by scammers to impersonate the real account. This is such an old trick that is still being used by scammers.",

Chances that are many scammers will try to fake their main account with bunch of copy cats tweets and worse there is the scammer using verified twitter for particular time and engage with such bullshit. Of course that will let participants think that its legit.I guess twitter should have restrict changing of names or content for a particular time to avoid leaping of these thieves from hype projects.",

If you have a Twitter account that follows a lot of projects, tokens, NFTs, etc. probably you already see a lot of posts like this and probably there are thousands of posts like this every day that you need to follow, retweet, etc. then also sometimes you need to put your address as well. Also, new hype projects are going to be the ones that they are going to imitate since that is where a lot of people are active.There are also thousands of likes on posts like this making it suspicious enough and some people would think its legit because of thousands of likes and retweet, but probably it was made by bots or some kinds of auto like on twitter. Scammers could easily trick a lot of investors from hype projects so its a bad idea not checking this account before doing something. If they send suspicious token on your wallet just do not try to move it, their are cases where hackers have ways to hack your wallet using this kind of methods.",

Same thoughts, although they can now see the addresses of those users and maybe the true attack is about to begin. They can send malicious tokens to those addresses and once those users interact with the tokens, that's going to be the time that they will be hacked. For the airdrops or even in bounties, it is advisable to use a disposable wallet/address and send only the legit coins after, in your main wallet to avoid any issues.

If not, we can also based on the number of followers. Legit accounts usually have lots of followers (over 20 to 30k) and has a small number of following users.",

And every social media now has a lot of scammer in their again taking advantage of the platform. So everyone should be aware of this kind of trick. There are a lot of ways for this criminals to look as if they are the real ones, and so we need to really be very careful.

On the other hand, there is only one trick being used to scam, they will have Twitter accounts, and you will see it as a official account with the blue badge and not to think that this is a scam.
