Yeah, you can trust it.The VisionStake SPENT, Add Liquidity, Earn SPENT.Espento aspires to be the number one liquidity provider on the Binance Smart Chain and the home of fresh and creative gamified farming mechanisms.Why Binance Smart Chain (BSC)❓We trust in Binance’s capacity and determination to bring a fast and cheap transaction chain with all major security in the near future. starting on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and would most likely result in faster initial acceptance, but we enjoy a challenge and are optimistic about BSC’s future.Faster and less expensive.What makes Espento different from other “Defi”❓In fact, we have created an ecosystem that will provide many opportunities for participants to earn huge returns with minimum input, all while playing.Anyway, let’s get down to the specifics. It’s time to enter into a huge platform.✦ Token: SPENT✦ Chain: Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20)✦ Total Supply: 51 million✦ Distribution:  12% Sale Round(Private sale)  2% Pool Liquidity(Initial Liquidity)  48% Reserve for Pool Liquidity  22% Marketing  10% Development  1% Airdrop  5% Gaming  (get into the page to learn more about the mechanism!)✦ Initial Liquidity Pools (LPs) for farming SPENT tokens:Reward Distributions:✅ Add Liquidity: Competitive Fee✅ Farms: shares APR starting 52.1428 %~104.2857%(may vary on Liquidity added in Pool)✅ Stakes: shares Rewards starting 126.67%~150%(May vary on staking amount and duration)Get your LP tokens (Espento Liquidity Provider Tokens) HERE.SPENT incentives (Additional mechanisms)StakingStack your SPENT with Espento Stake.✅ Up to 150% of eUSD stable tokens will be distributed to STAKE holders every day. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.✅ SPENT holders can swap SPENT for eUSD, and BUSD at the current price.✅ SPENT is distributed proportionally at each block based on STAKE holdings.✅ We will only record and distribute SPENT rewards to the wallet address that initiated the SPENT staking. Only the initiating address will receive the STAKE rewards.FarmWe’re keeping the specifics close to our end because this is a totally new technique that no one has implemented yet, and ours won’t be ready until a few days after farming begins, but:✅ It will be enjoyable.✅ It will introduce a deflationary aspect to SPENT distribution via a novel reward model, giving you the possibility to earn a lot with a little.Keep an eye out.Other bits and pieces:Espento Info/Analytics — in the worksEspento DAO — will be started soon after the farm and stake are completely launched.Lending-Borrowings­­­ — Espento provides its whitelisted users with a one-of-a-kind Lending-Borrowing experience. It is a one-of-a-kind smart contract that allows users to lend and borrow in order to provide a reliable source of revenue, with lending and borrowing rates defined by the amount borrowed by users. Savings in excess of the required amount are collected from the lenders and given to the borrowers.Audit : As stated in the site’s notices/disclaimers, Espento is presently in BETA and has not yet been audited by certified third parties. You use it at your own risk.What does the Espento team get?We think that value, therefore the right and reason for being “paid,” must be earned.It is possible that the community will opt to award us (The Espento team) with SPENT tokens in the future as a thank-you for giving value to SPENT token holders, keeping our commitments, and so on.For any queries, don’t hesitate to reach out to us on:https://espento.com/View & Join us onBe sure to follow us on: 1️⃣ https://twitter.com/espentoofficial, 2️⃣ https://telegram.me/espento_news, 3️⃣ https://www.reddit.com/r/espentoofficial/, 4️⃣ https://medium.com/@espentoofficial, 5️⃣ https://discord.com/invite/7BUJ9UTBgE, 6️⃣ https://www.facebook.com/espentoofficial, 7️⃣ https://www.instagram.com/espentoofficial  and 8️⃣ https://www.youtube.com/@espentoofficial",
