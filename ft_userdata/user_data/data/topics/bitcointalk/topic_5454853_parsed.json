I will advice that you should stick with trusted Dex, there is a way you can lose your assets connecting your wallets to any Dex you find online, some are scam so they will ask for extra permission when you want to connect to them, read very well before you approve any permission.",

Even its on eth network or other L1 or L2 as long as its fees arent that high and the dex is smooth then its good for me. Plus they supported a lot of tokens that are crosschain with other L1 since that could be very useful to me as I love to do some liquidity protocol on some dex. Bonus if they have a bridge cross chain function.",

Check if the decentralized exchange have terms of service. If they have, you need to read it. From reading it, you will be able to know how truly decentralized exchange they are. But if I will advice you, you can go for decentralized exchanges like Bisq. Other decentralized exchanges are not decentralized entirely but somehow centralized.If you want some other decentralized exchanges, read the link that Coyster gave above: https://kycnot.me/But the link is more about no KYC exchanges. The highest ranked ones are decentralized, especially Bisq which is the best among decentralized exchanges.In a decentralized exchange, you should try and know the coins they support and the fiat they also support. You should try and know about their trading volume also.",

They should have about three levels of decentralization;• Decentralized servers,• Open source codes,• Non custodian wallets.These are the key factors that make an exchange a DEX and ensures they are not interfering with the transaction or the user privacy in any way.After this you consider their mode of operation (how they mediate between transactions), ease of access or use, customer response, terms of service, liquidity etc.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on June 02, 2023, 05:32:02 PM[https://kycnot.me/ You can rely on this site as a search tool, but do not trust the platforms listed on it.

This is a big win for Dex.We still need to be picky though, as some DEX are not reliable too, make sure you understand the modes of operation of the DEX you decide to use, I have few in mind that are better than others, some DEX are not completely decentralized, for example, the popular dYdX, this DEX is not true Dex in my opinion.  I prefer the following, Traderjoe, Perpetual protocol, pulseX, Apex, Syncswap.",

A reputable DEX like Uniswap when it was still a popular DEX had lots of volume in every asset that's being supported by the exchange. Correct me, but DEX don't ask for KYC right? I'm not using it TBH that's why I'm not aware that much. A DEX with high reputation has high liquidity on it's assets. You don't want to put your money into a DEX where there has little to no volume in it right? At the same time, you don't want to put your hard-earned money into a DEX that has little to no users as well. A reputable exchange = more trustworthy than a new DEX.Well, there are some factors that might affect a person's decision in looking for a good DEX but overall, I think these 2 are the most important factors.",
