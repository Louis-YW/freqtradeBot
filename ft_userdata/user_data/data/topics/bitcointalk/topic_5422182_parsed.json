      "body": "Asking price really varies to your experience, quality of the output, and the time you spent making the design/layout.If you are offering this to your local area i mean your current client, i would suggest to inquire first to the local graphic artist (like a client to them) offering layout/logo on your area. I know there are lot of them making business there.If it's an online client and you'd be as a freelancer. I think you should refer the other offered price in any freelancer site which is really cheap. If you think your output is way more quality than other freelancers you could ask starting $50 to hundreds of dollars.But that's just my opinion with a bit research. You could ask these people if you want to (also if they will answer you), jayce, Maus0728, bubbalex",

Why don't you show your work here?Do you work with front end, or just logo?Maybe you should try to expand your abilities and try many types of designs,  maybe even create a website to show your portfolio. Working for free is a good idea, specially if you need a portfolio and experience. I created the website in my profile just to learn, it was like working for free. A few months later I joined a bigger projects and made some bucks.",

Also, words from you guys and research(which I did before starting this post) helped me.",

      "body": "@PX-Z. Thanks for the mention. I am very sorry for the late reply as I am busy doing academic workload this past few weeks!When I received my first commission, they gave me roughly $100 for a complete logo without any revisions. The logo was utilized for a chicharon business that is still operating today. Suppose you're curious about how I arrived at the price range. In that case, I consider the client's budget, the estimated time it will take me to complete the logo, and the materials I utilized to create the project (e.g., rent, food, software license).You also need to take into account the cost of living in your country, though, because sometimes there is a tendency that you will underestimate your pricing, especially if you live in a 3rd world country where products and services are commonly cheap as compared to others. Quoting such a price is difficult, but sometimes the trick is to trust your gut feeling, especially when you understand the ins and outs of the business.As of now, with my 4 years of experience in doing some freelance logo design(not my main niche), I roughly estimate the price range for about 400-500 USD with revisions. But that's only for the base price.",

      "body": "I know how difficult it is to estimate a price for your work.Here in my country I am sure the prices are different than yours, and each country has its own price, it can vary a lot also from city to city.In my job I have a lot of contact with people who work with design and we talk a lot.The big truth is that you will need to figure out your own pricing, I often see that teachers and other professionals base their pricing on prices that don't match reality, so there are many colleagues who work little and charge a lot. Just as there are colleagues who work hard and charge little. I believe that the ideal is balance between both.Start with small companies and local businesses. Research the prices they are charging in your city and on the internet. You may at least have a place to start.Within time you will be able to estimate your price according to the difficulty of the job.You will sometimes make mistakes and end up charging too little and having too much work, but it is normal.I know the answer you are expecting is a price, like 50 USD or 100 USD but I hope I have helped at least a little bit.Edit: Just to say I do design but I don't sell, I use only in my business as a way to generate value for my main product.",

Since you are in the fourth year of your college, you should focus on developing your portfolio and for this, you can make free logos too.However, i would suggest taking 5 dollars initially as that is the minimum for orders being placed at Fiverr. You can visit Fiverr and see how much the logo developers are asking for a logo. Remember, that the more experience you have, the more you can charge for your services.Quote from: bitmover on November 23, 2022, 12:57:04 PMI created the website in my profile just to learn, it was like working for free.

Then for the pricing it shouldn't be your priority first but after much efforts and practice have been put on any work or design which you chooses to design then post and confirm your ratings from users here as well, and if you must remain being busy with work you have to charge less for the start maybe after much request of your design work then you may gradually increase your pricing and pay rate.",
