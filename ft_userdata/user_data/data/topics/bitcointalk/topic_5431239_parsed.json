I'd say 98 out of 100 users used it exclusively for these two uses. Basically, no one is using bitcoin to buy things. I believe Satoshi Nakamoto intended to create not a speculative asset, but rather a new financial system that people can use on a daily basis doing peer to peer transactions.",

      "body": "The truth is the number of people keeping btc as a speculative asset are more than those using it for day to day transactions. To me, I feel what is really missing is awareness and understanding of the entire network. Of you take El Salvador as an example, despite the government has legalized btc as a legal tender, majority of the citizens aren't warming up to the idea of using it, why is that? Probably because they still lack the knowledge to fully utilise btc. So I think awareness is really lacking.",

The market price is too volatile for 'normal' people to handle especially those who are anxious or worried of things. While to investors of this technology, many hesitates to use Bitcoin and ither cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment for daily transactions simply because they don't want to lose money; spending during kow market prices could vreate permanent loss which pushes then to just hold it for possible market recovery. Same thing goes during bullish market trend wherein investors are also having hesitations to use it as payment or not because of the tendency to earn bigger profit if the market prices would continue increasing.",

That is the difficult part because the collapse of the dollar will take some time. We probably need multiple recessions until most people start looking for alternatives and we probably will benefit from recessions every couple of years. The collapse of banks and the general feeling that people are losing out by using fiat. Bitcoin is ready and has been ready for years we just need that driving force to convince people to learn btc. I think the documentation and the features we have are ready for mainstream adoption.",

I am an Asian (Indonesian) citizen, and it is true that my government is quite friendly to crypto, especially bitcoin and has never banned trading. Governments have rules about legal currencies, so bitcoin is not one of them, so to this day bitcoin and altcoin are only legalized as trading and investment assets.

Governments were made to represent the people of that country they were elected to look after the population. Taxing Bitcoins is expected and probably within Satoshis vision. Bitcoin was not made to completely replace everything and evade tax. It was made for a alternative that is more free then fiat and that is still true. If the governments banned self custody then that would be a problem but they have never done that. A lot of governments only tax btc when it is converted to fiat and that is them taxing their currency and not btc directly.",
