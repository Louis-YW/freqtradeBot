The city is already developing a robust regulatory framework, which could see it take the lead in crypto adoption.HongKong is related to China, and it's said on that article that expect a huge influx of money coming from the Chinese people. Well, I guess this is what will happen. Expect more money coming into the crypto market. This news alone already made Bitcoin's price go up again, but unfortunately it can't surpass still the $25,000 price resistance.",

But the difference is Hong Kong want to regulate Bitcoin, but they're not accept Bitcoin as a legal tender. But many journalists are exaggerating this news and it make people think it will give huge influence towards Bitcoin adoption. Some people even confuse between China and Hong Kong, they think China wanted to accept Bitcoin again after they completely ban it, but it's not and China is still ban Bitcoin.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cryptocurrency_by_country_or_territory#Hong_Kong",

Hong Kong could gain a lot of business, especially with cryptocurrency.For the cryptocurrency market, I am positive there will be a lot of new platforms that will start to pop and most of these are backed by Asians, Chinese particularly and I believe these projects could have a potential next unicorn company.Take note that most of the top cryptocurrency exchanges were born in Asia just like Binance, so for me, bullish!",

What do you guys think will happen to Bitcoin?A pretty good step taken by Hong Kong in legalizing bitcoin, because in the future the Hong Kong community can buy, sell and hold bitcoin as a long -term investment asset in the country, another positive impact of this legalization will have an impact on the cryptocurrency business and a new platform Starting developed, because many companies in this field will place Hong Kong as a new destination in the development of both.What is certain is that positive values will continue to be in contact with the legalization carried out by the Hong Kong government and certainly the person involved in the investment will increase with legal certainty about the legalization carried out by the Hong Kong government. But what must be underlined the Hong Kong government does not receive bitcoin as a valid payment tool.",

But it is a positive news for Bitcoin when we can see that many countries have begun to see the potential of Bitcoin and accept it. Not only Hong Kong, I hope that this year we can hear much news like this, many countries will accept Bitcoin, and countries that ban it will soon remove the Bitcoin ban.

It is just regulated, but if this is some sort of making Bitcoin legal, then I think it will have the same impact as other countries that legalize it; it will make more users of bitcoin, more buyers, and also more holders at the same time. We also see a bitcoin sticker stating that they will accept bitcoin as a payment method. It could possibly affect the price, but not to the point where you'll reach ATH.",

The content contained in the proposal outlines SFC's plan to legalize individual retail investors to trade crypto assets on government-licensed crypto exchanges.Source: https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1627587806590799872?t=p-NjtkZSs_Ijz04KuYgPrg&s=19No one can resist technology, initially countries that once looked down on Bitcoin, finally gave a place to exist in their country.

They just banned certain things in China like mining and even less things in Hong Kong where people are still mining bitcoin.So it depends on what \"legalize\" means in this context. The regulations they put in place will determine their effects. For example it could be positive regulations for exchanges and mining farms which means it would attract a lot of investors from China and possibly elsewhere to build the industry there.",

It was In, 2018 when  Bitcoin trading in Hong Kong  was only restricted to top professional traders or investors with a very high portfolio. And this reduced the amount of investors coming into the country as not all of them could meet up with such requirements given by the government of Hong Kong. It will only affects their country in a positive way because individuals with low investment capitals can now take part in cryptocurrency trading activities and not left behind and also give way for more investors to come in.",

In addition, there is also talk about \"Asian currency-based stablecoin\", which is a scenario that has already been seen in many cities around the world that have used \"Bitcoin\" to actually promote their tokens/stablecoins. And finally, I wonder how China will react to such decisions, because regardless of its status as a special administrative region, the communists in Beijing will not be thrilled that such things are happening on their doorstep.However, considering the current situation in the China - Russia - US relationship, I assume that CP's focus is elsewhere.",

In September 2021 Salvador declared Bitcoin legalized and every people in Salvador spontaneously started using Bitcoin for their daily activities. Although the majority of the population of EI Salvador was against legalizing Bitcoin. As Hong Kong is going to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, Hong Kong is taking this step realizing the far-reaching value of Bitcoin.",

However, despite being a country in Asia, Hong Kong, which is dominated by China, has launched the Digital Yuan announced by the China Central Bank in Hong Kong. Although China directly and indirectly bans cryptocurrencies, it is a matter of concern how reasonable it is for China to support the legalization of Bitcoin in Hong Kong. However, the people of Hong Kong will not oppose the legalization of Bitcoin, rather they support Bitcoin.",
