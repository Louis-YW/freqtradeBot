Why did you choose to partner with a company that has such a bad reputation? There are plenty of reputable casinos out there. But while the world of online casinos is diverse, it's still important to do your homework. There are dozens of different factors to consider when choosing an online casino, from software, to security, to reputation. And you'll want to be sure that when you choose a casino, you're choosing a safe and secure environment for gambling.",

      "body": "Better not to use a gambling site that has no active threads again on this forum. I checked Bitstarzis official thread on the gambling board, it was last active in 2016. That was 6 years ago. Best to use those with active official thread on this forum. You can always check gambling board for that. Especially, those with active official account.Also supposing you checked Bitstarzis official thread on this forum, you would have later noticed the red flag and negative trust against the gambling site which is enough as a warning of not to use the gambling site to gamble.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 02, 2022, 09:41:25 AMCould you show any proof where they say VPN is allowed? Their ToS doesn't mention whether it's allowed or not allowed.I checked their ToS, there is nothing like VPN is allowed or not, but there are many countries that are not allowed to gamble on the site. I expect the site to block the IP of the countries if they do not want to be a scammer. Because of that, some people may use VPN.It is not good to use VPN on gambling a site, it brings suspicion and can lead to the gambling site to scam even people from the countries that are allowed. That does not mean Bitstarzis not a scam site though.",

I don’t see on the video that they allow the use of VPN or approved your request as Israeli in Colombia. Maybe this conversation is on your email and providing there official response that giving you approval will be a good evidence to your case. I understand that you want to become to play safe but sometimes scammy use this against the user itself once they won in there casino since there ToS will protect them to justify there action towards user like you that citizen of restricted country.Bitstarz has a bad reputation here in the forum. I doubt that they will your concern on this forum.",

You are only allowed to use a VPN if you are from a country that is not on the restricted list. Since you revealed with your KYC data that you are an Israeli citizen, they concluded that you used a VPN to bypass the country restriction and therefore violated the terms of service. Since you have already asked them if you can use their casino from Colombia, you did not need to mask your IP location with a VPN. I do not support the casino at all, since their reputation is bad anyway, but I am just saying that you would have a better case if your IP address matched your physical location.",
