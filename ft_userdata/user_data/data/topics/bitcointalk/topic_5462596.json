      "body": "Trading, seriously said, will cause loss for most traders. The Price Alert Notifications will bring more real time price pings that will cause more pressure and you know, pressure is not good for your trading.The more price alerts you get, the more pressure you will have and very possibly, more losses you will make from your tradings. It is worse because most of people who use price alerts are amateur, not professional traders so price alert effects will be more negatively.",

You don't understand the Op so you are talking out of point, what you are saying is different from the op. And this clearly shows that you are posting for your signature campaign weekly quota. The Op is talking about how to receive notification when the price of bitcoin goes up and down and here you are talking about trading loss. Traders can use the notifier if only they are offline. And also to monitor the stop plus and take profit of the trading and that nis when they are going offline for a while or they are busy doing something else.",

It's purpose is to keep us updated all the time.We're quite like the same, I am also a hodler so I'm aiming for long term so price notification is just not too useful for me, it will just annoy me but for some traders maybe it is very useful and convenient for them.",

And that is why I also recommended to you after the first time I used it to get the alert. I expect that you have a lot of free time or have constant access to the trading platform so that you can place orders after reading the notifications. Otherwise, these notifications will represent more psychological pressure because you will not be able to access your device every time the price notification is available.Trading automation is best done by trading bots, which guarantee you much better results than receiving real-time notifications.",

It's strange if their emotions get disrupted by receiving such price information. isn't a trader's strategy planned from the start?.. so, dealing with volatile prices shouldn't affect professional traders.
