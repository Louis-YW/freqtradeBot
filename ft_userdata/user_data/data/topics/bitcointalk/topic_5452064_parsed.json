  "content": "So I just created a video on my TikTok ( I am not a famous TikTok creator, I just upload some videos on my account ), I created a video regarding my trading gains, it's just a clip of some of my gains from 6 months and I am so thankful because there are so many who appreciate my posts, comments and dm me in my TikTok accounts, what more for those influencers with many followers in their TikTok accounts or any social media accounts, which is a great medium to promote cryptocurrency. These are the common questions I've got from some of my viewers1. How do you earn money from trading?2. How to trade or invest?3. Can you help me have those gains as well?Conclusion: I just realized that there are still a lot of people in our country who are interested in crypto and willing to learn, I also promote this forum to them, especially to those users who asked about cryptocurrency. Hopefully, they are now here and comment on this post.Some only want gains and not to learn about crypto, they only want an easy success without knowing how risky it is.",

You got this much feedback just because people like newbies who have only this idea \"trade is just buying low and selling high\" and when they saw your videos they will think, this shouldÂ  be my sensei, he knows the tricks he(you), because he is gaining profit in all of his trades.I know, you have no intentions to misguide them or use there doubts as in your own benefits, i just want to point out that we should not only show the good of market while we should show the bad of it too. So that they would know the true nature of it.",

This is just the advice I can give you.Yeah, I agree. A lot of people see Bitcoin just as a gamble where you can get a lot of money fast, but it's necessary to tell those who are interested that BTC is a long-term investment if they want to use it like that. But it also can be used as currency.",

      "body": "Not to generalize but I think some of those people who asked how you earn money aren't really interested in crypto. Since they've seen your video where you gain money, they want to earn money as well probably thinking that it's sort of easy money. But if you'd try to tell them how it works and teach them the basics in entering crypto trading, I don't think all of them are really willing to explore. TikTok can be a great medium to promote Bitcoin since there are a lot of users and your videos can appear on their screen even without them following you. But I feel like a lot of people there can easily be convinced with something due to hype but won't really do their own research. However, I won't be against if you want to use your platform to educate about Bitcoin. It would be great as well if you are willing to create more videos explaining Bitcoin cause you could help others who are really interested to learn. Just don't forget to remind them to do their own research.",

This is just the advice I can give you.Agreed. Tiktok, being the popular way to show off short videos these days, would seem to be a great way to spread Bitcoin awareness with short concise educational videos about Bitcoin, as long as you make them interesting.And yeah often when someone asks me how I retired early and I say Bitcoin they almost inevitably mention the word gambling and I'm just like omg no I invested there is no gambling lol. I guess people's line of thinking is \"investment I don't understand\" -> risky -> must be gambling",

Many of the so-called influencers have been shilling any crypto-related projects like those P2E games when it was still popular. Some of them even \"teach\" trading like they were some kind of guru during the last bullrun even though it's somewhat obvious they were just new to the game. Many of them promoted scams too which led to many newbies losing more.",

      "body": "I appreciate your efforts in trying to make crypto popular.However the common audience in tiktok and other social media channels are the younger generation who has less money making attitude and more of a get-rich-quick attitude. The diligent investors are not going to visit these channels to waste their time rather use that for their own education, career development and personal finance, including own crypto investment.Be sure to put crypto in an unbiased light here, showing its pros and cons and why it is not a get-rich-quick scheme. But the problem of this approach is that you will lose viewers because the people lost interest. Instead of you take the path of lies, showing off your gains and promoting shitcoins, more people will come in because you just promoted their \"bubble\" of thought of easy money. That is how influencers who spam these stuff work and make money.",

Yes, mate I dont have misleading intentions with that video that is the first time I uploaded a video regarding crypto, I just created that video not to drag but just to share my gains and make people interested in cryptocurrency. I also told to those people who dm me about the risk of trading or investing in crypto so dont worry about it. If we have to promote something we should only indicate the positive of these things but then we should not let them not know about the disadvantage of it.",
