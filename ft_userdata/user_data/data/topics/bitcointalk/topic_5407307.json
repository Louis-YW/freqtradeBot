The better question is, does this board will have same activity after no signature casino campaign?Obviously it wouldn't since most users wouldn't post as much as when they're joined a campaign, some users might abandon their accounts. If a campaign doesn't have any rules to post in specific boards, they will spam in other boards where there's no strict moderators there.If anyone want to see how this forum without a signature campaign, you can check serious discussion or off topic boards.",

There are some threads here that attract a lot of viewers and replies. For example the big football tournaments, or the basketball and cricket threads would all still be active without the signature campaign posters. The sub forum here is a good way to talk about upcoming matches and see how other gamblers are betting on them. I got good tips from the forum that made me decent profit over the years. Overall I still expect the number of post to go down and we would also see less new threads being posted. Most people would probably post in their local boards more instead as it's easier to write in your own language than in English.",

There are traffic in those boards because of the signature campaign we join, 90% or 95% of signature campaigns on this forum are gambling signature campaigns, as the people are not posting on gambling board, so they will not also post on bitcoin boards too.",
