In short, this is what i said in the other thread.Quote from: logfiles on May 05, 2023, 12:50:23 PMLooks like there was an internal dispute between the owners, lolI didn't know about this, but it now seems to make sense.So apparently, the CEO Ray Youssef reigned from Paxful but is now working on a new \"P2P electronic marketplace\" civkitAnd?If we recall the letter paxful customers got about the shutdown, the recommendation was to use noones. So it's more like a breakaway from Paxful after a possible dispute, and now the other parties are trying to fight back by opening the platform again.I would avoid using the platform completely.",

The problem is that their old method has become useless with fierce competition from services such as Binance, Kucoin P2P, so it is better for you to wait for another month and see if they made radical changes and were in a positive direction then. You can go back and use that exchange, otherwise you will forget about it and it will slowly die.The criterion for success is the number of advertising their buying and selling ads.",

P2P exchanges are not centralized.Paxful is P2P since the platfrom is not creating the trade orders or set prices, its where the buyer and seller choose whatever they want and the platform collects flat1% fee and also I am encouraging the use of decentralized p2p like Bisq but with my case the volume for the order I prefer is absolutely zero and I created an offer it just sat there for very long.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on July 19, 2023, 02:06:11 PMI have been keeping an eye on the numbers from monetory.io since the shutdown of Paxful (after most users switched to the platforms listed there) and it doesn't look like people went back to Paxful.I am only deal with bank transfers and it's only with the members that I trust also I can see there is no declining in the demand, I am just afraid that if I don't move in back at right time then I am concerned those traders I usually trade might move to others.",

It is unlikely that Paxful will turn into scam, if there are trusted users and multiple possibilities to buy and sell bitcoin, why not, at least the Paxful is old and you can find ratings from several years ago, but the new platforms require users for years to build their trust profile, or you will depend on that You are trading outside the platform and therefore the risk is greater than the possibility of being scammed.I'm glad they're back again, the more options we have to buy bitcoin is better, Binance dominate the crypto market and this absolute dominance is not a good thing.",

If you want to sell your coin, only release the coin from escrow after you have seen the money the buyer send to your account. If you are the buyer, fast to report if the seller is hesitating to release coin after you have sent the money. I am referring to newbies.For gift card, it is normal on gift card exchanges that a card has been used which will lead to something like scam or not scam. One thing I have hate to do online is to sell gift card. I sell only bitcoin and stable coin like USDT.Because of what I saw on the link that you give us above, I will say that people should not use Paxful again if the issue is not about gift cards.",

How Paxful will know the person that is saying the truth between buyer and seller, I do not know. This is one of the reasons I avoid anything about gift cards. But you can check buyers and sellers that are trustworthy on the exchange with users positive and negative ratings.For bitcoin and other crypto P2P centralized exchanges, there are other exchanges that are good.

However, this does not negate the fact that there are many successful transactions, and even the complaints of the referrals may not be dealt with objectively if the seller is reliable and the reviews regarding him are positive.This makes deals always questionable, and despite that, Paxful has maintained a high activity rate, especially in the field of gift cards. The reason is simply that the platform supports almost all countries, including countries that are not supported by some gift cards themselves. Freelancers in many countries can only get paid for their services through gift cards, which they can only sell and get their local currency on Paxful.",

In my opinion, it was never wise to stop the platform's services due to disagreements between the work team or their lack of agreement on a specific decision or step. This will cost them a long time to gain trust again, and the most important thing is to convince users that what happened will not happen again.I do not know what alternatives are available to Paxful services, so I encourage users to verify and do the necessary research before venturing into using the platform again or leaving large sums of money on it.",
