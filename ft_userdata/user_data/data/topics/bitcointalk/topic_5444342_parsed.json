You create a transaction by entering the receiver's address (that is created using their public key) and then use your private key in your wallet to \"sign\" that transaction. The receiver will do the same when they want to spend those coins and that creates a \"chain\".Quoteq.2 . What are signatures that we use to verify the transactionBitcoin uses ECDSA and ECSDSA for its signature algorithms and they are found in all transactions you send using your private keys.Quoteand what is PGP signatures,at many places i seen that, begin pgp signatire- end pgp signature,PGP is an encryption and signing algorithm that used for encrypting messages (in Emails, files, etc.) and for creating signatures which you would mostly see when you want to verify the authenticity of a file (like a wallet's binaries).",

      "body": "Forget about technicality, first grasp the concept.Block chain(central bank).Nodes(bank's branches).Private key(you).Public key(bank account).Signature(your signature when opening account and transferring).Public key cryptography has extra features/functions.I send money to your bank account(public key) only you can spend the money.Now replace money with a message, I send(sign) a message with your public key, only you can read it because you(are) have the private key. PGP, is a close source application, GPG is not, regarding bitcoin they are irrelevant.Picture you posted is a technical explanation to show how we can replace banks safely where everyone could make sure about the legitimacy and authenticity of transactions.",

      "body": "Quote from: odolvlobo on March 13, 2023, 12:13:51 AMIn general, a signature consists of a public key Signature does not contain the public key. The signature scripts in bitcoin transactions usually come with a public key.Quoteand a hash of the message that has been encrypted with the private key.There is no encryption being done in message signing.Encryption is the process where you create a \"cipher text\" which can then be decrypted using the private key to get the original message. However, in a signing operation we should already know the message and the verification is done using the public key.The operations are called signing and verification not encrypt/decrypt.QuoteThe public key is used to decrypt the hash,As I explained. Also in any decryption algorithm you use the private key to not the public key to decrypt.",

It is possible to create a valid signature, where the private key will remain unknown.

Note that it is possible only for cases, where key recovery can be used, so it cannot be applied to Taproot.QuoteSignature does not contain public key.I would argue that R-value of the signature is always a valid public key. Of course, it should be different than the public key connected with that signature, because if d=k, then it can be easily calculated by anyone.",
