  "content": "ASSURED: Archiving Secure, Safe, Uninterrupted Relay, Ensured DeliveryAbstractASSURED is a peer-to-peer decentralized system designed to ensure secure, guaranteed future message delivery. It leverages blockchain technology for data integrity, distribution, and encryption, with mechanisms to prevent various exploitation forms. The system is designed around a user-friendly interface where users can set up events for future message releases.1. IntroductionWith the increase in digital communication, the need for secure, reliable, and time-bound message transmission is paramount. Traditional centralized systems fail to offer the resilience and security provided by decentralized systems. ASSURED, an acronym for Archiving Secure, Safe, Uninterrupted Relay, Ensured Delivery, aims to fill this gap. It is a system that allows users to set up time-bound events triggering the release of pre-saved encrypted messages. The system guarantees the delivery of these messages, even in the event of the original sender's absence or inability to send the message manually.2. System Overview2.1 Decentralization and BlockchainASSURED uses a blockchain-based system, where every node in the network keeps a record of all transactions. This decentralized approach ensures the system remains resilient and secure against various threats. It also avoids single points of failure, ensuring the system remains operational even if individual nodes go offline.2.2 ShardingTo further enhance security and to prevent any single node from having all the information, ASSURED uses a technique known as sharding. Each message is broken down into smaller fragments or shards, and these are distributed across the nodes in the network. No single node has all the pieces of a message.2.3 User Interaction and Message ReleaseUsers interact with the system via a user-friendly interface. They can set up their email address, a message of up to 1000 characters, and up to five recipient email addresses. They can also set a release date for the stored message. Starting two months before the release date, the system contacts the original author of the message every three days, giving them the options to cancel the message, extend the delivery date, or view the message.2.4 Nodes and RewardsUsers who want to schedule a message need to run a node. Nodes receive a reward of 1 ASSURED token every 10 minutes. This reward accumulates and can be used to pay for scheduling messages. Alternatively, users can purchase tokens to schedule messages if they don't wish to run a node. The fee for scheduling a message is 2880 ASSURED tokens, equivalent to running a node for one month (30 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 1 token/10 minutes).2.5 Encryption and Private KeyWhen a user schedules a message, the system generates a unique private key. This key is used to encrypt the message, and the user is given the key. The key is not stored or shared with the network, ensuring only the user (or anyone they share the key with) can decrypt the message.3. Security Measures3.1 Exploitation PreventionThe decentralized nature of ASSURED, combined with sharding and encryption, makes it extremely difficult for a user to exploit the system. Even if a user managed to take a group of nodes offline, they would not be able to access complete messages because the data is sharded across the network and encrypted with a key only the user possesses.3.2 Activation ThresholdThe system will only activate when it has 200 nodes to ensure enough redundancy and security from the start.3.3 Fees and RewardsTo discourage spam or misuse, setting up an event requires a fee. The fee can be earned by running a node or can be purchased. This mechanism encourages user participation in maintaining the network and helps maintain the value of the system's native tokens.4. Potential Exploits and Challenges4.1 Sybil AttacksIn a Sybil attack, an attacker subverts the reputation system of a network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. A Sybil attack is a significant risk in any distributed system. In ASSURED, we mitigate this risk by implementing a Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (PoET) mechanism, which requires nodes to wait for a randomly chosen period before they can validate a transaction or create a new block. This mechanism makes it computationally and financially expensive to create multiple fake identities.4.2 Shard ManipulationWhile sharding provides many security benefits, it also introduces new potential exploits. An attacker could try to control all nodes that hold a specific shard. This is mitigated in ASSURED by the system randomly assigning shards to nodes and frequently reassigning them.4.3 Centralization RisksAs nodes require resources to operate, there's a risk that only a few, resource-rich entities might end up running the majority of nodes, leading to centralization. This is mitigated in ASSURED by making the node operation lightweight and the rewards for operating a node attractive to a broad user base.4.4 51% AttacksIn a 51% attack, an entity gains control of the majority of the network’s computational power and uses it to manipulate the blockchain. This risk is inherent in any blockchain system. ASSURED mitigates this risk by implementing a Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (PoET) consensus mechanism, which doesn't purely depend on computational power and makes such attacks more difficult.5. Use CasesOne of the main use cases for ASSURED is in the creation of a digital \"dead man's switch\". For example, a user could store their digital wallet information in the system with instructions to release it to their family members at a certain date in the future. The private key for decrypting the message could be shared with the family members or stored in a will. This ensures that even in the event of the user's unexpected death, their digital assets can be accessed by their family.6. ConclusionASSURED is a robust, decentralized system for guaranteed future message delivery. It leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, security, and resilience against various threats. Although there are potential exploits and challenges, ASSURED is designed to mitigate these through various mechanisms, including sharding, activation thresholds, fees and rewards, encryption, and a Proof-of-Elapsed-Time consensus mechanism.While it's impossible to predict and prevent all potential exploits, ASSURED is committed to continuously improving and updating the system in response to new threats. The aim is to fulfill the assurance of secure, reliable future message delivery.7.

      "body": "QuoteHow is ASSURED helping the bitcoin network. ASSURED indirectly benefits the Bitcoin network by providing a means to combat the ongoing issue of Bitcoin losses due to unforeseen circumstances like the death of the owner. By introducing a secure, reliable mechanism for the future delivery of critical information, ASSURED allows Bitcoin owners to share their wallet details with trusted individuals at a predetermined time, without needing to disclose it prematurely.Over time, the accumulation of Bitcoin losses from situations like these can have a noticeable impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem. While it may not be possible to prevent all such losses, the ASSURED system can significantly mitigate them. By allowing for a planned transfer of Bitcoin access information, ASSURED helps ensure that more of the Bitcoin supply remains accessible and in circulation, thus contributing to the overall health and sustainability of the Bitcoin network.QuoteWe have appreciated the help of LN in faster and cheaper bitcoin transactions. Why is assured placed in same category of LN as a subsidiary to bitcoin.  It seems you didn't capture that in the article above.You're correct. While ASSURED isn't a direct extension or subsidiary of Bitcoin, like the Lightning Network, it has an important role in the broader context of Bitcoin's long-term sustainability.As we know, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized and pseudonymous basis. This lack of central authority and personal identification means that if a Bitcoin owner passes away without leaving their access keys or wallet details to someone, their Bitcoins can become permanently inaccessible. These losses accumulate over time and can impact the Bitcoin ecosystem by effectively reducing the active supply of Bitcoin.Traditional financial institutions have mechanisms in place to handle inheritance and the transfer of wealth when someone passes away. Bitcoin, given its decentralized nature, lacks an inbuilt mechanism for this.This is where ASSURED can provide significant value. By offering a secure, decentralized system for future message delivery, it enables Bitcoin owners to securely store and schedule the release of their wallet information or recovery keys to trusted individuals. This can act as a sort of digital will, ensuring that Bitcoins aren't lost if something happens to the owner, thus indirectly contributing to Bitcoin's overall stability and longevity.QuoteThe segwit wallet can solve this problem and also bitcoin timelock transaction is there to help.SegWit (Segregated Witness) is a protocol upgrade that changes the way data is stored in Bitcoin transactions. It primarily helps increase the Bitcoin network's capacity and speed but does not directly provide a system for future, guaranteed message delivery.Bitcoin timelock transactions can indeed lock Bitcoins until a specified future time or block height, but it doesn't provide a mechanism for message storage, scheduled delivery, or recipient notification.ASSURED, on the other hand, is specifically designed for this purpose. It provides a user-friendly platform where users can securely store messages, schedule their delivery to specific recipients, and ensure delivery even in the event of the sender's absence. The system also provides periodic notifications to the sender and options to cancel or delay the delivery.",

      "body": "QuoteHow does node run for the average user?It would be no different than running a current Bitcoin Node, hardware, Assured Client, and internet connection.QuoteI mean what exactly requirements does he need to run a single node?Here's a phased approach to the hardware requirements for running an ASSURED node, considering various growth stages of the network:Phase 1 - Startup (0-18 months):    Traffic: Low, initial users and early adopters.    Usage: Minimal transactions, mostly test transactions and initial users' events.    Hardware Requirements:            CPU: Dual-core processor            Memory: 4GB RAM            Storage: 100GB SSD            Network: Stable internet connection with at least 5Mbps speed.Phase 2 - Growth (1.5-3 years):    Traffic: Moderate, adoption starts to grow as the platform gains recognition.    Usage: Moderate increase in transactions as more users join the network and create events.    Hardware Requirements:            CPU: Quad-core processor            Memory: 8GB RAM            Storage: 500GB SSD            Network: Stable internet connection with at least 20Mbps speed.Phase 3 - Expansion (3-5 years):    Traffic: High, widespread adoption across multiple regions.    Usage: Significant increase in transactions as user base grows.    Hardware Requirements:            CPU: Octa-core processor            Memory: 16GB RAM            Storage: 1TB SSD            Network: Stable internet connection with at least 50Mbps speed.Phase 4 - Maturity (5-8 years):Traffic: Very high, the platform is well-established and widely used.    Usage: High volume of transactions, with many users actively creating and receiving events.    Hardware Requirements:        CPU: Sixteen-core processor        Memory: 32GB RAM        Storage: 2TB SSD        Network: Stable internet connection with at least 100Mbps speed.Phase 5 - Global Utilization (8+ years):    Traffic: Extremely high, the platform is globally utilized and has a massive user base.    Usage: Extremely high volume of transactions, with a global user base creating and receiving events.    Hardware Requirements:            CPU: Thirty-two core processor or more            Memory: 64GB RAM or more            Storage: 4TB SSD or more            Network: Stable internet connection with at least 200Mbps speed.These are obviously estimations and actual requirements may vary based on many factors such as optimizations in the ASSURED platform, changes in blockchain technology, and variations in user behavior. As the network grows, more nodes will be present, distributing the load and making the system more efficient. Additionally, the 1000-character message size can be reduced, if deemed to excessive, to reduce the storage requirement and bandwidth usage. QuoteIs it possible to run more than one node?Yes, and there are a few benefits to this, which include:    Resilience and Redundancy: Multiple nodes run by the same entity can increase the resilience and redundancy of the network. If one node fails or goes offline, others can continue to participate in the network.    Network Support: More nodes can help support the network by processing transactions, maintaining the ledger, and contributing to the consensus process.    Increased Network Coverage: If the nodes are geographically distributed, they can help increase the network's coverage and accessibility.It's important to note that all messages stored on the blockchain are encrypted. This means that even if an individual manages to gather all the fragmented pieces of all the messages stored on the system by running multiple nodes, they would still be unable to decipher or access the content of these messages.QuoteAlso you say: \"The fee for scheduling a message is 2880 ASSURED tokens, equivalent to running a node for one month\" How much does this cost in bitcoins or dollars? The cost in Bitcoin or dollars for scheduling a message would be dependent on the current market value of the ASSURED token. As the system is hypothetical and not live, it's impossible to provide a precise conversion rate. If we were to use the model of Bitcoin as a rough guide, early miners earned 50 BTC per block when the value of Bitcoin was very low. Now, those Bitcoins are worth a lot more, but the cost to mine them has also increased significantly.QuoteDo you see it logical that the fee for scheduling one message is equivalent to running a node for a whole month??!!The fee structure of the ASSURED system is designed to incentivize the running of nodes, contributing to the overall health and security of the network. By making the cost of scheduling a message equivalent to the reward for running a node for a month, the system encourages users to participate in the network and maintain its operation.This model ensures that those who want to utilize the service are also contributing to its maintenance. It's worth noting that these parameters (the fee for a message and the reward for running a node) could be adjusted over time as the network grows and evolves.It's also important to note that users don't necessarily have to run a node to schedule a message. They can purchase ASSURED tokens from others who have earned them by running nodes. In a functioning market, the price of these tokens would be determined by supply and demand.Maybe a month is too excessive. As I stated, the community can weigh in, and we can collectively determine the reward period.",

Let's say you become ill and your family members needs money for your treatment or in the event when you die? The primary function of ASSURED is to provide a platform for secure, reliable, and time-controlled message delivery, which has numerous potential applications beyond the release of Bitcoin funds. However, due to the nature of the platform (secure, decentralized, and time-controlled), it lends itself particularly well to the use case of \"unlocking\" cryptocurrency funds in the event of the owner's incapacitation or death.Quote It can also be helpful with scheduled payments of regular expenses, for example the monthly fixed payment of streaming providers and/or VPN services. The ASSURED system, as it's currently conceived, is primarily designed for the secure storage and timed release of messages, not for facilitating transactions or recurring payments. While it's conceivable that a user could include payment information or instructions within a message, it's important to note that the system itself does not interact directly with payment providers or perform transactions.However, the concept of automated, timed payments is certainly a relevant one in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency. There are other blockchain projects and platforms that are designed specifically for this purpose, providing smart contract functionality to automate payments based on specific conditions or timeframes. Ethereum is the most notable example of this, with its built-in support for smart contracts.While the idea of expanding ASSURED's functionality to include scheduled payments may seem appealing, it's important to clarify that the underlying architecture and security model of the system have not been designed for this purpose. Thus, the ASSURED system should not be used to facilitate scheduled payments.",

      "body": "QuoteDoes that mean ASSURED can be categorized as Bitcoin's sidechain?No, not exactly. However, integrating ASSURED as a sidechain to Bitcoin could potentially bring several benefits, but implementing a sidechain involves a significant amount of technical complexity. It would require careful design to ensure secure and efficient operation, vs just having it operate on its own dedicated blockchain. QuoteI fail to understand how decentralized system could send email. Does this rely on full node operator to run email server?In the ASSURED system, we implemented two types of nodes to foster a robust, decentralized network:Simple Nodes: These nodes contribute to the network by validating transactions, maintaining the blockchain, and participating in consensus. For their contribution, they receive ASSURED token rewards as per the protocol's reward schedule.Full Nodes: These nodes not only perform all the functions of a simple node but also run integrated email servers. They have the additional responsibility of dispatching stored messages to traditional email addresses at the specified release time. To incentivize this added functionality and responsibility, full nodes receive extra ASSURED tokens each time they deliver an email.This dual-node structure encourages participation from users with different levels of resources and technical expertise, promoting decentralization. The additional rewards for running a full node incentivize users to take on the task of email delivery, ensuring the reliable dispatch of messages.The ASSURED protocol would be designed to distinguish between simple and full nodes, to allocate rewards appropriately, and to direct email delivery tasks to full nodes. The protocol will also have safeguards to ensure that full nodes accurately report their email delivery activities and do not claim undeserved rewards.ASSURED will aim to avoid relying on any centralized or third-party services for email delivery, staying true to our commitment to decentralization. This framework will allow ASSURED to offer a secure, reliable, and decentralized messaging system.",

Thank you for your feedback. You have some misconceptions about ASSURED and its purpose. ASSURED is not a competitor to Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Rather, it's a separate project that complements the existing blockchain ecosystem by providing a unique service not currently available. The goal is to provide a decentralized, secure system for scheduling future message releases, not to serve as a financial system or currency.Here is a breakdown to help you better understand it:Different Purpose: Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ASSURED is not primarily a currency or a financial system. Its primary purpose is to provide a decentralized, secure system for scheduling future message releases. While it does use a token system (ASSURED tokens) to incentivize node operation and to set the cost for scheduling messages, these are secondary features, not the main purpose.Not a Replacement for Bitcoin: ASSURED is not meant to replace Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. It is a separate project with a distinct use case. It complements Bitcoin by providing a service currently unavailable within the Bitcoin ecosystem, specifically, the ability to securely store and schedule the release of messages.Not Overburdening the Chain: ASSURED will have ZERO impact on the Bitcoin network, and the design would avoid overburdening its own network. The sharding mechanism ensures that the data is distributed across the network, preventing any single node from becoming overwhelmed. The reward system incentivizes the operation of nodes, promoting a healthy, robust network.",
