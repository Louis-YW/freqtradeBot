It's just that it's very difficult when you invent something that after 20 years it's exactly the way you planned it.

The decentralized aspect of bitcoin, resistance to inflation,,seen as a store of value,bitcoin halving and limited supply has sustained bitcoin all the way from 2009 till date.

He was explaining in simple sense how bitcoin price works. Hence, it doesn't sound as seeing the future, yet its a prediction that took one side, which is the large transaction volume.

We can see now people are talking about tackling high number of incoming transactions and surely there needs to be some change in the block size if we assume Bitcoin will be the main stream payment mode because for now TPS of Bitcoin is only around 7 to 8 which is no where near if we compare the payment processors like Visa which can process 24K transactions per second.",

You expressed yourself incorrectly. Satoshi didn't see the future, but created this future.Also, you made a mistake with the interpretation of Satoshi's quote. I think he meant that 20 years later bitcoin will be in demand and will be used (which is why the volume of transactions will be high). Otherwise, bitcoin will be of no use to anyone and will not be used at all.In one thing, you are right that 20 years have not passed yet and we still can't verify the relevance of Satoshi's statement. In general, the figure of 20 years should not be taken literally.I think that Satoshi's quote has nothing to do with the current situation with high commissions, with which OP is trying to find a connection.",

Alot has been said than done over the years already so I feel the big digital currency still owes the world its complete renaissance,...
