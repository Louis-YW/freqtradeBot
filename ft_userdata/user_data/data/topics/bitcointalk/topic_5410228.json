Instead of running round and doing some nonsense u got to create the system what empowers you.Those who run now world as federal reserve and etc did same they invented something in times of crisis thats why they are wealthy and good now.If you do nothing in times like this the crisis then blame only yourself later",

I don't think that's a good solution, those sectors that you've mentioned won't even agree to what to you're saying.They're all dependent to the governments economy and they don't have to be a stand alone and just create their own tokens and support it by those people who are running those sectors.Things will be just going to be confusing if there will be that much tokens or coins just as what you're saying if each of the industry has it.",

I think op is not even referring to industries,  but to our individual selfs,  like me and you,  op is saying that we all should individually create our own coin so as to build and have our own economy and be rich.But my question to you @op,  if every single one of use create a coin, that is -All the farmers create their coin individuallyAll the welders create their coin individuallyAll the fisher men, the boat engineersThe painters,  the web developers,  the graphic designers, the transportation workers,  the delivery guys,  hair stylist,  the barbers,  the meat sellers, the landlords,  even the bad boys on the street that have no form of handwork or business etc.If all this people create their own coins individually,  who is going to be buying the coin,  which exchange will the coins be listed on?The truth is that, not everybody will be rich,  yes,  no matter what,  there will always be poor people, as unfortunate as it sounds,  it the simple truth,  there can never be a world where everybody is rich and no poor man anywhere.",
