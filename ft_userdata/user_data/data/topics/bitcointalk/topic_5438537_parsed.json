  "content": "The past few days has been an emotional one for the people of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria as earthquake hits the duo city. According to Turkish authorities, 3,419 people have died as a result of the earthquakes that were centered in southeast Turkey, raising the total death tollâ€”including those in northern Syriaâ€”to more than 5,000. The earthquake was severe to the point it brought down buildings and a lots of people trapped inside. The magnitude of the tremor as estimated is about 7.8.Â Our deepest sympathies are extended to the people of Syria and Turkey during this trying time.https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/earthquake-death-toll-turkey-syria-surpasses-5000-2023-02-07/?taid=63e21b461b86500001ad2e6f&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter",

Life is not fair sometimes, one of the the worst things is that this came out of nowhere. Nobody had a warning about this, nobody could prepare for it, nothing could be done.Mother nature is so cruel at times, this reminds me of the Tsunami that took so many lives years ago.

Prayers to the citizens of Turkey and Syria. Coming up with any kind of conspiracy theory here would take stupidity and ignorance really to the next level, but I get you. It wouldn't be surprising either these times. So before anyone really decides to come up with some insane theory, better get familiar with seismic fault lines, how they work and please explain how someone might have influenced anything... The worst thing is the constantly growing number of victims. Every time I refresh my news ticker the number goes up significantly. This is a disaster. It is not even certain at this point whether more impactful earthquakes are underway. They have had hundreds of smaller ones just within this short period of time. It is good to see though that the world seems to be sticking together and everyone is willing to help.",

      "body": "A devastating earthquake struck both Turkey and Syria last Monday, in a humanitarian catastrophe that the two countries had not witnessed in decades. According to the latest news of the victims issued today by international news agencies, the death toll exceeded 26,000 dead on both sides, in addition to the collapse of more than 6,000 buildings and the displacement of no less than 5 million people. It is a human tragedy by all accounts.As usual, the countries of the world mobilized to provide assistance to the affected people, since the two countries are already suffering from economic difficulties.Turkey has been living in an economic crisis since years, and it is hardly trying to save its economy in light of many international variables, including the global energy crisis after the outbreak of the Ukrainian war. The elections are close in Turkey, and the earthquake will certainly affect the results of the vote, in light of the accusations of the Turkish government of failing to rescue and compensate those affected.Syria has already been suffering from a civil war for 12 years, and its economy cannot bear such environmental disasters, especially since the country has been living under Western sanctions since the outbreak of the war, and there are no real capabilities that can be relied upon.",

Turkey and Syria is located in crossroads of 3 tectonic plates - Anatolian, Arabian, and African plates. They touch and interact with each other and it's tectonically active area. Unfortunately, this region always will be at risk of earthquake, and there is not much what human can do to. Here more detailed article explaining it:https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/two-earthquakes-turkey-syria-predicted/Countries located in such dangerous regions should follow Japan example. They have very strict requirement for buildings and it can withstand earthquakes. Even skyscrapers!",

Just a few minutes ago there was a new 5.1 aftershock.Meanwhile, 258 hours later another person was pulled out of the rubble alive. More people would've been saved had the rescue efforts started earlier and more organized. What happened is very sad but we'll overcome this.",
