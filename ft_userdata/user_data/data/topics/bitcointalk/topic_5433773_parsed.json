The price of bitcoin today is $17000 and he said the price will go down $17000 more. That only means that the price of bitcoin is going to zero. But if that happens, he needs to wake up and see that he is only dreaming and not in reality. He said bitcoin has no value, he did not know how bitcoin has helped economy, making poor people to become rich. Because of bitcoin, blockchain was created, helping the world. Countries are now making use of blockchain today. If not for bitcoin, there may be nothing like crypto exchanges today, see the tax the government are generating, also from other crypto businesses. See what people are generating from mining.This so called analysts that has nothing good to offer about bitcoin just said bitcoin has no intrinsic value. If you do not know about something, why lying to the world?",

Sometimes it backfires when they say a bunch of nonsense that shows how little knowledge they have and how illiterate they are.I don't really know who this guy is and after looking him up, he is claiming to be a \"geopolitical strategist\" and after looking into that it seems like he doesn't even have any actual knowledge in that field lol.",

The analyst claimed that the number one digital asset by market capitalization is now being priced “more appropriately.”Zeihan also argued that the “whole idea of economic activity is that there’s expansion, which means you need more currency to lubricate and manage that expansion. ”The analyst argued that if a currency’s supply is locked, there will be monetary inflation and this could “destroy an economic model.”Zeihan is a geopolitical analyst and author which is doesn't have any relation with Bitcoin, I think his brain already get washed by government since he's prefer to use an unlimited currency e.g. fiat. Talking about limited supply will case monetary inflation and destroy an economic model isn't make sense, actually the unlimited supply will cause inflation since when there's new currency exist to the circulation, it will make the value of the currency will decrease.Although the tiny size of Bitcoin on chain is satoshi, but if you use lightning network you can send a milli or micro satoshi.",

Now that they know it can't collapse they want to regulate it and also spread their cbdc's to see if people would be more interested in it than BTC. I have stopped listening to people who think BTC has no value, it proves the person as one who speaks without research or understanding.",

Because of bitcoin, blockchain was created, helping the world. Countries are now making use of blockchain today. And you're going the opposite way, instead of criticizing praising bitcoin but still, making quite hard to believe claims.Bitcoin helped poor people become rich.How, by buying low and selling high? Then we can argue that Telsa made poor people rich also and is a global benefactor and is challenging poverty all over the world. So did Apple and so did Microsoft. Besides, bitcoin is not an apple tree that grows and gives you more and more apples, when we refer to only the ability of making you rich you need to buy low and, sell high, and selling high requires somebody with deep enough pockets to buy your coins, cause if there is nobody offering even one cent for your coins their value would be zero. And now, who has that ton of money to buy all these expensive cheap coins, the, ..hmmm rich! So not only is Telsa making the poor rich but also the rich are making the poor rich! See how this goes?Quote from: Oshosondy on January 10, 2023, 01:24:41 PMIf not for bitcoin, there may be nothing like crypto exchanges today, see the tax the government are generating, also from other crypto businesses. See what people are generating from mining.This is like reading a press release from BAT or Philip Morris claiming how much in taxes they generate!Simple question, if instead of playing with 1000$ on Binance and paying tax on my possible income I would go to a grocery store and spend that on food, would the government lose money, or would they take that 9% in VAT? When you're closing a ski resort it doesn't mean the government is losing directly money, cause those people will just spend it on something else, they will not burn it just because they can't ski, they will simply redirect it to another service provider.Bitcoin works great for personal finances, it works great for your own safety, and your needs of privacy or security, but at a large scale it can't make everyone rich, and it can't turn a failed country into a prosperous economy on its own and more importantly, it can't make it rain money in everyone's pocket!There is a huge difference between personal level finances and diving into macroeconomics!",
