That is in a normal country, if we talk about NK style, that's different!",

I guess it's possible if they will acquire at least 51% of all Bitcoin hashing power. Anyone, as stated by stompix, can fork Bitcoin.  They don't need 51% of the hash.  They just need to modify the code and create their forked version of Bitcoin.  Earlier altcoins are forked from Bitcoin.  So yes Balckrock and central bankers can fork Bitcoin.Quote from: Ecomm1 on June 24, 2023, 12:09:25 PM1.

For example, one can affect Bitcoin's price by banning bitcoin mining, by investing in Bitcoin (like Blackrock), by tweeting a things about Bitcoin by influential people, like Elon Musk did when he created a hype around BTC and then tweeted some bad staff about it.Bitcoin can be 20K, 100K or 3K or any number in 5-10 years.

( How are changes to BTC created ?)Like said above, anyone can fork bitcoin. Blackrock can fork bitcoin, they can also create their own coin but in the end, it will be meaningless if no one other than them support it. Also, if BlackRock manages to acquire a lot of bitcoin, it will increase bitcoin's price and at the same time, if they fork and move on PoS Bitcoin, no one is stupid enough to follow Bitcoin that is led by BlackRock.

Too many to consider just to get to the ROI. It sounds interesting when you see the calculation and projections on how quick the ROI and high the profit may be but all of those are just projections.Quote from: Ecomm1 on June 24, 2023, 12:09:25 PM3.

They'll just have their own version of Bitcoin as an altcoin but they can't change the real bitcoin's POW into POS.",

The reward is fixed, as mentioned by others, the current reward is 6.25 BTC and the next halving will make it 3.125 BTC. Network/transaction fees will be unchanged.2. Not as far as I know, as historical price movements will be tremendously different to previous price movements.

Is there a good calculator for ROI and estimated rewards ( per day ) that calculates 5-10 years in the future or allows an input for estimated future value of BTC ?3. Will BlackRock and the central bankers be able to fork BTC into a proof of stake coin? ( How are changes to BTC created ?)Thanks,RonThe most annoying question is the no 3, Bitcoin is forever a PoW algorithm coin and nothing can reverse the engine again, it's over and too late for anyone to do this, not even Nakamoto can reverse the engine anymore, newbie I think you should start doing your own research on Bitcoin because your question is so off that it show that you haven't read a single thing about Bitcoin before making this post.Bitcoin is fully decentralized, do not expect what happened to Ethereum (abandoning PoW for PoS) will ever happen to Bitcoin, Ethereum was wired in such a way that the founder can tampered with whatever they want and change it to their own will, but not Bitcoin, if that's what you mean.Bitcoin has so many forks in the past like Bitcoin white, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin cash and so on, they introduce faster transaction speed and other few things, but Bitcoin still triumph over them all.",
