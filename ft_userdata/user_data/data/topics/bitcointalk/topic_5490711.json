I don't understand how you got such profit, because you said that you were trading and hodling at the same time. That is wonderful to se how much profit your strategy gave you. I prefer hodling than trading, because I am not a good trader, so I don't want to gamble with my bitcoin. However, every investor that took the opportunity to invest last year was would be in profit by now because the price of bitcoin have really surged high. If you continue hodli till next year you will make more profits compared to what your bitcoin have generated now. But if you continue trading, you mightÂ  lose all your funds.",

We can definitely earn a lot of money from Bitcoin long time Holding, we just need to hold long term without panicking. There is a lot of risk in trading, all the money can be lost because of a small mistake in trading. But if we do this long-term holding, the possibility of profit from here increases a lot, if the holding is long-term. It is possible to make a lot of money from long term holding in bitcoin, if we start long term holding now using DCA method it will give us huge profit in future, because we all know that bitcoin will cross 120k in next bull run and it will don't stop there will go further. So we should start holding now we can definitely build a much bigger portfolio in future.",

Even if you want to take passive income from the increase in the price of Bitcoin every month, I think it's very possible.It's true that you won't be able to get big profits in a short time, but it won't make you miserable in the future.",

Just a few months you got a profit of 1000% of the capital is a good achievement, if you want to sell I hope you are wise and spend back on bitcoin, because after halving this year in my opinion it will still be brilliant. Actually, addiction is because the brain responds more: easier, lighter, more income in expectations. Although it is easier to go bankrupt if you are too obsessed.The difference between investment and betting is quite far, but sometimes desire and overconfidence cause the effect of haste and inappropriate steps even though the goal is fun. Detect as early as possible the potential for loss and detect which ones can benefit. your steps are right.",

Hence, I think this story is to be tagged unreal until O.P provides more proof.However, with regards to the relationship about Bitcoin and gambling, I will say Bitcoin remains the best asset for one to spend his/her money on, unlike gambling where he has a 50/50 chance of either winning or losing.",

Gambling brings death to people because here if you win you gain and if you lose you lose your entire bet amount. But after investing in bitcoins if the price of bitcoins falls then if you can hold them patiently then you will recover your loss and if you can patiently wait till the new ATH then you can earn a lot of profit it is true and it is very effective. for this it is better to invest in Bitcoin by following DCA method.",

You started your Bitcoin journey with $100, perhaps you adopted the DCA approach, which has grown your investment portfolio by a lot and you own a lot of dollars. The link to the post you shared was dated September 2023. From there, about seven months ago today, you made that post and started investing with your $100. It's impossible to start investing with $100 and grow to $1130 in seven months because the price of bitcoins has increased from there, but you will never go from $100 to $1130 unless you deposit your bitcoins regularly or every month. You may have deposited your bitcoins every month for which your investment has grown.You invested your money in Bitcoin for which you got success but your friend chose the wrong path due to which he lost his money. So we all should consider the right path and then use our money there. If your friend had chosen to invest in Bitcoin instead of gambling, he might have been as successful as you. Bitcoin has changed many people's lives in my opinion. If you invest in Bitcoin and hold it for a long time, success is guaranteed.",

If you have been holding $100 worth of bitcoin for the past 5 months, you wonâ€™t have gotten that amount of profit, and if you claim to be a trader, I donâ€™t know the strategy which you used to accumulate that amount of profits.

No matter how big the profit boy is your talent, you must invest and never lose patience but hold on. If you gambled like your friend, then surely you can never wish your bright future to lose your money. And gambling can never give a man a good future, rather he will lose money and become an addict.
