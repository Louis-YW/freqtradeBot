These people are talking about the bull run in the context of how much it would pump bitcoin's value and increase the worth of their cryptocurrencies. Sure there will be people who would cash out of the cryptocurrency hype train but that doesn't mean everyone will. That's stupid. Everyone's going to be holding their bitcoins for dear life once the bull run comes in hopes of actually earning more by biding their time. That's how it has worked out in the past and that's how it will work out now. There won't be any reinventing of the wheel that will happen here.",

Dollar-cost averaging is another option for building up your Bitcoin holdings over time, independent of the state of the market. In the end the choice should be based on your particular financial condition and goals.",

And looking at the past performance, the price difference between bull market and bear market is quite big, so in the past selling all coins wasn't a risky decision if you sell late during the bull run. The biggest risk in selling all coins is that the price will keep going up and never fall down below that level ever again. To avoid this it's better to not sell early in the bull market and wait for the bull market to mature.",

You may sell during the bulltrend and buy on the dip; the market price won’t continuously increase in a consistent manner. However in such way, you’d stress out with every market price movement but will be able to maximize the profit. You may also just hold until satisfactory. Think of how early investors are at advantage right now problem only is waiting for years, but if you can manage to do so then that would be good. Creating partial selling and holding would also be an option however you would have feelings of regrets depending on the market price movement; if the market price continued to increase upon selling some of your asset and if the market price would suddenly fall which leaves you at the middle and without knowing when will recovery occur.",

It's a good idea to sell your Bitcoin during bull run because after a bull market we will see another bear market. Who knows in the next bear market Bitcoin may go as low as $50k or $55k and if goes that low then you can buy more Bitcoin during the next bear market.I think it's not worthy to hold your Bitcoin during the bull market as they can drop in value when bear market starts. At some time we will have to sell off some of our Bitcoin and if you really want to hold your Bitcoin for longer term then you really don't have to sell those Bitcoin during bull market. Some investors are thinking about holding their Bitcoin for long term and those investors basically hold their Bitcoin for decades and they really don't care about the conditions of the market. Those investors think that Bitcoin could reach values as high as $5M to $10M and their belief is so firm that they will never sell below those values.",

Of course you will sell but selling all is not a bad idea you sell all you will get a decent profit, and the bitcoin cycle will definitely be bearish again after the bullish time has passed, can you believe this? The decision is nothing wrong you can start again and accumulate again when the decline or bearish.I - currently do not have a decision which one to take, but will do some variations that have been targeted before but now prefer accumulation rather than thinking about the bullish still long enough.",

It's best not to be too hasty and have to wait for the highest price or close to the highest price to sell your Bitcoin, and the most important thing is that you have made a profit of more than 50% from your holdings.I talk like this because everyone has different plans and strategies, and the most important thing is that you don't sell in an unfavorable situation. And you can buy it back when the market is bearish, and the question is whether the price of Bitcoin will fall significantly because buying back Bitcoin below takes quite a long time.

If your target is just to get to the next bull market when Bitcoin reaches a new ATH or something. So selling at that time will indeed be quite good because you will definitely have a big profit. And then wait for the bear market to return to start accumulation again.But if your investment target is much longer or you have a target price, then as long as the target price has not been reached then maybe holding on to it is not a problem. But that means we also have to be ready to experience market waves again, which of course will always be a correction after an increase. There is always a bearish after a bullish. I personally might sell some when a new ATH is formed. And start accumulating again when the market really becomes bearish again. Dwyor",

However, I agree with you that selling all bitcoin assets during a bull market is not a good idea considering that in the future the price of bitcoin will increase, and that is much more if an investor can hold some of their assets during a bull market. Selling gradually and not in a rush is a much better idea, while buying again continuously.",

If you don't sell your Bitcoin in the bull market, when do you plan to sell your Bitcoin? I don't think anyone is advising you to sell all your Bitcoin in the bull market, you need to understand the market first and see if the market will go more bullish before selling your Bitcoin. Normally we might not know what the market will do in the next minutes and if we go and sell our Bitcoin immediately, this is going to affect us of either selling too early or sell too late. We need to grab every opportunity and sell when we are okay with the market because greed will look always come to make us feel guilty of ourselves if we don't take decisions that tend to help us in a long way.",

Next bull run cycle usually take a year or more before the price starts to recover again.Your only concern when you sell all your coins is the possibility of FOMO when the price keeps going up. My selling strategy is usually through selling by batch like DCA sell so that I can average my sell price until the peak reach. There’s always a price correction which you can use to enter again if you to trade efficiently.",

This is purely your decision, which is best for you to make yourself. No one will give you the right answer until you find it yourself. You need to be guided by your behavior strategy. If your plans are to sell part or all of bitcoin during the hype, then do so. If you want to change your decision, if circumstances change, then change your decision. There are no clear boundaries or restrictions unless you create them yourself. You may not sell bitcoin at all during the next bull trend and sell much later. 1BTC still remains 1BTC, and intermediate price fluctuations are, of course, a good opportunity to speculate on the difference in rates and make money, but in the long term, if the hold is planned for many years, then the profit will still be noticeable even without these trading games on bullish and bearish trends.",
