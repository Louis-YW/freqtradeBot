Because I actually feel that I am a person who is still new to crypto and I am not proficient in trading crypto. in fact I also always say that I prefer to invest regularly in Bitcoin with scheduled installments. the point is I rarely do trading activity.so I decided that the person who sent the PM was just sending me random messages which he also sent to other users. so I always avoid responding to it.

I don't really give myself headache when I see such, the simple advise is not to click on the link sent to you because if you do that means you are directed to other places and your details reviewed which could lead to hacking of your account. Stay away by just ignoring to read or respond to whatever was said on the PM. Some solicit for financial support especially from countries that are in warfare but it may not be necessarily those countries because human beings are known to taking advantage of situation that are bad and pitiable to draw sympathy to them.",

It's always a good idea to seek advice from Bitcointalk communities since here fellow members may have had similar experiences and can offer guidance on how to handle it. If you're receiving unwanted messages that become more severe, it might be necessary to report the issue to the authorities. In such cases, I usually block the person responsible and report the message. Its best to ignore the messages and not respond to them.
