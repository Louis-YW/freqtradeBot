      "body": "With the recent fiasco with FTX, centralized exchanges like this one aren't so favorable nowadays. Many would choose DEXs over CEXs.Adding to the fact that there isn't a single visible person on the website that would even remotely represent whoever is running this site is kinda scary.You've got some good numbers here: https://btcworm.com/en/reserve/Although, there is really nothing on the website that proves that you guys own and hold those cryptocurrencies. Not even a link to a wallet holding it.The website is also just recently registered as well. June of this year to be exact.The main issue with your \"automatic and semi-automatic\" exchange would obviously be transparency. If you guys could tackle and solve that issue, who knows, maybe you'll grow your business, maybe even grow your user base and become a force to be reckoned with within the crypto world.",

      "body": "Not worth to use since they do have an AML policy they should only apply it to those who live in the EU countries, not to other countries or 3rd world countries.So I think they will ask for KYC verification before you can able to use their service which I think is pretty risky for a new website.If you are a legal exchange you must have a public location or building since you are applying almost all legal procedures from your exchange.",
