  "content": "Anyone else notice that if you wrap something that contains really long lines with [code] tags, that it'll look okay in the actual post, but if you browse your post history afterwards, it'll render much wider than the surrounding posts and throw everything out?Here's an example of what I mean: I recently posted some code that contained a few really long lines, here. If you look at that post, it renders without issue (i.e. that post doesn't render wider than the other posts in that thread). But, if you look (currently) at the first page of my post history, you'll see that the posts on that page are rendering strangely, making them difficult to read without lots of horizontal scrolling.I messed around for a few (very frustrating) hours trying to get to the bottom of this, and managed to come up with the following SMF patch:Code:--- /var/www/baseline/Themes/default/Profile.template.php 2007-02-03 15:55:14.000000000 +0000+++ /var/www/modified/Themes/default/Profile.template.php 2023-01-06 00:15:50.000000000 +0000@@ -341,42 +341,45 @@  if (!empty($context['posts']))  {   // Page numbers.   echo '    <tr class=\"catbg3\">     <td colspan=\"3\">      ', $txt[139], ': ', $context['page_index'], '     </td>    </tr>   </table>';    // Button shortcuts   $quote_button = create_button('quote.gif', 145, 'smf240', 'align=\"middle\"');   $reply_button = create_button('reply_sm.gif', 146, 146, 'align=\"middle\"');   $remove_button = create_button('delete.gif', 121, 31, 'align=\"middle\"');   $notify_button = create_button('notify_sm.gif', 131, 125, 'align=\"middle\"');    // For every post to be displayed, give it its own subtable, and show the important details of the post.   foreach ($context['posts'] as $post)   {+   // style=\"table-layout: fixed;\" was added to each subtable as a partial fix for code sometimes rendering too wide (see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432954).+   // This could also have been done further up the hierarchy, but this is a more natural place to apply the fix, and (surprisingly) produces slightly superior results, too.+   // There's a second (progressive enhancement) part to this fix, after this foreach.    echo '-  <table border=\"0\" width=\"85%\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"bordercolor\" align=\"center\">+  <table border=\"0\" width=\"85%\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"bordercolor\" align=\"center\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\">    <tr>     <td width=\"100%\">      <table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" class=\"bordercolor\" align=\"center\">       <tr class=\"titlebg2\">        <td style=\"padding: 0 1ex;\">         ', $post['counter'], '        </td>        <td width=\"75%\" class=\"middletext\">         &nbsp;<a href=\"', $scripturl, '#', $post['category']['id'], '\">', $post['category']['name'], '</a> / <a href=\"', $scripturl, '?board=', $post['board']['id'], '.0\">', $post['board']['name'], '</a> / <a href=\"', $scripturl, '?topic=', $post['topic'], '.', $post['start'], '#msg', $post['id'], '\">', $post['subject'], '</a>        </td>        <td class=\"middletext\" align=\"right\" style=\"padding: 0 1ex; white-space: nowrap;\">         ', $txt[30], ': ', $post['time'], '        </td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" class=\"windowbg2\">         <div class=\"post\">', $post['body'], '</div>        </td>       </tr>       <tr>@@ -391,40 +394,67 @@    if ($post['can_reply'])     echo '      <a href=\"', $scripturl, '?action=post;topic=', $post['topic'], '.', $post['start'], '\">', $reply_button, '</a>', $context['menu_separator'], '      <a href=\"', $scripturl, '?action=post;topic=', $post['topic'], '.', $post['start'], ';quote=', $post['id'], ';sesc=', $context['session_id'], '\">', $quote_button, '</a>';    if ($post['can_reply'] && $post['can_mark_notify'])     echo '         ', $context['menu_separator'];    if ($post['can_mark_notify'])     echo '      <a href=\"' . $scripturl .

That's the first thing I tried, too (on the <pre> element though, not the <div>; I'm surprised doing that on the <div> had any effect for you). The problem with that approach (i.e. just adding white-space: normal; to the CSS) is that it collapses whitespace (in a browser-dependent way), which is obviously not ideal for preformatted stuff (like source code). white-space: pre-wrap; is a little better, but that still introduces line breaks, which I'm not convinced won't end up sometimes affecting copy/paste on particular configurations/systems.So, the approach I took was to leave the default white-space: nowrap; on <pre> elements alone (so that content is presented exactly as authored) but still find a way to size them as if white-space: pre-wrap; was being used (see the patch for details).",

Edit: Okay, all done.The approach that this patch takes may seem a little complicated to some (when compared to simply changing the CSS forum-wide to use white-space: pre-wrap; on the relevant elements), but I think the extra complexity is justified. I considered, tested, and then abandoned that (much) easier approach early on, because although it works (superficially), I don't like the line breaks that it inserts into code (I'd prefer to stick to the established way of presenting \"wide\" code on Bitcointalk, with scroll bars instead of text wrapping).",

I diff my patches (out of necessity) against SMF 1.1.19, so I imagine that it takes some effort on theymos' side to work around the differences between stock SMF and his heavily-modified version. I'm planning on submitting a 2FA patch soon, and that one will probably take substantial effort to massage into place.",

(dislaimer: there may be a problem with very wide images without width-tags, but that barely happens)Of course, a real fix is much better. Even without managing a campaign I often check someone's post history (including my own) to find back a post.What I should have said: lol@Full member  Rank up first",

I should cool my jets.It's not rational, but I just feel like I have to make up for lost time. It feels like I've missed out on all the good stuff, you know?I marvel at the quality of some of the technical discussion from years ago, and I'm sad that I missed that era of the forum.It also seems like my kind of contributions (i.e. programming-related) would have found more fertile soil 6 or 7 years ago.I'm also a little salty that (with more foresight) I could've been quietly stacking sats all this time.",
