Not minding the poor state of its educational sector and the low level of importance ots given, there is a need for the education of every Nigerian youth of proper age.It's never compulsory anywhere that once you are out of school, you get employed by the government or some other private entities out there as, schools equips you to be an emoyer of Labour too. That's why eve as a professional, your thought a general skill set so, you could afford some level of flexibility and can diversify. You can't afford being a stalk illiterate and expect yourself to compete so well in the larger world. Yeah, you can do well even as an illiterate but, you'll still need professionals to aid you in your management system.Education is a necessity.",

There were super rich as well as people who are striving for a day's meal. A big volume of wealth is accumulated into the hands of few people. Education is a big problem, along with the same it has got corruption probelm which is the reason why there is big difference between the rich and the poor.

It's because after graduation, it seems the the students needs more experience that's why they are extended and be qualified. Others try to work abroad and migrate because the job force is not enough here. Nevertheless, we still valued our educational system and everything starts from the government.",

But school is needed to help in exposure and going through schooling can result to self-esteem. Education in Nigeria is very cheap which is also where one of the problems come from including the government that do not focus on education, ASUU do strike up to 6 months at times and this can be another 6 months or more stike, ASUU and federal government are only there to waste the time of the future of tomorrow.But because of this, we should not think not going to school, schooling is important to bring exposure.",

You are right that the education system is in shamble, all institutions shut down for close to a year, this is very bad. However, we don't have to lose hope. Education better our lives personally and not the government, so whatever means we can get it, lets not wait for the government. The private schools are there although owned by same politicians holding the youths and country to ransom.Education is necessary and learning to read and write can never be wished away. I believe the nigerians here are able to read and write because they have some level of education. Education therefore is not irrelevant in Nigeria despite that jobs are not available now but favour is still around.",

Since you live there, obviously the situation will be much better understood as a whole how the education system in Nigeria works. However, globally in the realm of the resource-based education system, it is a development that is adapted to each particular region. For example, increasing the growth of natural resources around by utilizing available facilities. The government is reluctant to tackle this on the same scale. This means that only certain regions are selected according to the proposal and the limited education budget.Talking about the education system in a country, we cannot make the education system of another country a benchmark or equal. So usually they or the government in the field of education design curricula based on education units (elementary, junior high, high school, and university).Rooted in the problem of education, we often look at it from the point of view of Finland's educational achievements. Because they are the only successful pilot country in providing education. Despite all that, I believe that every country has the same rights and obligations as other countries to get an education. It becomes constitutional and mandatory for citizens to experience the same education, teaching, and achievements and be treated in the same way to achieve the ideal educational goals.Including Nigeria, a country that can develop in the next 20 years, depending on how the government reacts, its seriousness, or full involvement in preparing productive human resources.",

Education is definitely the most powerful tool that a country has to becoming richer and more successful. The higher education you are and the people around you, the more innovative ideas are bound to sprout. If the education system is poorly designed and unable to cope with the needs of the population that is a whole other story, although I suspect there are some very good schools in Nigeria, but the majority might be underfunded or have incompetent teaching staff. Teaching is a very tough job at the best of times, but in poorer countries it is even harder as the really knowledgeable teachers are bound to flock into other professions than face the stress.",

I find this so because the situation mostly is that the children of government officials and even children of people in charge of the education in the country do not attend government owned schools in the country, and most times are flown abroad to attain their educational degree. As a result, just as our failing healthcare, education has been neglected, making it look like it is no longer important to be educated. That notion should be discouraged, regardless of how the government may have failed educated people in Nigeria in the form of no employment opportunity, making it look like schooling was a waste, schooling is only a waste when you go through school and do not get educated. Do not mistake schooling to be the same as education, someone can go through school and not get educated, education refines your thinking and equips you to be able to seek knowledge and process information in a more organized manner than one who is not educated, and school is the place to get educated.",

The lack of developed education in these countries is the reason why people are having economic issues most of the time. However, the problem OP mentioned about unemployment after graduation is not something only happens in Nigeria but this happens in many other countries because of many factors, most people who study in school even if they have good majors still don't anything about how the economy actually works in real life that's something happens in most on the countries and not only the Nigeria in different levels.",
