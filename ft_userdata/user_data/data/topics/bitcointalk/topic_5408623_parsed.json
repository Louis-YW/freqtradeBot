Lol that's obviously a lot easier said than done. There's a reason why trading in general isn't recommended for most people, and there's a reason why most people lose money trying to get in and out of positions.Decide on what asset you want to invest on, DCA(or possibly lump sum if you don't panic), then just be patient.",

I don't really buy Bitcoin, my accumulation \"scheme\" is to sell less or more from the coins I earn (from signature campaign or other tasks).So I sell less, pretty much based on my gut feeling and the needs of my household (for example last week I couldn't save anything, but a couple of weeks ago I've saved the full amount of the signature pay).Of course, in crypto winter I try to save more.",

EG dont throw entire months excess income into a FOMO . just put 20%-60% and then put rest in later if the speculation dies down and price comes down just a little bit. that way you can maximise opportunities better",

With DCA, you don't need to force yourself to do anything.If your salary is xxx amount, and you can spare yyy amount every week, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly etc. Then you exchange that amount you can spare for Bitcoin. To avoid laying multiple transaction fees, you can spread out the buys a bit more.Of course, during periods like when the price spikes up alot, you can hold on a bit from buying and when it dips, you can buy more.Waiting for more preferable markets between the above points (spike and dips) might not be very effective.",

First you need to understand mate that here we are talking about Bitcoins.Secondly see the marketcap and popularity of the coin.And then finally conclude that Bitcoins are very much value and due to its large marketcap, the price of the coin will definitely rise.So as of me, whenever I have some money to invest, i just buy as many Bitcoins as I can. I don’t look at the price. As Bitcoins are for long term. If I buy now, then definitely after 2 years I will be get 3 times the invested amount.Rest is up to you to decide OP.",

They often get stuck in the dilemma of buying bitcoins. I think first of all an investor should buy bitcoin with risk. Since Bitcoin is at its lowest level in several years, DCA is particularly appropriate at this time. Bitcoin may slowly move higher again so it is better to $19000-$25000 and hold it.",

Sure, you might get lucky and get it a bit cheaper if you wait, but you also might miss out on some huge growth and never see that lower price again.  Since, in my opinion, the long-term direction is for the buying power of bitcoins to increase, any delay only increases the chances of missing out. As such, in the long run, attempting to wait for a better exchange rate will only hurt your overall position.There is a very strong human tendency to think we see a pattern where one doesn't exist, and to believe we can take advantage of that non-existent pattern for personal gain.  This has been demonstrated successfully in experimentation many times. In one example a human is asked to predict which of two events (for example one of two different lights illuminating) will happen next.  When the experiment is set up for the events to happen completely randomly, with an 80% probability of one event and a 20% probability of the other, the test subjects believe they see a pattern (which doesn't exist) and they use that pattern to try and occasionally choose the 20% event and do better than 80% success rate. The result is, on average, humans guessing the correct event only about 68% of the time.  Meanwhile, when the same experiment is performed with animals (such as rats), they quickly learn (end up trained) to consistently choose the 80% event every time. As such, the animal making the reliable choice to continuously choose the option with the higher long-term average consistently beats the human that is trying to time his decisions against a random process.Trying to time an unpredictable market is similar.  You're going to feel like you can get it right often enough to come out ahead of those that just consistently get what they can when they can. You're going to remember the times when you got it right, and you're going to convince yourself that the times you got it wrong aren't significant or that you can learn from that event how to predict it better next time. If the failures don't devastate you and cause you to quit altogether, then the successes will fool you into thinking you're coming out ahead. Either way, in the end, there's a VERY HIGH probability that you're going to end up with less bitcoin than you could have had if you had simply purchased what you could whenever you could.",
