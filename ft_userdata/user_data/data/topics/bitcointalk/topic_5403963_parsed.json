One is the rise you're predicting, another would be a drop and retest of 0.054 - I'd take caution when trying to call these things in either direction if I were you. I think bitcoin has to do well price wise for alts to also do well so this is a speculation on a speculation.",

Yes ETH also plays an important role in the market, but the market will only follow when BTC climbs.Also this bear market might last more 4 weeks. So till that point of time, we will everyday see the market in red.This is the time we need to just wait and show patience, then everything will be fine.",

This could bebthe start of a relief rally. but i dont think so that will be oump towards ATH. expecting just a relief rally only. Just like in the old days, Altcoins will tend to follow as Bitcoin will do the pump. This was the sentiment that we are looking for now and quiet to say that we are near to it (pump). This is the reason why we don't be negative about the downtrend as to know that the market isn't always on the high level, it will also dump to give an opportunity. Now, as the market loos good and moves high, it will prove that the market is alive, not dead as many says. I don't see myself that I was relieved, it was just how the market moves, and expected moments.",

Are you not worried about speculating on it for when the eth staking stops (just in case large amounts of eth are dumped on the market over a very short space of time - it might not happen but I'd consider it quite a risk on most cryptocurrency's pricing).",

Again, you might be right (though I'm not betting on it), but you seriously can't make conclusions only based on this microscopic \"bounce\".That conclusion will only help him (perhaps) because so far not many people are really convinced to say the altcoin rally post bitcoin correction price to $17.7K has started. I doubt about the altcoin rally, this is probably a normal situation for the post-correction recovery trend. So since we still believe there will be two sides to consider, then not betting is a good option.",
