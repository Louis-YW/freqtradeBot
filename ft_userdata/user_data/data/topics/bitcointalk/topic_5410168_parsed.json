Is this about the old issue of centralization when it comes to merging of new code changes? Or is the problem not naming a successor?I was just reading about the possible reasons for quitting and it looks like he's really burnt out. Whatever it is that made him leave, I don't think it's that big of a deal for the community and overall Bitcoin development. There are still few code maintainers and one of them could take the lead role. There are also hundreds of open-source developers or contributors if I am not mistaken.Those guys at bsv are probably happy about this since the fake one also harrassed Van der Laan.",

That's pretty impressive commitment from Van der Laan.It looks like he wanted to decentralize developing ability so that less relied on a single individual.He was starting to delegate more tasks to others since Jan 2001, according to his blog: https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.htmlQuoteI realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.",
