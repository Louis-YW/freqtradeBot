  "content": "Hi,I have just signed up with Kucoin as there are a couple of altcoins I want to purchase at these extremely low prices we are currently seeing and hold for the next 1-2 years.Up until now I have just used Coinbase which I have found pretty easy to use, you can just buy the crypto you want and hold but looking at Kucoin now is it only available for trading or am I missing something? I just can't see a quick way of buying crypto like you can on Coinbase. I just want to buy about £200 worth of each altcoin and hold, I don't want to trade.",

      "body": "Kucoin is just a standard exchange like Binance, which you have the opportunity to buy the altcoin at Spot Trading[1]. As for deposits, as far as I know, you can deposit fiat currency through their supported payment channel[2] in addition to using stablecoin[3].The only caveats here is that you must go through the KYC process and that purchasing cryptocurrency is not as simple as using Coinbase. It would take some time to understand how Spot Trading works and how to deposit fiat from available banks or payment gateway.[1] https://www.kucoin.com/support/360015207073-How-to-Make-a-Trade-on-KuCoin[2] https://www.kucoin.com/blog/kucoin-launches-fiat-account-for-crypto-purchase-with-usd-depositEdit: Most likely, you are going to trade using Spot. Spot is basically buying or selling an asset without leverage just like the traditional buy and sell in stock market.",

Kucoin however I have to do this through Spot trading?Because you want to buy and after that keep it for a long period then you have to do spot trading and after successfully the trade, withdraw the coins and save it in a personal wallet where you have access to PK (Private Key) don't ever trust CEX or any 3rd party to save your funds for a long periods, most likely you can lose all your coins.",

There are lot of listed there and you could choose any trading pair like with BTC but make sure you have the right choice of coins as you are investing £200 for each of them for long term :So if you are interested in having the information you have the links above or you could check it on YouTube for such videos for step by step guide like this one  But keep in mind that if you don't want to trade them then keeping them on exchange is very risky so it's better to have hardware wallet for them like Trezor or Ledger Nano but depending on the coin they support so make sure about it.There were recent rumours about kucoin becoming insolvent but the CEO denied the rumours about it just letting you know so if you come across this information.",

They have a direct conversion of token or coins from usdt without using spot trading. But actually its much easier to use a dex since you will automatically swap the tokens you wanted to buy. Why not try to learn the function of dex ( decentralized exchange) also its not a centralized so you wont worry on being hold up or locked of funds. Im confident though that the tokens you are interested with is listed as well on dex.",

Buying many altcoins in bear market and hold? I call it as suicide.From past bear markets, most of altcoins lose more than 95% to 99% of its value from ATH. Most of them die in bear market and developer teams abandoned their projects in bear markets too.Historical snapshots from Coinmarketcap shows you that top altcoins can die too. So think of it, and see what altcoins you are considering to buy? Even they are top altcoins, they are not completely safe.",

Kucoin is like any other exchange that you get to buy from the sold coins of others in the spot market. While Coinbase, it's like a wallet exchange that you can automatically buy and sell directly from them. That's why I also find exchanges like that too easy to use because you don't have to wait for someone to have that price for you because they have their own market price but it's sort of lower than the market price that you see on most exchanges.",
