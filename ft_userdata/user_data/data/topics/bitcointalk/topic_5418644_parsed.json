      "body": "I have gone more into scalping, day and swing trading. I only read little about arbitrage trading. What I think you need more in arbitrage trading is high amount of money to take advantage of same coin (like BTC/USDT) pairs on two or more exchanges and converting it to a stable coin.The only bots that can be helpful for you are the ones that list you the present price of the coin on many exchanges for you to take advantage of the little price difference which has to be very fast. Any other bot is a scam. Let see what people that are into arbitrage trade are going to talk about this.",

      "body": "Arbitrage has been a good solution for making money in bear markets before (when there's low volume on major pairs). For a long time the ethusd pair was out by about 3% among many exchanges in 2018-2019 so it was a good opportunity to arbitrage then.Triangular arbitrage might be a bit harder but would work on general principle (I assume you're doing it because you don't want the 2nd currency or think it's too volatile but could make something - it's probably something you'd need to experiment with to see if the exchanges are fast and reliable enough). If you want to get into arbitrage build the bot yourself or find someone who will and release the source code to you. Don't do anything stupid (like granting withdraw permissions on the api keys) and don't hold too much money on an exchange for too long if you don't need to (especially if it's not well trusted).",

      "body": "Not sure if arbitrage trading is still a thing of this era.I mean if you talk about 2017-2018, maybe arbitrage is very good strategy as it can make profits by taking advantage of price difference from exchange. But I think exchanges have evolved as well to combat it. And then the era of bots comes along 2019 up to this day. It could be possible that there are still traders who are into this kind of arbitrage but definitely with a help of a bot. But the question is, where and how to find the correct bot to help you do this? And for sure it might cost you big money to begin with.",

You probably need to use a very sophisticated software and very first internet connection with very low latency period (Like positioning your trading station very close to the exchange's servers like most big institutions do) in order to compete with them for the profits,Back in 2017, there would be some great arbitrage opportunities, especially in low liquidity exchanges.Before you think of buying the bot, ask yourself this question. Why is the owner selling it if it's profitable? Shouldn't he be making it huge right now instead of making it public?",

It will not be sold to more than 100 people.",

Now bots been activated and when someone makes a buy or sell from one pair then an auto trade execute in the other pair. That means when you are buying from one pair almost same amount selling in the 2nd pair which prevents any high jump or dump of the price.",

So why not try this bot and give us results instead of asking to watch the video or at least if it's open source give us a link so we can evaluate the code *I will not watch the video because it will cause an increase in the number of views and thus increase the spread if it is scam.",

They can only show that to attract people to join them. I think I will better believe on those who are low-key only and then doesn't shill or talk too much about their product.OP might have been scammed by arbitrage programs before but it's not good for him to say that all of them are now a scam. Of course there must be programs like that who are legit. Or maybe he only expects too much upon availing this. I think that's not how they work but sometimes the strategy will still depend on us.",
