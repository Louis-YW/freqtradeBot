  "content": "BTC so been playing on stake for 3 years.Last Sunday my balance went from 8 k to 10k I got phishing mail and I clicked thinking it was legit bonus as I was nearing level up.I was phished and my funds were gambled on 3 bets. I was surprised why hacker didn't cashout. May be 2FA.But biggest surprise was phishing link received after certain amount reached. Could hacker potentially be scanning wallet and only trying to scam for bigger account? Could they be getting too much success that they just decide to act only after certain amount level is reached.I wont doubht that because I am not the first one being phished and funds stolen/misused. I see time to time victims and stake does not try to improve its security or they don't care about their players at all.After loosing funds I was so angry and try every avenue to acknowledge Eddie and their tech support but I havent even gotten 1 reply from them yet.Just venting and warning other users that stake.com is not safe and more certainly they don't care if their security is poor. They will just say account security is players responsibility. Be safe out there and try to avoid suck irresponsible site.Peace .",

I doubt if they'll refund you on that unless it's proven because if that bet have won they wouldn't definitely get it on your account. If you've been phished that's definitely not stake''s fault in the first place. If the link you clicked has gone through and you input your credentials the hacker should have get it. You have been so lucky you probably have good security on your account set or else that would have been wiped out. Again, you're still just speculating and you don't have any proof/s yet if it was really done by Stake itself.",

Do share some of your achievements online such as social media or group of friends because that might be the reason for you to become a target no one can target you if you are descreet on your account. Stake has a lot of players actively playing so doing this kind scam attempt is very hard to believe.You will not be hacked if you check carefully the email regardless if the Stake itself or some hacker sent it to you since your account will not be compromised if you protect it well. This stroy of yours is a good worning to be vigilant on phishing attempt via email but not the point of doubting Stake credibility for potentially being involved on this malicious scam attempt just because you are near to rank up your vip level.",

      "body": "I was viper out. Hacker made 1st limbo bet it was winner. And he made 2nd bet on mines which was looser, 3rd limbo again looser. All bets were made in LTC 160, 155 and 168 ltc . After 3rd bet 29$ left in my account out of 10500 USD..Funny thing is this exact scenario was reported aprox 6 to 8 months before and I was suspecting player made it and lost it and now producing stories. As the bets were huge . I exactly remember player claimed it was not him.Stake definetly has more genius devs than me so I asked them to look up IP and devices associated with those bets but they refuse to reply. I only play through my phone and all other sessions it says android and location except that 1 login.Funny thing is I was actively trying to go in slots at this point and when I see balance I freaked out went straight to support asking if anybody withdrew or tip and support showed me I made 3 beta and lost. 2 questions I had at this time1) I was betting in USD so how suddenly it chabged to LTC value suddenly. 2)It was merely 20 seconds to load slots so sxammer waited till I was done playing with game I was playing patiently? I still can't digest this whole situation and not getting any response from their tech devs",

      "body": "First, let me point out that the fact that this did not happen all the while that your balance was low, but only happened as soon as you hit the 10,000 dollar benchmark is pure coincidence, this is nothing but coincidence because there is no way scammers or hackers can track individual wallets that is associated with stake, stake is a centralized gambling casino, and like we all know, most centralized platforms make use of one wallet system, this simply means that funds belonging to users of that platform are stored in one wallet, usually is cold or hot wallet, what users now see as account balances is the number entered by the system into the user's account when the user made a deposit, this number we now be reduced  or increased accordingly by the system as the user plays games and losses or wins, so it is some kind of impossible for scammers or hackers to monitor a user's wallet on a centralized platform like stake.com.And secondly, you falling victim to the phishing site is clearly your fault, whether or not stake's security is high or low end, you said you only play with your mobile phone, stake has a login system that keeps you logged in forever as soon as you log in the first time and did not log out, when you clicked and opened the phishing site, I believe you were asked to log in, that should have been a pointer to you that you are in the wrong site, but unfortunately, I believe you were too careless to notice and by yourself, you gave out your login details to the scammer, how and why then are you blaming stake for your own mistake?",

Reviving my account was stressful 36 hrs battle. Stake support could have used those resources to even come for an explanation about which locations and IP and devices the bets were made .Anyway I think scammer helped me to realise stake is not the top crypto gambling site so wouldn't be putting more energy in this site which I did for last 3 years feeling and assuming best \"online gambling website\".I am so closed to filing cyber security phishing complain just so stake takes this seriously and prevent this rather than just harassing users.",

I had to point the crypto amount send and it was showing in deposits same amount in stakes own deposit history. Like how would support fail to recognize legitimate stake deposit and checking rather than coming up with this was not stake deposit.Another senior stake support chimed in when I was angry and asked if they want my DNA.Anyway just discussing my experiance here so it can be cautious story for others.",

I thought it was discussion forum not judgemental spaceIf this comment is for me, then let me categorically make it clear to you that I am not being judgemental or judging you for whatever reason, I only stated the obvious fact which you yourself know it is the truth, you are logged in on stake and I believe you have not logged out since your first login,  and for every time you visited the casino, you were never asked to login again.When you got and opened the mail that contained the phishing link you clicked, when the site opened and you were asked to log in, if you were really paying attention, you would have first of all verified to make sure you are on the right site before inputting your login details again, but unfortunately you paid no attention to any of this and went ahead to give your login details to the hacker,  how is this the fourth of stake ?Now, speaking of who this hacker is and how he or she is able to monitor and know which accounts on stake has high balances, and even how he or she is able to get the email addresses associated with this account, I will personally assume this to be an insider, probably some bad eggs among the team did or is responsible for all of this, but then, this is not what is important, what is important is that you wouldn't have been hacked if you were security conscious.",

If you click a phishing website link then you have invested in a troubled waters, unfortunately I think that was what happened from his story.This is another lesson not to click just any link sent to you without verification of where it came from, I avoid them alot when they are sent through to my email. Sometimes they are not sent directly with the original site name but the link sent to you would bear the name and with such discrepancy, you don't need to click at all whether you activated 2FA or Google authenticator because these hackers are highly knowledgeable in tech.",

They will just say account security is players responsibility. I suggest you provide some evidence since this appears to be baseless criticism against a popular gambling site. Two-factor authentication (2FA) should already enhance the security of your account, preventing unauthorized withdrawals. I believe it's also a necessary safeguard when logging into the website. Just exercise caution in the future, as phishing, a form of hacking, is prevalent. Always verify the URL of the site you're visiting. If the site had poor security, there would likely be numerous complaints from various gamblers which I don't see.
