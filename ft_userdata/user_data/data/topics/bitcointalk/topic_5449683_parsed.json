  "content": "Hello everyone, since I've been using the Nicehash pool the s9s give me several errors. With SHA256 asicboost I often get the error:QuoteWarning message: Network problem (or fan fault). Click for detailsToday I selected the SHA256 pool, without asicboost, and after a few minutes these 2 errors often appear:QuoteWarning message: Network problem (or fan fault). Click for detailsWarning message: Total hashrate 11250.51 is less than 90 percents of 13714.99, stopping minerwith other pools (like binance) it never happened to me.Did I do something wrong or are there some parameters to modify to avoid errors? I use hiveos.thanks",

The 20% reward that you get from Nicehash or to fix the error/issue that your miner currently has?It's your choice but I'd also like you to check more potential earnings on merged mining from ViaBTC you mine BTC then gets rewarded some free altcoins.Check this https://support.viabtc.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001530543-What-is-Merged-Mining-",

Now I get to the payout and change it.Merged mining with BTC is useless, fractions of very small dead coins do not affect earnings.",

      "body": "Yeah you should try with some other pool  and check if the issue is solved or not.You can just point it on solo ckpool for a while, and see if it's ok in your logs. If Nicehash is the problem and you really want to use their pool, you could try with an alternative firmware. Be very carreful and double check before using any firmware, some are very shady. If I am not wrong all firmwares are not NH compatible, you will have to double check before.",

Click for detailsI disagree with the comment above, whether NH is good or bad has nothing to do with the current issue you are facing, and it will most likely occur on every other pool you use, let's clear some things.1- Which firmware are you using? the error you posted is surely not the stock firmware, not Vnish and very unlikely to be BO 2- Are you using stock fans?",

They give me the same error.I would start by flashing the default firmware back, take the 2017 version or any other version that doesn't have a signature lock so that you won't need to SDcard it later on when you want to change, after doing so, post the kernel log from the stock firmware -- that should be a lot more detailed and a lot better to understand than this hiveos junk.",
