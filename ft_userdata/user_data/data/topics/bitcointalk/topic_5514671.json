      "body": "There have been issues with physical Bitcoin in the past. Projects such as Casascius and Denarium had centralization issues and even risked key exposure, getting shut down due to regulatory concerns. One potential con here might be that, even while one is splitting the keys, part of the security still relies on trusting the issuer of the SEEDCARDs not retaining a copy of the partial keys-a risk which has been realized in physical Bitcoin implementations previously.Have you considered at all how a user would actually know the issuer is unable to access the private keys after the fact of issuance? This might be somewhat alleviated by greater transparency in key generation or, better still, in an open-sourced framework, and it certainly appears that is a good start with your use of ECC software. It would also be useful to have some usability comparisons for SEEDCARD versus more established hardware wallets, which generally are considered the gold standard for security with Bitcoin because they are offline and have strong PIN protection. Though your offline generation process of a project is a big plus, delving a bit more into how it compares with pre-existing methods could help build a stronger pitch.",

They can be generated as a singular key from a random 256 bit entropy.Finally when it comes to BIP39 mnemonics, the last word is not the checksum. The last word contains the checksum meaning in a 12-word mnemonic 4 bits out of the 11 bits of the last word are the checksum and the rest (7 bits) are part of the entropy. This means you can not generate the last word by just having 11 out of 12 words, you'll need to brute force it.",

The process of creating SEEDCARDs actually NEEDS the Issuer to retain a copy of a partial key (not both keys). Each key is generated in a different location. The 'spendable' part of the SEEDCARD is created by the Card Agent and both keys are only required when the SEEDCARD funds are swept and the card is physically destroyed. Every SEEDCARD has a unique NFC chip embedded to ensure that the Card Agent does not make multiple copies.Totally agree on your points about open source and transparency in generating the wallet keys. All code will be open sourced on our GitHub - https://github.com/seedcard When we have a MVP i will submit it for review with https://walletscrutiny.com/ I have taken a good look at the Bearer wallets whilst researching for this project.",

This script type has been chosen as it can be 'split' generated in two different locations. The script will be generated as two partial keys from random 128 bit entropy.Each partial private key will then generate a partial public key without either party needing to reveal their private keys. The two partial public keys will then be combined using ECC to create a useable full public key to allow funds to be recieved.",

A physical equivalent doesn’t really translate to value. In fact, I see certain challenges in this.1. Now, the idea is off chain and needing less knowledge of its technicalities but still, you need technology for verification and authenticity. That’s technology right there.2. Steel plates would be used and though, they might not be as much heavy, they still would come with some weight.3. The use of NFC simply means, if I’ve got any of these steel plates on me, I would find just any device that supports NFC making the connections when close by or activated out of suspicion, which might range from criminal propaganda to what have you.4. A question of denomination and balancing. Just how much worth of it would I be carrying about, how do I get the balance after a purchase.These and possibly more are the challenges this system can face. How do we go around these, it’s hardly a system I would prefer to what we have now. I still prefer Bitcoin sticking to its digital, on chain and technical means to transacting. If anyone haven’t got much on its technicalities, what’s there to do is learn.",

The redeem script contains the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode, which enforces the timelock condition. The Bitcoin network will reject any transaction attempting to spend funds from this script before the specified block height or timestamp has been reached. Once funds are sent to a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) or Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) address, the script's locking conditions (defined by the redeem script) are effectively immutable. Even if the user modifies the redeem script to remove or change the timelock condition, the modified script will produce a different hash. Bitcoin nodes and miners validate transactions against the locking script and consensus rules. Any transaction that does not meet these conditions (e.g., attempting to bypass the timelock) will be rejected by the network.This timelocking function is not built into any current bitcoin wallets and can only be used with a Bitcoin Core wallet.Now looking for a developer who can code a simple wallet (bluewallet fork?) that uses a default redeem script to embed the timelock condition...",
