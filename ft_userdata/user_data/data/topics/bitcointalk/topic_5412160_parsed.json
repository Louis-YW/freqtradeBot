  "content": "No one is prepared for war or likes to be invaded but you also don't get orchestrate a war and not have adequate resources to finish that said war.  In the case of Putin, his invasion to Ukraine has lasted for six months and according to reports gotten from professors studying the war, it was gathered that Putin felt the war would last for a week or so and then Ukraine would give in, but I guess he had another thing coming.  But then there's the case of replenishment of soldiers because should a war last this long, there's bound to be loss of both manpower and weapons. So far it looks like Putin is confused about what to do next concerning what blow to hit Ukraine with that can settle the war in his favor as Zelensky is not giving up anytime soon and backed by Western forces, one would be tempted to conclude the war could end in his favor and quickly too. But will Putin be willing to throw in the towel or does he have some hidden tactic up his sleeve?  https://feed.rhino-news.com/multifeed-detail-template/static/half/detail/20220902/507882654834622516.html",

I think he believes he can recreate the cold war from the 50's 60's 70's.He wants Russia China North Korea Vietnam with maybe India and Iran to form an anti west/capitalist group or block.Part of the reason Eth is going POS he wants to use Eth to attack POW coins like BTC.The next year will see Russia bogged down in the Ukraine and the world splitting on capitalism and socialism. Not a very nicepicture to think about. Here is hoping saner heads prevail or that Putin falls ill and has to retire from the lime light.",

Wear them down until they and their various supporting countries sort of fade away.Meanwhile, go on over to Iran and make special deals, starting special trade agreements. And welcome other nations to BRICS to continue the destruction of the USD as the world currency. And don't simply dump gas and other trade materials to Europe, even though much of Europe has become the enemy. Rather, slowly cut them off, so that they see how seriously wrong they were to antagonize Russia.Putin is reasonably pleased with how the war is going, and the new heights it has pushed his country to.

So, Russia is simply trading with other countries that are willing to trade with her... BRICS... and Argentina and Iran are possibly two new ones.Russia isn't anywhere near collapsing.

      "body": "Alright, this is nothing but my personal opinion on the subject. At the start of the invasion, Putin underestimated Ukraine's defense and overestimated his army's capabilities. He believed Kyiv could be conquered within a week and was quickly proven wrong. However, he changed his invasion's strategy shortly after and proceeded to reorganize the whole invasion by setting up a more methodical approach.A quick look at the war maps and unfortunately, it's evident that Russia is slowly but steadily advancing over the Ukrainian soil. His approach now is much more organized and has managed to disrupt Europe's economy. The war is likely to last more than a year, at least.",

Russia announced that it would end the war when its goals were achieved.According to the course of events, the goals revolve around imposing complete sovereignty over the European economy to reduce the US role on the one hand, as well as ensuring an international alliance capable of confronting the West, whether technologically or militarily.Many experts say that a huge amount of weapons available to Russia has not been used, as it does not consider this invasion its biggest problem, even despite Western support for Ukraine.",
