  "content": "As the title suggests, Bitcoin appears to breaking out of it's two month long downtrend after reaching the highs of $31K on April 14th, that followed with lower lows and lower highs.As can be seen by the chart above, today price is breaking the resistance trend-line as well as moving back above the 50 Day MA that price has remained below for the past 5 weeks. Do you think this break-out will continue to the upside in order to re-test the highs around $31K, or will it fail and price will fall lower?As of typing price hasn't made a higher high above last month high of $28,450, but is getting close.",

Even if it's going to fall, it won't fall until I do this test. This is how I feel as the price broke the resistance trendline. Especially the news and lawsuits that have emerged in recent weeks have not done any harm to bitcoin. This news was not about bitcoin anyway. It took a while to test the 31k because of this news. This was the only negative impact of these news on Bitcoin.All in all, if I have to wrap up my post, my guess will test $31,000.",

This was the only negative impact of these news on Bitcoin.It's a good point that the bearish news of SEC lawsuits overall had virtually no bearish effect on Bitcoin. Obviously fundamentally it shouldn't, as Bitcoin isn't referenced, but given how the market functions a lot on sentiment I'd assume that if the market was truly bearish then this would have had a negative effect on the overall market. Instead Bitcoin went sideways and has begun to recover since these announcements.I'm not even convinced the recent ETF news is what has instigated this rally either, it seems to have simply negated the negativity of the SEC lawsuits, therefore leaving Bitcoin with a relatively neutral sentiment. With that neutrality and after a 2 month downtrend, it seems quite logical Bitcoin would continue to the upside, given it's effectively been in a broader uptrend since the start of the year now.That's my take on the sentiment side of the market, technical analysis aside.",

For example today is around +4% and the week is +6%. It's slightly above average volatility, but otherwise probably just seems like it's moving fast because price has been moving so slowly for the past 2 months. Based on the Daily RSI for example, price is only just turning bullish after being neutral for almost two months, so far from overbought or anything like that. In fact, there is a lot of room to the upside if some of the shorter-term metrics cool-off in the meantime, especially given the break-out is barely even confirmed yet.We'll now when price is moving quickly because the Daily rise will be more than +5%, likely around +10% with another weekly candle around +20%. This is the usual outcome of breakouts after months of consolidation.",

What we don't want to see is these massive daily and weekly candles where we gain +20% week after week.Generally with bitcoin when that happens it means we are going to near a top and then start another sideways market and bear market. We need to see bitcoin up go slowly and not with violent upward moves, that usually indicates that the top is near.",

That said, if the month did close >$30K that would be very bullish imo. A nice long bullish wick to the downside followed by highest monthly close in over a year...Already the bullish wick to the downside showing buying pressure below $27K is good enough for me though if it closes in the green, better than testing the highs and returning to the opening price imo.",

I don't even expect $31k to test, but hope we can see price hold and the month close in that area.Being optimistic right now makes sense, but personally I prefer not to be too optimistic. Ie not hoping for re-testing $30K or $31K within the next 10 days, as a fast move from $25k to $30K would likely create a pull-back towards $27K by the end of the month, creating an indecisive monthly candle. Whereas if prices where to hold steady for the next 10 days then it would be a much more bullish monthly candle.Quote from: imamusma on June 20, 2023, 07:58:41 PMBut despite all that, panicked traders and holders eager to take quick profits will certainly have an impact on how the month closes out. But I believe the best closing price to expect later this month is $28k - $29k.Personally I get the impression that most who wanted to take profits, or get out of positions, did so previously around $30K resistance level.

Of course in Bitcoin it's a normal occurrence, but this recovery feels quite quick, I suspected that the $26k range will last for a lot longer. But I wouldn't be surprised by more gains, because everyone expects a bull run in next year after the halvening, so it would be logical to start accumulating now, which could be causing these price spikes when some big buyers do it.
