I'm by far no racist by why in hell is this?Juneteenth is the combination of June and 19th and it was dedicated as a holiday to the blacks to celebrate June 19, 1865, which was the date the African Americans that were enslaved got their freedom.I don't want to be unfair but the way you put your statement looks like racism because it was not Italian, Spanish, etc that was enslaved 157 years ago.",

      "body": "I don't like identity politics: you shouldn't be proud of things that you had no control over, and you shouldn't consider yourself to be part of some political tribe based on your race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. So I'd support getting rid of things like Black History Month or Women's History Month. But I think that the idea of Juneteenth is worthy of a federal holiday if anything is. Slavery was a very evil institution; it's worthwhile to remember the harms that were done (without blaming anyone alive today for it), and it's worth celebrating the fact that despite slavery being commonly accepted throughout most of history in most parts of the world to varying degrees, humanity in general and the US in particular were able to move the moral bar forward and finally recognize slavery as evil. If I listed some of humanity's biggest achievements throughout all of history -- the things that actually mattered and show IMO what we're even here for --, recognizing slavery as evil would be near the top of the list, and it happened relatively recently.That said, there are two things that bother me about Juneteenth. First, the name sounds incredibly stupid. I don't care if this is what they historically called it: it sounds ridiculous, and you can't tell from the name what it's even commemorating. Rename it \"Freedom Day\" or \"Emancipation Day\" or something. Second, there are too many federal holidays. Get rid of some of the more useless ones like Labor Day, Presidents' Day, or Columbus Day.On a similar matter, my initial reaction to hearing that they were going to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill was pretty negative. Whoever came up with this idea almost certainly did it with the mindset of, \"We only have white men on the money, but we need to check more identity boxes than that. Can we find a non-white LGBT woman or something?\", and that sort of identity-based thinking is a stupid reason to do anything. But I later came to at least not hate the idea. After reading some of Tubman's biography, I came to think that she was in fact an impressive figure who exemplified some of America's best qualities. Maybe there are better people than her to pick for this, but she's not bad. And Andrew Jackson was one of the worst presidents in US history, so I don't mind diminishing his prominence, and in fact I wish they'd remove him completely from the $20 bill rather than keeping him and adding Tubman as they currently plan. (If they were going to diminish Jefferson or Franklin, who I actually respect, that'd bother me more.)",

My people also used to experience slavery by the Japanese and in 1945 after Japan lost we just got out of slavery and we didn't make a special day for it. We just remember it in the history books and that's about it, there's no need to feel like making a day for something as sad as that.",

Most slaves became free when men showed up with guns and forced the slave owner to set their slaves free.  That obviously took time, years in some cases.  The decision was made in 1863, But Juneteenth, 1865 was when it started to happen in the South.",

He freed the slaves, and there was fraudulent voting by mail to try to stop him, and he was killed for freeing the slaves. The US has presidents on its dollars, and I think that should remain the status quo. If we are going to put another president who helped blacks, perhaps we should put Trump on the twenty dollar bill.",

I think you're the one who's confused or trying to confuse others.You're making a claim (\"US has presidents on its dollars\") that is false for 2 out of 7 (6 really; barely anyone uses the $2) dollar bills in circulation.

IMO triggered & fueled by media driven frenzies.For some reason the powers that be want to ignite a \"systemic racism\" torch.. even after recently having a black president voted in the US for 2 consecutive terms.  The people in the 1800s would probably smack the shit out of the people crying today.. as those guys actually experienced systemic racism. At the end of the day, Juneteenth is not worth arguing over as it will lead to more division, which is ultimately what they want.. so I just *shrug* and move on. My family has always remembered slavery and the civil war.. through education.. we know the history. I don't need the government reminding me when to think about black people's history and the overwhelming majority of people I know think the same.The stuff people of every color have experienced for quite some time is some form of modern day slavery, but it's not systemic racism, it's a form of control over the majority of the working class in general.AND ALL I SEE IS PROPOGANDAAAAA PROPOGANDAAAAAAAaaaaaa",
