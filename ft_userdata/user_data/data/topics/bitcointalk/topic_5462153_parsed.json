Braga have always shown how good they have been as well even though they only qualified for the champions league playoffs and Sporting CP on the other struggled last season, their performance was inconsistent that they barely made it to the europa league. A team like sporting should fight their way to the champions league, I believe next season they would improve on their performance and challenge for the title. The league is very competitive and interesting and all teams are trying to add more talent to their squad in order to challenge for the trophy. I can’t wait for the season to start and see how the teams perform.  I hope to see Benfica will the league again.",

      "body": "there are only 6 days left for the games to start, the first game of the league will be the game of braga against farmalicao, for this season braga had new players, I speak of Bruma, Rodrigo Zalazar, Vitor Carvalho, Víctor Gómez, Sikou Niakaté, Adrián Marín , Ron Lopez. braga did not spend a lot of money on hiring new players and there were some players that were sold, with that i would say that braga will be fighting to stay in the same position as always, that is they are not fighting for the title, they just want a place in the European competitions. Then we have Sporting, which only made two big signings, Viktor Gyökeres and Trincao. but sporting also lost players with Manuel Ugarte who was sold for 60 million euros to PSGthey also sold Pedro Porro, Tiago Tomás, Arthur Gomes and other players, with these departures sporting made a lot of profit, because they sold players for a high price and bought players for a low price, the problem will be what performance they will present in this new season. in the case of benfica we have 3 new players, we have dimaria, Orkun Kökcü and David Jurasek. there are others, but these for me are the main ones, but benfica also sold playersJulian Weigl, Gilberto, Lucas Veríssimo and soon Gonçalo Ramos. so I see benfica weaker this season, it doesn't surprise me because benfica always does that when they win the leaguewhile porto brought Nico González and Fran Navarro, but some players will also leave, I see that porto will be champions this season, in 4 days we will see a good game in which porto will play against benfica in the super cup, that will give us a little insight into what to expect from these two teams this season",

Looking at Benfica's squad, I'd say it's still the strongest in the league. If he's going to win, it's still hard for me to give an opinion, as Porto will play a lot with his \"off the field\" schemes.When it comes to the Super Cup game, Benfica tend not to play a good game - regardless of the opponent. Therefore, I think it will be difficult to understand who will be better at the start of the season, if Porto or Benfica.On the other hand, the coach has already noticed how the spirit of the squad is when he plays against Porto. And in that sense, I believe that prepare the team in another way.Just a final note about transfers. In Portugal, the only source of income for clubs is the sale of players, so all clubs have to sell players when good offers come up, as they are unable to offer equal wages to other European clubs.",

It's absolutely not a game one would missed for anything, both teams are elite clubs and have the possibility to draw concentration.  i would also go with Benfica here. If I am not mistaken the game takes place on neutral grounds and last season I thought for a second that Benfica could have some problems at the end of the season, since Porto kept winning their games. But their was solid until the last day and I believe they have a slight advantage over Porto. But this can really go both ways. There have been hardly any changes in the Porto team, so Benfica knows what they are up against.",

For this season, Arouca has prepared quite well so that they still have a big chance of winning oppose Estoril Praia.",

The last five meetings between the two teams have shown that Porto have won more matches, namely four times and Benfica only once. But it's difficult to predict the final, because usually the final always presents a balanced spectacle, I mean both teams will play more carefully and not be dominant in attack.",

What are your guesses?If I had posted to answer this question before the game started I wouldn't hesitate to say that the port would win, since the benfica when playing with the port has a tendency to play badly and lose the game, but the game is already over and the porto lost and the most unbelievable thing about it all was seeing porto not being able to score at least 1 goal, as expected in porto games, in this game there was also a red card, this time the red card went to the porto player, something I found strange because in most cases porto wins games based on the advantage that the referees have given them, porto team had chances to score but they wasted and benfica is taking advantage of the opportunities they hadIt's funny that there was a move in which the player from Porto touched the ball with his hand but the referee simply ignored it and in the minutes that followed, Benfica scored a goal. I see that in this game the referee was not in favor of Porto, at least in this game, we'll see when the league games start and Porto starts playing if the referee won't be helping Porto to win the games because if Porto doesn't have help from the referees and with this squad and coach, then porto will have a lot of difficulties to win the league with the big difference in points they like to have when they become champions, porto's first game will be against moreirense, it will be very interesting to see how the port and the referees will leave, with that I will start to see if the port will be champion or not",

Just to give you an idea, it is rare for Portuguese referees to referee Champions League matches, or a World Cup.This referee is known for giving a lot of yellows. And he started giving yellows in bids without any sense. Hence having this huge amount of yellow.I really hope this doesn't become a trend this season.This weekend, the championship begins.
