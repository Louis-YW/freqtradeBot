  "content": "This was Donald Trump speech at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference held in Nashville. Quote Former United States president and current Republican candidate Donald Trump announced his intent to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, if elected in November. After taking the stage an hour late, Trump addressed the crowd at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump said that he had great respect for the Bitcoin community, adding that “this is like the steel industry” when it was young. He told the crowd he had \"great respect for the Bitcoin community\", adding that “this is like the steel industry” when it was young. He also predicted that \"one day\" Bitcoin would overtake gold, gushing that \"Bitcoin is not just a marvel of technology, as you know it's a miracle of cooperation and human achievement.\" Trump also stated that if in future bitcoin price skyrocket that let it be that America was the cause to make such happen. This shows Trump great interest in bitcoin and he is also standing for bitcoin community. What are your thoughts on this.

Still, I’m not convinced that his heart is now on bitcoin and supporting it all the way. This is just very unlikely of him most especially if we have come to witness how he handled bitcoin negatively in the past years. But if he is really serious about this, that’s good but politicians will always be politicians, they are the great liars of all time.",

I don't know what changed his stance but I am certain he is not standing for the Bitcoin community. First of all the dumbest thing to do in this is to trust any word of a politician during election campaign period because they will definitely get the crowd growing with what they know the crowd wishes to hear. This days the issue of bitcoin and cryptocurrency is easily up in the news simply because Politicians have found out that the most masses prefer this new technology and if they realign their policies towards the technology many will believe in them and that’s exactly what’s happen in US. I don’t even found the fact the Trump was actually an anti bitcoin before in the past because he wouldn’t be the first person to have a change of heart people like even one of the biggest investor, Michael Saylor was also first against it before the turn, but turning back into it during campaign period is what I don’t think is ok, but should his intention comes out clean after election it will be a huge bullish sentiment for the market",

Even though he might have other intentions and agendas,  it becomes easy to hold him by his words which for now seem positive for Bitcoin. However, I have learnt not to swallow the words of politicians hook and sinkers,  rather I will take it with a pinch of salt as only time will reveal what the true intentions are. While we wait for the elections, it is wise to enjoy the gains that the market will make following these developments.",

The point was always to raise a lot of money from the crypto bros in town for the conference, and I’m sure he will accomplish this goal. The big news was that he would create a national strategic stockpile, pledging to maintain the current BTC acquired from criminal seizures. I’m sure Bitfinex will not be too pleased with that, since nearly half of the BTC held by the U.S. government was seized from the Bitfinex hackers.",

The earliest conference was only a day. This time, it's 3 days. It's probably a lot cheaper, if not free, to attend the Bitcoin Conference when it started. Today, it's a hell lot more expensive. And although the earliest conference was already ironic in that it was bannered by centralized services, they were probably honest innovations, technological development done by believers of decentralization. Today, however, the conference is headlined by politicians who have no qualms lying through their teeth just to court voters. Even minor speakers aren't anymore led by technological innovators. They're led by congressmen, senators, wall street people, and the like. I'm not sure who influenced who, which infiltrated which, but if you say that this \"shows Trump great interest in bitcoin\" and that \"he is also standing for bitcoin community\", then I doubt it very much. If a man is convinced into Bitcoin by a politician as dirty as Trump, it may be that his belief in Bitcoin is built on sand.",

Expect Trump to deliver his speech with good stance and practice on Bitcoin is unrealistic and too much expectation.Trump and his pre-President-Election rally helps Bitcoin Spot ETF applications were approved, then Ethereum Spot ETF applications to be approved. Because the SEC. under current President and his party's leadership, smelt risk of losing the President position in White house and domination in the Congress, so they were forced to changed recent months and made approvals on Spot ETFs of Bitcoin and Ethereum.It's successful and considerable contribution from Trump but I don't expect more than that.QuoteIf the United States government starts trying to stack a million + BTC, things will be too crazy for me to imagine.

So don't be too subjective and expect too much otherwise we will feel extremely disappointed if it doesn't turn out as we expected. Not to mention , there is no guarantee that Trump will be elected because according to some recent surveys, Ms. Kalama also has great support and is not inferior to Trump. It can be said that the election is taking place quite excitingly and nothing can be said in advance .",

However, as long as he is still on the side of Bitcoin, I don't feel that it is completely wrong, but just don't have too much hope for what he says, because if he can change his words about Bitcoin in just a few moments, then he might be able to change his policy on Bitcoin later.",

He promises to criminalize abortion in the USA, and attack women who have already had them by exposing their personal information.2. He promises to deport 5% of the US workforce immediately, leading the massive economic disruption.Both of these things will be very bad for Bitcoin, even if he doesn't move to takeover Bitcoin or replace it with his own currency, which is also very possible under Trump.But with so many in the Bitcoin community now begging for government intervention into the Bitcoin market--because they think it will temporarily prop up the price--I think Bitcoin's days as an independent entity are numbered. Inviting the government into Bitcoin's business is like inviting the Mafia into the business: they are nice at first, and then they will want their cut, and they they will take control. Here's how it will all go down:1. Trump will order the US to buy a huge chunk of Bitcoin, giving the US government effective control of the price of Bitcoin since the US has the power to buy and sell so much at once.2. With control of Bitcoin's price, Trump can then extort any imaginable concession from the community he wants.3. With control of Bitcoin secured, Bitcoin will then be controlled by US politics, and things like abortion drives US politics, not the net worths of people like Elon Musk.4. Voters who want to fight the new \"War On Abortion\" will want to control anything that allows payments to be made for illegal abortions, e.g. Bitcoin and other cryptos. 5. Hence, Bitcoin holders will be given a choice between accepting a defacto US takeover of the Bitcoin network or it being replaced by something that Trump himself profits from (or both).I keep saying this, and it's pretty obvious what is going to happen (maybe not exactly like that, but generally), but it would seem that the Bitcoin community is controlled by a few Bitcoin whales who care about absolutely nothing in the world except the price of Bitcoin in the next 72 hours.What Satoshi actually invented was the easiest market to manipulate by governments in the history of mankind.",
