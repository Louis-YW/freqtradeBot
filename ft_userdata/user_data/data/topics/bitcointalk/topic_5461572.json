  "content": "Hello Casino Bitcointalk Community,I am going to concentrate to write what my thoughts are and use help where necesarry and also to not let it look as if it is just an advertisement from my side. It´s broader.First of all, this comes from me but also read it in general. I wrote this recently:People without enough knowledge abouy cryptos het to hear, day in day out, CRYPTOS ARE BAD. Like drugs.But many people do not buy that BS anymore.So why don´t we see, at least alternative media, with an other type of advertisement and inform the public about crypto.Crypto is freedom, no?Well, that people are all screaming for freedom. And don´t know sjit about cryptos.So, unless I am missing something and cryptos are dead, what do I miss?Today, I'd like to share some thoughts on a unique opportunity that lies at the intersection of free speech, online communities, and as a human right, although a tricky business (like all businesses in the world) also the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency gambling.As the owner of commonsensetv.nl, a well-established platform (2019) dedicated to free speech, once a very big platform but I wish I knew what I know now. My business skills were not that good but it was fun and the platform still exists and has a lot of potential to be the national place whe only real people can come and speak and no trolls, AI bots etcetera. For the moment we have between 1200-2000 visitors a day.I've had my fair share of experiences with the traditional advertising world, but knew too little. I've tried the usual routes - Google's AdSense, affiliate programs, and the like. While these methods have their merits, they didn't quite align with my vision. It could have make me rich, by the way. Little did I know. It was not my goal either. I stood behind the deep sense of our platform. I still do, although opinions change. I think that is a good thing.I would like to discuss an alternative path. One that not only strays from the beaten track but also bridges the gap between different online communities.My idea is simple: Instead of relying on traditional advertising methods, why not explore the potential of direct advertising within the crypto gambling community? But here's the twist - instead of limiting this to crypto-focused platforms, we introduce these opportunities to a broader audience, such as the community at commonsensetv.nl.Imagine a banner that not only promotes a crypto casino or service but also sparks a conversation about the potential of cryptocurrencies. Or a blog post that informs and entertains, subtly highlighting the benefits of a particular casino or game, while also educating readers about the broader implications of cryptocurrencies.This approach allows for a more targeted advertising strategy, fostering a sense of community and mutual growth. It also opens up the door for long-term, creative collaborations. Think sponsored tournaments, branded games, or even the development of new, innovative gambling platforms.By embracing these alternative advertising methods, we can create a more engaging, dynamic, and ultimately successful gambling sector. One that values creativity, community, and the unique opportunities that cryptocurrencies provide.I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this and look forward to exploring these opportunities together.Best Regards and I might post two or three very similar posts elsewhere on this forum. This is because I am still not sure what is the best place to attract the right people for this.",

The best thing do right now is to lock the rest of your duplicate threads or deleted them if you can.",

That's the point of discussion.My overall perception of the crypto community is that they aim to pique the curiosity of as many people as possible and turn them into crypto-enthusiasts.On the other hand, where I've been coming from in recent years, media, governments, and even the so-called \"Alternative Media\" have long sold their souls and lost their independence (trust me, they try to buy you, but I'm not someone who sells his principles for money, despite appearances).So, aside from casinos, which everyone has the right to play in without excessive KYC and government restrictions on how much you can play per day (in Spain it's €600), and being tracked every step of the way.Now, regarding services, I should focus on services or perhaps ebooks or guides. Let's take my website as an example.Now, I'm aware of AI. There's CHATGPT with all its plugins.I could write an eBook about various aspects related to Bitcoin.I have no issue with using AI as a tool to assist. However, I do have a problem with writing the eBook myself without having any knowledge about the subject.I want my friends from my website to save some coins, knowing how to and learning what to do with it. I do not want them to make the banks happy.Quote from: coin-investor on July 31, 2023, 01:56:29 PMQuote from: Freedom4All on July 31, 2023, 10:18:59 AMI would like to discuss an alternative path.

And I have the feeling it is not new.People contact me, shady people (no names, strange email) and they want me to pay for a guest post. I did it once and the guest post was exactly about a casino that fits here, maybe it is even active here. But after contacting (literally) tens of casinos I got 0 answers.I miss something.My site authority is 38.We have 1k - 2k visitors a day. We even come from 40k to 100k visitors a day. Yes, it sounds unbelievable, especially for a Dutch site, but it happened. Now, this was during corona. So spent many more hours online.",

So tell me is that KYC free? Is the KYC not as a result of government policies?Another reasons for KYC is to note age of gamblers if they meet up with the government approved age in their country for gambling and lastly casinos demand for KYC to know countries on their restricted list.  I think you need to do a proper diligence OP.",

So they want to keep watch of every transaction from every financial institution in their jurisdiction so as not to loss and keep anything suspicious on track. Be it casino, sportbook etc. As for casinos that claim kyc free, I  think that is just a stunt to gain traffic to their site and to gain more members because online gamblers prefer a kyc free casino to preserve their identity so those casino takes advantage of it to hold them down and when they win big, withdrawal is always a problem and they start demanding for kyc and if they are scammers they run away with gamblers funds.Truly all licensed casino from the government demand for kyc as that is a criteria which they would require to do before admitting any gambler to opening an account with them and  operating as a gambler so as not to violate the country policies.",

It's a good idea because it will intrigue the people who see it and surely they will find out more about crypto (if the ad is related to crypto). Your idea is going well because it introduces crypto and information about crypto knowledge being carried out by sources and people, making people even more interested in following it. So far, people have been learning about crypto based on programs such as Ponzi, HYIP, Cloud Mining, Fast Trading, and Investment Programs.If you can implement your idea into an advertising medium, it will make people curious. So that a dialogue will occur between them and the source (if the advertisement refers to an online meeting). They can interact with sources or experts in their fields to learn more about crypto from the right sources.And for KYC, it looks like this could become more stringent in the future, especially for the gambling business, because the government wants to limit the movement of the perpetrators of illegal activities in utilizing crypto. For this reason, casinos have started implementing KYC for all of their members, especially those who use big money to do KYC. After doing KYC, the casino will know who is behind the gambling account using big money. If the casino reports it to the government, the government can also see that the person is not related to any illegal activities.",
