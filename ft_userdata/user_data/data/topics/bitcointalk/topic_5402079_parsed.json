I find it as good option as any.Another direction should be to uncheck in preferences the use of change addresses; I've never used this option, but it looks designed for your use case.PS. If you have Advanced Preview enabled, you can take a look onto the transaction before broadcasting; it may help, to be sure.",

I knew it should work but but better to check before trying and this proved to be surprisingly difficult problem to google.",
