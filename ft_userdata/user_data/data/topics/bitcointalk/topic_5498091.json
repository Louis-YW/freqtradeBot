  "content": "Source: https://archive.is/BZal2In 2013, a man stored 43.6 BTC in his wallet, and protected it with a strong, 20-character password generated using a password manager called RoboForm.Instead of simply storing this password in the password manager, he decided to store it in a file and encrypted it using a tool called TrueCrypt.Some time later that encrypted file got corrupted, so he was unable to obtain the password to his wallet.Now, the interesting part is that because of the way RoboForm generated passwords, it was possible to regenerate the same password and unlock the wallet!Here's the video that explains this in more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5IySpAkThgRoboForm used certain parameters like password length, use of upper or lower case letters, etc, which were simply guessed by the \"hackers/researchers\" based on other passwords that the man used in the past. But the crucial step is that RoboForm used the time of the system to seed the PRNG(Pseudorandom number generator) algorithm to generate the password. This reduced the number of checks dramatically and made it possible for them to crack it.The password was generated on May 15, 2013, at 4:10:40 pm GMT. They were able to generate the same password that the software gave to the man at that time.This is a happy ending, with the man now holding 30 BTC (he sold some and also paid the \"hackers\"), but it is also a cautionary tale:If you use a password generator, make sure to manually edit it so that it is not possible for people trying to steal your money to do something like this.",

If you go through the video, you will see that the hackers were able to reverse engineer the back end code of the so called robo password generator and got access into their software. To me, such software is already a red flag because if they could do it, then others might also do same and equal use it against other users.In the video, you can see that the hackers claims to be able to help others recover their lost bitcoins. And I know his claims are just to put up a show and draw more clients to himself. Brute forcing a Bitcoin seedphrase is impossible especially when you barely have any idea of the seed. While chosing a password to encrypt or further increase the security of our funds, we should be mindful of the software you use to generate them.",

In a way I am surprised that password managers are still being used, after all you can easily create more secure passwords on your own.Since if you were to create a password with 10 or more words of length, use words coming from different languages and some of those ‘words’ were composed with numbers and special characters, you will have a password that is very close to be impossible to break, and if you were to store that password offline, the only way for an adversary to break it would be by getting physical access to the password itself.",

The hackers that have been a part of this are probably white hat hackers, most likely that they're going to report this to the RoboForm administration so they can do something about, another thing is that RoboForm is probably not using PRNG anymore so they're probably safe, password managers aren't that safe in the first place after all so I'm not sure that anything changes in all of this, I mean it would've been much safer if you just covered all of your bases and just written it down too, because that way, file corruption might not be a thing that will worry you so much. It's a happy ending for this man, hopefully this will also happen to other people that have their bitcoin locked out.",

If I remember this correctly, the Bitcoin price was around 1K USD back in 2013(during the first major bull run), so this guy did the right thing by investing in BTC and try the best he could to protect his wallet and passwords.There's a reason why all cold BTC wallets tell you to write your seed phrases and passwords on a piece of paper.

It is like a documentary with very interesting stories. And the stories told here are really very cool, it makes me wish I have some experience with ethical hacking. Learning that there are many people who have lost a lot of bitcoin through fault of theirs or not. Some are being able to be recovered and some are not. If Micheal, had created multiple backups that included the passwords and encryption keys and stored them in different locations, he would have saved himself, the 13.6BTC paid the hackers for their service.",

If hackers can guess the password and the software can regenerate the password, this means such a tool is not safe. Many people have lost their money because of the same problems, so I count this guy lucky. Losing such an amount can cause lifelong regret or even depression.",

However, I myself have seen many times that people are quite careless and use such simple passwords that they are easy to guess.However, in this specific case, this user was actually lucky, because if by any chance he (without a program) generated and lost such a password, the chances of breaking it would be minimal.",

I see that what this person did in the past has become outdated due to the lack of other safer alternatives available now. It is advisable to avoid using generate or manage password programs because, as we have seen, these programs can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited, thus putting the wallet owner at great risk. Indeed, since Roboform has now been developed into an online mode, it has lost the security factor it previously had.",
