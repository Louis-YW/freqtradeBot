I mean unless ypu literally had coin on the site and completely lost it then you could determine it.  But in terms of price going up or down you can't specifically say it was directly related to tlftx closing or not.  Am I missing something here in terms of what you are asking?",

Literally on FTX then we are just the same since i dont hold any funds on that platform but cant really deny that in overall which it did might cause to contribute on the current bear market that we are facing today.2. Not that much since we arent that moving high and we are still sitting  on probable bottom but it is really good to see that at least we do have that normal day on seeing some green candles.Most of the coins that i've been holding is mostly on inside top #10 coins in the market which we know that it is much worth on holding it out rather making yourselfdo play with those low  caps.",

Since Bitcoin was affected by the collapse of FTX it's also the same as the altcoins since we know that the price of altcoins was tied up with the Bitcoin price.  Another is the data that you've submitted on the FTX might be lost or who knows it will become at risk.2. When FUD was widely spread, it takes too long for the FUD that will disappear, which create panic among the people that resulted from the price of Bitcoin going down.  But yeah, I saw now the slow recovery of the price but it's too early to say it is because it could be a normal resistance.",

Many altcoins were impacted and fell down too which are not good for people who have too many altcoins in their portfolios.The crash of FTT is still smaller than a crash of LUNA token that could impact more people individually but in market generally LUNA token crash had smaller impact.

The FTX crash only caused bitcoin to drop from $17k to $15.5k, so it's safe to say the damage isn't significant.

Now the crash happened close to the FTX incident and for the same everything is connected to it.You have a good point. When FTX crashed, bitcoin was worth $17k; after news of FTX crash was announced, bitcoin dropped to $15k. According to me, this is not a big drop so I can't say that FTX is the cause of the market's downturn. We started a bear cycle from the end of December 2021, and bitcoin plummeted from $69k to $30k, then the Luna crash caused bitcoin to drop even more. With or without FTX, the market will crash as we are in a market winter cycle, and in each of those cycles, there will always be more reasons for bitcoin to plummet.",

And it also good that you took advantage of the present condition to restock your portfolio with new buying since this is the best time to buy.
