It is what it is  .Just the other day, someone who picked up interest to invest in Bitcoin was actually seeking my attention so I could explain to him a few things about Bitcoin. In the middle of our discussion, he asked me if I think he can still make any good profit from Bitcoin, due to the fact that the price is currently too high; the price for that day was $42k. Then, I returned the question to him and asked him: How much was the last all-time high price for Bitcoin?He stare in confusion before saying that he didn't know about Bitcoin's all-time high.So my question to anyone reading this now is: do you guys believe that there are people who may have an interest in Bitcoin but don't know the last ATH price of Bitcoin?OP, you are right in your statement. Considering the 2021 Bitcoin ATH, the price is still cheap now, and there is still every possibility that those who invest now will make a profit.",

I once had a colleague that does bitcoin hold and trade, but when I asked how he does it, he just said that by intuition, he really doesn't have an idea of what he is doing, just hoping he will earn from what he is doing. From that, I gave him the advice that he should know what he is doing first because bitcoin investment is not a joke or just relying on intuition to earn. So yeah, many people are not aware of the existence of bitcoin, but there are also those who know about it and start investing but don't know the true essence of what bitcoin is.",

Because crypto currency seems to be integrated with the sophistication and progress of today's era. Therefore, the potential of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin looks brighter in the future. But we actually don't know what the future will be like, because sometimes the world changes.However, in my opinion, even though bitcoin and cryptocurrency do have good potential, if they want to replace paper currency, it seems like it is still just a theory. Because it is not that easy to replace the currency that is already circulating throughout the country, and replace it with crypto currency. Indeed, now El Salvador has proven that cryptocurrency or bitcoin can be used for transactions, but what I want to know is, do El Salvadorans still use paper money or not?But regarding investment, I really agree that investing in them (btc, crypto) is very good. Because currently bitcoin continues to experience significant price increases. So to use it as an investment asset, it would be very good.",

I recently checked the chart of Bitcoin in 1 year perspective and that confirmed your words. Based on that timeframe of the chart Bitcoin keeps on moving upward from 2011 to 2024. So what are we waiting for? Accumulating Bitcoins via DCA right now even in portions will surely give us the higher chance to make pretty decent profit in the future.",

I am sure a lot of common people do not think the same way as yours. Bitcoin is indeed a life changing investment. But when Bitcoin was initially launched, it was a currency system and not an investment. But as per the free market, it has become an investment. Also it is not necessary to think that everyone who invest in Bitcoin will make a whole lot of money. There are people who had lost money in Bitcoin. So it is always better to take a cautious route to invest in Bitcoin and one should not invest 100% of their money into Bitcoin.",

I don't also think that Bitcoin is designed to replace fiat but to be a viable alternative. However, Bitcoin awareness and adoption are gradually increasing which means that more people will keep joining the crypto space. Most people in my locality think that Bitcoin is a scam because they expect to make quick money from investing in the coin. When they fail to make a profit within a few months, they assume that it is not worth investing in. Bitcoin is a long-term investment and not like shitcoins that can be pumped and dumped cheaply.      QuoteBitcoin is a digital currency that has come to stay, as long as the internet stays , most persons that didn't believe in Bitcoin 10years ago regretted it, that will be also be the case for people who don't be in it now come 2034.so think positively take the risk and Investment in Bitcoin today.Bitcoin faced so many attacks and opposition from governments, corporations and some influential individuals. But it has been able to withstand these attacks and keep breaking new ground. The recent approval of the ETF by the US SEC is an indication that Bitcoin has become a major player in the global financial system. Just like other dominant currencies, it has come to stay.",

Haven't looked into further problems where bitcoin completely replaces paper money because in the country where I live bitcoin is only legal as an investment asset and that means the relationship between bitcoin and paper currency still has enough of their respective roles without replacing each other. Bitcoin can be invested as a short-term or long-term step because it depends on how someone expects rewards, although sometimes investing in Bitcoin has much more potential if done in the long term because it is able to maintain value and provide maximum profits.There are many people who don't believe in bitcoin and that is the case until now, but the growth of bitcoin is increasingly widespread with support for greater adoption. People do not realize how bitcoin can maintain the value of investments made as long as it is not influenced by panic and perhaps because knowledge narrow makes people unable to see the opportunities generated by bitcoin.",
