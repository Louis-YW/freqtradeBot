In fact, Pirate Robers got jailed before Binance started, all because he was running the silk road. I always thought that Silk Road was a place that was \"needed\", doesn't mean that I say it's a good thing or a bad thing, I am not taking sides here.But, it meant that there is a need for a market like that, and people are doing it with or without silk road, at least it could be monitored. I would say that if there were illegal things going on, stopping silk road wasn't the way to go, it would be catching criminals who used silk road should have been the path instead.",

      "body": "I think the title seems exaggerated since based on the graph of the article above, the high illicit sources in Binance already drop significantly right now after forcing all users to perform KYC. Of course after the system detect something suspicious, Binance can check the personal information of those accounts and froze their coins. They will ask more KYC to get more data and if the problem is really serious, it's possible Binance will contact police to arrest him.",

Good to read.I did not really read the article but I think what it is pointing to is that Binance was a hub for illicit activities in the past, that would be before making their customers to forcefully get verified. But in 2021, Binance told their customers to provide KYC documents or they should withdraw their coins on their exchange before certain deadline. Even if illicit activities is now reduced on Binance, that does not change the fact that it is still a centralized exchanges and that exchanges can be hacked, a good reason to use noncustododial wallet if not trading.",

Honestly, I don't have time to read them all. Personally, I don't like some things on Binance but it commonly happens with giant companies. When they are big, they make mistakes and small mistakes from giant should be big for community. At the moment, we don't have better option than Binance, until we have a better one. It will be like how Binance took over Poloniex and Bitrex leading positions in crypto exchange market in 2017.",

I remember many exchangers including binance had zero KYC tasks with some limited fund transfer on 24 hours basis. However as soon as criminal activities started to go up things are out of hand now. Not just this, in some cases governments are also pushing the stringent rules in the market so that crypto can be crumbled into non useful system.",

While this news here looks normal because binance is the biggest and the most known exchange.It is easy to trade big amounts here, no wonder why it is being preferred by the criminals that stoles bigger amounts but being the biggest should also mean that they are much stricter and their security is more stronger than most of the crypto exchangers so how come those criminals can get in and out of this exchange easily?

They can use a lot of people that are willing to submit KYC in the platform.So for me, they can go around this KYC requirement because some may not really be using their own info.But rather, asking different people to do their trading. And they can distribute it so it won't give an alarm.This is why, it is good that binance is already asking KYC for all users, maybe, to protect also the platform and to comply the government regulations.",

Remember that some money goes into Binance exchanges as hackers tries to liquidate the money but the good thing here, Binance knows what to do. We’ve been experiencing a lot lately, Binance remains a good site or exchange for traders and investors so I believe, no matter what negative articles about Binance, they will still prevail and remain on top, they are ready for this.",

Their exchange has a lot of volume making hackers to be their best target. The ronin network hack issue recently also used multiple binance accounts to convert the funds that they stole.This should be a reminder to us that even the biggest exchange can't be trusted. We should not put our crypto assets on exchanges if it's long term investment. It's better to put it on non-custodial wallet where we have complete control of our assets.",
