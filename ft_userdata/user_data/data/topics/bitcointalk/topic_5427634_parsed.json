I do agree that maybe in the background there have been leaps and bounds as far as QC is. But I doubt that they are doing this just to break bitcoin, there are more uses of it and for sure government knows that instead of targeting wallets that has like 50 BTC as you describe.And if ever they will be broken, maybe it's time for bitcoin to go one move step further and improved and be QC resistant again?",

The real fear is the ability to crack private keys, which I think is still likely several decades away.As far as I know, if quantum computers doesn't know the public key, then it will still have difficulty in getting the private key.So yeah it will take years though before probably a good model of quantum computers will be out to crack private keys of exposed public keys. But for sure those quantum computers will not be in the hands of just ordinary individual to play around. Usually this quantum computers are houses in a more sophisticated places or in a safe place. And obviously, bitcoin developers could have been looking for plan B already if this so called quantum computing threat becomes a reality.",

Even allowing for a whole day, this figure only drops to 13 million qubits. This is reassuring news for bitcoin owners because current machines have only a tiny fraction of this – IBM’s record-breaking superconducting quantum computer has only 127 qubits, so devices would need to become a million times larger to threaten the cryptocurrency, something Webber says is unlikely to happen for a decade.",
