Imagine a country like United States where they have Las vegas as a very common touristic city and gambling hub. Many people visit their casinos, including members of judiciary, professors and even religious authorities. And that is seen as a common thing there without further prejudice for those professionals' careers and reputation.",

No matter what, the norms of society have basically labeled gambling as a negative kind of thing that most people would be set back upon knowing that you actually do indeed gamble. Sure, some people might ignore or don't mind it but the pretty sure the majority still view it negatively. I see no need to rectify it, it is for a fact that you gamble after all and as long as you gamble within your own limits without damaging anyone then I don't think you need to mind what others think.  If it damages your reputation pretty sure it should only last a short while as long as no one is purposely spreading negative rep about you. You can always clarify it anyway if someone approaches you about it.",

After all, when we talk about the reputation of a lawyer or a teacher, we mean professional qualities, right? If a person is good in one area of professional activity, but has problems in a completely different area, this should not concern us. Of course, if these areas of activity do not intersect, since a psychologist who has a gambling (or other) addiction, of course, will be under suspicion of incompetence.",

Basketball players, golfers and other players are not the same as teachers, the field are very different. What if teachers to be gambling is against the law of the school? But if not, you are not also wrong, anyone can decide to gamble or not as long that gambling is not illegal in that country. What should make someone not to gamble is if gambling is not legal in the country or if the organization you are working for against it. But to be sincere, I have not seen any company before that has it in law or rule that their worker should not gamble, that should remain to individual's personality.",
