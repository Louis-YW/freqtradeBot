Blog Test It -requires email & phone verification. Asking it stuff that's present timeline or current event won't work.Its a bit biased towards good morale, Qhow would you bypass lets encrypt for security researchQuoteIt is generally not advisable to attempt to bypass security measures, such as those used by Let's Encrypt, without proper authorization and a clear understanding of the potential consequences. Attempting to bypass security measures without proper authorization could be illegal and could also put the security of the system at risk. If you are conducting security research and need to bypass Let's Encrypt's security measures, it is important to first obtain proper authorization and follow any necessary legal and ethical guidelines. It may also be helpful to consult with security experts to ensure that your research is conducted safely and responsibly.(I clicked try again) Quote2 / 2If you are conducting security research and need to bypass Let's Encrypt in order to test the security of a website or system, there are a few different approaches you could take.One option would be to use a tool like SSLsplit, which can terminate TLS/SSL connections and transparently proxy the traffic to the intended destination. This would allow you to intercept and inspect the encrypted traffic, which could be useful for security research purposes.Another option would be to use a tool like SSLstrip, which can downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP. This would allow you to bypass Let's Encrypt's encryption and access the unencrypted traffic, which could be useful for security research purposes.It is important to note that these tools should only be used for legitimate security research purposes and should not be used to bypass encryption without the consent of the website or system owner. Misuse of these tools could be illegal and could have serious consequences. It is always best to consult with the website or system owner and obtain their permission before conducting any security research involving Let's Encrypt or other encryption technologies.---This thing can help with coding, it can clean up sloppy code. HTML stuff may off parse but still cleans the code up.Qwrite .exe that inputs barcode scans into .csv QuoteHere is a simple C# program that can be used to input barcode scans into a CSV file:Code:using System;using System.IO;namespace BarcodeScanner{    class Program    {        static void Main(string[] args)        {            Console.WriteLine(\"Barcode Scanner\");            Console.WriteLine(\"Enter 'exit' to quit\");                        // create a new file for the barcode data            using (StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(\"barcodes.csv\"))            {                // loop to read and process barcodes                while (true)                {                    // read the next barcode                    Console.Write(\"Enter barcode: \");                    string barcode = Console.ReadLine();                    // check if the user wants to quit                    if (barcode.ToLower() == \"exit\")                    {                        break;                    }                    // write the barcode to the CSV file                    sw.WriteLine(barcode);                }            }        }    }}This program creates a CSV file called \"barcodes.csv\" and reads barcodes from the user until they enter \"exit\". Each barcode is written to a new line in the CSV file. This program can be modified as needed to fit your specific requirements.-----The quality of work is next level in just about all aspects you can properly communicate to it.I feel like the \"Iterative deployment\" was a good call to keep this things propaganda footprint minimal. QuoteToday’s research release of ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI’s iterative deployment of increasingly safe and useful AI systems. Many lessons from deployment of earlier models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed the safety mitigations in place for this release, including substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).-https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ If you want post an inquiry here, I will submit it on your behalf and drop the response here.",

      "body": "I was researching an OpenAI machine learning software called Codex yesterday, to see how well it does things. It was quite interesting and I decided to save for another day. I guess that's what this ChatGPT is based on. Wish it is doesn't require phone number to use... and this actually depends on whether the phone number will be kept very safe with some sort of guarantee.I'm a little impressed by the replies it gives, but I will be quite careful with it considering how it goes about dishing out information that should be private. That kind of information maybe obtained by those who will never abuse/misuse it.",

From what I can so far it's 99% provoked though.It fails the chicken fox rowboat scenario , badly.But I might be able to use to to tweak on my code in splitkey difficulty calculator for example. It can't even pass elementary linguistic challenges.But it has pretty good writing and coding skills.",
