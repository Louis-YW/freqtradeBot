(Some thermal pad pieces is really hard to remove.)I use toothbrush to remove all napkin pieces.Then I use alchol to clean. I always change all pads on graphic cards. (Not only memory side.)Normally, I m so carefull. But my litlle sweety 11-month-years old baby was crying. I was in a rush that graphic card.I think there was a little piece napkin. I m not sure.24 minutes ETHW mining was good. Then rig reboot itself and I saw that gpu has an error.Maybe the napkin burnt and short circuit.I clean the graphic card properley again. There is no burnt parts.Maybe fuse protection. I think I can change the fuse or short circuit, it will work.I know it s my fault. I want to fix it. I was used to repairing cell phones at the past. I have tools for it.But i never repair graphic card. By the way, This graphic card has two pcie power socket.First one is for PCIE socklet 1, Second one is for PCIE socket 2.Third one is for report a problem. But what problem ? Shor circuit ?How could I learn which ones are fuse ?Rig1:Rig2:Graphic Card:",

Running a different card in thesame slot with the same risers would rule out a slot issue as well as a riser issue.Since the cards are (assumed) identical it should also rule out a power issue.Eliminate everything it isn't and you're left with what it is.",

There may or may not be fuses, you need to look at the diagram. If there is no video card cdiagram, then you can check the resistance of each power circuit after the throttle for a short circuit.This may be your mistake, or it may not be yours, but just a coincidence.

If the repair will be expensive, then send the video card to the EVGA warranty service.",
