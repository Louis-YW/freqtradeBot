  "content": "Posted this earlier today about coinify: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405723They have not run with peoples money nor as of now have I heard about them blocking withdraws. BUT they are now in bankruptcy so what they want to do may not matter it's up to the courts and lawyers.Anyway, I was thinking of a separate board about things like this. Putting it in reputation may or may not be seen. Similarly putting it into services > exchanges may not be viewed by people if they are not having an issue why look. But rather just some place more like important announcements https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=87.0 that others can post to.Otherwise I can see things like this getting buried. May or may not matter that much. But between them, Compass Mining https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396462.0 and all the others I can see a separate board being useful. There is so much news out there so many things get lost in the noise. It would not be definitive but it would be a place to glace to see what went to shit this week.Would think it would be best if posting was supposed to be like the press board with everything starting with a date.  More like the 'bad press board' :-)I don't think it's going to happen, but would be nice to have.-Dave",

But rather just some place more like important announcements https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=87.0 that others can post to.If a special board (warning board) is created for a special case as what you presented above, two things will happen.People will likely use the board for posts that needed to be in reputation. They will think that posting the case in warning board will give it wider and urgent publicity.The board will also be crowded and important messages would end up being burriedI therefore support your idea but with a modification. If the Warning board is created, only moderators would be allowed to post in it. Then, an extreme case in reputation as the one you pointed out or obvious scams would be moved to the board only by admins and iff agreed my majority in reputation.",

The forum does not moderate for accuracy of posts, and I don't think the forum is going to be willing to moderate based on the perceived severity of the allegation.I think the most appropriate section for the coinify thread would be service discussion. Users may not specifically check that particular section, however hopefully google will rank said thread high in their search results, and anyone searching for that service will see your warning.",

As for the suggestion the OP made, I'm in for it. I believe it will help keep a great deal of people out of financial hurt and losses if they get warned where they can see it on time.",

Just give a mention about something that is important but, never made a separate post that other people may have seen in a better section of the forum where it might have gotten more eyes on it.

Reputation board is more to the events involves forum users. With the current setting I think Service Discussion board is appropriate. After seeing OP this was the board that came first in mind.
