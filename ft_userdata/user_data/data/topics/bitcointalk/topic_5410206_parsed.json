  "content": "Hello everyone!In a nutshell, I want to run UA Cyber Shield with VPN ( https://prnt.sc/MkuKxSEz7YrB ) because is more efficient but it has negative effects on other applications when I turn on VPN, including Bitcoin Core (I can't get incoming connections anymore). When I turn off the VPN, all apps (including Btc Core) automatically start working properly.How do I solve it? I don't have a favourite vpn brand, I just want something to work with full node and preferrably cheap.No political discussions, please.Thank you!",

Depending on your VPN provider, you may be able to forward that port (or set a different one). My favourite VPN has instructions for it.Suggestion: if you want to use the VPN for only one specific application, can you run it in a VM?",

I can't speak to others but I have seen it with those products. Having nothing to with BTC but it should follow the same rules as other apps. So you may go out but others might not let you in. -Dave",
