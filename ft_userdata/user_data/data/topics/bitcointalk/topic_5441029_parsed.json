      "body": "^^^ You open up a whole bunch of questions... a whole theme of questions. They are based around doing what is best for people, and especially the older generation. But the same questions can often be applied to children to some extent. What is best includes what the mindset of elderly people was while they could think clearly. In other words, what would the elderly person want done to him/her, and when should one override their wishes because their thinking was not the best for them.It's easy for a relative or medical person or government official to think that they are benefiting an elderly person, when they really are not. You can see it happen all the time. And much of the time, the supposed benefits for the elderly are things that could be applied to anyone, but the benefactors aren't doing it for themselves, even though they want to apply it to other people.A crude example of this is somebody who wants to euthanize elderly people to reduce the population. The elderly people don't want to die. So, why doesn't the proponent of euthanization simply commit suicide to reduce the population, if he is that sure of his population thinking.Do what is good for the elderly. Reconsider all your ideas about what is really good for them before you apply it to them.",
