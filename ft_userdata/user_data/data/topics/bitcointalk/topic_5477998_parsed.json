      "body": "Relying on one source of income has become difficult, but many do not have the option to have a side business, such as starting a small business and growing it gradually, either because there is not enough money, or there is no space, or there is no time and experience, or problems in marketing and reaching customers, so it is better to try. You should start investing early and at a young age, and when you reach the age of thirty, then you will think about starting a family, and then you will have surplus money and experiences.",

And if the salary is only enough to meet our needs, we also have to think about this when we are still working to find a side job or additional income so that we can save or invest according to our abilities.And with all that, you will not experience difficulties and destruction when you are fired from your job, and that way you can open a business or anything from your savings or investments and you can also continue doing your side job. Because in the current economic conditions we are required to be smart in living a life that does not only rely on one source of income, because we never know what will happen in the future. So preparing an umbrella before it rains is very important, you have to think and plan in advance while you are still working, otherwise you will suffer.And for this problem there is no need to question or ask other people or anyone else, because they will not care and living independently is much happier and more enjoyable.",

Do you think that if everyone in the world became an entrepreneur, would your business or company still have a way to make money? I mean, if you don't have manpower or employees, can you do it alone?Yes, it is true that it is not enough to have only one source of income these days if you are not a rich person. But there are many opportunities that can be added besides being an employee. As long as we have time and can manage it properly. But I don't believe that when you only have one job, it is equivalent to suicidal. In this matter, you are wrong.",

Will you still be financially strong, can your other sources of income keeps you going or you will be devastated by the loss of your job. It's necessary to have another source of income if you are working for someone so it can help you prepare for the rainy day but also understand this op, that it's not everyone that's capable of managing their own businesses. There's so many factors to consider when doing that and these are just a few to outline.- financial risk; There's a lot of risks involved in managing your business as you'd need to have a substantial amount before you can start and if eventually things don't go as planned, you run into loss and end up not getting any substantial income.Secondly, the stress of doing two things at a time can really tell on you eventually as to start a business, you ought to know that you are the business which means you have to balance your time working for someone else and working for yourself. The rewards of owning your own business is there but many people will prefer having the knowledge they can get from their present place of work, then resigning or retiring to go start theirs than juggling two jobs at a time. Except, the 9-5 job isn't as stressful.  Your advice is well meaning but at the same time you have to consider that everyone operates differently.",

Don't put your financial destiny in the hands of your bosses, you might not know the importance of having your own business till you have been sacked. think about it.I would add - wherever you work - always create an alternative income option. From your personal business, to investments ! Always keep in mind that there are a lot of risks, with a probability higher than 0, that you will be left without your current job. It can be anything - problems in business, global changes, corruption, natural disasters. And having no alternative source of income, you may wake up one fine morning and realize that now you have NO income, if you have not prepared a \"reserve airfield\" in advance. And it will be very painful to realize.... ALWAYS create at least 1 spare income channel, MINIMUM 1 spare, but more is better",

I would say we need to have multiple streams of income and we can take example of an YouTube or Influencer as they earn through the view time, paid adverts, Merchandise promotion, Affiliate Marketing and much more. We need to upgrade our skill and probably have more than one job/business in order to survive because those who believe thier 9-5 job will be with them forever they are living in delusion.",

      "body": "Yep, I have also faced this problem, but in a quite different situation, I have been more proactive in my own life because I see my work as a contribution to the business/government. The government did what I could to help them, and I fully accepted that if I was fired, perhaps my qualifications were not suitable for that position. So anticipating risky situations in life, such as unemployment, is probably also part of preparing for life. For me, it is not fixed to have only one job to find income to spend on life. Although my current life may seem like a waste to many people, it is one that I have struggled to decide, I am living in a small, quite peaceful rural area. So the problems of office life or competition are all things that I have experienced, and it helps me reflect on myself and the true meaning of the life I am living. So, facing the situation and trying to develop an increasingly bigger mindset, I look back at society and see chaos everywhere, from issues of food, health, work, material,...But that thing in my eyes is quite trivial, and although there are things that are still easy to force, I think simplification through returning to balance without paying attention to counting distractions will make life a lot easier.",

Sometimes I think a lot about finding a partner, because alone it's very complicated. If your having difficulty in decision making you should stick to what keeps you comfortable or maybe you can consult an advances economist to broaden your knowledge about income generation through such conversation you can find an area of interest and go into it and make good profit hence having another source of income. If I may suggest to you a business line weather your knowledge about it or not you can own it and employ some workers to manage it for you, business like pharmacy; you don't need to be an expert on it if you have the capital you can register with the legal Institutes of Health and publish a pharmacy employ a pharmacist. that's one of the business that can profit you because it has to do with health and it doesn't have a season because people sick everyday and need to be healthy so the location and capital is just required. If you're due for marriage bro you can take a bold step to the other path of manhood and at least you will have an assistance in your area of business while doing other activities.",

It is true that we don't have to rely in a 1 source of income because we have no guarantee that it will last for a lifetime and it is possible that something will change in the future so we should always be prepared but let's be real here, finding other source of income is not that easy in terms of time and money and that is one of the common problem to us. Having your own business requires a lot of time and effort which is somehow might cause a neglegence in your work, unless you're good at time management or your have other people who's willing to support and help you in your business.",

You will get paid accordingly because they have better economy and low population.But this is completely different in third world country, it's hard to get job and if you get, you need to accept low payment and extra work e.g. if the job is from 9AM to 5 PM, you will be asked to arrive in 8 AM and work for 2-3 hours more without getting any extra payment because if you don't accept it, they can easily fired you as there are many people still interested due to high population = high unemployment.",

There are those who simply aren't business-minded. Starting a business isn't easy. Sustaining it is even harder. Sticking to it, embracing the responsibilities, need no less than devotion or commitment. Another factor is that business is an investment. Meaning, it needs a starting capital. To many who are fully salary-dependent, starting a business is only a goal because they simply cannot afford it, or at least the kind of business they want to have isn't easily within reach. Another factor is that investing in a business is risky. While the goal is to have another source of income, it could happen that the business itself is the cause that all savings is drained. This has happened to many.",

About business idea, first I will say look into the work you’re employed to do and think if it is possible to do same business even if it’s small. If your work doesn’t fit a business, then you can actually do a market survey to see what your locality lacks and if it fits your capital you can start. You can employ a family member to help in the running of the business because sometimes it is hard to cope if you’re employed to another organization.
