Bitcoin network consumes lot of electricityIf 0.1% of the total energy produced on a global level is a lot, then what about some other consumers who spend much more and do immeasurable damage to the environment? Bitcoin is very insignificant in this regard, regardless of the fact that the mainstream media persistently pushes that story.Quote from: developeron29 on August 01, 2022, 07:33:42 AM4. Satoshi Nakamoti hodls the maximum BitcoinsAn assumption, not a fact. It has never been proven how many Bitcoins Satoshi mined, so although it is assumed that it is a larger amount, all the numbers that appear in the public are just speculations.Quote from: developeron29 on August 01, 2022, 07:33:42 AM8. You can earn Bitcoin through MiningTrue, but in order to earn Bitcoin through mining, you need a lot of money to set up a mining farm, and to pay all the costs that arise from such an operation. The days of Bitcoin mining with personal computers are a thing of the past.Quote from: developeron29 on August 01, 2022, 07:33:42 AM15.

Bitcoin reached its All Time High on 11 Nov 2021You just told us Bitcoin reached its All Time High on 11 Nov 2021 without mentioning the actual value the ATH was because there are people who will love to know, of which I guess was around $68kQuote4. Satoshi Nakamoti hodls the maximum BitcoinsAnd you just told us that Satoshi Nakamoti hodls the maximum Bitcoins without telling us the exact number it is, of which I think he hodls around 1million BitcoinQuote12. Satoshis are smaller units of BitcoinAnd Satoshi is also the name of the inventor of Bitcoin (Satoshi Nakamoto)Quote14. 10,000 Bitcoins were spent to buy pizza in 2010While the name of the person who spent the 10000 Bitcoin on two pizzas is called Laszlo Hanyecz",

These are some interesting facts about bitcoin and i thought i'll share it with the community~Sorry but I think that some of your facts are not really that interesting because some of us know's it already like in your number one. We know that the latest ath of btc occurred last year but it would be better if you will start on the first ath of btc as that seems more historical and I think that many of us didn't know the exact date yet. Your number 2 seems also wrong.Yes, btc is now more expensive compared on its early days but I think that many people have successfully accumulated 1 btc for their long years of stay here. There's also bear runs which can cause btc value to dip and this makes it easier for the people to buy more bitcoin.",

How many total bitcoin addresses can be created? Is it an infinite set or does the number of possible addresses have a finite value? Could there come a moment in the future when all addresses will be used and it will be impossible to create a new one?
