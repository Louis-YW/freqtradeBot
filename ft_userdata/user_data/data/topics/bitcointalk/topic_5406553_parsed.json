  "content": "Hello all,I am new to this forum. I would like to introduce myself as Frasz. English is not my native language but I will do my best.Sorry if the topic is not in the correct path if so please move the topic to the correct one.I wanted to make a altcoin from the bitcoin source code and was able to do so with all kinds of information on the internet.I made a coin named bitmunt I know it sounds corny as it means bitcoin in my native language Dutch.The coin itself did not show any errors after compiling and after lot of trial/error I was able to create a new blockchain with the source code.Since it was for fun I didn't change much and left the 21 milion coins as the original Bitcoin.I used version 17.0.2 of the bitcoin core source code from Github and made all the changes in linux 16.04 and migrated the source code to 18.04.Today I hooked my virtual machine and created a clone (bridged) and did the basic changes in bitmunt.confSince I am using a 17.02 version of bitcoin core I was unable to mine with setgenerate. This seems to have been removed for some reason.I tried setgenerate 1 but it stopped so I made a script called mine.sh and was able to mine on both instance in the virtual machine.As of right now I have 2 blocks mined. The difficulty is set to 1.I have a question: is it normal that it mines the blocks in 30 min instead of the 10 min it should be ? I set it as the original bitcoin not much was changed since it was just to test if I was able to recreate my own crypto Altcoin of the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto.I am of course not able to post anything on here as a new member with pictures as much as I wished I could.When I do a ./bitmunt-cli getmininginfo I see the following:{\"blocks\":2,\"currentblockweight\": 4000,\"currentblocktx\": 0,\"difficulty\": 1,\"networkhashps\": 567.2190108964646,\"pooledtx\": 0,\"chain\": \"main\",\"warnings\": \"\"}Also I wonder since I made a script called mining.sh it shows me that it is mining with the following below until it finds a block.][][][This continious until it finds a block.CPU is AMD and usage is around 70% and I have 30 gb ram on the laptop.Is it normal for the coin to find a block every 30 minutes with a difficulty of 1?Thank you for reading any feedback is appreciated.",

Probably the difficulty is a tad high for the total hash power. I am not sure if it could retarget difficulty to lower than 1, I think not.Currently 71% in use mining on both virtualmachines with around +- 2.62 GHz.I think it is possible to change to a lower difficulty but then I will have to kill the current blockchain and recreate a new one. But I don’t want to mine thousands of coins at one go. It wouldn’t make sense. But Thank you for the comment and thinking with me.",

Please correct me does it mean if a older version of bitcoin source code was used with cpu mining available the 10 min would have worked better ? To calculate with difficulty of 1 using a self made script could possibly be causing the limitation? I need to check this and try to get a miner . My laptop also has a build in GPU AMD Radeon (TM) Vega 6 Graphics but it is not being used much 1-2% but it is showing 61*C. I shut down the mining activity for a few days today I resumed and checked in total 850 coins in immature balance and on the main one 1850 coins. But it works. Thanks",

But It takes 100% longer then 10 minutes with CPU.That's called luck. BTW 100% more than 10 minutes in not 100 minutes, it's 20. You meant 10x.What miner are you using? What difficulty are you mining at? What's your hash rate? Do you find blocks at the estimated TTF statistically over time?",
