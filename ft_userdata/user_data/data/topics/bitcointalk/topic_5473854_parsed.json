      "body": "The best way to key your bitcoin wallet safe is to keep the recovery key or private key save from any other person including your dear ones such as close friends and family. It is not everything that people around you must know about you especially as it deals with your asset. We've seen cases where brothers go into battlegrounds simply because of inheritance that has been kept for them to take.Human beings are selfish by nature and they have this thing within them that motivate or instigate them to go that route so, the best way to avoid somethings is by keeping them private to yourself which includes your seed phrase.Your private key is so important and delicate to the level that you are advised not to upload it anywhere online in any cloud storage. Instead you should have it stored offline and keep it up to yourself. There are a few ways you can store your private key offline which is through hardware written on paper, through custodial and noncustodial cold wallets.The custodial wallets are when you allow your exchange company to store the keys for you whereas in noncustodial you do that yourself. The danger in allowing other company's store it for you is once their server or database is hacked into, your asset is probably gone forever but custodial wallets can be of advantage to small and new bitcoin users who have meager resources on their wallet.On the flip side, the noncustodial wallet is an example of Ledger Nano X which you make use of yourself to take care of your key. Whichever one you do have their advantages of disadvantages but the best is to always have your private key secured in an offline physical storage where you can always access in years time.",

Second, buy a hardware wallet to store your bitcoins. And as far as your mnemonic phrase, write it down, make a back-up but don't used your email to store it or cloud or anything that is connected to the internet. Even if it is password protected, hackers are very smart and you just don't know how easy for them to break that password.And if you wanted to go beyond, you can create an offline wallet: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html.

In every discussion I've seen, many people have commented on this topic in a very nice way, and those comments have been accurate in keeping Bitcoin wallets safe. The first step to secure a Bitcoin wallet is that the user should first use a more secure wallet. If we use a wallet with more security in the initial state, then we do not have to be in a dilemma whether we have selected the right wallet or not. The name of the hardware will come first in the case of results that will give more security, if you do not have the facility to use hardware wallets, there are some mobile wallets that are very secure, you can use those wallets if you want. Another important aspect of keeping your Bitcoin wallet safe is to keep your wallet's personal information and wallet's private key only to yourself and ensure that no one else knows your wallet's private key. If planned and implemented in this way, a user can keep his Bitcoin wallet safe.",

If the wallet in which we store our bitcoins is not fully secured then there is a possibility of our bitcoins being hacked or stolen. So whatever is necessary to maintain the security of the wallet must be done. The security system of the wallet especially the 12/24 wordphases should be stored in such a way that they are not lost or stolen. Strong passwords are required to prevent the wallet server from being hacked and you must keep my device secure so that no one can gain access to your device.",

The reason for this is that, if you don't have your private keys or seed phrase, then you don't own the bitcoin, the custodial platforms can decide to prank you for maintenance and then they run away from that spot, many cases have been discussed.If you must save your wallet on any place, it should be a hardware wallet. With such simple device, your bitcoin is not connected to the internet, you can have a seed phrase during set up which serve as the main access to your bitcoin and make sure that the seed phrase is properly kept in a safe location inscribe in any metallic plate that can serve as fire resistant.
