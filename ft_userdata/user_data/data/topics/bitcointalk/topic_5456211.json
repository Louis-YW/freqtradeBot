  "content": "I think from my side is something worth to be celebrating because I never can tell in life that I could earn from this forum..It all started by December 17, 2021, 04:44:22 PM when I joined this forum with no or less idea of bitcoin and to whatever they called digital currencies. As time goes I never pay attention to this forum anymore because I didn't know my left and right although I was regularly keep motivated by lots of people from my local board some keep calling me to know why I don't come online that much at some point I felt I can't continue anymore, coupled with my baby girl disturbing etc. I was totally off until I created a topic that says \"Is there best way to seek people's attention on bitcoin?\" At this point some people suggested for me to be a partaker of this I must first hold some fractions of bitcoin to know how it works, which I also went further to explore those advise given to me by some members by also giving a prove of my purchase of bitcoin titled \"How I decided to buy some fractions of BTC after discussion with members here\".Then next was I created another topic saying \"Was it that easy to learn a reputable member posting format?, I think with some replies I got over this thread boosted my understanding to start being good and develop attitudes of reading to the end of whatever post or anything they are saying, with gradual process I never knew my merits was as well increasing gradually till I found myself in a Full member rank, less I forget, I ones applied on bounty managed by well known manager, COMBO 1&2 which I never understand how it was till I came across the service section on a campaign by Julerz12, I applied according to the instruction and I noticed luckily selected to participate. It was like a joke to me but when I ended up given the required post I noticed I was paid, It was like a magic to me like wanting to know how happy you were then during your first paid. There are many things to say but I can't just expressed them all by writing here and I think had skipped lot of things but this are the few things that came to my mind since I can't make them words to words any longer.Therefore, I really want to thank everyone who had encouraged me mostly those that are from my local board including those who advised me to increased and learn a self posting pattern, although I mostly love how JayJuanGee do post. Sorry to say this, I am beginning to learn from JJ and few other members lols! All Thanks to Julerz12 because this shows how trusted and reliable he his, and please I do not make this post in any way to beg for merits so don't see my post as one, I only share to express how happy I am and how helpful this payment would be to me, after my first purchase of bitcoin I never sold it because some were saying I should hold till the next bitcoin halving and current there is no much increase and profits on the holding bitcoin, this additional payment revived my thinking of my previous investment although I never ran into that much lost but it gives me confident that I'm not on a lost anymore. However, If you think this post qualifies to earn some merits whom are mine to say No when my profile is clearly empty and ready to receive themÂ  .",

      "body": "Previously I've found several topics that are exactly the same as this, at first everyone would say this when earning the first earnings on the forum. Even though some members who join the forum say that money is not the main goal, the fact is that when the Signature Campaign was open, almost 90% of the members in the forum would apply there if they met the requirements the manager wanted.Being able to earn on forums is something to be proud of, it's not easy to compete with other members who have better quality posts, but you can be part of one of the signature campaigns managed by well-known managers on forums. Congratulations on your success in getting Bitcoin flakes on the forum after successfully defeating the feeling of tiredness and boredom in increasing knowledge which made you rank Full Member since you first registered on the forum.",
