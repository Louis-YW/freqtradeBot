The system is designed so that it suits them perfectly, whether it is accounts that are in their name, or some secret ones through which they hide their money in order to pay less tax. They are among the last in the world who would change that system, because if you think that they think that Bitcoin is better than fiat, then why don't they invest their wealth in it?Quote from: Outhue on December 04, 2022, 11:42:31 AMThis is why I strongly believe that Bitcoin will forever keep it's value intact, do make sure that you at least have 50% of your fund in Bitcoin...If you really believe in Bitcoin, then even 50% is too little - although that is the decision of each individual. For some, it may be too much, especially in the time we are in now, because some have a hard time bearing the fact that their investment has lost value and that they cannot know when it will reach the desired value again.",

It is even these rich people that are given peoples money as loan to invest with, so you don't expect them to come into fair and equal space like bitcoin.With all that said and also a bitcoin enthusiast I still believe it is way risky to put 50% of your worth or investment into it. Bitcoin is at a stage where it requires enough patience for long time holding and 50% might just be too much to lay off for a long time. So a 5-20% of investment will worth the risk.",

Bitcoin is an asset it is likely the same as gold the only difference Bitcoin is too volatile.And take note banks have their own security to protect your funds, unlike Bitcoin which depends on you how you protect your wallet.",

In any case your BTC shouldn't be kept in any exchange, but safe in self custody, i believe if one successfully protects their BTC from scammers they can't lose anymore, except such a person is greedy and impatient.",
