  "content": "As we Indians are so fond of shitcoin projects. I went ahead did some research and found a meme coin project that might get 5x after the launch. I am talking about Wall Street Memes ($WSM). I did went ahead and did some research and found this meme coin is brand new. The team behind it was able to raiseÂ  more than $1.5 million. They raised that sum of amount in pre-sale. In just four hours they were able to get that kind of amount. This project is backed by a reddit community that has been making fun of Wall Street for quite sometime now. I did check their website and found that you still can buy those tokens using either Ethereum blockchain or BSC blockchain. What do you guys think?",

I would request @pakhitheboss to shift this topic to that child board. Coming back to your question. Investing in Meme coin is too risky. Considering it is being promoted by a community from reddit I would say it is till risky. The reason behind it is the presale price which is $0.02 or nearby $0.03. The asking price is way above my expectations. I won't say they are FOMOing but considering the backing these guys have as a community it is worth investing i this project. I donot see any future for this project as in technical terms. I would say they would create memes that would hurt the sentiments of Wall Street and might disrupt the ongoing lies. Thanks.",

I had accidentally posted it on the main board. The project looks quite interesting to me at the moment. I know shitcoin is a shitcoin and doesn't come with any technical qualities. As indian love meme coins that is why I posted this topic.",

      "body": "a real friend of mine who died of corona btw (rip bud!) asked me about bitcoin a long time backand i told him what it is and left it up to him to invest in it or not.but he did his own research and got convinced that this new shitcoin (i don't even remember the name of) is the next best thing after bitcoinand came to me and told me i should invest in it too after he had invested upwards of 1 lakh rupees in it (i think it was 1000+- inr per coin)i told him, im good and that he had made a mistake and he left and we stopped talking for a while.fast forward 3 months later, the shitcoin he invested in was down to inr 3 from where it was and he couldn't even dump it off at that price.so, memecoin or shitcoin, i don't invest in any of this.",
