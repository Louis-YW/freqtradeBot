  "content": "Newbies, you are all welcome to this forum as you are in the right place to learn all angles of bitcoin and many more. It is easy to grow here, if you are ready to learn.  There is board here that is called local board in the forum.Local board is a board that was given by Theymos, to people from your country for easy discussion, so that you can learn and contribute in your native language for proper understanding and also to assist one  another.So many newbies here don't know that the forum has a local board for their countries, and they find it difficult to interact in their local language for easy understanding. When I first registered here, I didn't know that Nigeria has a local board and it took me three months before I finally saw our local board. I felt overwhelmed and felt at home the moment I visited the board, also it made me feel comfortable to ask questions there and also to contribute on topic been discussed in our local board. As a newbie, it is important that ypu identify yourself with your local board, because it will enable you to learn in your local language which might help you understand topics being discussed in the forum faster, and it will also make you grow faster, especially those people that English Language is their second language. Local board will make you also have good contact and have new friends from your country because, life doesn't end here in bitcointalk, since nobody knows tomorrow.Although, there are some countries that Theymos hasn't grant their request to give them their own local board, that shouldn't discourage you from posting there, because it is the number of people in a local board and how active that sub board is that will help to speed up the provision of your own local board. On the forum home page, if you scroll down, after alternative cryptocurrency, you will see where the local board is, scroll down to see if your country is also written there and if not, it means that your country hasn't been given a local board yet but you can also look for your country here Other languages. Bitcointalk is open for everyone in the world, so you should also enjoy posting in your local board here.This is the advantage of  a local board, a member got most of his merits from his local board, and got to Full Member rank.",

      "body": "Identifying with your local board would help you alot and your stay on this platform would enable you scale through successfully. Local boards encourage members here to enteract freely with themselves very much because the use of local dialect is encouraged as most members here do not speak English so therefore the local board would help them muete their presence here and building them through till they are very much equipped with knowledge and experience to be able to contribute their quota here to the development of their various boards. The idea of local board  is very helpful as it makes members relate very well.  You will meet with new friends here both reputable and new beginners within your country. This further helps on the Bitcoin awareness and adoption course because when the locals meet, they encourage themselves to start up a process that would attract the attention of the masses to Bitcoin which would warrant massive adoption as it is gradually doing now. I believe local boards can also in one way facilitate the speedy adoption of Bitcoin globally.",

      "body": "The idea for local board is actually a commendable one as it allows people from the same community to interact with one another in their native languages and to also discuss about their internal affairs such their government policies, bitcoin development, exchanges and local politics as well. It build confidence in newbies as the senior members from the local board guide them, correct them and make them to familiar from the local board to the wider general board.English is known to be a universal language but some people can not find it easy to communicate with it either in written form or verbally. This set of people interact more often in their local board than in general board because they feel among and in the midst of the colleague who speaks the same language with them. With the absence of local board, this particular groups will feel discouraged in the forum and may end up leaving the forum eventually. Although, it's not compulsory to belong or interact in local board but it is actually a good thing if you are opportune to have your people here in the forum.",

The legendary and other ranks help the new members in their native language. Most members do not understand the forum rules efficiently or they do not know the forum rules when they join their local board the member of those boards clarify how the forum work and how to do a quality post in short the local boards are like nursery where they are growing, Knowing about the form and more study about the bitcoin in their own country language through which they easily understand.

Newbies can make mistakes and be corrected with love easily on their local board. However such mistakes might lead to severe bashing in the international boards. It also makes new members more comfortable and confident since they are among countrymen. For non-English speaking members, the local board will be a good training ground to get used to the operations of the forum. It is not compulsory to join discussions but it could be very helpful. But some persons might have various reasons for not visiting their local board. Members might want to maintain absolute privacy and the international board is the most convenient to achieve it.",

Some of them are so good on their local boards that they contribute and help their community grow by contributing useful posts there, which I much adore. On local boards, you can always get the best answers to your queries in a pleasant manner that does not sound harsh, as some individuals believe they receive harsh responses from forum users. In contrast to the general board, it is simple and easy to respond to someone who speaks the same dialect as you since it is immediately understandable, relatable, and easily replied to as opposed to the general board where you find plenty users of different dialects that may not understand your point better than your country man.",

It may please you to know about our monthly overview by Igebotz. This initiative has fast developed the board and making members to be active while on-boarding of new members  also. So far it has contributed to the growth of this platform because more Nigerians have registered so far and also creating of bitcoin awareness and adoption. I  believe these are just the few amongst the numerous reasons why our request was granted to have our own local board.",

And when I found out, I was very happy to find a thread in my native language, in which all the information that is necessary for the modern era of Bitcoin adoption was introduced in my mother tongue. The local board allows members to share information, guidance, and experience related to the cryptocurrency field in their mother tongue, making it more accessible to everyone for better understanding. Therefore, the identification of the local board is very important for the new members so that if someone has a problem speaking English, he can master his issues in his own native language on the local board or thread under the supervision of his senior fellow.Recently, a local board has been formed in Ningeria. There are quite possessive and capable members who can guide you and every newcomer very well in their native language. We have also submitted the appeal of our local board under the supervision of our senior in the court of Taymos, and I hope that Taymos will announce the announcement of your local board very soon.",

But from what I observe, it's far more tolerant to newbies day by days, as long as the post is not merit fishing or spam and junk, the higher rankings and other members who are currently active in several global boards is much more appreciative and less of a bully.

When I came to the forum I never wrote anything on my local board, even though it was already there. I value my privacy and I don't want people to know where I'm from and where I live. Usually local languages have this friendly drive where people want to know where you're from, what you do for living, finally want to organize meetups, conferences and such. I don't want to tell them no and I don't want to take part in this. I prefer to stay anonymous.",

It's the higher ranked accounts that will make the local board conducive for the newbies that's why I said they're needed on the boards/threads too, you gain nothing when you disassociating yourself from your local board instead you're leaving it in the hands of those that might be competent to pilot the affair of the board but when you join hands with them, you guys will be able to groom the next generation of productive users of the forum. I knew the importance of local board and that's why I was a strong advocate for the Nigerian local baord which we have gotten. Newbies are more free and inspired when they're surrounding by those from their locality and they learn better that way before exploring the main boards.QuoteAlthough, there are some countries that Theymos hasn't grant their request to give them their own local board, that shouldn't discourage you from posting there, because it is the number of people in a local board and how active that sub board is that will help to speed up the provision of your own local board.The recent local boards that was granted by theymos all gave him a reason for doing that so if others what the same thing they need to also prove to theymos that when their board will be approved it won't become dormant like some local boards are. The activities on the board needs to increase and older members on the board should come together and put hands together to see how they can create awareness about the threads to their countrymen on the forum. For Nigeria it was easy to identify one from the way they write so if you have similar attributes for your country men you can send them DM to invite them to the thread or create other campaigns like Signature Campaign for the purpose of creating awareness for the thread. You can organize local competition to keep them interested in discussing on the thread and before you know, your local thread will have active contributors without any extender motivations but first people need to be motivated to contributions to discussion on the thread.",

Yes topics due disappear after some time but the name of the countries with local boards in the forum are always there for a newbie to see if such person is exploring the forum and yes you can't compare your method of your communications in your local boards to other sections of the forum because you will be free to express yourself more using your local language than English especially if the person is not very good in writing in English.",
