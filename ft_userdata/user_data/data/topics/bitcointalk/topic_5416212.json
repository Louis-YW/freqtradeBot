If you have extra mining capacity or are looking for a new coin to mine after ETH went off POW then check it out. We are building a community at https://discord.com/channels/1022184683913625721/1022184684668596347. Instructions to start mining are on the Stohn Coin website or you can join a Stohn Coin mining pool.",

There are many possible scams popping up which are to trick honest miners in some way.The fact that this is a new account, its a coin I never heard of, the whitepaper is a joke, and very badly written.Until there is more confirmation about this, i would stay away.",

TLDR: humans have been inventing and reinventing money for hundreds and thousands of years. Cryptocurrencies are just the next iteration.I absolutely do want superior money.

Currently Monero is still profitable to mine since the difficulty are decreased, I might consider to mine other top 50 crypto if Monero mining difficulty aren't profitable anymore.Anyway when you're linking your coins to Bitcoin, it's just show to everyone if it's a shitcoin.",

      "body": "Stohn Coin is newly launched and I agree we have some work left to do ie: White Paper, but never less we have spent a lot of time creating this new mineable coin. Stohn allows people that missed the Bitcoin launch an opportunity to mine a coin with just a laptop or GPU card. Stohn Coin isn't a scam. Mine a few Stohn Coins and join the community as we try to build something from nothing. I appreciate your  viewpoints and feedback, but isnt every coin lauched today just an iteration of another coin or idea. Our goal is to build smart contract functionability onto Stohn Coin moving forward to offer something new that has value. There are tons of token coins that have been created in the past year but very few new mineable coins. If you believe that no other coin besides Bitcoin should exist then no new coins would have ever been developed. Launching Stohn Coin is just the first step in building a community and ecosystem that may or may not work out. By mining Stohn you risk very little except a little time and a very small amount of electricity. Building and launching a new coin is very difficult and time consuming. If you don't see any value in Stohn Coin please don't mine it and if you do then we would appreciate you joining our community.",

Alright we will see that how Stohn Coin journey in the next year, will it be listed on centralized exchanges or it will become worthless since there's no volume on swap platform. I guess Stohn Coin journey would be end become dead coin without any volume, there's many coins out there have been linked with Bitcoin but it doesn't prove anything.Mining Stohn Coin just wasting electricity cost and time to set up the pools etc, not worth it.",
