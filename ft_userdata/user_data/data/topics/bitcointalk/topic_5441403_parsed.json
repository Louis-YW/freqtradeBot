But since ETH is a centralized token, I believe in the future those Ethereum will be moved since Vitalik Butterin have a control over every ETH. He might burn unused ETH because he think no one is holding it.",

That could be a pretty good time to sell small portions of his assed, if he's alive and has the keys. The biggest possibility is losing the key that he has or has died, if you look at wallet activity, there were still transactions in, 1 hour ago. However, not a single outgoing transaction (ETH) from the wallet. There is only 1 outgoing transaction (ERC-20) from this wallet, I don't know how this can made an out outgoing transaction activity.",

I think the guy is still alive and he did not lose his private keys because when I look at his tokens list, he still have those recent tokens. I think he himself buy those tokens from the exchange and then send it in this/his wallet. If he start investing in 2015 then I don't think he will be careless when it comes to handling his wallet or private keys because from that year, cryptos are already making their names, especially ETH. The guy is only hodling strong.You know whales, they can HODL even for a long year, only to see the real potential of the assets that they HODL. They only bought the coins at a not so expensive price and they only invest what they can afford to lose so, there will be no regrets for them in case things didn't run well in the future.",
