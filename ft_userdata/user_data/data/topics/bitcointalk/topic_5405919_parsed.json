  "content": "It's been a little over a month since I received my ColdCard Mk4, and I'd like to share my thoughts, opinions and observations here.  I purchased the ColdCard Mk4 with my own money, I was not offered a discount nor did I receive any promotional pricing of any type.  I have no affiliation with Coinkite, I have had no communication with them since my purchase, nor have they offered any incentive for making this post.tl;drIf you can get over the fact that the firmware is not open-source, this is the most feature filled and among the most secure hardware wallet I've ever used.  It's not the most user-friendly or newbie-friendly wallet I've used, but for the experienced bitcoin maximalist, I do recommend it.I am a bitcoin maximalist and the ColdCard is a Bitcoin Only hardware wallet, but I do wish they would integrate support for Monero's official wallet.PriceThe price of the ColdCard as compared to the competition:Trezor Model One:   $77Ledger Nano S+:   $83Ledger Nano X:   $157ColdCard:   $158Foundation Passport:   $249Trezor Model T:   $280At the time of writing this review the ColdCard costs $158, which puts it in the bracket of moderately priced competitor models, and nearly identical to the Ledger Nano X.  Despite it's price being roughly twice that of a Trezor One, I think it's still a good value given it's many features which I'll touch on below.PurchaseThe purchasing process directly from Coinkite was easy, and secure.  When I ordered the Mk4 it was on backorder, but I received it within three weeks of reserving mine.  The wallet arrived in a non-descript cardboard box, with no indication that it had anything to do with cryptocurrency, other than the return address.  There were no accessories included with the wallet, other than a couple of stickers, and a card for a mnemonic seed phrase.  A USB-C cable is required to power up the device, which again is not included.  FormThe wallet it's self is a very simple design, intentionally meant to look like a 90's vintage calculator that you got for free when opening your first checking account.  An uneducated thief looking for items of value wouldn't give it a second look.  The clear plastic housing is a cool look in my opinion; however I do believe a flat black option would further the intent of making it look like a cheap calculator.The injection molded plastic housing is upgraded from the Mk3 in that it includes a protective cover for the keypad and screen.  The fit of the cover is secure, both on the front and the back where it stows away neatly during use.  The overall quality and feel of the device seems solid and practical.  Function and QualityFunctionally, the wallet has some minor issues that are more annoyances rather than issues.  The keypad buttons are deeply set within the housing and my fat fingers have trouble getting in there at times.  Another observation is that as I scroll through some of the function pages if I start pressing a bit too quickly the scroll function doesn't keep up.  Again, I find these to be relatively minor observations.  It's worth noting, however that the only other wallet within my realm of consideration that has a physical keypad is the Passport which costs $90 more.  With the even more expensive Trezor Model T's touchscreen I tend to be prone to mistakes.  Again I blame my fat fingers.  So, even with the minor observations regarding the keypad, in contrast with the competition a full number pad of real buttons is a welcome feature.The other hardware functionality seems pretty solid.  The USB-C connection is solid feeling, and so is the slot for the micro-SD card.  The screen is on the small side, but the font is bright, clear, and large enough for me to see without issues.SecurityNow if it's one thing I've learned about trusted vendors and services within the crypto world, it's easily summed up by a Russian proverb that was made famous in the US by Ronald Reagan in 1987; doveryay, no proveryay (trust, but verify.)  So I'll take this opportunity to note again that the ColdCard is bult with source code for firmware that is licensed as common clause, not open-source.  The firmware is open for peer review, but cannot be forked or distributed.  Of course verification is possible, and verifying your transactions is always recommended.  Any bitcoin transaction can and should be verified prior to signing, and again prior to broadcasting.Discounting the the controversies around common-clause licensed firmware, the wallet strikes me as a brick house in terms of security.  It includes the typical features one would expect; 24-word seeds, complex passphrases with full keyboard of special characters, and control over derivation paths for multiple, less prominent wallets. It also has a special configuration for entering PINs which I find to be more secure than the more common methods.  It can also create a fake pin to use when under \"duress,\" and even allows a special configuration of the duress PIN which, when entered will result in the device being bricked.As would be expected, the Bip39 passphrases (extensions) are entered on the device, and only stored while the device remains powered up and logged in.  An automatic logoff timer can be set, so if you must step away from the device for a few minutes it'll automatically log itself off.PrivacyThis category is where I believe the ColdCard sets itself apart from the competition.  Due to the simplicity with which it can generate new, unaffiliated addresses, multiple HD wallets, and integration with Bitcoin Core the device makes it very simple to prioritize your privacy, and give you tools to make it easy.  I will discuss these features more in the next section.FeaturesThe ColdCard is full of neat features that help the use remain safe and private.  Here are some of the ones I find useful:Bip85 sub-seed generatorPaper Wallet generatorOptional USB connectivityWallet file generator for popular desktop clientsMultiple user accountsSimplified backupsMost of the items I've listed above are, as far as I know, unique to the ColdCard.  Most are also self-explanatory, but I will touch on the Bip85 feature here because knowledge of its existence is new to me, and it's super cool.  With this feature you can generate any number of mnemonic seed phrases, WIF HD seeds, and standard single-address private keys.  These keys are derived from your master seed, so as long as you've backed up your master seed phrase, you'll always have the ability to restore any of the derived seeds and keys.  For example, you can generate a 12 or 24-word seed phrase that's derived from your master seed to use for a hot wallet and if you choose to not write it down, no big deal.  You can always use the ColdCard with the same master seed to retrieve the hot wallet seed.The Bip85 feature along with the single key generator can help improve privacy by creating wallets that are unaffiliated with your main wallet but can be recovered later if needed.  It is worth noting that the \"Paper Wallet\" generator creates random keys that are not backed up by your master seed.The other feature I want to touch on is the optional USB connectivity.  ColdCard models prior to the Mk4 did not include this feature, they had no method of connecting to a host device (PC or phone) through the USB port.  They relied on transferring data through the use of the micro SD card.  The Mk4 can be used the same way, but it also provides the option to use USB connectivity so the wallet can work similar to other, more typical hardware wallets, i.e., it can be paired to a desktop client to sign transactions directly.  Another feature it includes is the option to enable 4 megabytes of integral volatile storage.  This can be used to transfer wallet files generated by the ColdCard or save PSBTs generated on the host.  This storage is non-persistent and is lost once the device is logged off or powered off.ConclusionThe bottom line about the ColdCard, or just about any purchase can be summed up with one question; would I buy it again?  The answer is a resounding \"Yes!\"I am of the opinion that all crypto currency wallets, hardware or otherwise should be open-source primarily for trust and transparency purposes.  I do find the ColdCard to be secure and practical hardware wallet.  All in all, I think it is a great tool for any bitcoin maximalist.",

I never owned or used a ColdCard, just like to add my opinion to this device.Printing \"ColdCard\" on the PCB doesn't quite disguise this device from a cheap calculator. I wouldn't count on that, likely nobody does or should.I don't like closed-source firmware. This cuts you and others off to check and verify what the firmware does at sensitive points of wallet \"procedures\". For me this is kind of security by obscurity and clearly not a policy I want to support with my money.While I like a lot of the features you mentioned, there's one or two in particular I dislike a lot: first the ability to create paper wallet data which is unrelated to the main ColdCard seed. There might be use cases for that, but I simply find it a dangerous features, because you can't recreate such paper wallets if you loose any details or documentation of it. The second feature I don't like is the ability to have a special PIN which completely bricks the device. As far as I understood it, it's optional and I don't have to use it, still doesn't feel comfortable for me personally.Some interesting features which are also new for the Mk4 incarnation of the ColdCard device set this Mk4 apart from predecessors. How do we know that Coinkite did it \"right\" with those new features? With closed-source firmware you'll have to put too much trust into them for my personal security taste and comfort.My personal conclusion is: as long as I have more open-source alternatives and no unique feature that this device offers and which I need, I'd stay away from ColdCard Mk4.",

There might be use cases for that, but I simply find it a dangerous features, because you can't recreate such paper wallets if you loose any details or documentation of it. There is a way to generate individual keys that are indeed backed up by the master seed, but I believe the \"Paper Wallet\" generator is decoupled from that on purpose.  There are indeed use cases where you want to generate a key that isn't recoverable; keys for physical coins or Paper Wallet gifts for example.Quote from: Cricktor on July 16, 2022, 10:19:47 AMThe second feature I don't like is the ability to have a special PIN which completely bricks the device.

I am not a software developer, so I can't imagine what it means creating and releasing a software or piece of code without making any profit from it. Making it a proprietary piece of software would mean that it does not fulfill all the conditions to be called open-source, but I was only referring to the publicly or not publicly available code. I think it's morally wrong to take an already open-source codebase, change it, perfect it, and then make it proprietary and call it your own. It can't be your own if someone else already laid the foundations. If ColdCard did that, then it's a pretty shitty thing to do. But that's just an opinion not based on any knowledge of what it takes to create a piece of software.",

      "body": "@DireWolfM14 and everyone else who owns ColdCard mk4 hardware wallet should update asap to the latest firmware version 5.0.6, that should fix recent Virtual Disk bug.They explain more about this fix in their new blog article released today, but I am starting to think they could made all this fuss and fix just to promote this new Virtual Disk feature, because they are very excited about this. QuoteWhile optimizing performance, we noticed a math bug in the way disk size was calculated. A value was 8196 which should have been 8192. The result is four blocks (512 bytes each) past the end of the “virtual” disk were accessible. Due to the design of our hardware, this is an isolated area in a memory chip called the PSRAM. The extra 2k bytes of accessible memory wrap around to the bottom of the PSRAM, where we store the PSBT during the signing process. No other part of the address map is exposed by this bug.We were not able to find a means to exploit this bug. The 2k of memory already is available for read/write over the USB port. We allow uploads (and downloads) of PSBT into exactly that area.Further into the audit, we examined the related subsystems for other issues. We found a few, very-limited logic bugs in the in the Micropython and ST Microsystems open-source code that is related to disk emulation. Our conclusion was those were of no impact, but important to improve the overall hardening in this release. In our experience this class of bugs could lead to vulnerabilities, and should be fixed.We are still very excited about the Virtual Disk as a means for people using the device without computers (phone-first world). As you know we are a paranoid user-first, so any USB feature should always be disabled by default. And air-gap hardware wallet operation—as we pioneered—is still king.Although this was an internal discovery, we still like to practice Responsible Disclosure.https://blog.coinkite.com/5.0.6-released/",

You just can't do it for commercial reasons.With that being said, it still goes back to what I mentioned earlier this week. Quote from: DaveF on July 28, 2022, 06:49:40 PM-->This is not just about Coldcard, but all hardware wallets. Keep adding bloat and stuff will go wrong.<--Evey time you add a coin, a feature, anything it's one more point of failure and vulnerability.Adding XMR fine, do it yourself. Want to add another feature go ahead. But don't have it in there out of the box (plastic bag)I still plan on getting a mk4 if my mk3 ever gives me any issues, no real point in replacing something that works.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on July 29, 2022, 11:50:25 PMIt's only 4MB of memory, but that's plenty for PSBT or wallet files.  And, it's a whole 10% of the HUGE hard drive I bought back in 1989.The 1st web server my company put together had a massive 4GB drive back in 1998. Now I have a magnitude more of RAM just on the caching controller that the drives are hooked up to. -DaveSide note, over the last 6 months or so I am really starting to see a greater use for the CreativeCommons license. Dealing with some things I have seen some pretty good pieces of open source software being run on shit sub standard hardware. And because this piece of shit CNC machine is running (not the real name) UltraMill 4 software. Then UltraMill CNC machines must all suck. To the extent that the UltraMill company is actually changing it name and all the new machines are running closed source dongle locked code. Not saying that this is the case here, but I am starting to see why it's needed now and then.",
