Do you really ask this question seriously?Though, there is rumour that president of China Xi Jinping asked Putin not to start during Winter Olympic games in China.",

The war is not going to affect the world cup .Political issues are always there because it is all about gaining territories and who is superior to the other,for this reasons i dont think Puttin will stop the war for respect of the world cup. It is sad that football brings different continents in the world together for competition but while this event is going on some other countries are busy  fighting war.",

Having said that, neither of the two countries in battle is hosting the WC, and neither of them is a participating country in it, so i don't see how it could stop them from fighting whilst the WC goes on, even though i hope it could make them stop.",

I'm happy that I won't have to watch Russians in the World Cup. It was a good choice by FIFA. Should they cease fire? Yes, but Russia usually breaks every agreement. Remember how they were supposed to allow refugees to leave the war zone through humanitarian corridors and then shot at them with artillery? I wouldn't trust any word from Putin's mouth.",

The world cup is a competition that promotes peace and unity, hence we need peace during this prestigious competition. The war would indeed have some effects on the competition. The safety of Ukrainian and Russian airspace are not guaranteed. Most participants might have to avoid these two nations' airspace, there by making them to take alternative routes. Due to sanctions, most companies were not able to get advert slots in the competition and some individuals might not be able to travel to Qatar to watch these matches.A football match between Ukraine and Russian national teams would not be bad in this world cup  .",

The seize fire has been coming intermittently before now during talks to see if agreement would be reached but unfortunately one of the parties don't keep to it but if this time, it is kept all through the duration of the world cup which is one month, it can allow the both government to have a rethink, compromise and reach out for themselves, it is possible for tempers to calm down .

Yes, you can say that majority remain silent because they're afraid to get arrested, but when you look at things which are going on in Iran, it's only excuses. Probably risk to protest in Iran is bigger than in Russia, but people still do it.Sanctions? It has smaller influence than majority expected.
