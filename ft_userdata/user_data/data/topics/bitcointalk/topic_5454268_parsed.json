A crypto that identifies each user so that he gains a good reputation or a bad reputation regarding his transactions and faithfulness in them.2. Cellphones that are walkie-talkies, something like the original cellphones were, so that there is no central control over the cellphone messaging.3. Actual transactions remain private.4. A justice board, like a jury, to make judgments in transaction disputes.5. As airlines sell tickets through Internet comparisons of prices, let everything be marketed based on the prices of all merchants.6. Get government out of buying and selling; keep it in areas of justice among people; No more fiat money.We, the people, can do this.",

In order for people in government to overcome freedom for the public, they have to make laws that enslave the public. But, since freedom is built right into the whole government setup, it is difficult for government to do this, because the public fights back with legal things that are in basic government.One of the strongest freedom things is privacy. It's built right into the whole legal operation of government, and has been since the inception of the government. I am talking about the US mostly, but Canada and Britain, as well. You know how difficult it is for government to come into your home without a warrant, and how you can sue even the judge who signed the warrant if he does so frivolously.We need to take our crypto operations out of the public, and make them private. We can do this by making the whole public into private within the crypto community. This has to do with making membership for using crypto to be like membership in a club. But this entails writing up a contract that people who use crypto agree to before they can use it. Such a contract needs to be built right into the blockchain and wallet.Search on \"Private Membership Association.\" The, start building a private crypto world. Do it now, before government takes crypto away.",

The current administration in the US is trying to appease eco clowns who think bitcoin mining is destroying the planet. They have to fight against something so if chaining yourself to a tree is no longer popular and so is freeing animals from labs, there has to be something else they can do, right?

On the USA, it is different, any federal judge in the Union can challenge any presidential choice and deem it unconstitutional. So the road to banning Bitcoin won't be easy, even more keeping in mind the amount of libertarians in that country. It reminds me the occasion when Trump wanted to ban people from countries with important Islamic population from entering the USA, a single judge stopped it all.",

And when they do so, prices can take a nosedive.I wont lie, it sounds difficult to me that anyone with a minimum grade of intelligence would actually fall for that explanation or narrative. Even if Bitcoin was never invented as we know it, the Fentanyl and other drugs would be still flooding the streets of the biggest cities in North America. Criminals like cash, to them cash is King after all. Within the narco culture the 100$ bills are more established than the satoshis. If I had to bet, the most likely scenarios would be the excuse of the environmental impact of Bitcoin so the politicians can push for some kind of restrictive Bill about mining on American soil. That won't stop Bitcoin, obviously.",

US already has a significant crypto users and even though the government bans crypto now,it wouldn't affect anybody or the crypto market because bitcoin users knows that bitcoin is decentralized,so they will continue. It will only affect exchanges. Miners will move their farm to a country that is more crypto friendly,maybe China. We have seen this before,it is not something new. China also placed a ban on crypto but when they saw that they are loosing out,the uplifted the ban recently. If US tries to ban crypto,then it will be an opportunity for China. I don't think that US will do something as dump as banning crypto",

I am more inclined to think that the average person living in the USA would rather to sell their Bitcoin than getting trouble because of committing what could be considered to be tax evasion. That's what I think reality is, not all the people who have Bitcoin and other crypto assets in the USA are so into the ideology of satoshi to risk being punished by a court. Still, I think that a ban on Bitcoin is unlikely to happen and it is only a thing on countries where autocracy is blatant and there is no separation of powers, the United States is still blessed with those benefits, in contrary to Russia and China.",

      "body": "The reason for strife in the world are the crypto coins/tokens, esp Bitcoin.The ruling cabal - those who direct and control governments - are losing control. People are waking up. Fiat is a Ponzi and worse. It is a method to give control to the cabal through the money systems. Fiat is a way to steal the labor and wealth from average people and give it to the cabal. The cabal includes the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank, and those who own and direct the Fed owners.Bitcoin threatens to throw off the controls by becoming a direct property transfer among the people... no banks involved. That's why the banking system is trying to convert the current fiat Ponzi into a crypto that tightens up the controls that are rather loose under the fiat Ponzi. Here's how it works:- A check or money order that can be traded among people and banks is a negotiable instrument. It is essentially money.- A promissory note on a bank loan is a negotiable instrument. It is essentially money.- When a promissory note is signed by a borrower, he is paying off his loan before he gets the loan. But he doesn't know this, so he pays the loan off the second time over the years.- The bank converts the promissory note negotiable instrument into other forms of money, and sells it to people and companies who buy it to get the interest over the years.- The money that the banks gets from the sale of the promissory note negotiable instrument goes to the Fed, and to the cabal thereby.- The cabal is becoming rich from every fake loan that is made because of the ignorance of the people; the people are becoming poor by paying off the loan twice... or more when you include interest.This old Ponzi system is failing because the people are waking up. The cabal needs to take stricter control if they want to maintain their reign as masters over the general populace.And, there are also many other ways the banking cabal make money and control the people thereby.",

If they resort that they need to leave the US market then that's it, other players will adopt those users and it's still a huge market for those companies. In that case that the biggest of the biggest will leave US market, then for sure majority of the holders there will still find a way to sell or buy bitcoin. If not, then they'll leave us for good and will definitely leave this market as well and will sell before anything else or before the closure of these exchanges.
