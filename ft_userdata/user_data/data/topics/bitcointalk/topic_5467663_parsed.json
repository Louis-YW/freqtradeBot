Let's say you are a fan of collecting exotic animals and it has been just a hobby for you so far, you can open a shop for example. Or a website, or both: a shop with an online shop as well.I don't think it's going to be very successful to read about a small business idea here on the forum and set it up if it's not in a field you know a lot about or are passionate about. It's not impossible but the odds are low, as a small business requires a lot of time and dedication, especially in the beginning.Quote from: komisariatku on September 22, 2023, 02:36:11 AMHowever, to start investing we need capital. How do you find capital for investment?Especially for a small business the start-up capital should be minimal. Trying to start with a very high initial investment, especially if you resort to loans, increases exponentially the risk of not succeeding because you will need much more time to become profitable, and in the case of taking loans you increase the fixed costs.",

I want to hear itWhy do people whose dreams want to look for low risk but with big profits. In terms of running a micro or macro business, the greater the risk, the greater the profits obtained, as well as appropriate. But it doesn't rule out the possibility that there are other options out there that suit what you are looking for. It's just that if we need to calculate the percentage of each large profit, we will generally determine the risk to be greater.There are several tricks that you might be able to use, but they still require research. For example, you have to monitor sectors that have the potential to become a business in your neighborhood. By utilizing available resources and processing them into a mixture with a large turnover. However, capital is still capital, starting a business is not just an idea if its implementation is not accompanied by the ability to distribute the results of the product, such as looking for suppliers. Both small and large businesses all need careful planning and are able to target long-term guarantees.",

Because nobody wants to lose money, work their ass for and not become rich in 1 year, the same reason most of those businesses fail in the first years as everyone is daydreaming while making their plans.I've seen hundreds here on different topics claiming how agriculture is successful, how it can save a country from recession, how is a guaranteed win, how everything and when I tell them you need to work your ass all day, all year with no holiday except winter, difference between Wednesday and Sunday for something that might end with a profit margin of under 10% (profit not operating profit) by the end of the year they all act surprised.Quote from: noorman0 on September 22, 2023, 04:27:26 AMIf you live in a remote area where there are not many advanced users of digital devices, this kind of business is definitely sustainable.Who is going to need these services in a remote area that usually comes with 100 or 20 people living in a village?And how are you going to make a living out of this?",

They try to become resellers of online stores or dropshippers and upload videos via Instagram, TikTok and other social media.They almost do not need capital except for an internet connection found in many places. They upload video reviews about their products, provide discounts that their stores get, and more. They can get endorsements from advertisers, which means they can earn income. It all depends on each person's creativity, so if you can be more creative than others, you can have the opportunity to earn income.And don't forget to get a lot of followers because that is one of the keys to success in marketing products via the Internet. But if you want to open a small business offline, you need capital. You can borrow capital from the bank or your budget to be safer.",

I want to hear it Many businesses can be started on a small scale.I have seen many people start business with small capital. Very few people will see you who have started a large scale business from scratch. Majority of people have started a small scale business, and then grow the business and expand the business further. I have seen a rice seller on a cart, who now has many big branches in different parts of the city. From where he gets a lot of income and many people's jobs are also associated with him.You can start a small scale mobile and parts business, start a small cosmetics business. A small -scale electronics and electric parts business, which is often used at home, can also be launched,and it can earn good income. Investment can also be made in the small -scale agriculture sector, as agriculture is also a good way to make a profit, and various commodities are also our daily needs. A small scale solar system business can also be started, as the solar system is now becoming a need for every home.However, if you start a small business in keeping with the needs of your area, a good profit can be achieved from a small business.",

I want to hear itMost of the time, people find their capital through loan money but sometimes this is only for people with a large scale businesses. On my case, my capital came from my savings because it is only a small scale business and at that time, I was only exploring and I just wanted to have an experience. I remember my first business back when I was in high school, it was an online business and I sell different clothes. I also did reselling perfumes and scented candles. At that time, and as a student, it was such a satisfying feeling because I am earning money at such a young age. And if you are just like me who was just trying and exploring the business industry, it is not advisable to loan money from banks and such because it's risky. So, if you just want to experiment, it's better to build your own capital through your savings and start from small scale business to build experiences. And by that, you can transition from a large scale business if you think you already can and is now equipped.",

For example, in my area, the total cost to open a sidewalk snack bar would be around $1k$-2k$. And if we business smoothly, the profit will be about $30-$50/day after deducting all costs. The profit margin is quite impressive, IMO. This is a business model that many people do not think about because they think it will not bring good profits, but in my opinion, its revenue will be more significant than the revenue of larger restaurants in the same field. Not to mention, the risk is quite low if we fail, unlike opening a large restaurant that will cause more serious damage.",

Capital can also come from grants, when you have a really good business idea, if you are able to organize it well into writing with a clear strategy to make profit, you can get an Angel investor.

There are still risk in the businesses that you have mentioned and they may not be minimal. For printing for example, if you are able to get a big printing deal that should be profitable to you and you make mistake in the printing or it does not come out well from machine, you will spend extra, sometimes even your profit in trying to correct the errors from the job.",

A grocery delivery service that sources directly from local farmers ensures quality, freshness, and cuts out the middlemen.

As for the product category, I would suggest focusing on handcrafted goods that are available for pre-order. This means you won't have to invest money until you have confirmed buyers.Becoming a reseller is also a viable option. It provides valuable experience in selling products, which can be highly advantageous when you eventually have your own products. Progressing in a sales career is also quite promising, as this role plays a pivotal role in contributing to a company's revenue. No significant capital is required; you just need to sell other people's products to make a profit.",

As for capital to open a grocery store, it depends on the scale, it is not a small business model, you can expand it to a large scale if possible. With a small store size, importing goods in limited quantities will prevent you from getting a better price than a larger store, thereby leading to very low profits. Not to mention, many items will expire very quickly and liquidation at small stores is very difficult and not as convenient as supermarkets...There are many issues that need to be resolved if you intend to open a grocery store, so you should consider carefully.",
