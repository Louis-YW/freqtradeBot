Why invest in AI?-cut-Artificial intelligence is a broad field and different projects claiming to have something to do with AI don't necessarily have an usecase in a real world, but are made up solutions for made up problems. I stopped keeping track ages ago with DeepBrain chain raising a lot in ico only to show that no one needed their crappy AI solutions for toys of all things. Or god forbit any blockchain tech glued to it.I am thinking same rule still applies because it's a very narrow field in AI tech that would even benefit from blockchain tech. And asking if you should invest to AI crypto is like asking that should you buy altcoins, and answer being: \"Maybe, but 99% of them are pointless crap\"",

That's some shit going on. Well, many project owners do use words for buzzword marketing which many people have fallen to the trap and get lucky if it ends up successful. I guess if op really want to hodl then better but altcoins that are known to be legit and already running for quite some time. Even the quick research made the Poster above is that I am not familiar with the said AI coins that are mentioned in there.",

Those projects and organizations can thrive without it.So it is unlikely that the current cryptocurrency ecosystem where buzzwords and empty promises spread massively are able to cope with those projects. In fact, I can't think of any AI project that requires blockchain that the cost of incorporating it would be worth it for the whole project.",

I'm asking because I recently noticed Matrix AI myself and I'm thinking about investing. Of course, I am aware that this is a long-term project, because from what I can see they have been working on it for several years. The new roadmap looks promising in my opinion: https://1369953351-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FT5LtcFS1DoKk05KGaZdm%2Fuploads%2FOnsRSLdWol2UnvQRYM9t%2FMatrix%203.0%20Roadmap%20Full%20EN.pdf?alt=media&token=ef0cf8d3-81e0-473a-9da5-5ffad4dffe50The team is active in social media, developers are working on the code, new team members are being hired. Of course, the project may turn out to be a fiasco, but it's hard to call MAN a scam. The current capitalization is around $4 million, so there is a lot of room for growth.",

Thanks for this info, but maybe just like the rest of us, I'm not familiar with this so called AI coins. I know that this is a recent buzz word in crypto as well and perhaps it was due to ChatGPT and other AI out there, but if you are going to look at it, this could be a hit or miss for us.What I mean is similar to P2E in the beginning, it was one of the hottest and then it become crowded and only those who are prime movers like Axie did enjoy, but once it gets saturated, the market becomes messy. So this is still 50/50 to me so we should be careful if we are going to invest on them, just saying.",

They will create a buzz about something and will start pulling it into the black hole and revolving our world around it. First it all started with few Altcoins, then they launched ICO trend. Idk, later came in era of miners, now we have NFT trend which is getting tailed by Artificial intelligence these days. I think these kind of trends are going to be there all the time. They will come and go all the time. We don’t even know what’s going to be there, but those are short term trends. All the above ways that I mentioned remained for short period of time. Definitely AI is next. Better invest wisely.",

Its worse because it use complex bigdata operations to give resoult you can get using simple math. I don't think that activities that AI can be used for are the same that needs decentralization and blockchain. Good AI coins? Well AI is a bigdata application. You need a big database. The bigger and better you have the better AI you can get. So tell me. How could a random team from crypto community, with 10M$ from ICO and empty databease develop a good AI tool if google knows more about us than we do ourselves. If we will ever have AI revolution (for sure we will) it will be dominated by Google, Nvidia or other big companies ... maybe from China?

Don't believe what the altcoin projects say is the new technology, the technology of the future... it's all scam, all they want is our money.
