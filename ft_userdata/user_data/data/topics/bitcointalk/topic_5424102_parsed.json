My home page starts from Economics but others start from Bitcoin discussion. Just as it has been mentioned above that you're likely to have mistakenly press the hidden button below the bitcoin discussion board icon written, all you need is to press the minus sign (-) to plus sign (+) in other to activate it back, also know that you're likely to have a different display if you log in using mobile version and your uncle using desktop to log in but that doesn't mean makes the reason to why the bitcoin discussion board isn't displaying, it's just a simple function of the mistake you made by clicking the hidden button.",

It happened to me on a few occasions and got me wondering where the Bitcoin board had gone to for a few seconds.Incidentally, playing around with the feature now I’ve just noticed that toggling the +/- sign next to the section has a minor side effect on the News section on the top quadrant of the page: If changes the hyperlinks in the news frame to a text and the url within brackets. i.e.QuoteNews: Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.0)Nothing that you can’t revert by altering the url and trimming the \"action\" part or alike. If the OP is seeing the above in the News bar (instead of a hyperlink), then it’s definitively the toggled +/- section that makes the Bitcoin boards non-visible.",

Refreshing will not solve the matter but clicking on the + sign that appearing before bitcoin at the beginning of the page is best solution. I have faced such problem before and  I clicked the + sign and the board came back though I was trying to check (learning) things on the forum. There is another thing I also discovered in the forum that day was as I refreshed the page the Quote from: DdmrDdmr on November 29, 2022, 04:39:24 PMNews: Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.0) would changed to another news that has been posted before.

Just click the \"+\" sign to unhide the Bitcoin boards. It was not easy for struggle but I have finally gotten it. I follow the procedures you instructed me to do. It's like I mistakenly clicked the - sign unknowingly. I really appreciate your instructions. At least, many other users have also learned something new from my question.",
