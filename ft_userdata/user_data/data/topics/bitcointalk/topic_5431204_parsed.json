      "body": "I have read many times that Russia wants to legalize crypto fully but I don't know how genuine the news is. What I know is that Russia is a country that needs a lot of reform due to the economic segregation by many countries of the world. So if they would implement that, it means they are desperate for more financial independence which Bitcoin in particular would do successfully for them. And it would be another proof that Bitcoin is a saver.Quote from: krishnaverma on December 24, 2022, 11:21:49 AMBut will this step be sufficient or fruitful ? What do you think about this  ?Yes, it would help them, but to what extent, I would say it isn't easy to ascertain. This is because it would only help them if they are strict with using only a well-regulated centralized system. If not, the decentralized transactions will never add to their economy, though both would ease the payment of goods and services across borders.",

You can not avoid sanctions by using bitcoin because the source and destination are still known. The only reason why countries use bitcoin for their international trade is to replace US dollar which is an attack on US economy considering it will get completely destroyed if the world stopped using dollar.BTW this is not new and there is a topic about it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412477.0",

What do you think about this  ?As practice shows, the news is very often deceptive and has nothing to do with reality. However, if this news is true, then the best way is to check it out to see if it is true or not. But based on the current situation, this news may well be true, but the question still remains, what exactly will the cryptocurrency be used to pay for? I remember once they asked Putin a question about whether BTC could be used to pay for hydrocarbons or oil, to which he replied that in the future it is possible - yes, but as long as the price of BTC is too volatile, this option is not considered. So everything is simple here, cryptocurrencies can be used as a means of payment, but for this their prices must be stable.",

However, Russian government has been in logger head with the EU and US over Ukraine war since the beginning of this year making Russia to face sanctions from various world powers and international organizations  cutting them off ties in business, bilateral relationship etc. Maybe one of the major reason for doing that is to evade the ban on trading with them because any nation that do trade with Russia would likely face sanctions from the IS which is very detrimental so therefore it is best their identity is not known when dealing to cover their name which is a good move.  If Russia takes such step, it would be a good one for them.",

China is not going to stop trading with Russia and they understand why Russia is trying alternatives. The sanctions have come from every direction so it makes sense that Russia comes to Bitcoin. I do not think this is a permanent change this is just until the sanctions become less restrictive which they will because as much as the us and europe do not want to admit they rely on trade from Russia and the sanctions are hurting them too.",

Russia only allows it because of the war before that I think it was banned. I know a lot of Russia people wanted to start using Bitcoin after their bank refused to give their money that they stored in the bank this was documented on the news. Governments that have banned it realized that they could benefit from allowing Bitcoin by taxing its use instead of banning it and not getting any return when it was still being traded. I think it was China that banned btc but the bitcoin usage only increased during the ban.",

The citizens of Russia could not withdraw their money from the banks because they refused so they looked for alternatives and the Russian government has used Bitcoin as a way of avoiding the sanctions imposed by the West. I think there is enough evidence to support this. I agree that Bitcoin adoption may reverse in Russia because currently most are using it due to the war but when the war is over they may change to their rubles again .",

The sanctions are laws that have to be passed by the US and Europe. A lot of the sanctions include transactions from rubles to euros and dollars because these sanctions are written up and passed in court they take time. Russia is using Bitcoin as a way of getting around the sanctions otherwise it would not make sense why they are pushing for the use of btc so much in the past few months. nationwide bans have never worked and the same goes for the sanctions there will be countries still trading with Russia in secret with inflated prices. Bitcoin allows them to do that without the risk of being found out because the sanctions do not cover btc.",

If the West decides to target Bitcoin because Russia is using it to get past the sanctions I think that could be devastating to the price of btc for as long as they target it what I am concerned about is Bitcoin is not used much by governments and they could put a sanction on btc permanently if they wanted too which could effect the price further. As long as they allow people to transact in btc it should not be a big problem but sanctioning countries with btc would probably be just more negative news to create doubt.",
