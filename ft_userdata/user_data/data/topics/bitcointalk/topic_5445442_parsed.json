Do you watched The Glory ?Seems using padlocks is something very common there!Quote from: pingu39 on March 21, 2023, 10:05:18 PMIf this is true it will spread to the whole world and then no one is safe anymore. Yes, same as using Wi-Fi / IP cameras for security.. people don't know how such systems are weak/vulnerable !I think that the real problem is there is no real pedagogics on how such systems we using everyday are weaks/dangerous. officials just choose not talking about problems that have no solution, more that this they looks like promoting them in way they can profiting from it !For example for IP cameras, if eveyone with just some very basic hacking knowledge can break them.. it means that promoting them among other more secure systems was deliberate for an intention of having a ready available free global vast surveillance coverage!PS:  and LoyceV because someone once said he's Korean",

They have a way these days of stealing keyless cars by emitting a signal from some kind of box which pairs with the keyless car fob in your house to open your car & start the engine. There is a lot of this going on where I live now so I took action. I also have a pouch to put my fob in which stops anything pairing with it.",

Again, that's depending on the security settled by the manufacturer of the car.. on older models when even after opening the car it is necessary to insert the key witch contain a cryptographic key for starting the engine.. in this case they'll be able to open the car but not start the engine!",
