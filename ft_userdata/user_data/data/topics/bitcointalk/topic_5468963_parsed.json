That appears to be done pretty well. Im sticking with just the websites for now unless anyone can present me a more coherent list of sites than the one I am putting together. I believe @krogoth has a pretty comprehensive list - or maybe it was someone else? but the post was never pinned so maybe he can reply with the link.",
