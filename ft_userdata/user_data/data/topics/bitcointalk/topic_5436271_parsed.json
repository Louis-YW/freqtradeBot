The only news I could find is that Binance added a few Aptos pairs to its Liquid Swap pools, which, while it is positive news, it's not something that would typically cause such a significant price increase. https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-liquid-swap-adds-apt-btc-apt-usdt-hft-btc-hft-usdt-liquidity-pools-c322dd20aa1e4c82b7992ce2cc01cb3bIt's more likely that this price increase is a result of the overall market sentiment being bullish, and traders looking to speculate on the next promising coins.",

I think it's just pumped by whale and it's not seems to be real pump. It was best time to took entry below 6$. Now if anybody want to take risk then I will recommend not because there is no big ecosystem for Aptos yet.",

It means those investors are optimistic regards crypto investments and a possible sign they are coming back to the industry, in an opposite movement of what happened last year. It could be one of the first evidences of the beginning of a new bull run in crypto market.Congratulations to APT for making its ATH in a moment when every other cryptocurrencies are managing to achieve only slight recovery.",

I feel like web3 is seen as next big thing in crypto so bulls love to pump that kind of coins with web3 support. I think its very speculative so its best to not act quick and stay calm with Aptos. Its good coin obviously tho.",

I remember Aptos was being talked about lately here in the forum so the coin might really have a potential and not just the hype that causes its price to rise but it's great if you are one of those who invest in the coin before it pumps.Just only be careful and try to avoid buying when the coin is still at the top because it can go down and will take some time to recover again but it looks like you are promoting a crypto exchange there on your post. Is it a requirement to specifically mention the name of the exchange and their on-going promotions? . But, if you are telling the truth then that was killing two birds with one stone.",

Also, I use to exchange because new coins get listed early and i found some rare gem tokens there. Looks like a promotion though. But it's not.Also, thanks for your advice",

If you were watching the market and then you will see that if APY has increased more than 400%. that's a very good increase. I just suggest you to read this article https://newsbtc.com/news/aptos-climbs-75/Probably there are so many things come to the aptos. It's started from the various things like gaming blockchain-based. I have bought some thousands of APY around $4. Got very nice profit in a short time. Im very thankful for the whales who have been pumping this token.",

So, I felt like, Aptos price going up is just for me to earn something  Be careful, this kind of thinking about the markets moving according to our needs or even against them is not rare among many traders and yet it is a mistake to think this way, markets move according to the aggregate will of the market participants, and they do not care at all about the position you have taken or how much you need to win your next trade, so try to not think on those terms as it is easy to lose your money when your ideas about the markets are flawed.",

Since this thread was created aptos has kept pumping, most likely as you speculate this has to do only with hype which means that it should be getting closer to its limits and a correction should be close to happening, and while it is nice to hear about those which have earned some money with this coin during the last days, it worries me that in order to give those profits so many people are going to lose a massive amount during the next weeks, since it is very difficult to recover psychologically from such losses.",

And now, similarly to APT, I see this, though I'm not sure if this uptrend can be sustained; personally, I see this as a positive signal in the market when everything was too bleak the last time, but really, this pump and dump game is still very easy to manipulate people's psyches.",

You can check this twitter thread from Binance Research: https://twitter.com/BinanceResearch/status/1618240040227983361?t=gU7DrebXj_NFErqXJiv6FQ&s=19. There's nothing as huge or small on news, the important thing is that they deliver what's on their roadmap. Just because it was not a second layer blockchain doesn't mean it's not meant for a ride or to grow in development. It's not impossible tbh.",

Yes, coins with good potential can also experience it and not just those coins with no solid use cases A.K.A the meme coins but even if the coin didn't get any public recognition, but as long they are following their plans properly or on what is written on their roadmap then that is still commendable. There are a couple of good coins who aren't also a second layer blockchain so why can't Aptos right?",
