Since scams are not moderated and some users may wrongly think that services with pinned topics are secure, I don't agree with the idea. Quote from: krishnaverma on November 16, 2022, 01:13:14 PMAnd will also increase the overall revenue of the forum which will help for more efficient management. The forum doesn't need any money. Theymos has even disabled advertising banners. See the following post. Quote from: theymos on September 20, 2022, 07:17:24 PMFinally, bitcointalk.org has a large reserve of BTC, so we're able to continue operating without ad revenue for many years.

It depends what is going to be posted and advertised, but theymos recently said that he is stopping ads advertisement (with some exceptions) and I think your suggestion falls in this category.Maybe it's not a bad idea to have one or two pinned promoted posts, but this could also turn into bunch of posts getting pinned out of control, so someone needs to moderate everything and that means more work for theymos or moderators.",

      "body": "There would have to be a manual process where each would have to be reviewed. The thing is, theymos has already voiced his concerns about the auction process, and I imagine it's the same reasons that something like this or the Altcoin section selling off threads isn't going to happen. theymos could just put up a disclaimer that any pinned threads aren't directly endorsed by the forum, and you'd have to do your own research, but I think theymos rightly wants to be a little more responsible than that. So, I can't see us ever getting over that fact, and this is unlikely to happen in any of the sections. It's just a massive can of worms waiting to be opened. I'd somewhat support it other than that fact, which I don't think there's any way to mitigate that issue without the manual review process, which again probably isn't perfect either.",

Many of us avoid buying and selling digital products because most sellers are newbies without any trading history and it is better to avoid buying from them, so providing this feature means increasing their ability to defraud.I believe that if you are a good seller, members will refer to your topic, and therefore you do not need to make it on the first page to get requests.",
