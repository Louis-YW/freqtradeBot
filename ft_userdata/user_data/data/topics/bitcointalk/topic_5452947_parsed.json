  "content": "Hi, I am trying to install Electrum 4.4.3 and to check the GPG signature of the soft (for OS), so GPGSuite shows me that the installer file is signed by Stephan Oeste it@oeste.de, but in the verification guide https://bitzuma.com/posts/how-to-verify-an-electrum-download-on-mac/   it is written that the file should be signed by Thomas Voegtlin. Could you please help, if the developers added one more person to sign the wallet download file?",
