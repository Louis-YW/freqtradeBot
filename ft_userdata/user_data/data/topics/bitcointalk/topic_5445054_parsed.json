So if you got her ID, what's your plan? Does it help you get back the locked account?",

Quote from: MrAndras on March 15, 2023, 06:56:28 PMHow to get all information about the owners of that scam company, for example Sara Leppänen is it possible to find our her ID?You can easily google them and the name that will appear is different from what you've mentioned and that was said by dansus. I think that you've landed on a wrong domain and website and that's like a phishing and copycat of localbitcoins. For more info visit their service closure announcement through their official website: https://localbitcoins.com/service_closure/",

What do you even plan to do with this information lol.Just go through the proper process op - reach out to LBC and relevant authorities. Posting your story in crypto communities should be fine but make sure they’re concise with supporting evidences otherwise it’s likely to get ignored.",

In case you are facing difficulties with withdrawing your BTC, our customer support team is here to help.https://localbitcoins.com/support/Personally, I did not try the site myself, but it had a very good reputation. There are many people who bought and sold bitcoin through the site, and I did not hear any scam during that long period.",

Just because you got 20$ does not give you the right to call them scammers or not scammers.Its a typical exit scam behaviour, be honest to all small traders and then scam the big traders. not everyone, but enough to make a big profit, then run away and hide.Yes its an exit scam, Localbitcoins got very bad reputation these years, that's why they need to shot down. They are spending a lot of money to hire costumer support to delete all the negative comments.What I also find funny is, that some people here tell me I should contact the costumer support. - Of course I did it but these scammers reject to tun off my holiday mode.  And no I am not a criminal. My BTC I deposit was clean and NO I did not any trade after that. And Yes I am stupid, because I transferred my BTC on an online wallet(not your keys not your wallet).",
